(Justin Garcia/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - A police officer was found guilty Wednesday of voluntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a Black man during a 2022 confrontation at a New Mexico gas station.\n\nLas Cruces police Officer Brad Lunsford's verdict in a jury trial is the latest outcome in cases that prosecutors have linked to systematic brutality against Black people by members of law enforcement, nearly five years after the May 2020 killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis.\n\nLunsford, who is white, had pleaded not guilty. His attorney, Jose Coronado, said he will ask the judge to review the verdict for its legal sufficiency.\n\n\"While I respect the jury's verdict, I am extremely disappointed in it. I don't believe the state met its burden,\" he said in an email to The Associated Press.\n\nProsecutors said he shot Presley Eze at point-blank range in a scuffle after police responded to a 911 call from a gas station attendant who reported that Eze stole beer. Eze allegedly placed his hand on a second officer's stun gun before being shot.\n\nAttorney General Raúl Torrez said the use of deadly force was not reasonable, noting that Lunsford immediately drew his service weapon and shot Eze in the back of the head.\n\n\"Today's verdict reaffirms a fundamental principle: no one is above the law - not even those sworn to uphold it. Officer Lunsford's actions were not just a tragic lapse in judgment; they were an egregious abuse of power that cost Presley Eze his life,\" Torrez said in a statement after the verdict was announced.\n\nThe charge of voluntary manslaughter with a firearms enhancement carries a possible sentence of up to nine years in prison. Evidence at trial included police body camera video of the confrontation, in which police pulled Eze from a vehicle and the struggle ensued.\n\nPhilip Stinson, a professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, said most fatal shootings by on-duty officers are determined to be legally justified under precedent stemming from two 1980s-era U.S. Supreme Court rulings.\n\n\"It is incredibly difficult for a prosecutor to obtain a conviction in a jury trial in one of these cases, and that's because jurors are very reluctant to second guess the split-second, often life-or-death decisions of an on-duty police officer in a potentially violent street encounter,\" Stinson said. \"Anything can happen, but it's only in the most egregious cases.\"\n\nRecords compiled by Stinson, university colleagues and students through the Police Integrity Research Group show that 205 nonfederal law enforcement officers have been arrested on criminal charges of homicide or manslaughter over the past 20 years, resulting in 66 convictions, 27 convictions of them for manslaughter or homicide.\n\n\"If you do get a conviction, it's often for the lesser offense,\" Stinson said.\n\nMore than 900 fatal shootings by on-duty state and local law enforcement officers typically take place each year in the U.S., he said\n\nIn pursuing a criminal charge against Lunsford, Torrez described the killing of Eze as a tragedy and \"yet another example of poor police tactics resulting in an unjustifiable use of force to subdue an individual resisting arrest for the commission of a minor crime.\"\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Lunsford is currently employed as a police officer in Las Cruces.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

There was no information immediately available online regarding any additional charges associated with the delayed death.\n\nAn online search also did not turn up information about a future court date for Bal or whether he had an attorney who could speak on his behalf.\n\nCoolidge's partner, Officer Matthew Haney, who had two years with the department, was wounded but released from the hospital following treatment. He is recovering at home.\n\nThe department did not give the ages of the officers, who were certified field training officers in the Mountain View Precinct, which helps to train new police academy graduates.\n\nBoth officers were chasing a suspect on foot at about 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday after arriving together on a call about a man trying to break into a vehicle. The man fired at the officers, striking both.\n\nWhile one officer was able to return fire, the suspect was not struck. Other officers arrested Bal nearby soon afterward.

Kenya had promised to send 1,000 officers to Haiti. Since June, 800 have been deployed.\n\nAnother Kenyan officer who was shot and killed by the gangs in Haiti in February was buried in Kenya last week. Opposition leaders in the east African country called for the mission's officers to be better equipped.\n\nThe mission has been struggling with a lack of personnel as gangs that control 85% of the capital, Port-au-Prince, keep seizing more territory. The force's funding has also been dealt a blow after the U.S., its biggest backer, froze some of its funding, part of President Donald Trump's sweeping freeze on foreign assistance.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nThis photo taken in Decatur, Ala., Tuesday, March 25, 2025, shows the Alabama courthouse for a case of former Decatur police officer Mac Marquette's fatally shooting Steve Perkins in 2023. (AP Photo/Safiyah Riddle)\n\nDECATUR, Ala. (AP) - The murder trial of an Alabama police officer who fatally shot an armed Black man in his front yard hangs in the balance as a judge considers whether the officer is shielded by state self-defense immunity laws.\n\nMorgan County circuit court judge Charles Elliott's decision will largely hinge upon whether the officer had the legitimate authority to be at the man's house in the first place.\n\nMac Marquette, 25, is charged with murder in the fatal shooting of Steve Perkins shortly before 2 a.m. on Sept. 29, 2023, while accompanying a tow-truck driver to repossess Perkins' truck at his home in Decatur.\n\nThe northern Alabama city of 60,000 people was roiled with protest after Perkins' death, and the judge had to issue warnings to silence outcries in the packed courtroom during the immunity hearing on Tuesday and Wednesday .\n\nAlabama's \"stand your ground\" law grants immunity from prosecution to any individual who uses deadly force as long as they are in a place they have a right to be and reasonably believe they are in danger.\n\nProsecutors didn't contest the defense's claim that Perkins briefly pointed his gun towards Marquette before the officer fired 17 shots, killing Perkins, based on body camera footage shown in court Tuesday. The footage considered was from the two officers who accompanied Marquette and the tow-truck driver - video from Marquette's body camera wasn't entered into evidence on Tuesday.\n\nThe contention was about whether Marquette had a right to be there in the first place. If the judge decides that Marquette was operating outside of the scope of his duties as an officer, then Marquette will not be shielded by self-defense laws and his trial will proceed in April.\n\nAlabama law requires a court order if there is a \"breach of the peace\" in the initial attempt to seize the vehicle, and law enforcement is prohibited from assisting the repossession without a judge's authorization. Combs was authorized by Perkins' creditor to repossess the vehicle but not a judge.\n\nDefense attorneys said that Marquette and the two other officers who were dispatched with him had an obligation to accompany the tow-truck driver, Caleb Combs, on his second effort to repossess Perkins' truck. Combs called officers after Perkins pointed a gun at his chest in the initial vehicle seizure attempt.\n\n\"You have officers responding to a citizen's request for help,\" said Lance LoRusso, one of Marquette's attorneys.\n\nOfficers testified that the decision to accompany the tow-truck driver was approved by their superiors because these types of \"standby\" operations to \"keep the peace\" are routine for patrol shifts. Officers also said that it is a well established tactic to approach houses from out of sight.\n\nChristopher Mukadam, one of the officers at Perkins' house with Marquette, didn't have his body camera on when he first spoke with Combs - a breach of department policy that cast uncertainty on his testimony that Combs asked for an escort. Combs testified that he didn't explicitly ask the officers to accompany him.\n\nChief assistant district attorney Garrick Vickery said \"there was no reason\" for officers to be at Perkins' house without a court order.\n\nVickery also argued that officers weren't keeping the peace because they intentionally positioned themselves out of Perkins' eyesight.\n\n\"There was no way that Steve Perkins could have known that police were on the scene until about one and a half seconds before he was shot and killed,\" said Vickery.\n\n___\n\nRiddle is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCLAYTON, Mo. (AP) - A former St. Louis County police officer was sentenced Thursday to five years of probation for firing a gun into the air at a trick-or-treating event and shouting that people were going to die.\n\nMatthew McCulloch, 40, pleaded guilty in January to six counts of endangering the welfare of a child, one count of making a terroristic threat and one count of unlawful use of a weapon. There was no sentencing recommendation as part of his plea, but several charges were dismissed.\n\nPolice said hundreds of people were attending the school-sponsored event in the St. Louis suburb of Kirkwood in October 2023 when an off-duty McCulloch began harassing people, walking up to some of them and saying, \"You are all going to die.\"\n\nAfter a man responded by pushing McCulloch to the ground, police said McCulloch lifted his shirt to show a handgun and his badge. McCulloch, who was attending the event with his family, then shot into the air around a dozen times, according to the probable cause statement.\n\nTrick-or-treaters ran for cover, then police said several people tackled McCulloch and took the gun. No one was hurt, but prosecutors said participants were traumatized.\n\n\"We respect the court's decision in this tragic and difficult matter,\" said St. Louis County prosecuting attorney Melissa Price Smith in a statement. \"We are so grateful that no one was physically harmed in this incident and pray that this sentence brings some closure for the many victims - especially the many children - impacted by the defendant's actions.\"\n\nPolice said soon after the incident that McCulloch no longer worked for the department but provided no details.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Before that, he spent five years with the Denver Police Department in Colorado, and served as a seasonal officer with the Ocean City Police Department in Maryland.\n\nAn obituary said he earned a degree in criminal justice and police science from California University of Pennsylvania.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP, File)\n\nMIAMI (AP) - A Florida police officer has been sentenced to more than 17 years behind bars after pleading guilty to stealing drugs, cash and firearms from federal investigations and admitting that he once went so far as to swap cocaine seized by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration with a fake kilo made from a 3D printer.\n\nJames Hickox's sentence, handed down Monday in Jacksonville federal court, is the stiffest yet imposed against more than 20 DEA agents and task force officers charged in recent years with crimes ranging from perjury and assault to wire fraud and money laundering on behalf of the same drug cartels the DEA is charged with fighting.\n\nHickox, a sergeant with the Nassau County Sheriff's Office, was arrested in 2023 along with Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Joshua Earrey on charges of possession with intent to sell drugs . Both had been assigned to a DEA-led task force in Jacksonville.\n\nAs part of his plea agreement, Hickox admitted to receiving more than $420,000 for routinely stealing and selling marijuana, cocaine and other drugs seized as part of DEA operations and then falsely claiming the evidence had been destroyed following normal procedure.\n\nHe also confessed that in 2022, he swapped a kilogram of cocaine seized by the DEA with a brick made from a 3D printer sprinkled with real cocaine to make it look legitimate. Hickox said he then gave the real cocaine to a Jacksonville drug trafficker who sold it for around $20,000. About half that amount was paid to Hickox.\n\nHickox's father said the stress of his work for the DEA, dealing with criminal informants on a daily basis and being surrounded by large amounts of cash and drugs, contributed to his son's descent into criminality. He said the DEA needs to provide mental health counseling to properly vet its workforce and prevent other criminals from abusing the public's trust.\n\n\"They have to live two lives,\" his father, James Lee Hickox, told WJXT television in Jacksonville. \"You're out slinging dope for the DEA and then you go home and be a family man.\"\n\nHickox, 38, also said he gave around 550 pounds (250 kilograms) of marijuana to one informant, receiving about $200 to $400 for every pound sold.\n\nOn another occasion, according to the plea agreement, he and Earrey staged a fake traffic stop to seize what they thought were 6 kilograms (13 pounds) of fentanyl arriving from another state.\n\nWhen authorities searched Hickox's house, they found cocaine, methamphetamine pills and a powdery substance containing fentanyl, as well as several firearms that had been seized during law enforcement operations. The narcotics were found in a converted garage labeled \"Gator's Man Cave.\"\n\nHickox, in his plea agreement, also admitted to routinely breaking into DEA evidence bags, stealing thousands of dollars in cash and then resealing the bags, or repacking the currency into another heat-sealed bag with forged signatures, to cover his tracks.\n\n\"Law enforcement officers who operate as though they are above the law betray the badge and the citizens they swore to protect,\" FBI Jacksonville Special Agent in Charge Kristin Rehler said in a statement.\n\nAttorneys representing Hickox did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nEarrey is scheduled to be sentenced in April.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The loss of a young mother and her infant are devastating and tragic,\" Johnson said. \"However, as prosecutors, we are bound by an oath to apply the law and analyze facts without being guided by the sympathy we feel for all those impacted.

(Kevin Clark/The Seattle Times via AP, File)\n\nA suburban Seattle police officer was sentenced Thursday to over 16 years in prison for the 2019 shooting death of a homeless man he was trying to arrest for disorderly conduct, marking the first conviction under a Washington state law that made it easier to prosecute officers for on-duty killings.\n\nA jury found Auburn police Officer Jeffrey Nelson guilty June 27 of second-degree murder and first-degree assault in the death of Jesse Sarey.\n\nKing County Superior Court Judge Nicole Gaines Phelps sentenced Nelson to just over 16 1/2 years for the murder conviction and 6 1/2 years for assault, to be served concurrently.\n\nBefore sentencing Nelson at the high end of the standard range, Phelps chastised the 46-year-old officer for his violent behavior in uniform.\n\n\"Respect for the law, here, goes more beyond you, Officer Nelson,\" Phelps said. \"This is the first case in which a police officer was charged and it in some ways serves as a telescope for others to view police conduct and for police to remember to abide by their training when engaging in situations so that they do not become lethal to them or to others they are sworn to protect and serve.\"\n\nNelson, seated in a packed courtroom in a red short-sleeve jail uniform, his arms covered in tattoos and his hair cut short, showed no emotion as the judge spoke. His wife and other Auburn police officers sat behind him in his support, while Sarey's friends and family filled the other side of the courtroom.\n\nProsecutors had said at trial in June that Nelson punched Sarey several times before shooting him in the abdomen. Seconds later, Nelson shot Sarey in the forehead. Nelson had claimed Sarey tried to grab his gun and a knife, so he shot him in self-defense, but video showed Sarey was on his back with his head positioned away from Nelson after the first shot.\n\nKing County Special Prosecutor Patty Eakes, citing Nelson's long history of violence and disregard for his training, asked the judge to sentence him at the higher end of the standard range: 18 years for murder and 10 for the assault conviction.\n\n\"What was Jesse Sarey doing? Sitting outside of a grocery store drinking from discarded cups,\" Eakes said. \"He had other tools other than pulling out his gun and shooting an unarmed person in the stomach.\"\n\nSarey's family, including two brothers and a former foster sister, told the judge that his violent death by a police officer crushed their family, and they're happy to see Nelson held accountable.\n\n\"Six years in the making to see justice not only for Jesse but for all impacted families in Washington state!\" Elaine Simmons, Sarey's foster mother, said after sentencing.\n\nKing County Prosecuting Attorney Leesa Manion hailed the sentence as showing Nelson's actions \"were not above the law.\"\n\n\"The sentence reflects the very serious nature of Jeffrey Nelson's crimes,\" her statement said, noting it was the first time an officer has been tried, convicted and sentenced under the Washington state law that made it easier to prosecutor officers for killings while on duty.\n\nNelson lawyer Emma Scanlan said the defense will appeal.\n\n\"Our deepest sympathies go to his family,\" she said in an email. \"However, this trial was marred by unprecedented and significant legal errors that deprived Officer Nelson of his constitutional rights. When police officers are charged with crimes they deserve to be treated fairly just like everyone else.\"\n\nIt was the second case tried since Washington voters in 2018 removed a standard that required prosecutors to prove an officer acted with malice - a standard no other state had. Now they must show the level of force was unreasonable or unnecessary. In December, jurors acquitted three Tacoma police officers in the 2020 death of Manuel Ellis.\n\nNelson's lawyers had recommended the lowest possible range - 6 1/2 years - arguing he had served his community \"on countless occasions, placed the lives of strangers above his own.\"\n\nNelson's wife, Natalie Mounts, told the judge he was kind to others and his family needed him.\n\n\"He has a heart of service and a need to take care of people,\" Mounts said. \"Jeff and I are very sorry for the loss suffered by the Sarey family.\"\n\nAn Auburn police assistant chief and commander also spoke of Nelson's generosity and work ethic, but Phelps rebuked them for failing to acknowledge trial evidence showing Nelson's propensity toward violence and lying to cover it up.\n\n\"That tells me that the Auburn Police Department will stand by anyone and everyone as long as they have a badge,\" she said.\n\nIf you want to test a man's character, she said, give him power.\n\n\"In this situation, I would add give him power, a badge and a gun,\" she said. \"Character is who you are when no one is looking. When Officer Nelson thought that no one was looking ... he took the opportunity to harm others.\"\n\nSarey was the third person Nelson killed while on duty.\n\nNelson killed Isaiah Obet in 2017 . Obet was acting erratically and Nelson ordered his police dog to attack. He shot Obet in the torso and then the head after he fell to the ground. The police said Nelson's life was in danger because Obet was high on drugs and had a knife. The city settled with Obet's family for $1.25 million.\n\nIn 2011, Nelson fatally shot Brian Scaman, a Vietnam War veteran with mental issues and a history of felonies who pulled out a knife and refused to drop it after Nelson stopped him for a burned-out headlight. Nelson shot him in the head. An inquest jury cleared Nelson of wrongdoing.\n\nThe City of Auburn settled with Sarey's family for $4 million and has paid nearly $2 million more to settle other litigation over Nelson's actions as an officer . Nelson remains on unpaid leave.\n\nBefore sentencing, Nelson's lawyer Kristen Murray asked the judge to throw out the assault charge as constituting double jeopardy. But the judge let both counts stand, saying jurors recognized that two shots fired seconds apart - after Nelson's gun jammed and he cleared it - as separate actions.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki, File)\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - Oklahoma's Republican attorney general dismissed a felony assault charge Friday against a police officer who slammed a 71-year-old man to the ground, breaking his neck, during an argument over a traffic ticket.\n\nGentner Drummond announced that he had intervened in the case and dismissed the aggravated assault and battery charge against Oklahoma City Police Sgt. Joseph Gibson, 28.\n\nOklahoma County District Attorney Vicki Behenna charged Gibson this month after body-worn camera video released by police showed Gibson throwing Lich Vu to the ground after Vu touched Gibson during the argument following a non-injury traffic accident Oct. 27.\n\n\"As attorney general, I will not permit Oklahoma police officers to face criminal prosecution for conduct adhering to their training,\" Drummond said in a statement. \"While the outcome of this incident is unquestionably devastating for Mr. Vu and his family, I do not believe the officer exhibited criminal intent.\"\n\nProsecutors said Vu suffered a brain bleed and a broken neck and eye socket.\n\nBehenna said in a statement that she was \"surprised and disappointed that Attorney General Gentner Drummond took this case away from my office and the citizens of Oklahoma County.\"\n\nShe said previously that after evaluating the case, prosecutors determined Gibson's actions were an unreasonable use of force.\n\nDrummond said Vu should not have touched Gibson during the argument.\n\n\"No individual is allowed to hit or push an officer, regardless of whether he or she doesn't understand English well or comes from a different culture,\" Drummond said. \"The simple truth is, this unfortunate incident never would have occurred if Mr. Vu had kept his hands to himself.\"\n\nThe use of force prompted outrage in Oklahoma City's Vietnamese community, particularly since the video shows Vu had difficulty communicating with Gibson during the interaction and appeared not to understand what the officer was telling him.\n\nGibson's attorney, former Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter, said Drummond's decision to drop the charge was \"well reasoned and correct.\"\n\nMark Nelson, president of the Oklahoma City Fraternal Order of Police, said no officer wants to see someone injured and he hopes Vu makes a swift and full recovery.\n\n\"However, our members often have to make split-second decisions, and they cannot control the outcome of every situation,\" Nelson said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, when someone resists law enforcement, they increase the risk of harm to themselves or others.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

He collapsed and died after the assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The District of Columbia medical examiner's office determined he died from a stroke, saying \"all that transpired played a role in his condition.\"\n\nPart of what transpired was being sprayed with a chemical agent directly in the face from a few feet away by a man wearing a knit Trump hat and Trump gloves.\n\n\"When I saw him get attacked, I remember his face, ghostly pale, and in pain. I remember thinking that I had never seen anyone go pale when they got sprayed with chemical spray, and I knew he must need help,\" fellow Capital Police Officer Caroline Edwards said in a victim's impact statement. \"I didn't get a chance to help, though, because seconds later I was sprayed.\"\n\nShe went on: \"On January 7th, 2021, a sergeant called me to tell me that Officer Sicknick would not make it. My day had already been confusing enough. Injured with a traumatic brain injury, I slept fitfully, not sure of what was real life and what was a dream. I had hoped this call was a nightmare. All I could remember saying to him over the phone was, 'No.' That's all I could say, 'No,' followed by: 'I'm sorry. I am so sorry.'\"\n\n\"What kicked off was months of survivor's guilt and asking. 'God, why wasn't it me?' It didn't matter what anyone else said to me. I felt like the absolute worst kind of officer; someone who didn't help their friend, couldn't help their friend. Every time I looked in the mirror, I was reminded of this. My eyes were red and scabbed for over a month afterwards. It was like the 6th was mocking me, reminding me at every turn how I couldn't help my fellow officer that day.\"\n\nSicknick was cremated and a police honor guard solemnly carried a black urn containing his remains up the Capitol steps. He became only the fifth person to lay in honor in the Rotunda, a distinction that is the equivalent of lying in state for government and military officials. The other four are: fellow Capitol Police officers, Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson, killed by a crazed gunman in 1998; Civil Rights icon Rosa Parks in 2005; and evangelist Rev. Billy Graham in 2018.\n\nThe urn was then deposited with full honors in the columbarium at Arlington.\n\nIn March of 2021 the FBI arrested 32-year-old Julian Khater of Pennsylvania and 39-year-old George Tanios of West Virginia in connection with the attack on Sicknick and Edwards. The evidence against them included video in which Kharen says to Tanios: \"Give me that bear shit,\" and then takes the chemical agent from his backpack. Khater then sprays both officers at close range.\n\nTanios pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and trespassing misdemeanors. He was sentenced to time served, having already been remanded for six months.\n\nKhater pleaded guilty to felony assault on police officers and U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Hogan sentenced him to 80 months on Jan. 27, 2023. Hogan had clearly been moved by Edwards' description of the attack on Sicknick and the immediate aftermath.\n\n\"Officer Edwards said he just turned pale white,\" the judge said to Khater. \"You just walked up, within three or four feet of her, and sprayed her directly in her face; I mean, held it right there into her face to hurt her.\n\nAnd she wanted to help [Sicknick] and couldn't because she was blinded. She couldn't see where to move or where to go.\"\n\nThe judge added, \"You can see how distraught and destroyed she is two years later, it's a long-term effect.\"\n\nOthers who provided impact statements included Gladys Sicknick.\n\n\"I am Brian Sicknick's mom,\" she told the judge.. \"Today I did not get dressed up because I dressed up in Brian's shirt ... And I just thought it was something I had to do.\"\n\nShe continued, addressing Khater directly, \"Seven hundred and fifty-one days, that's how much time has passed since Jan. 6, 2021. And each and every day, I and my family are reminded of what you did to my son Brian. There is hardly an hour's respite. With every news report, newspaper, on the internet-we are pummeled by the horrific images of that day. But we also see the face of my son and those of courageous men and women who stood their ground to protect our democracy from a vicious mob.\"\n\nShe went on, \"And I see you, Mr. Khater. You are a center stage in our recurring nightmare. Just when raw nerves have begun to heal, we are carried back to the scene of your crime. You, among all the other crazies, you are the reason Brian is dead, Mr. Khater. You alone, today, sir. But on Jan. 6 you were on the front lines of a violent mob. And for what? While you were assaulting police officers whose duty is to keep the peace and secure our Capitol, you can't possibly have thought you were doing the right thing.\"\n\n\"The rioters who breached the Capitol that day, whether or not they have been charged with crimes, all of you are culpable in Brian's death. All of you bear responsibility for the injuries sustained by Brian's fellow officers: The broken bones, head trauma, and the continuing mental anguish they suffer and will endure for the rest of their lives. Imagine the emotional pain that would cause someone to take his own life. Four officers committed suicide. You and your movement caused their deaths.\n\nShe was not done.\n\n\"'Foot soldiers, you call yourselves. You, with your flags used as spikes. My son was a soldier. Soldiers don't erect gallows and call for the Vice President to be hanged. Soldiers don't attack the seat of their own government by brandishing pipes and clubs and bats ... They don't beat and blind policemen with chemicals like you did to Brian.\"\n\n\"You attacked my son like he was an animal. You are the animal, Mr. Khater. In defense of their actions, some of the mob have relied upon the fact that the former president invited them to Washington, that he whipped them into a frenzy and sent them marching to do his bidding to stop the peaceful transfer of power, to overturn our election. That man will get his due, his day in court; that's my hope. But you should have known better. In this great country we go to the voting booth to make a difference. We don't start an armed rebellion, no matter if the President encouraged you to fight like hell to take your country back. To this day he rants about your patriotism and how unfair you have been treated. To this day he lies about the election. How does it feel to be headed to jail because of a bald-face lie? You are no martyr. You are a felon.\"\n\n\"I don't know what kind of upbringing you had, what might have happened in your childhood that contributed to your deluded sense of right and wrong. If I were your mom, I would be embarrassed to have a son like you. I couldn't bear to look at you ever again, which is how I feel right now. Let this be the last time, Mr. Khater. Lawlessness, misplaced loyalty to a deranged autocratic ideal, and hate killed my son. And I hope you are haunted by your crimes behind bars. Whatever jail time you receive is not enough in my eyes.\"\n\nEarly Monday evening, Khater was inmate number 34510-509 at Federal Correctional Institution Danbury in Connecticut, not due for release until Nov. 18, 2026. But Donald Trump had just arrived at the Oval Office after being restored to power.\n\nThe newly inaugurated president had begun his day by delivering his inaugural address in the Rotunda, which his supporters had stormed four years before and where Sicknick had afterwards lain in honor.\n\nTrump then went down to Emancipation Hall to address the overflow crowd and repeated the falsehood about the 2020 election being \"rigged,\" the same lie that had led to Sicknick, Edwards and at least 138 other officers being injured.\n\nFrom there, Trump went to an indoor parade at the Capital One Arena. He said he would be pardoning all those convicted in connection with the storming of the Capitol. He called them \"the Jan. 6 hostages\" even as he stood with the families of actual Israeli hostages.\n\nHe then headed for the Oval Office and sat down at the Resolute Desk to sign a stack of executive orders in blue folders. A news camera recorded an aide setting the first before him.\n\n\"First you have a list of pardons and commutations for events that occurred on Jan. 6, 2021,\" the aide said.\n\n\"OK, and how many people is this?\" Trump asked.\n\n\"I think this order will apply to approximately 1500 people, sir,\" the aide replied.\n\n\"So, this is Jan. 6,\" Trump said. \"These are the hostages. Approximately 1500 for a pardon.\"\n\n'Yes,\" the aide said.\n\n\"Full pardon,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added that there were about six commutations that would require further examination.\n\n\"The commutations will either stay that way or, it'll go to a full pardon,\" he said.\n\nTrump proceeded to affix his signature with the customary black Sharpie.\n\n\"So this is a big one,\" he said.\n\n\"The order does require the Bureau of Prisons to act immediately upon receipt of the pardon and commutation orders,\" the aide said.\n\n\"Why don't we get that down, so they can get them going right now,\" Trump told him.\n\n\"Yes, sir, absolutely,\" the aide said.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons says that Khater was released at approximately 11:55 pm. That was five minutes before the end of Trump's Day One.\n\nBut Trump never had the day in court that Sicknick's mom had hoped for.\n\nAt least Edwards is said to still be on the job and promoted to sergeant. She can look in the mirror and see someone who had said what needed saying for her fallen comrade. She stands in honor at the Capitol.\n\nSpecial Correspondent\n\nmichael.daly@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

The other four are: fellow Capitol Police officers, Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson, killed by a crazed gunman in 1998; Civil Rights icon Rosa Parks in 2005; and evangelist Rev. Billy Graham in 2018.\n\nThe urn was then deposited with full honors in the columbarium at Arlington.\n\nIn March of 2021 the FBI arrested 32-year-old Julian Khater of Pennsylvania and 39-year-old George Tanios of West Virginia in connection with the attack on Sicknick and Edwards. The evidence against them included video in which Kharen says to Tanios: \"Give me that bear shit,\" and then takes the chemical agent from his backpack. Khater then sprays both officers at close range.\n\nTanios pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and trespassing misdemeanors. He was sentenced to time served, having already been remanded for six months.\n\nKhater pleaded guilty to felony assault on police officers and U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Hogan sentenced him to 80 months on Jan. 27, 2023. Hogan had clearly been moved by Edwards' description of the attack on Sicknick and the immediate aftermath.\n\n\"Officer Edwards said he just turned pale white,\" the judge said to Khater. \"You just walked up, within three or four feet of her, and sprayed her directly in her face; I mean, held it right there into her face to hurt her.\n\nAnd she wanted to help [Sicknick] and couldn't because she was blinded. She couldn't see where to move or where to go.\"\n\nThe judge added, \"You can see how distraught and destroyed she is two years later, it's a long-term effect.\"\n\nOthers who provided impact statements included Gladys Sicknick.\n\n\"I am Brian Sicknick's mom,\" she told the judge.. \"Today I did not get dressed up because I dressed up in Brian's shirt ... And I just thought it was something I had to do.\"\n\nShe continued, addressing Khater directly, \"Seven hundred and fifty-one days, that's how much time has passed since Jan. 6, 2021. And each and every day, I and my family are reminded of what you did to my son Brian. There is hardly an hour's respite. With every news report, newspaper, on the internet-we are pummeled by the horrific images of that day. But we also see the face of my son and those of courageous men and women who stood their ground to protect our democracy from a vicious mob.\"\n\nShe went on, \"And I see you, Mr. Khater. You are a center stage in our recurring nightmare. Just when raw nerves have begun to heal, we are carried back to the scene of your crime. You, among all the other crazies, you are the reason Brian is dead, Mr. Khater. You alone, today, sir. But on Jan. 6 you were on the front lines of a violent mob. And for what? While you were assaulting police officers whose duty is to keep the peace and secure our Capitol, you can't possibly have thought you were doing the right thing.\"\n\n\"The rioters who breached the Capitol that day, whether or not they have been charged with crimes, all of you are culpable in Brian's death. All of you bear responsibility for the injuries sustained by Brian's fellow officers: The broken bones, head trauma, and the continuing mental anguish they suffer and will endure for the rest of their lives. Imagine the emotional pain that would cause someone to take his own life. Four officers committed suicide. You and your movement caused their deaths.\n\nShe was not done.\n\n\"'Foot soldiers, you call yourselves. You, with your flags used as spikes. My son was a soldier. Soldiers don't erect gallows and call for the Vice President to be hanged. Soldiers don't attack the seat of their own government by brandishing pipes and clubs and bats ... They don't beat and blind policemen with chemicals like you did to Brian.\"\n\n\"You attacked my son like he was an animal. You are the animal, Mr. Khater. In defense of their actions, some of the mob have relied upon the fact that the former president invited them to Washington, that he whipped them into a frenzy and sent them marching to do his bidding to stop the peaceful transfer of power, to overturn our election. That man will get his due, his day in court; that's my hope. But you should have known better. In this great country we go to the voting booth to make a difference. We don't start an armed rebellion, no matter if the President encouraged you to fight like hell to take your country back. To this day he rants about your patriotism and how unfair you have been treated. To this day he lies about the election. How does it feel to be headed to jail because of a bald-face lie? You are no martyr. You are a felon.\"\n\n\"I don't know what kind of upbringing you had, what might have happened in your childhood that contributed to your deluded sense of right and wrong. If I were your mom, I would be embarrassed to have a son like you. I couldn't bear to look at you ever again, which is how I feel right now. Let this be the last time, Mr. Khater. Lawlessness, misplaced loyalty to a deranged autocratic ideal, and hate killed my son. And I hope you are haunted by your crimes behind bars. Whatever jail time you receive is not enough in my eyes.\"\n\nEarly Monday evening, Khater was inmate number 34510-509 at Federal Correctional Institution Danbury in Connecticut, not due for release until Nov. 18, 2026. But Donald Trump had just arrived at the Oval Office after being restored to power.\n\nThe newly inaugurated president had begun his day by delivering his inaugural address in the Rotunda, which his supporters had stormed four years before and where Sicknick had afterwards lain in honor.\n\nTrump then went down to Emancipation Hall to address the overflow crowd and repeated the falsehood about the 2020 election being \"rigged,\" the same lie that had led to Sicknick, Edwards and at least 138 other officers being injured.\n\nFrom there, Trump went to an indoor parade at the Capital One Arena. He said he would be pardoning all those convicted in connection with the storming of the Capitol. He called them \"the Jan. 6 hostages\" even as he stood with the families of actual Israeli hostages.\n\nHe then headed for the Oval Office and sat down at the Resolute Desk to sign a stack of executive orders in blue folders. A news camera recorded an aide setting the first before him.\n\n\"First you have a list of pardons and commutations for events that occurred on Jan. 6, 2021,\" the aide said.\n\n\"OK, and how many people is this?\" Trump asked.\n\n\"I think this order will apply to approximately 1500 people, sir,\" the aide replied.\n\n\"So, this is Jan. 6,\" Trump said. \"These are the hostages. Approximately 1500 for a pardon.\"\n\n'Yes,\" the aide said.\n\n\"Full pardon,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added that there were about six commutations that would require further examination.\n\n\"The commutations will either stay that way or, it'll go to a full pardon,\" he said.\n\nTrump proceeded to affix his signature with the customary black Sharpie.\n\n\"So this is a big one,\" he said.\n\n\"The order does require the Bureau of Prisons to act immediately upon receipt of the pardon and commutation orders,\" the aide said.\n\n\"Why don't we get that down, so they can get them going right now,\" Trump told him.\n\n\"Yes, sir, absolutely,\" the aide said.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons says that Khater was released at approximately 11:55 pm. That was five minutes before the end of Trump's Day One.\n\nBut Trump never had the day in court that Sicknick's mom had hoped for.\n\nAt least Edwards is said to still be on the job and promoted to sergeant. She can look in the mirror and see someone who had said what needed saying for her fallen comrade. She stands in honor at the Capitol.\n\nSpecial Correspondent\n\nmichael.daly@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

Previous reporting revealed that Crooks pointed his gun at the officer, and after ducking the officer lost his grip and fell to the ground.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLater in the video, the officer makes his way back to his squad car, where he retrieves a weapon. \"He turned around on me,\" the officer says to another.\n\nCrooks then begins firing, killing rally attendee Corey Comperatore, grazing Trump's ear and injuring two others. On the video, chaos quickly ensues as armed law enforcement try and make sense of the situation.\n\n\"Yo Mike, I climbed the wall, and I popped my head right in front of him, bro. He's got a book bag. He's got mad sh*t. AR. Laying down,\" the officer says.\n\nThe officer then returns to where he was boosted the first time and is hoisted once again onto the roof, where Crooks has been shot and killed.\n\nThe video ends with the officer on the roof making his way towards Crooks, whose body is rapidly surrounded by other officers.\n\nAnother recently released body camera video shows another officer's point of view moments after the shooting takes place.\n\n\"Threat one is down. We need to secure the rest of the area,\" the officer says into his walkie-talkie.\n\n\"I need a bunch of EMS on standby too because I don't know how this crowd is going to disperse,\" he says later.\n\nclay.walker@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Bizarre Footage Shows Cop Open Fire After Mistaking Acorn for Gunshot\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\nShocking body-camera footage released this week showed a Florida cop's dangerous overreaction, in which he dropped, rolled, and unloaded an entire clip from his pistol in the direction of a restrained suspect after mistaking an acorn falling on his patrol car for a gunshot.\n\nJesse Hernandez, of the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office in the Florida Panhandle, resigned a month after the incident as his superiors ultimately determined his use of force \"was not objectively reasonable.\"\n\nFootage of the incident, which occurred in November, surfaced for the first time this week. In it, Hernandez is seen flinging himself to the ground while calling out \"shots fired\" four times. He does a roll, breaks his sunglasses, and then pulls out his handgun and opens fire at his own patrol car.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHernandez's partner, Sergeant Beth Roberts, emerges and opens fire herself after confirming with Hernandez that someone shot at him. Making the situation all-the-more baffling, Hernandez, while firing around 18 shots, was grunting and yelled out to his partner, \"I'm hit, oh, I'm hit.\"\n\nMoments later, the footage shows him crawl to cover and he claims that he's been shot through the car. Then, likely realizing he was never shot at all, he tells a frantic Roberts, \"I'm good, I feel weird, but I'm good.\" He later adds, \"It might have hit my vest.\"\n\nIn reality, Hernandez's department determined he was never shot at all, as the detained suspect, 22-year-old Marquis Jackson, a Black man, was not armed. Instead, cops said he sat helpless in the back of the patrol car while a barrage of shots were fired at him by Hernandez and Roberts.\n\nJackson wrote in a lengthy Facebook post that the incident left him \"damaged for life,\" despite miraculously not being struck by the officers' gunfire.\n\nHe said he was \"scared to death,\" and that he leaned over and played dead \"to prevent getting shot in the head.\"\n\n\"Mentally, I'm not OK,\" he said. \"I haven't been the same since and I don't think this feeling I have will ever change.\"\n\nOnce the officers stopped firing, Jackson said they forced him to show his hands, but he couldn't raise them as ordered because he was still in handcuffs on allegations he'd stolen his girlfriend's car. While doing this, he said he was staring down the barrel of an officer's gun, so he closed his eyes and prayed he'd survive the ordeal.\n\n\"I eventually found a way to rest my cuffed hands on the shattered window area to show that I wasn't armed. A few minutes later they swarmed the car and slammed me on the ground to search me,\" he said. \"The image I can't get out of my head is seeing how bad my mom was hurt/crying right before I got into the ambulance.\"\n\nSheriff Eric Aden said in a video statement that he apologized personally to Jackson, his family, and conceded that \"we let the public down.\"\n\n\"I will admit that this was a very tragic and traumatic incident for Mr. Jackson and we are so grateful and thankful that he was not injured,\" Aden said.\n\nThe department compiled a 44-page report for the incident, which included a nearly second-by-second breakdown of the released footage and partial transcripts of interviews that were conducted with the officers involved.\n\nThose interviews appeared to show that Hernandez was in denial of his department's findings. Once informed it was determined the noise that set him off was merely an acorn striking his patrol car's roof, the report said Hernandez refused to watch his own body-camera footage.\n\nRoberts told investigators she only opened fire because Hernandez did so first and she feared he'd been shot. She said his positioning in the middle of the road was particularly troubling-and, in the aftermath, truly puzzling-because police training instructs officers to seek cover in shots-fired situations.\n\nWith Hernandez audibly grunting and calling out that he was hit, plus his strange positioning on the road, Roberts said she truly believed Hernandez had been seriously injured.\n\n\"I thought I just saw a deputy get murdered,\" she said, according to the report. When asked what her feeling was when she heard Hernandez call out that shots were fired, she said she thought, \"Shit has hit the fan.\"\n\nRoberts will not face any internal punishment for her role in the shooting after the probe determined her response was \"objectively reasonable.\"\n\nHernandez was an active deputy in the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office between January 2022 and the incident, which occurred on Nov. 12, 2023. Prior to that, he'd served two tours in Afghanistan but never saw combat.\n\nJackson said that he was placed in a holding cell for hours after the incident and had his fingerprints taken. He said he was eventually released with no charges filed against him. He did not return interview requests from The Daily Beast.\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\nJosh.Fiallo@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "The Cynical Hypocrisy Behind Trump's Visit to an NYPD Officer's Wake\n\nSpecial Correspondent\n\nDonald Trump attended the wake of fallen NYPD Officer Jonathan Diller on Thursday, telling the crowd of media outside afterward, \"Police are the greatest people.\"\n\nAnyone who thinks Trump truly believes that or that he was at the wake out of genuine respect should recall a campaign rally in Ohio earlier this month.\n\nAt the start of that March 16 event in Vandalia, Trump solemnly saluted as the sound system played a recording of the J6 Prison Choir singing the national anthem inside the District of Columbia jail.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe producers who had spliced in a recording of Trump reciting the Pledge of Allegiance and marketed the song as \"Justice for All\" have never identified the particular singers. But an analysis by Just Security found that 17 of the 20 Jan. 6 prisoners in the facility around the time of the recording had been arrested for assaulting law enforcement officers.\n\nAmong them was Peter Stager , who is serving four years for beating D.C. Police Officer Blake Miller as he lay head-first, face-down on the Capitol steps. Video captured Stager striking the defenseless cop at least three times with a flagpole that had an American flag attached.\n\nCourt papers show that Stager subsequently stood over and cursed another officer who had been dragged into the crowd. \"Every single one of those Capitol law enforcement officers, death is the remedy,\" Stager was recorded saying during the riot. \"That is the only remedy they get.\"\n\nThis recording on Jan. 6 was part of the evidence against Stager when he was held in the D.C. Jail where the J6 Prison choir recording was made over a cellblock phone. Trump first played \"Justice for All\" at a March 25, 2023, rally in Waco, Texas that marked the start of his campaign for re-election.\n\n\"Our people love those people,\" Trump told the crowd.\n\nTrump supporters stand on a U.S. Capitol Police armored vehicle on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nTrump has played it repeatedly since then, evolving from standing with his hand over his heart to giving a hand salute this month.\n\n\"And you see the spirit from the hostages, and that's what they are as hostages,\" Trump told the crowd in Ohio. \"They've been treated terribly and very unfairly, you know that everybody knows that. And we're going to be working on that.\" He called the prisoners \"unbelievable patriots\" and termed their incarceration \"a disgrace.\"\n\n\"My first acts as your next President will be to Close the Border, DRILL, BABY, DRILL, and Free the January 6 Hostages being wrongfully imprisoned!\" he declared in a March 12 posting on Truth Social.\n\nAs tallied by the U.S. Department of Justice, those arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 riot included \"approximately 127 individuals who have been charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer.\"\n\nThirteen days after Trump made his latest pledge to free the \"hostages,\"  31-year-old Officer Diller was fatally shot in the stomach under his bullet-resistant vest after he approached an illegally parked car in Far Rockaway, Queens. He leaves behind a wife and a 1-year-old child.\n\n\"Our heartfelt prayers go out to the family of highly decorated NYPD officer Jonathan Diller, whose life was taken by a murderous career criminal yesterday during a traffic stop in Queens,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nHe followed that with a Truth Social post on Wednesday.\n\n\"To Officer Diller's family, and all of the other brave men and women of law enforcement who put your lives on the line every day, we love you, we appreciate you, and we will always stand with you!\"\n\nTrump was apparently counting on everybody forgetting the 140 officers the DOJ says were assaulted at the Capitol by people he calls \"patriots\" and \"hostages.\" He used a very different word to describe 34-year-old Guy Rivera, a career criminal arrested in connection with the officer's killing, calling him a \"thug\" and saying that he should never have been released from lockup.\n\nTrump was saying exactly what Diller's grieving comrades would want to hear-sentiments that have led many law-enforcement officers in New York and elsewhere to imagine he has their interests at heart, even though he has proven with his actions that he does not.\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt subsequently announced that the ex-president, who fancies himself a champion of law and order even though he has been indicted four times, would be attending Diller's wake on Long Island on Thursday.\n\n\"President Trump is moved by the invitation to join NYPD Officer Jonathan Diller's family and colleagues as they deal with his senseless and tragic death,\" Leavitt said.\n\nLeavitt did not say who had invited Trump, and the campaign did not respond to a query from The Daily Beast. A spokesman for the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York said he did not know who had asked Trump to attend. It turns out that Trump was invited by Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, a Republican.\n\nIt should be noted that President Joe Biden was also expected in New York on Thursday, to attend a big fundraiser at Radio City Music Hall with former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton . There are no reports that Biden was invited to attend Diller's wake, which says something about what most New York cops and their families feel about him.\n\nNew Yorkers pay their respects at a memorial for slain NYPD officer Jonathan Diller outside the 101st Precinct.\n\nIf Trump's attendance was not just a political stunt with the bonus of contrasting him with Biden, he could have just arrived at the Massapequa Funeral Home without making a public announcement beforehand. He could have said a prayer at the coffin and offered his condolences to the widow, Stephanie.\n\nBut Trump's campaign alerted the media it so often disparages. He thirsts for the headlines-whether they are about him praising cop-beaters or honoring an officer killed in the line of duty.\n\nTrump arrived at the wake at 2 p.m., escorted by Blakeman and greeted by NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban. After 30 minutes with Diller's family, friends and fellow officers, he emerged and paused outside to speak to reporters.\n\nHe almost sounded like he is capable of empathy as he spoke of Diller's \"very beautiful wife\" and son.\"\n\n\"That child-brand new, beautiful baby-sitting there innocent as can be doesn't know how his life has been changed,\" Trump said. \"But the Diller family will. You'll never be the same.\"\n\nHe said what needed to be said, but the words should ring hollow to anyone who knows what he has also said about the insurrectionists who battered Diller's comrades on Jan. 6.\n\nThere is no need to pay attention to anything Trump said. Focus instead on the words Diller's brother-in-inlaw, Joseph McCauley, spoke at a candlelight vigil the night before.\n\n\"He loved what he did. He was born to be a cop. He was born to be a hero. He died being a hero. He died doing what he loved.\"\n\nMcCauley then said of Diller something that we should be able to say about those we elevate to our highest office: \"I will forever be a better person because of him.\"\n\nSpecial Correspondent\n\nmichael.daly@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

He leaves behind a wife and a 1-year-old child.\n\n\"Our heartfelt prayers go out to the family of highly decorated NYPD officer Jonathan Diller, whose life was taken by a murderous career criminal yesterday during a traffic stop in Queens,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nHe followed that with a Truth Social post on Wednesday.\n\n\"To Officer Diller's family, and all of the other brave men and women of law enforcement who put your lives on the line every day, we love you, we appreciate you, and we will always stand with you!\"\n\nTrump was apparently counting on everybody forgetting the 140 officers the DOJ says were assaulted at the Capitol by people he calls \"patriots\" and \"hostages.\" He used a very different word to describe 34-year-old Guy Rivera, a career criminal arrested in connection with the officer's killing, calling him a \"thug\" and saying that he should never have been released from lockup.\n\nTrump was saying exactly what Diller's grieving comrades would want to hear-sentiments that have led many law-enforcement officers in New York and elsewhere to imagine he has their interests at heart, even though he has proven with his actions that he does not.\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt subsequently announced that the ex-president, who fancies himself a champion of law and order even though he has been indicted four times, would be attending Diller's wake on Long Island on Thursday.\n\n\"President Trump is moved by the invitation to join NYPD Officer Jonathan Diller's family and colleagues as they deal with his senseless and tragic death,\" Leavitt said.\n\nLeavitt did not say who had invited Trump, and the campaign did not respond to a query from The Daily Beast. A spokesman for the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York said he did not know who had asked Trump to attend. It turns out that Trump was invited by Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, a Republican.\n\nIt should be noted that President Joe Biden was also expected in New York on Thursday, to attend a big fundraiser at Radio City Music Hall with former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton . There are no reports that Biden was invited to attend Diller's wake, which says something about what most New York cops and their families feel about him.\n\nNew Yorkers pay their respects at a memorial for slain NYPD officer Jonathan Diller outside the 101st Precinct.\n\nIf Trump's attendance was not just a political stunt with the bonus of contrasting him with Biden, he could have just arrived at the Massapequa Funeral Home without making a public announcement beforehand. He could have said a prayer at the coffin and offered his condolences to the widow, Stephanie.\n\nBut Trump's campaign alerted the media it so often disparages. He thirsts for the headlines-whether they are about him praising cop-beaters or honoring an officer killed in the line of duty.\n\nTrump arrived at the wake at 2 p.m., escorted by Blakeman and greeted by NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban. After 30 minutes with Diller's family, friends and fellow officers, he emerged and paused outside to speak to reporters.\n\nHe almost sounded like he is capable of empathy as he spoke of Diller's \"very beautiful wife\" and son.\"\n\n\"That child-brand new, beautiful baby-sitting there innocent as can be doesn't know how his life has been changed,\" Trump said. \"But the Diller family will. You'll never be the same.\"\n\nHe said what needed to be said, but the words should ring hollow to anyone who knows what he has also said about the insurrectionists who battered Diller's comrades on Jan. 6.\n\nThere is no need to pay attention to anything Trump said. Focus instead on the words Diller's brother-in-inlaw, Joseph McCauley, spoke at a candlelight vigil the night before.\n\n\"He loved what he did. He was born to be a cop. He was born to be a hero. He died being a hero. He died doing what he loved.\"\n\nMcCauley then said of Diller something that we should be able to say about those we elevate to our highest office: \"I will forever be a better person because of him.\"\n\nSpecial Correspondent\n\nmichael.daly@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Clare Nowland's son says decision not to imprison police officer who killed her a 'slap on the wrist'\n\nKristian White was convicted of manslaughter over death of Nowland whom he shot with a Taser at a Cooma aged care home in 2023\n\nA judge's decision not to send Kristian White to jail for the manslaughter of Clare Nowland is \"a slap on the wrist for someone that's killed our mother\", according to the 95-year-old's son.\n\nJustice Ian Harrison handed down his sentencing decision for the former New South Wales police officer in the NSW supreme court on Friday, saying the incident in his opinion \"falls in the lower end of objective seriousness\" for manslaughter and that time in prison would be a \"disproportionate\" sentence.\n\nHarrison sentenced White to a two-year community corrections order. The conditions include 425 hours of community service and reporting to a community corrections officer.\n\nWhite was convicted of manslaughter last year over the death of Nowland, whom he shot with a Taser at an aged care home in the southern NSW town of Cooma in the early hours of 17 May 2023.\n\nWhite was called to the Yallambee Lodge home after Nowland, who was displaying symptoms of dementia, was found disoriented in the middle of the night, walking around the property carrying a serrated knife.\n\nNowland, who was frail, weighed just 47kg, and could only move slowly with the aid of a walker, was confronted by White, who ordered her to put the knife down.\n\nWhen Nowland did not comply, appearing not to understand the instruction, White said \"nah, bugger it\", and fired his Taser at her chest, causing her to fall heavily and hit her head. He fired his Taser within three minutes of seeing Nowland at the home, the court heard.\n\nNowland died a week later in hospital after suffering inoperable bleeding in the brain. She never regained consciousness.\n\nIn his reasoning, Harrison called White's actions an \"error of judgment\" and a \"mistake that in hindsight is hard to comprehend\".\n\n\"He deployed his Taser in response to what he perceived to be a threat that in my view never called for such a response. There were several ways he might have dealt with it differently,\" Harrison told the court.\n\n\"Mr White clearly made the wrong choice.\"\n\nHarrison said White's actions had led to \"tragic, avoidable and serious\" consequences and acknowledged the family was \"struggling to cope with the enormity\" of Nowland's death and the loss of their matriarch.\n\nHowever, Harrison explained that he deemed a prison sentence for White's actions \"disproportionate\" because White does not pose a risk or danger to the community, and does not pose a risk of reoffending.\n\nHe also said that the offending occurred within the context of his duties as a police officer, and his access to a Taser was part of that role, therefore the chance of him deploying a Taser in a similar circumstance was \"negligible, if not fanciful\".\n\n\"His employment has been terminated ... he has become an unwelcome member of the Cooma community as a result of what he has done,\" Harrison said.\n\nHarrison said White had expressed both remorse and regret in a letter he sent to the family. He also noted earlier in his reasoning that White has been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and PTSD, and that he had indicated he would move away from Cooma after the court proceedings had finished.\n\n\"I have no doubt he regrets what he did and the position in which he now finds himself. It would be remarkable if it were otherwise.\"\n\nHarrison had said in November during a sentence hearing that a jail sentence for White was not \"inevitable\", noting the \"extraordinary range\" of sentencing options available to the court: from 25 years' imprisonment to a non-custodial sentence.\n\nWhite's sentencing in the half-full 290-seat courtroom was attended by more than 20 of members of Nowland's extended family.\n\nOne of them began to cry shortly after the sentence was handed down and was comforted by other family members.\n\nOutside the court, Nowland's eldest son, Michael Nowland, spoke briefly on behalf of the family shortly after the sentence was handed down. He said he was still processing the decision.\n\n\"Justice and fairness, that's all we wanted,\" he said.\n\nWhite did not stop to speak to reporters as he exited court and immediately got in the passenger seat of a car waiting for him.\n\nIn December, six days after the manslaughter ruling, the NSW police commissioner, Karen Webb, announced White had been sacked from the force under the Police Act section 181D, which gives the police commissioner the power to fire an officer if confidence is lost in their suitability.\n\nWhite has sought to appeal against his sacking , filing a case in the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales."

      "text": "Ex-officer convicted in fatal shooting of Black man at New Mexico gas station\n\nProsecutors said Brad Lunsford, found guilty of voluntary manslaughter, shot Presley Eze at point-blank range in 2022\n\nA former police officer was found guilty on Wednesday of voluntary manslaughter in the killing of Presley Eze during a 2022 confrontation at a New Mexico gas station.\n\nBrad Lunsford, who is white, had pleaded not guilty in the fatal shooting of Eze, who was Black. The former Las Cruces officer's attorney, Jose Coronado, said he would ask the judge to review the verdict for its legal sufficiency.\n\n\"While I respect the jury's verdict, I am extremely disappointed in it. I don't believe the state met its burden,\" he said in an email to the Associated Press.\n\nProsecutors said Lunsford had shot Eze at point-blank range in a scuffle after police responded to a 911 call from a gas station attendant who reported that Eze had stolen beer. Eze allegedly placed his hand on a second officer's stun gun before being shot.\n\nThe state attorney general, Raúl Torrez, said the use of deadly force was not reasonable, noting that Lunsford had immediately drawn his service weapon and shot Eze in the back of the head.\n\n\"Today's verdict reaffirms a fundamental principle: no one is above the law - not even those sworn to uphold it. Officer Lunsford's actions were not just a tragic lapse in judgment; they were an egregious abuse of power that cost Presley Eze his life,\" Torrez said in a statement after the verdict was announced.\n\nThe charge of voluntary manslaughter with a firearms enhancement carries a possible sentence of up to nine years in prison. Evidence at trial included police body-camera video of the confrontation, in which police pulled Eze from a vehicle and the struggle ensued.\n\nIt is the latest verdict in cases prosecutors have linked to systemic police brutality against Black people, nearly five years after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, murdered George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nPhilip Stinson, a professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, said most fatal shootings by on-duty officers are determined to be legally justified under precedent stemming from two 1980s-era US supreme court rulings.\n\n\"It is incredibly difficult for a prosecutor to obtain a conviction in a jury trial in one of these cases, and that's because jurors are very reluctant to second-guess the split-second, often life-or-death decisions of an on-duty police officer in a potentially violent street encounter,\" Stinson said. \"Anything can happen, but it's only in the most egregious cases.\"\n\nRecords compiled by Stinson, university colleagues and students through the Police Integrity Research Group show that 205 non-federal law enforcement officers have been arrested on criminal charges of homicide or manslaughter over the past 20 years, resulting in 66 convictions, 27 of them for manslaughter or homicide.\n\n\"If you do get a conviction, it's often for the lesser offense,\" Stinson said.\n\nMore than 900 fatal shootings by on-duty state and local law enforcement officers typically take place each year in the US, he said\n\nIn pursuing a criminal charge against Lunsford, Torrez described the killing of Eze as a tragedy and \"yet another example of poor police tactics resulting in an unjustifiable use of force to subdue an individual resisting arrest for the commission of a minor crime\"."

Eze allegedly placed his hand on a second officer's stun gun before being shot.\n\nThe state attorney general, Raúl Torrez, said the use of deadly force was not reasonable, noting that Lunsford had immediately drawn his service weapon and shot Eze in the back of the head.\n\n\"Today's verdict reaffirms a fundamental principle: no one is above the law - not even those sworn to uphold it. Officer Lunsford's actions were not just a tragic lapse in judgment; they were an egregious abuse of power that cost Presley Eze his life,\" Torrez said in a statement after the verdict was announced.\n\nThe charge of voluntary manslaughter with a firearms enhancement carries a possible sentence of up to nine years in prison. Evidence at trial included police body-camera video of the confrontation, in which police pulled Eze from a vehicle and the struggle ensued.\n\nIt is the latest verdict in cases prosecutors have linked to systemic police brutality against Black people, nearly five years after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, murdered George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nPhilip Stinson, a professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, said most fatal shootings by on-duty officers are determined to be legally justified under precedent stemming from two 1980s-era US supreme court rulings.\n\n\"It is incredibly difficult for a prosecutor to obtain a conviction in a jury trial in one of these cases, and that's because jurors are very reluctant to second-guess the split-second, often life-or-death decisions of an on-duty police officer in a potentially violent street encounter,\" Stinson said. \"Anything can happen, but it's only in the most egregious cases.\"\n\nRecords compiled by Stinson, university colleagues and students through the Police Integrity Research Group show that 205 non-federal law enforcement officers have been arrested on criminal charges of homicide or manslaughter over the past 20 years, resulting in 66 convictions, 27 of them for manslaughter or homicide.\n\n\"If you do get a conviction, it's often for the lesser offense,\" Stinson said.\n\nMore than 900 fatal shootings by on-duty state and local law enforcement officers typically take place each year in the US, he said\n\nIn pursuing a criminal charge against Lunsford, Torrez described the killing of Eze as a tragedy and \"yet another example of poor police tactics resulting in an unjustifiable use of force to subdue an individual resisting arrest for the commission of a minor crime\"."

The weapon was registered to Christopher Dorner , a former Los Angeles police department (LAPD) officer who killed the daughter of a former LAPD captain and her fiance as well as two others over nine days in 2013 before dying in a dramatic standoff with law enforcement. Dorner had felt he had been wrongly fired by LAPD, and accused the department of racism and corruption.\n\nFederal prosecutors said on Tuesday that one of the robbery suspects, a 19-year-old Venezuelan citizen named Jesus Eduardo Padron Rojas had told police he had handled the gun and left it in the Airbnb.\n\nAuthorities say Padron and another suspect in the robberies, Jamer Mauricio Sepulveda Salazar, a 21-year-old Colombian citizen, are part of a \"crime tourism\" group that had been staying at the rental. The gun was in a pillowcase on a bed where a witness told police Padron had been sleeping, according to an affidavit.\n\nSepulveda and Padron were stopped in the vehicle Tuesday and charged with felonies related to armed robbery.\n\nThe men told investigators that they were involved in the armed robbery of a $30,000 Rolex on 5 August in Beverly Hills and, two days later, in one with the watch with an estimated worth of more than $1m, according to the affidavit.\n\nOne suspect pointed a gun at a man sitting with his wife and two daughters on the Beverly Wilshire Hotel's restaurant patio while the other removed the silver Patek Philippe watch from his wrist, the affidavit said. The crew had been surveilling for the luxury watch for two weeks, Sepulveda told police.\n\nSepulveda and Padron are both in custody and made their initial court appearances Tuesday. They will be arraigned next month in federal court in downtown Los Angeles."

      "text": "In the United States, there is no official accounting of the people killed by police. To address that void in information, non-governmental and news organizations have been collecting data on such incidents.\n\nData artist Josh Begley's new project, \"Officer Involved,\" uses databases on police brutality compiled by the Guardian to present the problem in a new way. Begley's project (like several others he has done) is an intervention that makes visible the violence behind the way we live. \"Officer Involved\" reveals the lack of innocence in the landscape, and, without sensationalism or sentimentality, challenges us to think about a deep injustice that so many of us accept as normal.\n\nIn row after row, we see photographs of corners, streets, suburbs, towns, all in daylight, almost all free of human presence. All these images-in spite of the mysterious lyric beauty of some of them-were captured indiscriminately by the all-seeing eye of Google, either with a bird's eye view or at street level. They were then selected and set into an array by Begley. In one sense, they are the same as any other stills randomly pulled from Google Maps. But when we look at these photographs in particular, we are also seeing the last thing that some other human being saw. It is an immersion in the environment of someone's last moments.\n\nIf it is true, as our ancestors always suspected, that the dead continue to exert some influence on the places where they lived and died, then Begley's photographic project makes that insight manifest.\n\nHow quiet these scenes are, how charged by a crisp light and brilliant clarity. They look like insignificant places, but all of them are full of significance for those whose loved ones died there. All are sites of premature death, all are sites where someone was killed, and most also index an unrestituted crime.\n\nThe American landscape is thickening with these incidents. If extra-judicial killing was always facile, the reporting of it is becoming so as well. This is the value of Begley's project: to shift us into a sober space, a space of contemplation. It is important to have the numbers, but it is vital to have an affective intervention like this one as well, which shows us how difficult the current dispensation is to bear, and how it marks us, the streets on which we move, the places in which we live.\n\n-Teju Cole, author of \"Open City\" and photography critic of the New York Times Magazine"

      "text": "Capitol Police Officer Who Shot Ashli Babbitt Insists He Did Warn Her Before Opening Fire\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nLt. Michael Byrd says Ashli Babbitt ignored his order to stay outside a barricaded door in the Capitol on January 6. A member of the pro-Trump mob standing next to her heard the warning.\n\nLt. Michael Byrd , the Capitol Police officer who shot and killed Ashli Babbitt on January 6, has rejected claims from her defenders that he opened fire without warning, telling NBC News that he ordered the fanatical Donald Trump supporter to stop advancing before he fired the fatal shot.\n\n\"I had been yelling and screaming,\" Byrd said in an interview broadcast Thursday night, \"'Please stop, get back, get back, stop.'\"\n\nVideo posted online by multiple witnesses that day showed that Babbitt, an Air Force veteran wearing a Stars and Stripes backpack and a Trump flag as a cape, was shot by Byrd as she climbed through the shattered window of the barricaded Speaker's Lobby door, which was all that separated the mob of Trump supporters from members of Congress.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe officer's statement matches the account of a fellow member of the pro-Trump mob, Thomas Baranyi , who caught Babbitt as she fell back. Baranyi, who still had Babbitt's blood on his hand when he spoke to a local news crew outside the Capitol minutes later, said that \"a number of police and Secret Service were saying, 'Get back, get down, get out of the way.' She didn't heed the call.\"\n\nFurther evidence that Byrd's warning was clear to those around Babbitt comes from graphic video of the shooting posted on Twitter less than 40 minutes after the event by another witness. Those images clearly show that Baranyi, who was wearing a backward blue Trump cap and standing close to Babbitt, raised his hand and nodded in Byrd's direction to signal his compliance with the command to stay back. Three seconds later, Babbitt climbed into the window to cross the barricade and was shot.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/rise_images/status/1346915187245404165\n\nThe unexamined claim that Byrd opened fire on Babbitt without warning has been central to the effort to portray her as a peaceful protester murdered by the police and, in the belief system of pro-Trump extremists, a sacred martyr.\n\nWhen Rep. Paul Gosar asked FBI Director Christopher Wray in June if he knew the identity of the officer who \"executed\" Babbitt, the far-right Arizona Republican claimed that Byrd \"appeared to be hiding, lying in wait, and gave no warning before killing her.\"\n\nWhile questioning FBI Director Wray, Rep. Paul Gosar asserts that Ashli Babbitt was \"executed\" pic.twitter.com/ySYscC096P\n\n- Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) June 15, 2021\n\nAn online crowdfunding appeal to support legal efforts by Babbitt's family, which has raised more than $240,000, ignores Baranyi's account and the video evidence of his actions and asserts that \"Ashli was entitled to a warning and chance to surrender before she was shot to death. Witnesses confirm that the officer did not give a verbal warning prior to firing.\"\n\nTerrell Roberts, a lawyer representing the Babbitt family, has described the fact that other witnesses among the pro-Trump mob said that they did not hear a warning from Byrd as a central feature in possible civil litigation. But in an interview last month, Roberts said his key witness was Tayler Hansen, a far-right political activist who filmed the shooting but was across the hall from Babbitt and Baranyi.\n\nHansen, who spent last summer painting \"Baby Lives Matter\" on streets outside abortion clinics and recording opposition research video of left-wing activists, is hardly a neutral witness. In posts for the far-right Gateway Pundit website, which is known for spreading misinformation, and on his Twitter account, Hansen has spent months spreading clues to Byrd's identity online, demanding that the officer be charged with murder and even arguing with Byrd's lawyer .\n\nWhat's more, just before Babbitt climbed through the window, Hansen's ability to hear what Byrd was saying was no doubt diminished by the fact that he was standing right next to another videographer, John Sullivan, who was loudly shouting , \"No! There's a gun! There's a gun! There's a gun!\" to draw attention to the fact that Byrd had raised his weapon.\n\nShortly after Byrd's account was broadcast on Thursday, Tucker Carlson claimed that \"Michael Byrd executed an enemy of the Biden administration\" and did so \"without warning her first.\"\n\nCarlson has been a central figure in the effort to cast Babbitt as a martyr, starting on the evening of her death, when he devoted the opening monologue of his show to a deeply misleading, inaccurate description of the viral video of her shooting recorded by Hansen.\n\n\"In the footage, which we're not going to show you because it's too upsetting, but you can find on the internet, the woman is standing in a hallway right off the House floor at the center of the Capitol building,\" Carlson told his viewers. \"She's got an American flag tied around her neck. The scene around her is chaotic. People are bumping into each other, yelling, trying to get through the door into the Senate chamber. Suddenly, with no warning, there was gunfire. You hear a shot and the woman falls. She has been hit with a bullet.\"\n\nA careful review of the video evidence makes plain that Carlson misrepresented it from the start. To begin with, there is the false claim, which quickly became an article of faith on the right, that Babbitt was wrapped in the American flag when she was shot - rather than a Trump flag worn as a cape and a small red, white, and blue backpack . Then there is the fact that she was trying to get into the House, where lawmakers were still huddled, not the Senate, which had already been evacuated.\n\nMore importantly, Carlson told his viewers that the footage he was not screening for them that night showed that Babbitt was shot \"with no warning\" while just \"standing in a hallway.\" The very different truth, which is visible in the first second of Hansen's video and in other clips that circulated online that day, is that Babbitt had climbed from the hallway into the window and was attempting to cross the final barricade between the rioters and the House chamber when Byrd opened fire.\n\nByrd, who has been subjected to a torrent of death threats and racist abuse since his identity was uncovered by far-right activists, spoke to Lester Holt of NBC News this week after an internal investigation by the Capitol Police \"determined the officer's conduct was lawful\" and had \"potentially saved Members and staff from serious injury and possible death from a large crowd of rioters.\" In April, federal investigators closed a separate inquiry because they could find no evidence that \"the officer did not reasonably believe that it was necessary to do so in self-defense or in defense of the Members of Congress and others evacuating the House Chamber.\"\n\nWAIT!

He passes someone holding a Trump flag and keeps running through a parking lot, his gun flashing in the periphery of his camera.\n\n\"Is he hit?\" he asked another officer standing outside the building.\n\nThey replied, \"I'm not sure.\"\n\nVideo footage from body cameras on Butler Township Police Department officers, obtained by The Intercept, shed light on the chaos among law enforcement officials responding to the assassination attempt. The videos confirm previous reporting that a lack of communication and coordination between federal, state, and local police led to confusion at the rally and reflected insufficient preparation. The Butler police, for their part, had not had a chief for a month leading up to the attack.\n\nThe footage also shows in real time law enforcement officials' frustration in the moments just after the shooting and provides insight into how police respond in emergencies and how little they are actually able to do in an active shooter situation. The videos document the frantic nature of the response, including police asking minutes after gunfire erupted why no officers were posted on the building used by the shooter.\n\nAdditional body camera footage shows one officer telling his colleagues minutes after the shooting that he warned the Secret Service well ahead of the rally to post agents at the building used by the shooter. Other video footage from the immediate aftermath shows a sergeant making phone calls to make sure that his family and children, who had attended the rally, got out OK.\n\nIn a statement to The Intercept, Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said the agency was aware that local police had released the footage and reiterated its support for local agencies that supported the response on the day of the rally.\n\n\"The U.S. Secret Service is aware of and reviewing the bodycam footage from July 13 that was recently released by local law enforcement,\" he said. \"The attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump was a U.S. Secret Service failure, and we are reviewing and updating our protective policies and procedures in order to ensure a tragedy like this never occurs again.\" (Butler Township Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThe moments just after police encountered the shooter and later, the moment of gunfire, unfolded amid chaos as officers from different agencies scrambled to try to get onto the roof.\n\nOne Butler Township police officer started to help other law enforcement teams climb onto a plastic shed to access the roof, cupping his hands to boost them up amid worries that the shed would collapse. Eventually, a ladder was found. Soon after they realized the shooter had already been taken down, the officers started coming down off the roof.\n\nAt least 8 minutes after the gunfire, a Secret Service agent walked up to the back of the building where the police officers were standing.\n\n\"Is the shooter down?\" he asked. \"I don't want to split hairs here, but is he a 'shooter'? Did he have a weapon?\" the Secret Service agent asked, using air quotes around the word \"shooter.\"\n\n\"That was the report,\" the Butler police officer responded.\n\nA few minutes later, as police teams scattered around the building debriefed on what happened, two Butler officers and the Secret Service agent stood looking at the storage shed. \"Is that how he got up?\" one police officer asked. \"I have no idea,\" the other said. The Secret Service agent used the ladder to go up on the roof.\n\n\"I fucking told them they need to post the guys fucking over here,\" the first officer said to his colleague. \"I told them that - the Secret Service - I told them that fucking Tuesday. I told them to post fucking guys over here.\"\n\n\"I thought you guys were on the roof?\" the other cop responded.\n\n\"No, we're inside.\"\n\nThe officer walked around the building and encountered another officer. \"I wasn't even concerned about it because I thought someone was on the roof,\" the other officer said. \"I thought that's how we - like how the hell can you lose a guy walking back there if someone was on the roof?\"\n\n\"Why were we not on the roof?\" another officer is heard asking.\n\n\"Because I thought we were gonna post guys over here,\" the first officer said. \"I talked to the Secret Service guys and they were like, 'Yeah, no problem, we're gonna post guys over here.'\" The officers repeatedly discussed how the shooter might have accessed the roof.\n\nOther video from the minutes before, during, and after the shooting shows a police officer notifying other officers that there is someone on the roof of the building. The Butler Township Police Department redacted sound from the video clip so it's unclear what he says to the officers. He pointed to the roof, and two other officers ran around the side of the building to get a better view.\n\nThe first officer walked back into the parking lot to get a line of sight to the top of the roof before returning back to the corner of the building and training his gun on the roof. A few minutes later, the Beaver County Emergency Services Unit team arrived on the scene and tried to access the building.\n\nThe police opened the door to the building as emergency services officers entered to discuss the situation with SWAT members already on the scene. One SWAT officer said that an officer who climbed onto the roof suffered lacerations on his hands from the ladder and might need minor stitches. (Emergency services team members told ABC News last month that they were supposed to meet with the Secret Service on-site when they arrived before the rally, but that the meeting never took place.)\n\n\"What the fuck,\" the officer said again, partially to himself. He walked up to another emergency services team member and pulled him close. He lowered his voice and told the first responder again that he had warned the Secret Service to post people at the site the shooter accessed.\n\n\"I fucking told the Secret Service, post a fucking guy over here,\" he said. \"I told them that fucking at the meeting Tuesday.\"\n\nAs a group of officers gathered and discussed what happened, the first officer turned off his body camera.\n\nAnother clip from a sergeant's body cam shows him yelling at bystanders to clear the scene just minutes after the shooting. Witnesses told him they saw the shooter go down. He relayed the information over his radio: \"I have witnesses that think that he is down, but we have not confirmed.\" The sergeant panted as he walked around asking other bystanders if they needed a medic. After he confirmed that one suspect was down, he radioed that they needed to secure the rest of the area.\n\nThen, the sergeant called a woman. \"Get the fuck out of there, I'm OK. Get out of there,\" he said. \"Get everybody together and get out of there and get in the house, and I am OK.\"\n\nA few minutes later, he made another call to ask someone to check on his children after he sent them home from the rally. He added that he hadn't been able to get hold of his brother and that law enforcement wasn't sure if there were other shooters on the scene.\n\n\"My kids were in there,\" he yelled to another officer. \"They got separated, I'm trying to get them home.\"\n\nAfter it was clear that the shooter was down, officers started discussing how to handle the mass of people rushing away from the scene of the rally. The sergeant radioed to ask if there were any patrol dogs available.\n\n\"Just for standby, any area would be great. I don't know what this crowd's gonna do,\" he told the person on the radio.\n\nAnother officer drove up and handed him a bottle of water. \"Holy fuck, dude,\" the sergeant said. The second officer told him to sit in the squad car where there was air conditioning.\n\n\"I'm good, man,\" he said, before turning off his body camera.\n\nWAIT!

A few minutes later, the Beaver County Emergency Services Unit team arrived on the scene and tried to access the building.\n\nThe police opened the door to the building as emergency services officers entered to discuss the situation with SWAT members already on the scene. One SWAT officer said that an officer who climbed onto the roof suffered lacerations on his hands from the ladder and might need minor stitches. (Emergency services team members told ABC News last month that they were supposed to meet with the Secret Service on-site when they arrived before the rally, but that the meeting never took place.)\n\n\"What the fuck,\" the officer said again, partially to himself. He walked up to another emergency services team member and pulled him close. He lowered his voice and told the first responder again that he had warned the Secret Service to post people at the site the shooter accessed.\n\n\"I fucking told the Secret Service, post a fucking guy over here,\" he said. \"I told them that fucking at the meeting Tuesday.\"\n\nAs a group of officers gathered and discussed what happened, the first officer turned off his body camera.\n\nAnother clip from a sergeant's body cam shows him yelling at bystanders to clear the scene just minutes after the shooting. Witnesses told him they saw the shooter go down. He relayed the information over his radio: \"I have witnesses that think that he is down, but we have not confirmed.\" The sergeant panted as he walked around asking other bystanders if they needed a medic. After he confirmed that one suspect was down, he radioed that they needed to secure the rest of the area.\n\nThen, the sergeant called a woman. \"Get the fuck out of there, I'm OK. Get out of there,\" he said. \"Get everybody together and get out of there and get in the house, and I am OK.\"\n\nA few minutes later, he made another call to ask someone to check on his children after he sent them home from the rally. He added that he hadn't been able to get hold of his brother and that law enforcement wasn't sure if there were other shooters on the scene.\n\n\"My kids were in there,\" he yelled to another officer. \"They got separated, I'm trying to get them home.\"\n\nAfter it was clear that the shooter was down, officers started discussing how to handle the mass of people rushing away from the scene of the rally. The sergeant radioed to ask if there were any patrol dogs available.\n\n\"Just for standby, any area would be great. I don't know what this crowd's gonna do,\" he told the person on the radio.\n\nAnother officer drove up and handed him a bottle of water. \"Holy fuck, dude,\" the sergeant said. The second officer told him to sit in the squad car where there was air conditioning.\n\n\"I'm good, man,\" he said, before turning off his body camera.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "More Than Two Years After Viral Chokehold Video, NYPD Officer Has Faced No Discipline\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAn independent agency concluded in 2019 that an NYPD cop had used improper force, yet he continues to patrol the same streets.\n\nWhen the independent agency investigating abuse by New York police determined that an officer had held him in a banned chokehold and shocked him with a Taser 13 times, Tomás Medina thought he would get justice at last.\n\nSeven months earlier, Medina had been playing music with friends outside the car dealership where he worked, in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan, when New York Police Department detective Fabio Nunez, responding to a noise complaint, demanded to see Medina's identification. When he argued and tried to walk away, Nunez escalated the encounter, which was caught on surveillance camera and police body camera . The video mirrored that of the 2014 killing of Eric Garner by officer Daniel Pantaleo and sparked an outcry about the NYPD's continued use of chokeholds, a practice that has been prohibited for decades but remains widespread .\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWhile the footage leaves little doubt about what transpired between Medina and Nunez in July 2018, department officials quickly sided with the officer. A day after the incident, NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan defended Nunez's actions, saying that he \"used the necessary force to take that individual into custody.\" The NYPD closed its internal use-of-force investigation without taking any action. But the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the body tasked with investigating civilian allegations of some types of police abuse, including excessive force, substantiated Medina's accusations of misconduct. It was a relatively rare outcome for an agency that reviewed nearly 5,000 allegations last year, substantiating only about 15 percent of them.\n\nEach complaint filed with the CCRB can include multiple allegations, and the board considers a complaint substantiated if at least one allegation within it is proven to have happened and to have been improper, based on the NYPD Patrol Guide and applicable laws. In 2019, 24 percent of fully investigated complaints were substantiated. But the CCRB classifies many allegations it reviews as \"exonerated,\" meaning that the reported incident did happen but was not improper, or \"unsubstantiated,\" meaning that there was not enough evidence to determine whether an officer committed misconduct.\n\nThe video of his encounter with Nunez went viral, and Medina drew some comfort from knowing that people could watch what had happened and see for themselves that he had done nothing wrong, he told me. The CCRB ruling, however, gave him hope that a measure of accountability would follow. \"I felt better, like my case was being listened to,\" he told me in an interview, speaking in Spanish. \"I thought they would fire him.\"\n\nTomás Medina body camera footage. Content warning: police violence.\n\nThat ruling was two years ago this week, and Nunez is yet to face any consequences for his conduct. The NYPD has not scheduled an administrative trial against him or issued as much as a reprimand against him. He is still patrolling the same streets, where he has received additional complaints, including another substantiated allegation that he used a chokehold just two months after the incident with Medina.\n\nDuring his two decades with the department, Nunez has been the subject of 46 CCRB allegations stemming from 16 different incidents. Thirty-two of those involved allegations of excessive or unnecessary force, including 19 that were substantiated, according to a database of officer disciplinary records that was made public by the New York Civil Liberties Union. Before the incident involving Medina, Nunez was cited in at least five civil lawsuits involving excessive force or false arrest, which the city settled for a total of at least $220,000, according to a different database of officer misconduct . (These settlements usually do not include an admission of liability.) Nunez has also earned a spot on a Manhattan district attorney list of officers with credibility issues for providing false testimony.\n\nJessica McRorie, a spokesperson for the NYPD, did not answer questions about Nunez's record and the delay in prosecuting him over the incident with Medina but wrote in an email to The Intercept, \"The discipline process is ongoing. A trial date is not scheduled at this time.\" The mayor's office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMedina's ordeal and his stalled quest for justice underscore decades-old problems with the NYPD's disciplinary process, which is crippled by chronic delays , a lack of transparency, and the department's reluctance to discipline officers. For years, communities on the receiving end of police abuse and their advocates have denounced the culture of impunity that the system has fostered. In January, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a new \" disciplinary matrix \" for the NYPD. The document was the result of a yearslong effort to bring some transparency to the discipline process, which gained momentum following the George Floyd protests last summer. The matrix details consequences for specific instances of misconduct, for instance recommending termination for officers found to have used chokeholds, although it leaves room for mitigating circumstances. While the mayor has hailed the new NYPD matrix as substantial progress, its recommendations are not binding, and the police commissioner retains the final word on what disciplinary measures, if any, to mete out.\n\nMundo Auto Shipping, where Medina worked in 2018 when he was assaulted by Nunez, is seen in Inwood, New York, on Feb. 23, 2021.\n\nThat's hardly good enough for critics, who argue that there can be no accountability until police discipline is removed from the control of the department altogether and assigned to an independent arbiter. In order to do that, lawmakers would first need to repeal a decades-old state law that limits independent oversight of police discipline - a measure advocates have been pushing for, including at a city council hearing last week. City officials have pushed back against that prospect and asked instead that the new discipline matrix be given the time to work.\n\nCases like Nunez's will now test the effectiveness of the matrix, which is supposed to retroactively apply to any outstanding disciplinary processes. Medina and his attorneys have called on the department to swiftly schedule a trial and to stick to the matrix's recommended punishment, but so far, the NYPD has refused to say whether it plans to do so. \"Policymakers are trying to make changes to remedy the situation, but ultimately, when individual officers are not actually held accountable, all of these policies don't really add up to much,\" said Molly Griffard, a legal fellow with the Legal Aid Society's Cop Accountability Project, who represents Medina. \"The NYPD has shown that it is just not capable of policing itself. We have a department with a widespread, rampant culture of impunity. To actually hold police officers accountable, you need to get NYPD discipline out of the NYPD.\"\n\nMedina, who has filed an ongoing federal civil rights lawsuit against Nunez and the city, was angered to learn of all the abuse allegations against Nunez that went unaddressed before their encounter. He also fears that unless the officer faces consequences, there will be more. Once, he told me, he saw Nunez drive by in his patrol car. The two exchanged looks, but no words. He remains nervous about running into him. \"They have not done anything about him,\" Medina said. \"He might behave the same way with somebody else as he did with me. He might even kill someone.\"\n\nMedina's case highlights the frustrating limitations of the recourse process currently available to New Yorkers who have become victims of police abuse, a process that is slow, riddled with bureaucracy, and rendered largely futile by the fact that it is ultimately up to police to hold their own accountable. \"Ultimately, the NYPD has authority over NYPD discipline,\" said Griffard. \"They can do what they want.\"\n\nThe CCRB is the largest civilian oversight agency in the country, employing more than 200 staff, including more than 100 investigators. It has the authority to investigate civilian complaints involving force, abuse of authority, discourtesy, and offensive language, and has recently clarified its jurisdiction to include investigating officers for sexual misconduct and for false statements made on official paperwork or in official proceedings. The board is also currently in the middle of a fraught legal battle between city officials and police unions over the public disclosure of officers' disciplinary records, which state legislators voted to make public when they repealed a controversial law known as \"50-a\" in the aftermath of the Floyd protests. CCRB records offer an unprecedented look at the extent of NYPD abuse over decades, and their release could expose enormous amounts of evidence and testimony that the board has so far been bound to keep under wraps.\n\nThe 34th Precinct where Nunez works is seen in Inwood, New York, on Feb. 23, 2021.\n\nThe CCRB, however, is not empowered to deliver what New Yorkers abused by police most want: justice and accountability. When the board substantiates an allegation, it can recommend disciplining measures for the officers involved. In the most severe cases, attorneys with the CCRB's Administrative Prosecution Unit can also take those officers to trial before an administrative judge, with punishments that can range from loss of vacation days to termination. But the NYPD commissioner maintains the final say over that punishment, and the department has regularly downgraded CCRB discipline recommendations. Sometimes, the NYPD can also take over a case from CCRB prosecutors and assign it to the NYPD's own Department Advocate's Office instead, even as that office's primary responsibility is over misconduct allegations that are raised internally or fall outside the jurisdiction of the board. The NYPD retains the right to prosecute a case internally when it determines that a CCRB prosecution would be \"detrimental to the Police Department's disciplinary process\" or when \"the interests of justice would not be served,\" according to the memorandum of understanding that outlines the process.\n\nIn practice, that means NYPD officers with substantiated complaints of abuse can be prosecuted by other NYPD officers in administrative trials held at the NYPD's headquarters, over which the NYPD commissioner has the last word.\n\nThat's exactly what happened with Nunez. Initially, a CCRB prosecutor was assigned to the case, but then the DAO took over, and Medina and his attorneys have received no updates since then. The CCRB did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"We're just hitting dead ends,\" said Griffard. While there are guidelines detailing how CCRB administrative prosecutions work, and while the NYPD is required to explain its decision to take over a case to the CCRB, the police department is not required to justify that decision publicly or to the person who filed the complaint. That secrecy has left people like Medina in the dark, sometimes for years, about what was happening with their complaint and why.\n\n\"Tomás Medina's story is a perfect example. This horrible thing happened to him, he filed a complaint, and the allegations were substantiated, and two years later, that officer who brutally assaulted him and has assaulted others is still walking around with a badge and a gun,\" said Griffard. \"It's understandable that a lot of people don't have much confidence in the NYPD disciplinary system, including the CCRB process, because it just doesn't lead to tangible results for so many people.\"\n\nFollowing the Floyd protests, city and state lawmakers also tried to strengthen prohibitions against chokeholds. The NYPD patrol guide has unequivocally prohibited the practice since the 1990s, but the department retains the right to review each case to determine whether specific circumstances justified the measure, making the ban largely moot. Following the killing of Garner, the CCRB issued a report which found that the use of chokeholds was increasing despite the prohibition and that the department \"failed to enforce the clear mandate of the Patrol Guide chokehold rule.\"\n\nAfter Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin killed Floyd by kneeling on his neck for more than eight minutes last May, and as outrage resurfaced in New York over the yearslong process to hold Pantaleo accountable for Garner's killing, state legislators voted to ban chokeholds , making them a felony in more severe cases. The New York City Council passed - and then tried to walk back - a law making police chokeholds a misdemeanor . Police have forcefully pushed back against the new restrictions, but advocates are also skeptical and have noted that adding more laws to the books doesn't do much if prosecutors don't enforce them.\n\nMedina's attorneys stressed that while the chokehold Nunez used on him was clearly prohibited, the officer also tased Medina 13 times. That deployment of force is far greater than what might have been necessary to apprehend someone, and they say it amounts to a punitive measure and inhumane treatment. Medina was arrested that day and charged with assault on a police officer as well as resisting arrest and disorderly conduct, but all charges were ultimately dismissed.\n\nThe attorneys also noted that Nunez was a neighborhood coordination officer at the time of the assault, part of a \"community policing\" approach that was introduced following Garner's killing and that the mayor has repeatedly touted as a solution to the city's policing troubles, including after last summer's protests. \"It's really telling that we're still hearing a push for more community policing under different names coming from the de Blasio administration,\" said Griffard. \"It clearly hasn't succeeded when we have officers like detective Nunez, who was working as a neighborhood coordination officer, escalate a noise issue into a brutal, potentially deadly assault.\"\n\nIshita Kala, an associate at the law firm Covington & Burling, who also represented Medina, said that \"it's been very disillusioning for him to see how long this process has been drawn out and the lack of justice that results from it,\" referring to the CCRB investigation. \"What happened to him was truly a brutal assault, and he deserves justice.\"\n\nMost often, that justice comes in the forms of settlements paid out by the city - but little action against the officers themselves. According to Medina's federal complaint, NYPD officers have been accused of using chokeholds in at least 40 federal lawsuits between 2015 and 2018, and the city has settled at least 30 of those at a cost of more than $1.2 million. Because these settlements are not public, the real figure is likely much greater.\n\nMedina still believes that the evidence against Nunez is so overwhelming that he will eventually get his day in court, whether as part of an administrative trial or in the course of his lawsuit. Last November, U.S. District Court Judge Alison Nathan mostly denied an attempt by the city to dismiss the lawsuit, noting \"Detective Nunez's history of the use of excessive force-and the lack of meaningful discipline that resulted from reports of his abuses\" in her ruling.\n\n\"I would like to ask him to his face why he did that to me when there was no justification at all,\" Medina told me. \"It's already been two years and six months. ... It's about time they give me some sort of answer.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Church and State\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nHow the Murder of a CIA Officer Was Used to Silence the Agency's Greatest Critic\n\nO n the night of December 23, 1975, Ron Estes, the CIA's deputy station chief in Athens, was lounging on the couch in his girlfriend's apartment when the man who worked as a driver for his boss, Richard Welch, burst through the front door.\n\n\"A shooting, and Mr. Welch is down,\" the driver yelled.\n\nEstes grabbed his coat and ran outside, ignoring his girlfriend's pleas to stay.\n\nAt Welch's house in the Greek capital, Estes saw the station chief lying on his back on the sidewalk, his wife, Kika, kneeling beside him. Blood covered Welch's face, and Estes could see immediately that he was dead. \"I didn't need to feel for a pulse,\" he said in an interview. A police car arrived, and Estes asked the officer to call an ambulance. When no ambulance arrived, they hauled the body into Welch's car and Estes and Welch's driver followed the police officer, siren blaring and lights flashing, through the streets of Athens to the nearest hospital. A medical team was waiting; they quickly placed Welch on a gurney and took him to an examining room. There, a doctor placed a stethoscope on Welch's chest and confirmed to Estes that he was dead.\n\nWelch was 46 years old. A career CIA officer, he had been the CIA's Athens station chief for six months.\n\nAt the hospital, Welch's driver finally caught his breath and told Estes what had happened. He had driven Welch and his wife home from a Christmas party at the U.S. ambassador's residence, then stopped in front of the walled compound that enclosed Welch's house to open the front gates. As Welch and his wife got out, three armed men in a black car pulled up behind them, burst out of the car, and confronted Welch.\n\n\"Put your hands up!\" one of the men told Welch in Greek.\n\n\"What?\" Welch asked in English.\n\nOne of the gunmen leveled his .45 caliber handgun and fired three times. An autopsy later showed that the first shot hit Welch in the chest, rupturing his aorta and killing him instantly. The three men got back in their car and sped away. That's when Welch's driver rushed to get Estes.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe hospital lobby soon filled with journalists, who had most likely heard about the shooting by monitoring the city's police radio. Estes realized that many of them already seemed to know that Welch had been the CIA's station chief. Steven Roberts, a New York Times reporter in Athens who covered Welch's murder, wrote the next day that he had been talking with Welch at the ambassador's Christmas party an hour before the shooting.\n\nA spokesperson from the U.S. Embassy arrived, and Estes slipped away from the crowd of reporters. The police found the gunmen's car, which had been stolen, abandoned several blocks from Welch's home.\n\nBack at the CIA station, Estes sent cables to CIA headquarters and talked on a secure phone with a top agency official. \"When I finished briefing him, he said, 'I could only hear about half of what you said.'\" Estes recalled. \"'Send me a cable repeating what you said immediately. We've got to go to the president.'\"\n\nAn undated photograph of Athens station chief Richard Welch before his death in 1975. Photo: The Boston Globe, 1975 Welch's assassination was huge news and struck a painful political nerve in Washington, coming at the end of a year of stunning disclosures about the CIA and the rest of the U.S. intelligence community by the Senate's Church Committee, which, throughout 1975, had been conducting the first major congressional investigation of the CIA. The Church Committee uncovered so many secrets and generated so many headlines that pundits were already calling 1975 \"the Year of Intelligence.\"\n\nAn undated photograph of Athens station chief Richard Welch before his death in 1975.\n\nBefore the Church Committee was created in January 1975, there had been no real congressional oversight of the CIA. The House and Senate Intelligence Committees did not yet exist, and the Church Committee's unprecedented investigation marked the first effort by Congress to unearth decades of abusive and illegal acts secretly committed by the CIA - and to curb its power.\n\nSen. Frank Church, the liberal Democrat from Idaho who chaired the committee, had come to believe that the future of American democracy was threatened by the rise of a permanent and largely unaccountable national security state, and he sensed that at the heart of that secret government was a lawless intelligence community. Church was convinced it had to be reined in to save the nation.\n\nTo a great degree, he succeeded. By disclosing a series of shocking abuses of power and spearheading wide-ranging reforms, Church and his Committee created rules of the road for the intelligence community that largely remain in place today. More than anyone else in American history, Church is responsible for bringing the CIA, the FBI, the National Security Agency, and the rest of the government's intelligence apparatus under the rule of law.\n\nBut first, Church and his committee had to withstand a brutal counterattack launched by a Republican White House and the CIA, both of which wanted to blunt Church's reform efforts. The White House and CIA quickly realized that the Welch killing, which occurred just as the Church Committee was finishing its investigations and preparing its final report and recommendations for reform, could be used as a political weapon. President Gerald Ford's White House and the agency falsely sought to blame the Church Committee for Welch's murder, claiming, without any evidence, that its investigations had somehow exposed Welch's identity and left him vulnerable to assassination.\n\nThere was absolutely no truth to the claims, but the disinformation campaign was effective. The Ford administration's use of the Welch murder to discredit the Church Committee was a model of propaganda and disinformation; an internal CIA history later praised the \"skillful steps\" that the agency and the White House \"took to exploit the Welch murder to U.S. intelligence benefit.\"\n\nThe Welch case has long since served as a classic example of how to exploit and weaponize intelligence for political purposes. The George W. Bush administration's efforts to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq by claiming that Saddam Hussein was behind 9/11; the Republican obsession with the 2012 attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, and their use of it to discredit then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; and Donald Trump's efforts to portray himself as the victim of a \"deep state\" conspiracy can all be traced back to the way U.S. leaders exploited Welch's 1975 killing.\n\nThe White House and CIA were aided in their propaganda campaign by the fact that Estes did not go public at the time with his account of what really happened in Athens. Now, nearly 50 years later, Estes has finally broken his silence. In interviews for our new book, \" The Last Honest Man ,\" he talked in detail about the murder and its causes with a journalist for the first time, supplying new evidence that Welch's assassination stemmed from the toxic politics of Athens - not Washington.\n\nGreek Cyprist demonstrators storm the gate of the U.S. Embassy as police fire tear gas on Aug. 19, 1974. Photo: Bettmann Archive W elch's killing was a direct result of the feverish political climate that gripped Greece in the mid-1970s. In July 1974, the right-wing military junta that ruled Greece backed a coup in Cyprus to oust the island's president and create a union between Greece and Cyprus. Making Cyprus fully Greek was a longtime objective of Greek right-wing ultranationalists, but the move immediately prompted a Turkish invasion of Cyprus. Greek junta leader Dimitris Ioannidis bitterly blamed the United States for not stopping the Turkish invasion.\n\nGreek Cyprist demonstrators storm the gate of the U.S. Embassy as police fire tear gas on Aug. 19, 1974.\n\nGreek hostility toward the United States spread. On August 19, 1974, a pro-Greek mob attacked the U.S. embassy in Nicosia, Cyprus, and both U.S. Ambassador Rodger Davies and a local embassy employee were killed. After a ceasefire, Cyprus was divided into Greek and Turkish zones; the disastrous outcome of the coup in Cyprus later led to the collapse of the military junta in Athens. But anger in Greece toward the United States continued unabated.\n\nThe relationship between the CIA and Greece's Central Intelligence Service, known as the KYP, was also poisoned. Soon, someone had leaked the names of Welch and a few other officers in the CIA's Athens station to the Greek press.\n\nIn November 1975, Welch's name and home address were published in English language and Greek language newspapers in Athens. The information \"was obviously leaked by hostile KYP officers,\" Estes said in the interview, \"because the only names leaked were those in liaison contact with KYP.\" (CIA overseas stations often included officers who were in liaison contact with the intelligence service of the local country - their identities as CIA officers thus declared to the service so they could meet with them and trade intelligence - and others who were not identified so they could spy without the knowledge of the local government.)\n\nWelch was not hard to find; he lived in a luxurious villa that had been the official residence of the CIA station chief for decades. After his name and home address were published in the press, Estes talked to him about whether he should move. But Welch and Estes concluded that the threat was minimal. \"We both agreed that political assassination was not part of the fabric of Greek history or culture,\" Estes recalled.\n\nIt was a fatal miscalculation. Welch's murder was carried out by a new, extremely violent Greek leftist guerrilla organization called 17 November. While right-wing Greek nationalists hated the United States for betraying Greece over Cyprus, left-wing Greeks blamed the United States for helping to install the military junta in Athens in 1967. The 17 November group was named for an anti-junta protest by students that was brutally broken up on November 17, 1973. Welch was 17 November's first target. (The group continued to conduct terrorist attacks in Greece, including the murders of other American officials, until it was finally crushed in 2002.)\n\nEstes reported the truth back to CIA headquarters: that Welch had been murdered by Greek terrorists after being publicly exposed by the KYP, the Greek intelligence service. His story was buried in the service of a more helpful political narrative.\n\nAfter Welch's murder, emotions were running high in the CIA station in Athens. On the night of the assassination, Estes had to restrain another CIA officer after he grabbed a pistol and threatened to seek revenge by killing the KGB's Athens Rezident, Welch's Soviet counterpart.\n\nWelch's murder hit Estes hard as well. He and Welch had come up through the ranks of the agency together, and by 1975, they were close friends who met to play chess every Sunday. Welch and Estes had previously served together in Cyprus, and they understood the island's status as a battlefield in the long-running conflict between Turkey and Greece. While serving in Cyprus, Estes said, Welch had recruited the personal secretary of Cypriot President Makarios III to spy for the CIA.\n\nEstes was eager to solve his friend's murder, without waiting for the Greek police. At the time, he didn't know about the new leftist 17 November organization since Welch's killing was its first operation. Instead, Estes focused his investigation on a right-wing terrorist group.\n\nHe and other CIA officers in Athens grilled their local sources and found that a gunman associated with a Greek-Cypriot right-wing paramilitary group known as EOKA had left Athens on a flight to Nicosia, Cyprus, the day after Welch's killing. The gunman was known to have killed people in Cyprus with a .45 handgun - the same kind of weapon used to kill Welch.\n\nWhen he worked in Cyprus years earlier, Estes had recruited an EOKA hitman to work for the CIA. \"When I left Cyprus, he told me that whenever the CIA wanted something done that it didn't want to do itself, call me,\" recalled Estes. \"So, after Welch was killed, I sent a case officer to Nicosia to meet him and tell him that Ron Estes sent him.\"\n\nThe CIA officer asked the Cypriot agent if he knew the EOKA killer who had flown from Athens to Cyprus the day after Welch's murder. The hitman said he did. The CIA officer told the hitman to go meet the man and ask him if he'd killed Welch.\n\nThe hitman reported that, when he confronted the EOKA killer, the other man was so scared that he offered to plead his innocence to the CIA himself. An American case officer then met with the man in Laranca, Cyprus, where he passed a CIA-administered polygraph.\n\nEstes's conviction that Welch had been exposed by the KYP and murdered by Greek terrorists, and the fact that CIA officers were conducting their own murder investigation on the ground in Cyprus, were not made public in Washington at the time. That information would only have gotten in the way of the campaign to exploit Welch's murder to discredit the Church Committee.\n\nSen. Frank Church, D-Idaho, chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence speaks to the press in Washington, D.C., on July 22, 1975.\n\nBy late 1975, Ford and the CIA were both worried about their public standing. The Church Committee's disclosures of intelligence abuses had weakened the CIA, and the White House was concerned about the political impact of the committee's disclosures on Ford, the first commander-in-chief who had never been elected either president or vice president. Ford had been the obscure House minority leader in 1973 when he was chosen as vice president under the 25th Amendment by then-President Richard Nixon and Congress. Ford replaced Spiro Agnew, who had been forced to resign amid a corruption scandal; he became president when the Watergate scandal forced Nixon to resign in August 1974. Ford was headed into a tough presidential election campaign in 1976, and he wasn't even assured of winning the Republican nomination. He faced a formidable challenge on the right from former California Gov. Ronald Reagan, and so Ford was eager to prove his conservative bona fides.\n\nNow, with Welch's assassination, the White House and CIA quickly realized they had been handed a political gift - a martyred hero whose death they could lay at the feet of liberal Democrat Church.\n\nLargely through innuendo, the White House and the CIA blamed the Church Committee for Welch's death, claiming that its investigations had somehow led to his exposure.\n\nIt didn't matter that Welch's murder had nothing to do with the Church Committee. It didn't matter that Estes had told CIA headquarters that the Greek intelligence service had leaked Welch's name and address to the Greek press as revenge for U.S. policy in Cyprus. Largely through innuendo, the White House and the CIA blamed the Church Committee for Welch's death, claiming that its investigations had somehow led to his exposure.\n\nThe day after Welch's murder, Welch's father, who had been living in Athens with his son, asked Estes to see if Welch could be buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Welch had never served in the military, so burial at Arlington would require a special exemption.\n\nEstes says he cabled CIA headquarters about the request, and Ford quickly gave his approval. That led to a grand political moment, stage-managed by the White House.\n\nA U.S. Air Force plane flew Welch's body from Athens to Washington. Welch's son, a Marine lieutenant wearing his dress blues, accompanied his father's body on the flight. The plane delayed its landing, circling Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington for 45 minutes so its arrival could be broadcast live during the morning network television news programs.\n\nDaniel Schorr, a CBS News correspondent who covered the event, wrote in his personal journal, which was published in Rolling Stone in 1976, that \"the public relations people explain that the big cargo plane, already overhead, will stay in a holding pattern and land at 7 a.m. so that it will be available for live televising on network morning news programs. We do in fact carry it live on the CBS Morning News.\"\n\nWelch's January 6, 1976, funeral service at Arlington was attended by Ford, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, and CIA director William Colby. No president had ever before attended the funeral of a slain CIA officer.\n\nAfter the funeral service, Ford stood beside Welch's widow while Welch's coffin was placed on a horse-drawn caisson. \"We watch, and film ... the same caisson that carried the body of President Kennedy, the folded flag given to the widow by Colby,\" wrote Schorr in his journal.\n\nCIA director William Colby, third from left, stands with the family of Richard Welch at his funeral on Jan. 6, 1976.\n\n\"It is the CIA's first public national hero,\" Schorr wrote. \"I have a sense that Welch, dead, has one more service to render the CIA. He will be turned into a symbol in the gathering counter-offensive against disclosure.\"\n\nWhile Ford, Kissinger, and Colby attended Welch's funeral, the FBI was investigating a death threat against Church in retaliation for Welch's murder, sent by a group calling itself Veterans Against Communist Sympathizers.\n\nAnother prominent Washington official also attended Welch's funeral: George Herbert Walker Bush, who had just been nominated to succeed Colby as CIA director. Ford had chosen Bush after firing Colby, who Ford believed had cooperated too readily with the Church Committee's inquiries. The opening battle between the White House, the CIA, and Church would be fought over Bush's confirmation in the Senate.\n\nChurch saw Bush's nomination as an effort by Ford to put a partisan hack at the CIA, someone who would do the bidding of the White House just as Congress was seeking to curb the agency's abuses. Church viewed Bush's nomination as a direct attack on the Church Committee.\n\nThe chance to be CIA director came at a critical moment in Bush's career. Until then, he had a poor record in elected politics. He won a House seat from Texas and served two terms but then lost a campaign for the Senate in 1970. After that, Bush started to rise in the Republican ranks through a series of appointed positions. He served as chair of the Republican National Committee during Watergate, a job that forced him to make repeated public excuses for Nixon but earned him credit for party loyalty. He also served as United Nations ambassador under Nixon and as head of the U.S. Liaison Office in China under Ford.\n\nFord was considering Bush to be his running mate in 1976; the job as CIA director seemed like a stepping stone. But first, Bush had to get past Frank Church.\n\nEven as he was still working on his committee's investigations and reports, Church went all out to block Bush's confirmation. On December 16, 1975, Church testified as a witness against Bush during his confirmation hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Bush's confirmation was \"ill-advised,\" Church told the committee, because of his partisan political background and because he had refused to rule out running as vice president in 1976. Church complained that the White House was using the CIA as a \"grooming room\" for Bush \"before he is brought on stage next year as a vice presidential running mate.\"\n\nBut Welch's murder quickly changed the political calculus of the confirmation fight in favor of Bush - and against Church.\n\nThe White House and CIA followed a subtle but effective strategy to use the Welch murder to help get Bush confirmed, while also poisoning the political climate for Church and his Committee. Immediately after Welch's murder, the CIA sought to blame the Fifth Estate, a left-wing group based in Washington that published Counter Spy, a small left-wing magazine that had previously printed long lists of CIA officials' names, including Welch's when he served in Peru. Agency officials also blamed Philip Agee, a former CIA officer who had just published \"Inside the Company,\" a controversial book that had listed the names of hundreds of CIA officers and agents.\n\nMany observers saw the CIA's efforts to blame Counter Spy and Agee as a way to shift the blame for Welch's murder from Greek terrorists to the CIA's American critics. And if the public inferred that those American critics also included Church and his committee, so be it.\n\nConservative pundits quickly made the link explicit. In early January 1976, right-wing columnist Smith Hempstone wrote that the blame for Welch's murder should be shared by \"the congressional committees that for nearly a year have been holding the CIA up to ridicule and verbal abuse.\" Around the same time, an anonymous, pro-CIA newsletter, the Pink Sheet, called Welch's murder \"a tragic reminder of a very basic truth: There are individuals and organizations in this country whose activities are aiding the enemies of the U.S. Are we to be impotent against such fifth columnists in our midst? Please write to your congressman and senators and ask what they propose to do about this increasingly dangerous problem. Instead of harming our internal security agencies, Senator Frank Church and his colleagues should be investigating outfits like the Fifth Estate.\" The Pink Sheet's diatribe was included in CIA files and publicly released by the CIA among other documents declassified in 2004. It is not clear whether the newsletter was published by someone affiliated with the CIA.\n\nMeanwhile, former CIA officers began to make themselves available to the press to attack Church. One of them, Mike Ackerman, told reporters that the Church Committee shared the blame for Welch's death, adding that the committee should have conducted its investigations without publicly disclosing agency operations.\n\nNew York Times columnist Anthony Lewis saw through the unfolding White House-CIA strategy.\n\n\"Understandably, the Welch case has brought to a boil the resentment felt by CIA veterans at critics of the agency,\" Lewis wrote . \"But it is another matter entirely to use the murder of Richard Welch as a political device, as President Ford and his national security assistants are evidently trying to do now.\"\n\nColby's \"denunciation [of Fifth Estate] plainly had a larger purpose: to make the case that the CIA needs more secrecy in general than it has been getting lately,\" Lewis wrote. \"President Ford and his colleagues, judging by their recent comments, hope to prevent any thoroughgoing reform of the CIA. They will use the Welch case to that end, in particular to resist limits on covert action and to reduce congressional scrutiny.\"\n\nThe Washington Star's Norman Kempster agreed, noting that \"only a few hours after the CIA's Athens station chief was gunned down in front of his home, the agency began a subtle campaign intended to persuade Americans that his death was the indirect result of congressional investigations and the direct result of an article in an obscure magazine. The nation's press, by and large, swallowed the bait.\"\n\nThe campaign by the White House and the CIA to exploit Welch's murder ensured Bush's confirmation as CIA director. On January 27, 1976, Bush sailed through the Senate on a vote of 64-27. Ford made only one concession to the Senate before the vote: He announced that Bush would not be his running mate in 1976.\n\nFour years later, Bush was elected vice president on the ticket with Reagan.\n\nThe false narrative that Welch had been murdered because of reckless disclosures in Washington remained powerful for years afterward, ultimately leading to legislation that made it illegal to publish the names of covert CIA officers, a law that has since often been abused by the government to crack down on whistleblowers and dissent.\n\nCIA director William Colby, left, arrives for questioning by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence accompanied by George Cary, legislative counsel for the CIA, on May 21, 1975.\n\nAfter Welch's murder, public support for the Church Committee waned. Church was stunned by the sudden reversal of the political climate and angered that Bush continued to push the false story around Welch's killing even after he became CIA director.\n\nDuring one closed hearing of the Church Committee soon after Bush had been confirmed, \"Bush blurted out, 'You were responsible for Welch's assassination,'\" recalled Fritz Schwarz, the Church Committee's chief counsel. \"It pissed off everybody. We forced Bush to apologize during the hearing.\" Still, the Bush family continued to push false narratives about the Welch murder for years. In the 1990s, Agee, the former CIA officer, sued Barbara Bush for libel after she wrote in her memoir that Welch had been killed after Agee's book blew his cover. The suit was dropped in 1997 after Bush acknowledged that Agee's book was not responsible for Welch's assassination.\n\nMeanwhile, Church also had to convince other senators, whose support for his committee was wavering in the face of the White House and CIA disinformation campaign, that his investigation was not responsible for Welch's murder.\n\n\"One of the things we did was tell other senators that we didn't reveal Welch's name,\" recalls former Church Committee staffer Loch Johnson. \"We had to make it clear to other senators that we had nothing to do with it.\"\n\nThe controversy over Welch's murder hit just as Church was about to launch his own bid to run for president in 1976. After the Church Committee had completed its investigations, Church announced his candidacy in March 1976. But by waiting until the committee's work was done, Church started off far behind the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter. Still, Church surprisingly won several primaries before dropping out and became a leading contender to be Carter's running mate. When Carter instead chose Walter Mondale, a Democratic senator from Minnesota, Church began to suspect that CIA officials had worked behind the scenes to torpedo his selection. Church confided to his son that, just before the Democratic convention in New York, he'd gotten a call from the CIA saying the agency had been told that The Economist magazine was going to publish a story revealing that the Church Committee had been infiltrated by the KGB.\n\n\"Can you imagine any rumor more certain to spook a presidential candidate than that his prospective vice president has overseen an operation which was infiltrated by the KGB?\" Church told his son, Forrest, who recounted the conversation in his 1985 memoir.\n\nIt turned out that the reporter the CIA had told Church was writing the story did not exist, and no story was ever published. \"Church's feeling that he had been sandbagged by the CIA might have been an illusion,\" Forrest Church wrote. \"One thing is certain, however. There is no member of the Senate whom the leaders of our intelligence services would have less preferred sitting a heartbeat away from the presidency.\"\n\nFormer Church staffer Peter Fenn corroborated that account: \"We talked a good deal about the CIA torpedoing him.\"\n\nT he CIA's hatred of Church didn't end in 1976.\n\nIn 1980, Church was facing a tough reelection campaign in Idaho. As the election loomed, Rep. Steve Symms, a hard-right Republican who represented Idaho's first congressional district, appeared the most likely candidate to run against him. Symms, whose family owned a large fruit ranch near Caldwell, Idaho, had been plotting to take on Church for years. He had even urged Bob Smith, his friend and chief of staff, to run against Church in 1974 as a stalking horse.\n\nBut just in case Symms had any last-minute doubts, James Jesus Angleton, the CIA's former chief of counterintelligence, stepped in to give him a push.\n\nRelated Documents Reveal the Complex Legacy of James Angleton, CIA Counterintelligence Chief and Godfather of Mass Surveillance\n\nAngleton felt he had been humiliated by being forced to testify in public before the Church Committee, and Church was at the top of his personal enemies list. In the late 1970s, Angleton, who was originally from Idaho, began meeting with Symms to convince him to run against Church.\n\n\"He was from Boise, and he really despised Frank Church,\" Symms said in an interview. \"He used to come over to see me in the House,\" he added. Angleton would recount to Symms all the damage he claimed Church had wrought on the CIA, Symms said, and then Angleton would say, \"You should run against Church.\"\n\n\"I got exposed to that [intelligence] stuff through Angleton,\" Symms added. \"I still remember him coming over to my office and sitting on my couch, and he would smoke one cigarette after another. He would kind of put his leg up and talk to me on intelligence. He wanted Church defeated.\"\n\nSymms beat Church in 1980, which was cause for celebration in CIA circles.\n\n\"After I won the Senate race, I was invited to a party at someone's house and I was just about the only person there who was not former intelligence,\" Symms recalled. \"It was quite impressive to meet all these people and see how deeply they all despised Church.\"\n\nThis article was adapted from \" The Last Honest Man: The CIA, the FBI, the Mafia, and the Kennedys - and One Senator's Fight to Save Democracy \" by James Risen with Thomas Risen, which will be published on May 9, 2023, by Little, Brown and Company, an imprint of Hachette Book Group, Inc.

      "text": "A New Police Force Chased a 17-Year-Old Boy to His Death. Then It Vanished.\n\nBraven Glenn Photo courtesy Blossom Old Bull\n\nBy Samantha Michaels; Film by Mark Helenowski; Photography by Tailyr Irvine March+April 2024 Issue\n\nCruising south down a two-lane highway in Montana, Braven Glenn looked out onto the open road, the evening sky chilly and dark. It was November 24, 2020-half a year into the pandemic and three months after his 17th birthday. He was a good student, on his way to pick up his girlfriend, a basketball player like him, at her house on the Crow Indian Reservation.\n\nMost days, Braven took his time while driving; his friends sometimes teased him for staying below the speed limit. But lately he hadn't been feeling like himself-not since his grandma died from Covid weeks earlier. On this particular night, when a car ahead of him sat at around 60 mph in a 70 mph zone, he signaled and passed it, slowing again to the speed limit after crossing back over the dotted yellow line.\n\nThen lights flashed behind him. The car he'd passed belonged to a white cop from the reservation's brand-new tribal police department. Headquartered inside a former Subway restaurant, the department had launched just five months earlier with Covid relief funding-an attempt by the tribal nation's chairman to address crime and a huge deficit of federal police.\n\nThe officer called dispatch to report a speeding driver, according to law enforcement records, even though Braven wasn't speeding when she activated her siren.\n\nA chase began.\n\nWithin 70 seconds, his car was struck by a train.\n\nMore than two years later, on a Sunday evening in May 2023, Braven's mother, Blossom Old Bull, took a deep breath as she parked her Honda Odyssey on the side of the highway near the site of the wreck. Together we walked through knee-high grass toward the railroad. \"This is what's left of it,\" she said, bending over to show me a scrap of burned metal. A suspension spring, a radiator, and a wheel also lay nearby.\n\nOld Bull tilted up one of the rims to get a better look, exposing a tattoo with Braven's name on her forearm. She often drove out of her way to make sure the memorial for him was still standing there, a cross with his basketball jersey draped over it.\n\nIt had been difficult for her to move forward after the crash; she still had so many questions about what happened. According to interviews, public records requests, and court documents from a lawsuit over Braven's death, a Crow couple who had pulled over at the wreck site said Braven was denied medical care for a half-hour as he begged for help. The cop who chased him, moonlighting from her job as a Veterans Affairs security officer, left the scene with a crucial piece of evidence: her patrol vehicle. Someone broke into the police headquarters, and the incident report went missing along with records from other cases. Two or three days after the crash, the entire police force disbanded , offering the community-and Braven's family-no explanation. When Old Bull went to the department for answers, she found a locked door and windows taped over with white paper. \"Everybody just up and left,\" she recalled.\n\nSubscribe to Mother Jones podcasts on Apple Podcasts or your favorite podcast app. The disappearance of a new police department so soon after the wreck was highly unusual, the kind of story you might never hear twice. But other parts of Braven's story were deeply familiar: unanswered questions after deaths on the reservation, inadequate law enforcement. Before 2020, the federal government controlled policing in the Crow Nation-providing only a handful of officers for an area two-thirds the size of Connecticut. Crimes went unsolved , grieving relatives complained of faulty investigations, and some victims wouldn't even call for help, fearing violence by officers. (Nationally, police kill Native Americans at higher rates than other people of color.) The Crow's tribal police department was a desperately needed but underfunded counterbalance to a federal system that isn't working. And Braven was caught up in the dysfunction. So, too, was Old Bull. After the tribal cops disappeared, it felt like nobody in power would talk to her, like nobody noticed the life that was lost or took responsibility for it. \"They come on Native land and they kill, and they just walk away. They think nobody is gonna care,\" she said as she drove home from the train tracks, the sun almost set, the clouds a deep blue behind her. \"I think they thought that's how our family was gonna be-that we were gonna let this go.\" \"They didn't expect us to speak out and try to get answers,\" she added. Blossom Old Bull in her home in Crow Agency, Montana The Crow tribe has about 13,400 members, most of whom live on or around the reservation in southeastern Montana, a lush landscape with towering mountains, open skies, and rivers teeming with trout. The tribal nation earns some revenue from its vast coal and oil reserves. Most people speak Crow as a first language, and the matrilineal clan system remains strong. Braven and his mom moved to the reservation when he was in eighth grade. Old Bull, a single mom and health care worker from South Dakota, is Lakota, not Crow, and she'd been raising Braven in New Mexico; he was her youngest boy, the eighth of nine siblings. But she wanted him to grow up closer to his father, who was Crow, and some of his older brothers and sisters, and to learn more about that part of his Native heritage. When she'd spent time on the reservation previously, she recalled families camping in teepees for Crow Fair, an annual celebration with a powwow and horse racing and a rodeo, or enjoying the Sun Dance and sweat lodges. Braven hadn't wanted to move away from Albuquerque. He was a sensitive kid, and he cried in 2017 when he learned he'd have to leave his basketball team behind. In Montana, the family settled in the town of Crow Agency in a shabby one-story house that they spruced up with fresh paint. It was a rough transition; weeks after they arrived, Braven's dad died from pneumonia after a struggle with alcoholism. Braven, only 13 years old, stood at his bedside the day they pulled him off life support. I know you weren't there for me because you were sick , he said, but I still love you. \"He was such a good-hearted person, to even think in those terms at that age,\" says his sister Marissa. Braven did his best to settle into the bunkbed room he now shared with his older brother Emilio, who played basketball with him on the corner courts. He grew closer with his half siblings' grandmother, who adopted him as her own grandson. He loved spending time at her house and would offer to drive her to appointments, help her carry groceries, and put the pots away on the top shelf of her kitchen. Braven was an honor-roll student who ran cross country and track and played JV basketball. Though he hadn't wanted to move to the reservation, it didn't take long for Braven to hit his stride. His cousin Jayden remembers how quickly Braven made friends: \"I left for the summer and came back and everyone knew him. He was really popular.\" \"He had a goofy personality,\" says his girlfriend, Jordan Jefferson. As the years passed, Braven excelled-an honor-roll student who ran cross country and track and played JV basketball, and who was unanimously chosen by his teammates to co-manage the varsity squad, which he hoped to eventually join himself, running miles most days to get in better shape. \"He was one of a kind and always ready to take the challenge,\" says Mike Beads Don't Mix, his freshman coach. But the pandemic marked the start of a shift after Braven's high school switched to remote learning and he couldn't see his friends much. In August 2020, the month he was turning 17, his grandma got Covid; she fell into a coma and was unable to sing him \"Happy Birthday\" like she normally did. Weeks later, she was dead. \"He took it really hard\" and \"got a little more distant from all of us,\" his sister JoLee remembers. In his bedroom, Braven played his grandma's favorite song, \"Blue Ain't Your Color\" by Keith Urban, over and over. His grades slipped, and he started drinking more. The week of Braven's birthday, Old Bull found him passed out on a couch at his older brother's house. He lashed out at her after she roused him, and she called the cops, hoping they might teach him a lesson. The police arrested him for disorderly conduct and took him to juvenile detention in Billings, about an hour away. \"My mom, she had to raise all these kids on her own, so I guess you could say she's tough, but not mean,\" Emilio says. \"She's loving, she'd get us a bunch of basketball shoes, but she's gonna give you the tough love you need to succeed in this world.\" \"But you need to learn now, Braven, that if somebody needs to call the cops on you, this is what will happen.\" When Braven returned three days later, now on probation, he hugged Old Bull and gave her a letter he'd written apologizing for the incident. \"I never want to leave your side again,\" he wrote. \"I know everybody in our family is disappointed in me...I was crying while writing this letter just because I realized how bad I hurt you.\" He told Old Bull that on his way to detention, an arresting officer from the Crow tribal police \"choked [him] out,\" according to court records, and that it had scared him, reaffirming all the bad stories he'd heard about law enforcement: His cousin Jayden once watched a cop push his uncle's head into the concrete, and they both remembered when officers at Crow Fair beat Braven's 15-year-old cousin Esaias Stops Pretty Places. This is why I didn't want to call the police , Old Bull told him. \"But you need to learn now, Braven, that if somebody needs to call the cops on you,\" she added, \"this is what will happen.\" Tattoos in memory of her son Braven Glenn adorn Blossom Old Bull's forearm. For centuries before the Europeans arrived, the Crow had no police. Instead, warrior groups protected people and enforced laws like the rules of the buffalo hunt. \"There's a big difference between a warrior and a cop,\" says Crow historian Alden Big Man Jr., who has studied the tribe's traditional systems of justice. Warriors' punishments could be harsh, including things like burning down a person's home or killing his horses, but if the offender responded favorably, the warriors would compensate his loss, perhaps giving him as many horses as had been taken away. In the 1800s, the federal government confined the Crow, also known as the Apsáalooke, to the reservation; white settlers often shot at people who tried to leave. The tribe's nomadic hunters and gatherers were forced to become sedentary farmers and to accept Christianity, learn English, and educate their kids in the colonizers' way. As railroads brought white ranchers into their grazing areas and banks denied Crows loans, the former warriors were \"reduced to begging for handouts during ration days,\" according to Big Man, while they \"witnessed a complete annihilation of the buffalo, as well as the disappearance of a whole way of life.\" In 1887, after a Crow man led a war party off the reservation to steal horses, a colonial agent sent the party to jail. \"It was right then and there,\" says Big Man, that in the Crow Nation \"the system changed from warrior societies to the government enforcing the law.\" Around that time, the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) began appointing Native officers to police reservations-ordering them to prohibit traditional rituals that the colonizers viewed as immoral, ration food and other supplies, and stop any activities that might interfere with white economic pursuits. In 1885, Congress had taken away Native nations' right to prosecute serious crimes like homicides committed by Native people against other Natives on reservations. (US lawmakers were outraged that a Sioux government in South Dakota had punished a killer according to its own principles of justice -rather than the death penalty, it had fined him $600, eight horses, and a blanket.) Instead, murders and other violent offenses would be investigated by federal agents, some of whom traveled long distances to tribal territories and had little to no long-standing relationship with the people who lived there. Nearly a century later, as activists from the American Indian Movement protested police brutality and rising crime, Congress passed the 1975 Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act , which created a path for tribes to take back more control of law enforcement. If tribal nations were able to jump through the hoops needed to secure a contract with the BIA, they could divert federal dollars intended for BIA cops to their own tribal police. \"It was a real game-changer,\" says Lauren van Schilfgaarde, an Indian law scholar who is Cochiti Pueblo and previously directed UCLA's Tribal Legal Development Clinic. Tribes have since set up more than 200 law enforcement agencies on reservations, far surpassing the number of BIA agencies. But many tribes were not able to get a contract, including the Crow, and those that have tribal police still lack jurisdiction over major crimes. In 1978, the Supreme Court also removed their ability to prosecute non-Natives, even for most minor crimes. \"Even if you have infinite dollars, if your police departments have questionable, shaky, or even no authority over any person within their territorial boundaries, that compromises the entire enterprise,\" van Schilfgaarde says. The federal government, meanwhile, skimped on funding for reservation cops, much as it skimped on health care, education, housing, and rural infrastructure. By 2001, violent crime on reservations was double or triple the national average. \"Ultimately, you are of your environment,\" Aaron Brien, a historian for the Crow tribe, says in the recent documentary Murder in Big Horn . \"When you take an entire society and strip them of any confidence and self-worth they have, it becomes very fragile.\" Tribes barely had half the policing resources per capita as non-Native communities: While Baltimore, Detroit, New York City, and DC had between four and seven officers per thousand residents, few tribal departments had ratios of more than two officers per thousand residents. As some communities of color protested overpolicing in cities, says van Schilfgaarde, reservations suffered the opposite extreme, coupled with a lack of resources to address public safety through other means like addiction treatment, employment, and schooling. \"It's incredibly frustrating and dangerous,\" she says. Under the Obama administration, Congress passed the Tribal Law and Order Act , creating a commission to study the problem. The commission, which included Republican and Democratic lawmakers along with Indian law experts, recommended the federal government pay to nearly double the number of reservation police-noting that crime dropped by more than one-third on four reservations that hired extra cops during a pilot program in 2009. The tribes themselves, instead of the BIA, should lead the police, the commission argued; this change would help build trust with the community and more closely reflect tribal priorities and customs. \"Public safety in Indian Country can improve dramatically once Native nations and Tribes have greater freedom to build and maintain their own criminal justice systems,\" the commission wrote , describing the federal policing system as \"a maze of injustice.\" The commission set a goal of 2024 to \"close the public safety gap\" on reservations. But by 2018, the number of BIA-funded officers on reservations hadn't grown at all-in fact, it had fallen by about one-third. Carole Goldberg, a commission member appointed by Obama, says Trump's administration seemed more focused on approving oil pipelines on Native land than on reforming reservation law enforcement. By 2020, the BIA estimated tribes needed $1.4 billion to handle policing nationally but admitted it was only providing $246 million, almost the same budget as a decade earlier. (The Department of Justice provided less than $100 million.) \"It's like working with strings and tin cans at times,\" Robert Bryant, chief of police for the Penobscot Nation, had testified to the commission. During parts of that year, the Crow Nation had just four BIA police to cover an expanse of 3,500 square miles. BIA cops were stretched so thin that \"we were pulling 18-hour days\" and \"going months without a day off,\" says Josie Passes, a former officer who wrote a letter to members of Congress begging for backup. A perceived lack of accountability contributed to a climate of fear. \"When you start thinking about it,\" says Birdie Real Bird, 70, a lifelong Crow resident whose aunt was assaulted during a home break-in and never received a visit from police, \"you're a sitting duck.\" \"When our Native women and girls go missing, law enforcement chooses to do nothing, and it's up to the family members to do the hard work of investigating.\" Add to that the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, an international problem that's particularly severe in the Crow Nation, where girls are sometimes sex-trafficked and used as drug mules along Interstate 90. Seventy-four people disappeared on the Crow and neighboring Northern Cheyenne reservations in 2019-more than any other area of Montana, which has one of the highest rates of missing Indigenous women nationally. One of them was Braven's cousin Kaysera Stops Pretty Places , an 18-year-old who loved to sing, dance, run, and wrestle. Five days after she disappeared, the sheriff's office found her body face down in a fenced backyard, but the office didn't notify her family for nearly two weeks. Four and a half years later, her cause of death remains undetermined . Families of the missing often complain about poor transparency and inadequate investigations, and jurisdictional barriers make the situation worse. The BIA can't arrest people for crimes committed off the reservation, even in border towns like Hardin, where Kaysera died. And on the reservation, other agencies-like the FBI or the sheriff's office-might have jurisdiction depending on the type of offense and whether the perpetrator was Native. Because it's often unclear whether a crime took place on or off the reservation and who the perpetrator was, it's easy for law enforcement to avoid responsibility. When corpses are discovered, investigators regularly write off the deaths as accidental. Commonly, \"when our Native women and girls go missing,\" says Mary Kathryn Nagle, a Cherokee attorney who assisted Kaysera's relatives, \"law enforcement chooses to do nothing, and it's up to the family members to do the hard work of investigating.\" \"When you start thinking about it, you're a sitting duck.\" By 2019, the Crow reservation was desperate for a change. In August, one of the few BIA cops there-the police chief, no less-quit in protest of his agency's understaffing. That November, Crow Chairman AJ Not Afraid, the tribe's chief executive, issued an emergency declaration over the shortage of police. Days later, he traveled to DC with other Native leaders to discuss the issue with President Trump, whose administration was announcing Operation Lady Justice, an initiative to improve the federal response to tribes' missing-persons cases. Some Indigenous critics described the effort as uninformed. Trump, for his part, seemed fixated on the Crow chairman's name. \"Is it true-you're not afraid? Are you not afraid of anything?\" Trump asked, laughing. On New Year's Day 2020, Not Afraid's 16-year-old niece, Selena Not Afraid, went missing at a rest stop between Hardin and Billings. A search party, which included Braven, scoured the surrounding fields with ATVs, helicopters, horses, dogs, and drones. Three weeks later, a team from the Interior Department discovered her body less than a mile away. Her death was attributed to hypothermia, but some locals suspected foul play. Selena's sister had previously died in a hit-and-run, and her brother was killed by the Billings police. \"The Crow Tribe,\" Not Afraid had said in his emergency declaration, \"will no longer accept 'lip service' for the unacceptable lack of law enforcement.\" It was long past time, he and his administration believed, to create their own tribal force. Not Afraid pleaded with the BIA to fund a new police department, according to records of their correspondence. But the BIA kept denying his request , arguing that the tribe, which didn't have a jail or other necessary infrastructure, hadn't fulfilled application requirements and couldn't effectively manage law enforcement. The pandemic provided Not Afraid with an opening. In May 2020, the Crow Nation received $27 million in coronavirus relief funding through the CARES Act. Suddenly, he didn't need the BIA's money; he had enough to launch a police department on his own. Soon he'd hired about 15 officers, tripling the police presence on the reservation. \"I was excited about it,\" says Yolanda Fraser, ­Kaysera's grandmother. \"I thought that finally we would have a justice unit that could dig into\" missing-persons cases. However, tribal legal experts say Not Afraid failed to get the necessary approval from tribal lawmakers. \"Police departments need to be established by legislation-that wasn't there,\" says Dennis Bear Don't Walk, the tribe's former chief judge and now legislative counsel, who says Not Afraid also likely needed lawmakers to sign off on using CARES Act money for policing. Not Afraid declined to comment, but former officials who helped him launch the department told me they believed he had the power to control spending and establish law enforcement during an emergency like the pandemic. (The Treasury Department is reviewing the matter and declined to comment, as did the BIA.) In Indian Country, tribal chairs have sometimes faced accusations of co-opting police departments for their own purposes-officers can act as enforcers for whoever has the upper hand in tribal management. After the department launched in late June, Not Afraid put out press releases promising to prioritize community involvement and rehabilitation. But he also embraced tactics that appeared to benefit him personally. In August 2020, he responded to an uptick in Covid deaths by imposing a reservation-wide lockdown and curfew , which had public health benefits but also ­prevented political opponents from campaigning ahead of the November election-even as he held events to drum up support himself. Some doubted the legitimacy of Not Afraid's new force. \"What if they pull a gun on you: Are they a real cop?\" Big Man, the historian, wondered. Gerald \"Jay\" Harris, the chief prosecutor in Big Horn County, which includes most of the reservation, sent a memo to the sheriff's department warning that the county could be exposed to lawsuits if it worked with the tribal police, which Harris, who is also Crow, did not view as legitimate. The BIA kept patrolling alongside the new officers but sometimes wouldn't send calls through to them, according to sources familiar with the tribal force. Passes, the BIA officer, viewed the tribal cops as more of a \"militia group than a law enforcement department.\" The federal government had never invested enough resources to create a strong pipeline of trained local police. Shilo Bad Bear was hired as a supervising dispatcher of the new department, even though she only had about 10 months of prior experience. \"I was so scared-I didn't have the proper qualifications,\" she says. \"I basically had to learn by myself,\" adds another dispatcher, who asked for anonymity; she had no prior experience and says she received a sheet of 10 codes but no formal training. Shilo Bad Bear, a former 911 dispatcher for the Crow tribal police, says she was hired without much experience. Passes questioned whether the force's employees had undergone sufficient background checks; she recalled that the BIA had arrested some of them in the past. Some of the cops had retired years ago from other agencies, which meant they were no longer certified, according to one former officer, who also requested anonymity. Others had never worked as a cop. Under Montana law, they could patrol for almost a year before attending a police academy to become certified. It's a delay that's common in small rural departments, but one that Michael Gennaco, a consultant in California who specializes in civilian oversight of law enforcement, describes as \"a tragedy waiting to happen.\" Geoffrey Eastman, a tribal patrol sergeant who did have his certification, later testified in litigation surrounding Braven's death that \"there were no policies in place\" to show officers what was expected of them. And resources were tight. For a police headquarters, Not Afraid's administration purchased a closed-down Subway restaurant attached to a museum that commemorated the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn. Confused tourists often dropped in looking to order sandwiches, but the counter that once stored cold cuts had become a temporary shelf for officers' guns. \"It felt like a joke,\" says Bad Bear. \"We were making do with what we had,\" says the department's first police chief, Terrill Bracken, and \"building an airplane as we were flying.\" The goal was to create \"a department of the people, for the people,\" says Bracken, \"with tribal members policing their own.\" But recruiting Crow cops was challenging because of the long hours, low pay, and limited benefits, and because of the reservation's extensive clan system; few locals wanted a job that might involve arresting their relatives. So Not Afraid also brought in outsiders, who he hoped would be more impartial. Bracken himself was a white martial arts instructor from Billings who had briefly worked as a sheriff's deputy; he moved into a camping trailer outside the tribal police headquarters, away from his wife and two kids, so he could devote more time to the force. \"I had so much passion for that project,\" he says. \"It wasn't going to get done unless somebody stepped up.\" After one month, he was unexpectedly replaced; Crow local Larry Tobacco, who had previously worked for the BIA, became chief. The new police department also recruited from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Sheridan, Wyoming, which staffs about a dozen federal cops to patrol a manicured VA campus. \"The reservation stays very busy and you would be exposed to a lot more major crime than you are here,\" the VA's police chief told his team in May 2020, according to emails obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request. Under VA ethics guidelines, the agency's cops generally could not moonlight on the reservation if the tribal police received federal funding. Even though Not Afraid launched the force with CARES Act funds, the tribe assured the VA that no federal funds would be used, according to emails and interviews, so the VA ethics committee gave its blessing. (One former police official told me he was present when an attorney told Not Afraid that the funds became tribal after entering the tribe's bank accounts; a Treasury Department spokesperson said the funds still would have been federal. Not Afraid did not respond to my request for comment.) Former tribal police vehicles sit abandoned on the Crow reservation. Some Crow residents, including Old Bull, questioned whether it made sense to invite outside law enforcement onto the reservation. And these VA officers may not have been prepared for real policing, says Seth Stoughton, a former cop who lectures on policing issues at the University of South Carolina; patrolling a VA medical center, he says, is more like working as a security guard than as a municipal cop. Bracken tells me these officers had previously completed training in operating a police vehicle to get federal certification at the VA. But a VA spokesperson told me its officers receive no training in high-speed chases because they are banned by the agency. The night Braven died, it was a VA police officer turned tribal cop, Pamela Klier, who chased him. The Crow tribal police \"was a good thought,\" says Bad Bear, the dispatcher, but \"it seemed like something bad was bound to happen because these guys didn't know what they were doing.\" The morning before Braven died, he and his brother Emilio played basketball for a couple of hours. Then Braven went to his late grandma's house in Hardin to see his cousins Jayden and Trey, who were still grieving her death. He seemed fine, remembers Jayden; they \"danced each other up,\" like they always did to say hello, and then Braven went to fish at a nearby pond. Around 1 p.m., he texted his girlfriend and offered to pick her up at home after her shift at the Boys & Girls Club that evening. He could borrow the car at his grandma's house, a black Chevy Malibu, to make the 35-minute ride. It was already dark out when he hit the road, a crisp November night, but it hadn't snowed yet so it would be an easy drive. Blossom Old Bull didn't learn about the crash until several hours afterward. She had just woken up from a nap when she got a phone call. Braven's older brother Gavin was sobbing. He'd heard that Braven had been in an accident. \"Where is he? Which hospital do I go to?\" Old Bull asked frantically. \"He's dead,\" Gavin said, still crying. Old Bull dropped the phone and screamed. No! she yelled. How do you know? Emilio hit a shelf in the room he shared with Braven, breaking it. His sister Jolene threw herself on the floor and sobbed. They were all still crying, struggling to comfort each other, when they heard a knock on the door a half-hour later at 10 p.m. Outside, a tall man with a black shirt and badge stood on the rickety front steps. It was BIA Special Agent Jose Figueroa Jr., who'd just come from the crash site. A banner demanding justice for Braven hangs outside Old Bull's home. I'm sure you guys already know what happened , Figueroa said to Braven's older brother Keenan outside, according to Old Bull and court records . They clocked him going 90 and chased him, and he ended up going head-on with the train . Figueroa said the family could go to the mortuary the next morning. He asked whether Braven drank or did drugs, then left without offering condolences. When Braven's older brother returned inside, he had a confused look on his face. Speed limits often weren't enforced on the reservation. And Braven was always so slow behind the wheel. \"I didn't know what to think,\" Old Bull says. She was inclined to trust Figueroa, because her dad worked as a cop in South Dakota when she was younger. But Figueroa had hardly given the family any details-not even which agency had pursued her son-and she couldn't square the story she had been told about Braven speeding with the cautious boy she had raised. The next morning, she grew even more baffled when the mortuary owner said she couldn't see Braven's body yet. The owner didn't tell her that it had already been sent to a crime lab for an autopsy. Her confusion turned to shock in the days that followed. On the TV news, she learned that it was the tribal police who'd chased Braven, so she drove to their headquarters. But the force had by then disbanded, and the windows of the old Subway were covered in paper. Seething with anger, she tugged on the locked door and pressed her face against the windows, trying to see inside. \"There was a life taken, and you just closed everything down without giving the family any answers?\" she thought. When she went to the BIA office instead, looking for a police report, an officer handed her a sticky note that simply said \"FOIA.\" Over the next few months, she got an attorney, Nagle, who'd also been helping Kaysera's family, and they filed a Freedom of Information Act request for documents with the BIA, but the agency rejected it , citing an ongoing investigation. The question was, who was investigating? The BIA told Nagle that the FBI had jurisdiction, but an FBI agent told her his office had no case file for Braven. (The FBI, in response to my own FOIA request in 2022, would not confirm or deny whether it possessed documents related to Braven's death. The BIA told me both agencies initially investigated, but the FBI eventually took control because Klier was non-Native.) When Old Bull tried to get Braven's death certificate, an assistant at the Big Horn County court couldn't find it. When she tried to locate his car, the insurance company Progressive said authorities hadn't released it yet. For weeks, the only information she could access was from Braven's toxicology report; the coroner personally called to offer his condolences and to tell her that Braven had been drunk and had THC in his system when he died. It would take her four months to get the full autopsy report. She still didn't know the name of the officer who'd pursued her son or how the chase had unfolded. \"There was a life taken, and you just closed everything down without giving the family any answers?\" Old Bull, a medication aide at a nursing home, is far from naive when it comes to requesting medical documentation. But federal and state law enforcement have a reputation for keeping Native families in the dark after killings. \"It's expected for families not to get information,\" says Rae Peppers, a Crow former state lawmaker. Other families have also struggled to get basic paperwork after their loved ones died. \"They never notified me, not once,\" Fraser, Kaysera's grandmother and legal guardian, says of the sheriff's office that found Kaysera's body. \"It was hard, not getting any support,\" says Alvilene Buffalo Bull Tail, whose 14-year-old grandson, nicknamed Jr. Boy, was fatally hit by a train on the Crow reservation in 2017. Authorities deemed his death an accident, surmising that he fell asleep on the tracks; Buffalo Bull Tail suspects someone pushed him, and that law enforcement never properly investigated. \"We don't have closure until at least we know what really happened.\" In Lame Deer, a town on the Northern Cheyenne reservation bordering Crow, Maureen Bryant says her family still hasn't obtained a death certificate or autopsy report more than two years after her niece DeAnna Limberhand was found hogtied in the Stillwater River. Going to the courthouse for documents felt \"like a dead end.\" \"We kept waiting for paperwork or some kind of information, but we never heard,\" she says. \"What do you do if no one is helping you?\" she adds tearily. \"We're just going through a lot right now, and the not-knowing makes it even worse.\" Rae Peppers, a Crow former state lawmaker, says Native families often struggle to get information from federal and state law enforcement agencies after killings. The stonewalling led Old Bull and her family to speculate about what happened to Braven, and sometimes they clung to upsetting theories. When they went to the railroad after the crash and observed a second set of tire marks alongside Braven's leading from the highway through the grass to the railroad, they wondered whether the police ran him into the train. And they wondered if perhaps law enforcement's lack of transparency was a sign of something more nefarious. \"If you did nothing wrong, just release the information,\" Old Bull wanted to tell them. \"What is it you are trying to hide?\" Her suspicions heightened as witnesses came forward. According to her lawsuit, Maurice and Mavis Mountain Sheep, the couple who'd passed the wreck on their way to get gas, told her they had waited near the railroad for about a half-hour and didn't see anyone offer Braven first aid. Braven \"kept saying, 'Help me,'\" Mavis told the family. But law enforcement \"just stood there and stared at him.\" Old Bull also got a text from Bad Bear, the tribal police's dispatcher. \"I had quit by the time that occurred with your son but I can tell you right now, absolutely nothing was in compliance,\" Bad Bear wrote. \"That place should have not ever been opened...It was a shitshow there.\" For Old Bull, the lack of clarity about the night Braven died was like torture. And she isn't one to let something like this slide. In February 2023, she tried to sue Klier in federal court for wrongful death, hoping the court proceedings would bring new information to light. She had also sued the BIA, which sent officers to the scene of the crash, accusing the agency of negligently allowing the tribal police to operate without proper training and of failing to offer Braven medical care. \"The acts of the agents of Defendant United States shock the conscience and offend the community's sense of fair play and decency,\" her attorney wrote . Last April, a judge allowed Old Bull's case to proceed against the BIA, but not against Klier, because Klier had chased Braven in her capacity as a tribal employee, not a federal one. By then, it was too late for Old Bull to sue Klier in tribal court; she'd missed the tribe's statute of limitations. Old Bull decided to try a different tactic. In July 2023, she drove to Billings to share her story with a broader audience, including federal officials who were seeking feedback about law enforcement on reservations. She wasn't sure what to expect, but she hoped someone in power might finally listen. In the years since Braven died, President Biden had appointed the country's first Indigenous secretary of the interior, Deb Haaland. Before Haaland left Congress to take the job, she and other Native lawmakers passed a bill to hear testimony about crime and the crisis of missing Indigenous people. Now, Native families were coming from Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota to testify to a federal commission, some driving 20 hours round trip for a chance to speak for 15 minutes. Grace Bulltail, Kaysera's aunt, was a member of the commission and encouraged Old Bull to join. But Bulltail felt disappointed at the turnout of elected officials. \"We invited the Montana Department of Justice-nobody came,\" she says. Not even many Crow tribal leaders showed up. (A DOJ spokesperson said he wasn't aware of an invitation.) Still, Old Bull told me afterward that the gathering made her \"a little optimistic that something will change.\" It helped her feel less alone knowing that her family wasn't the only one waiting for answers. \"Listening to everyone's stories, you realize you're a piece of a big, big thing.\" The next month, I was in Crow Agency again, reporting on Braven's case. It had been nearly three years since Old Bull first started investigating the circumstances surrounding her son's death, but there'd been a big development since the last time I visited: The BIA had sent me an email with a trove of documents about the incident. It had taken me months of corresponding with the agency-after a year examining the case, interviewing dozens of people, and scouring court and government records-to get the details of her son's final minutes. I wondered whether my luck with the BIA had something to do with all the time that had passed, or my status as an outsider. Nagle, Old Bull's attorney, told me journalists are \"much more likely\" than Indigenous families to get documents from the federal government via the Freedom of Information Act. At Old Bull's house, she put on her glasses and joined me on the couch, where I spread out the highlighted pages for her to see. At first, what Old Bull read in the BIA's investigative report lined up with what she already knew. It all started on Highway 451 on November 24, she read. But the next detail made her purse her lips: At 5:39 p.m., Braven made a \"legal pass\" of Klier's police car over a dotted yellow line, according to the BIA's description of Klier's dashcam footage, which doesn't specify how fast he drove past her. Then, once he got in front of her, he slowed back down to the speed limit, about 70 mph, and Klier turned on her emergency lights to pull him over. He kept driving. Maybe he was afraid, Old Bull thought, remembering the officer who had choked him on his way to juvenile hall just months before the crash. In any case, Braven drove, still close to the speed limit. Seconds later, he slowed down considerably, and it appeared he might pull over. Klier, now following him at 55 mph, called dispatch and reported that he'd passed her at 90 mph. But Braven did not pull over. Klier activated her siren. Now, Braven began to accelerate, and she chased him. Seventy-seven miles per hour within half a minute. One hundred and nine miles per hour within a minute. They passed two other cars driving the opposite direction. Then Braven made a bold move. He turned off his headlights and other exterior lights, a tactic that drivers sometimes use to hide from police. At a bend in the highway, he went onto the grass, driving in the dark toward the railroad. Old Bull stopped reading and pushed her glasses onto her forehead. \"He legally passed her,\" she said. \"All this kid wanted to do was to go see his girlfriend, that was it. It doesn't make sense.\" She covered her face with her hands and cried. A \"compelling need\" for a police chase \"does not include the mere act of fleeing, even if reckless.\" One-third of all police chases in the United States end with a crash, often causing property damage, injury, or death. Many of these chases begin after an officer observes a traffic infraction, but because of the risks involved, some police departments only allow pursuits after a violent felony or something that puts the public in imminent danger. It's unclear whether the Crow police had a similar rule. Police Chief Tobacco and Sergeant Eastman testified in the lawsuit over Braven's death that there was not a handbook of policies and procedures in place, or at least they weren't aware of one. But the tribe submitted one to the BIA in the months leading up to the crash, according to records I obtained . That handbook states that an officer can only pursue a driver if there's a \"compelling need\" and if the chase presents less risk to the public than the driver remaining at large. A \"compelling need,\" the manual adds, \"does not include the mere act of fleeing, even if reckless,\" or \"traffic and licensing infractions, including DUI.\" Some police officers argue it's worthwhile to chase after a traffic violation, because maybe the driver is actually fleeing due to a bigger offense, like a dead body or bags of cocaine in the trunk. But suspicion alone, says Stoughton, the South Carolina expert, is not enough. \"If you aren't sure what the benefits of the pursuit are, but you do know the dangers,\" including a deadly crash, \"clearly the risks should outweigh the benefits,\" he says. \"Failing to stop for a speeding violation is not a good reason to kill someone.\" And that's especially true if the driver may be intoxicated, he says. In Braven's case, \"what's more dangerous-him driving the speed limit while drunk,\" or him being chased and \"driving 100 mph while drunk?\" says Stoughton, adding that Klier could have arrested him later: According to court documents, she'd already noted his license plate number. \"Had she terminated the pursuit,\" policing expert Susan Peters testified in Old Bull's lawsuit, \"more likely than not, Braven J. Glenn would not have been involved in a vehicular fatality accident.\" Scraps of burned metal, including a suspension spring, a radiator, and a wheel, are what's left of Braven's car near the site of the crash. As Old Bull and I read over the BIA reports, it became more and more apparent that the investigation into the crash had been flawed from the start. Moments after the crash, Klier called dispatch. \"Send medical,\" she said, according to call logs. \"He just got hit.\" Soon, other law enforcement arrived-from the tribal police, the BIA, the state highway patrol, the sheriff's office, and the fire department. But according to other records from the investigation, they struggled to get on the same page, a common complaint on reservations. Bodycam footage from Deputy Sheriff Michael Colvin, a county cop who was assigned to divert traffic, offers a small glimpse into the confusion. \"Hey, where's the body at?\" an officer asked Colvin. \"I don't know,\" Colvin said. \"Tribal PD was first on scene, and they told BIA where it was at...He said it wrecked some place down here.\" \"Was it crossing or what?\" \"I don't know. That's what I asked, but he didn't really give me an answer.\" Seconds later, paramedics drove past Colvin, lights flashing. A voice came over his radio: \"They're on scene, but they've been canceled.\" The paramedics left. Six minutes later, a tribal police officer called dispatch, according to records I obtained from the county attorney's office. \"Tribal asked why EMS canceled,\" the dispatcher noted in a call log , \"because they didn't make the determination the individual(s) were deceased.\" The tribal officer asked the paramedics to return. Later, Braven's girlfriend, Jordan, who drove over after Braven didn't pick her up after work, saw men loading a body bag into a white truck. Meanwhile, BIA special agent Figueroa arrived. According to an investigative report , he told Klier that the BIA would investigate the crash. Later, he told another tribal officer on the scene that Klier would need to have her blood drawn and that he needed the dashcam footage from her patrol vehicle. The officer acknowledged his request, but when Figueroa returned from speaking with the train conductor, Klier was gone and had taken the police car with her. The tribal officer had given Klier permission to go home, according to the report; she'd been visibly shaken up after the crash. \"It's like, what the fuck?\" says attorney Tim Bechtold, who is representing Old Bull in her lawsuit. \"All these cops not knowing what the fuck to do.\" Klier's decision to take her vehicle was \"incredibly unusual and wildly inappropriate,\" says Stoughton, the police expert in South Carolina. \"It's not that much different from an officer who's involved with a shooting taking their gun home instead of turning that over for evidence.\" A former tribal police officer, who requested anonymity, later told me he saw Klier at the police station soon after the crash. The officer drove to the railroad and alerted Figueroa that the car might be at headquarters. \"You need to go down there and get that vehicle now,\" he recalls telling Figueroa. But it's unclear if Figueroa went; he didn't locate the car that night. The next day, Figueroa told the Crow police department that he would need a copy of Klier's incident report and the dashcam footage. The following day was Thanksgiving. And a day after that, Figueroa learned the police department had already \"disbanded and closed shop,\" according to the BIA investigation. \"No one knows who has access to their reports.\" Then things got even more complicated. In mid-December, when Figueroa reminded the tribe that he still needed the report, he learned that someone had broken into the former police headquarters. Now the records he needed were missing. Figueroa still didn't know where Klier's police car was, either. So in January, he drove to Wyoming, where she lived and worked with the VA, to find her. She said she was waiting for an attorney and didn't want to talk. (She also declined my request for comment.) Figueroa drove back to Montana and reached out to the tribe's homeland security director, who said he was \"unsure where anything was,\" this time citing two break-ins at the police ­headquarters,­ but that he would try his best to find the records. (Police equipment, including guns, had also gone missing.) Two weeks later, in February, Figueroa learned the headquarters had suffered four break-ins, but someone had finally located Klier's police car; Figueroa copied the dashcam footage. In May, he obtained the BIA's dispatch logs, but the tribal police's logs concerning Braven's death-and Klier's incident report for it-were still missing. (They don't appear to have ever been recovered.) Harris, the former Big Horn county attorney, whose term ended in late 2022, believes the US government may be responsible, at least in part, for mistakes made by law enforcement that night. In addition to allegedly failing to provide potentially lifesaving medical care, the BIA did not properly secure the scene of the crash and allowed Klier's police car to get away, and then took months to find it. \"You would think [the BIA] would have their hair on fire chasing everybody down,\" says Jonathan Smith, who oversaw investigations into police department misconduct at Obama's Justice Department. If it took that long to locate the car, he adds, \"it seems unlikely they tried as hard as they could.\" Old Bull's lawsuit is scheduled for trial this summer. The US government denies any wrongdoing. Since the BIA did not employ the Crow's tribal police force, an attorney for the government wrote in response to the complaint, \"the United States cannot be held liable...for their negligence.\" \"There's so much they did wrong...It's like a ton of bricks just hits you. I fought so hard...It's like we don't matter, like we are nothing.\" After reading the BIA reports, Old Bull retraced the new information. \"There's so much they did wrong...It's like a ton of bricks just hits you,\" she told me, motioning with her hands toward her chest. She wondered whether things might have been different if she'd gotten some of this information sooner-whether it would have helped her legal case, or at the very least helped her heal. And it stung, she added, knowing that an outsider like me-a white journalist with no connection to Braven-could access all these FOIA records, while she, Braven's mother, had been denied. It took suing for her to begin getting evidence, and even that, she said, didn't include some of the key details I'd just shared with her. \"I fought so hard to get that, years and years,\" she said. \"It's like we don't matter, like we are nothing.\" Two days later, former tribal police chief Terrill Bracken arrived at my Airbnb in Billings. I'd told him that Old Bull was interested in seeing him. Bracken wasn't leading the police department when Braven died, and he knew little about the chase. But if Old Bull wanted to talk, meeting her seemed like the Christian thing to do, he said. \"Anything I can do to help her with the grief that she is going through, that's why I'm here,\" he told me. Old Bull, who'd worked a 12-hour shift at the nursing home that day, sat in her car outside the house for a moment before entering. For months, she'd been asking God to help her forgive, but it was hard to let go of all the resentments she carried. Maybe, she thought, it would be easier after talking with Bracken and hearing another perspective. \"I have to come face-to-face with somebody that started this whole thing, and just get some straightforward answers,\" she told me at the front door. After taking a seat opposite the former police chief, Old Bull anxiously tapped on her glass of water with her fingers, tears welling in her eyes. Bracken said he was sorry for her loss. She thanked him. \"That's our right to know what happened to our child,\" she said. \"And I never got that. I had to fight and fight and fight.\" \"And it should not have to be that way,\" Bracken agreed. \"It's frustrating for me,\" he added, \"because I know what we were working toward was going to be so much better,\" he said of the tribal police. Their conversation stretched on for two hours. At points, Old Bull seemed to soften toward Bracken. \"I do feel better with you talking to me. I can see you now as a person,\" she said. But when he began talking about Officer Klier, the mood shifted. \"For all we know,\" Bracken said of Klier, \"she's not doing very well right now.\" \"She's not the one hurting,\" Old Bull said quietly. \"I'm not saying who's suffering more. It's not a contest,\" Bracken responded. \"But I'm just being honest with you: Given the information that I have, I can't see how I would have acted any differently than the officer. And that's a difficult part of the job.\" Old Bull sighed. \"I gotta work in the morning,\" she said, signaling her intent to leave. \"Would it be okay if I prayed with you?\" he asked. She nodded, her eyes shut, and began crying after he placed his hands over hers. Driving home, Old Bull was glad to have spoken with Bracken. But as she lay in bed the next morning, recalling the conversation, her anger grew. \"For him to say, 'Oh, poor Pamela, I wonder what she's going through'? How dare you ,\" she thought. She picked up her phone and texted me: \"Samantha there was a lot that bothered me. He put her on this pedestal,\" she wrote. \"To sit there and emphasize her feelings, when this is about the loss of my son and her actions made that loss happen. I feel like it was an attempt...to glorify what she did as a cop.\" \"This is a system made to oppress us. It's been this way since Columbus,\" she added, before putting down her phone and heading to work. The doors of the tribal police headquarters were locked the first time I visited last year, but I could peek inside to see how abruptly it was all abandoned. The police's whiteboard calendar still showed the Thanksgiving party scheduled for the day Braven died. Stacks of unused call logs sat in dusty boxes. In the parking lot, a makeshift jail remained, two tiny cells inside a shipping container. The refrigerated counter that once held Subway's sandwich ingredients-and then guns-had been removed. The dining tables that the cops used as desks were piled outside beneath cottonwood trees. The temporary holding cell in a modified shipping container outside the former tribal police station The former tribal police station in a closed-down Subway store on the Crow reservation There was never a public explanation for why the department closed in late November 2020, leading to speculation. Old Bull still wonders whether the police are hiding something. Big Man, the historian, wonders if they packed up and left because of poor training and lack of community support, and because Braven's chase was \"the final straw.\" \"There were a lot of reasons why it shut down,\" says one of the tribal police officers who requested anonymity. \"It was starting to fail\" even before Braven's accident, and then \"the money stopped coming in.\" Bracken doubts Braven's death was the only motivation for disbanding, if it was a motivation at all. He blames politics: A few weeks before the crash, Chairman Not Afraid lost the election to Frank White Clay, a former tribal lawmaker who believed propping up a new police force with Covid relief funding violated federal spending guidelines. \"We're still trying to figure out exactly where that money went,\" White Clay would later tell a journalism student at the University of Montana in 2021. He agreed the reservation needed more law enforcement but said this police force was just \"playing cops.\" Rather than give White Clay the satisfaction of disbanding the force, Not Afraid beat him to it and shut down the department about a week before the inauguration, according to another former tribal police official. It was possible Braven's accident may have been \"the catalyst, the icing on the cake,\" but it wasn't the primary reason for closing, he said. Harris, the former Big Horn county attorney, says the department's sudden ­closure was evidence that it was never properly established. \"A legitimate, lawful police agency doesn't just end because a chairman or president or governor says, 'All right. Enough,'\" he tells me. \"This [police department] was a mirage, a facade.\" It was \"a temporary fix, nothing more than a Band-Aid,\" one of the former police officers tells me. \"Did we do everything perfectly? Absolutely not,\" says Bracken. \"But were we doing the best we could with what we had? Yes. I really believe that department would have flourished into something had it gotten a fair opportunity.\" The Crow police force's brief existence and abrupt end is not just a story about a tribal administration's mistakes, says Big Man. It is also a story about the federal government's repeated failures leading up to 2020-to keep families informed, to conduct thorough investigations, to keep the reservation safe. And it shows \"a real need for clear, meaningful communication\" with Crow people, says Kristina Lucero, who directs the American Indian Governance and Policy Institute at the University of Montana, \"about expected goals and the mission of what law enforcement should be doing.\" The police department was \"a temporary fix, nothing more than a Band-Aid.\" Many of the families who testified with Old Bull in Billings were adamant that they want more transparent policing, including easier access to information after loved ones die or go missing. \"Authorities at all levels must improve communications with family members, who are too often left in the dark for days, weeks, or months,\" causing \"enormous stress,\" the federal commission wrote afterward. Indigenous communities also want more funding: In 2022, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe in Montana sued the US government because of a shortage of police. The state's Fort Belknap Indian Community sued too, after the BIA refused to provide more public safety money. \"What's happening at Crow, that's pretty extreme,\" says UCLA's van Schilfgaarde, but \"when budgets are tight, these [police] departments come and go in a way that would just never happen in other communities.\" The problem isn't just in Montana, she adds. Most Native villages in Alaska have no law enforcement presence whatsoever. Two days after his inauguration in 2020, White Clay informed the BIA that \"an independent law enforcement effort is not the direction that the new administration of the Crow Tribe intends to continue.\" Since then, complaints about BIA policing persist. In July 2021, the tribe sued a BIA officer after he was caught on video failing to stop his dog from biting someone handcuffed after a traffic stop, for nearly a minute, leading to three surgeries on the man's ankle and foot. \"Unfortunately, nothing in this video is surprising to anyone who has lived on the Crow Nation,\" the tribe's attorney wrote. \"I had a lot of faith in the police before,\" Old Bull says, \"but after Braven died, I don't believe they're there to protect us.\" In December, President Biden signed an executive order to remove red tape that has hampered Native access to law enforcement funding. But legal action might be more effective. In May, a US district judge encouraged the feds to meet with the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota and \"figure out how to more fairly fund\" tribal policing-or else go to trial. The decision was \"the first to acknowledge that the government owes a treaty-based duty to fund law enforcement for [an] Indian tribe,\" according to the Oglala Sioux's attorneys. And they say it could at last force a legal reckoning over Washington's centuries-long harm to Native justice systems. A successful reckoning must give tribes more jurisdiction and make room for them to reimagine policing and public safety in ways that reflect their own cultures and customs, says Goldberg, the Obama appointee to the Indian Law and Order Commission. She's seen Indigenous communities that involve spiritual leaders in justice proceedings to weigh in on punishments and design a path forward. The Tulalip reservation in Washington state, in keeping with its values, has required police to stop by the Boys & Girls Club twice a shift to help kids with homework, and they attend elders' breakfasts to share data and answer questions. A successful reckoning must give tribes more jurisdiction and make room for them to reimagine policing and public safety in ways that reflect their own cultures and customs. On the Crow reservation, most people I asked said the tribe needed more law enforcement, but they also emphasized the importance of better officer training. Some said they wanted to think about public safety in a more balanced way, with funding for mental health, addiction treatment, housing, and education. Investments like these could make it easier to recruit good local cops, says the University of Montana's Lucero, since people might be less hesitant to police their relatives if the justice system offered more second chances and paths toward healing. \"You just can't arrest people, lock them up, and expect to throw them back in the same situation and change,\" says Big Man. \"Past traumas have created who we are,\" adds Old Bull. \"Get people into treatment and get them help and programs before moving in a police department.\" Tribal nations that are successful with law enforcement, says Goldberg, are ones with \"strong congruence between the views of the community and the way it's done.\" Braven's family built a memorial for him near the site of his death. Old Bull buried Braven about an hour from home, at the foot of the Pryor Mountains, next to the graves of his father and his cousin Kaysera. The cemetery is small and quiet, off a dirt path surrounded by fields, and most of the gravestones are simple, some with fake flowers and crosses. Old Bull and her family go there often to mow the grass around Braven's plot and decorate it with gifts, like chocolate-covered pretzels, one of his favorite snacks, and a basketball covered in their handwritten messages for him. At times they'll play music and reminisce about the ways he made them laugh, like how he'd make a muscle like Popeye and kiss it. When two of his older sisters got pregnant, they went to the cemetery and told him about it. When his younger sister graduated high school, she wore a cap beaded with the words, \"We did it Brave.\" They feel sometimes like he's still with them, even sending them messages. The night before his funeral, when Old Bull slept in a teepee with his remains, in keeping with her Lakota traditions, she and another family member heard a basketball bouncing in the middle of the night, even though everyone else had long since gone to bed. In August 2023, on what would have been his 20th birthday, Old Bull and her kids drive to the cemetery to visit Braven. They eat chocolate cupcakes with sprinkles, Braven's favorite, and release balloons into the sky for him. \"I want them to know he was a person too,\" Emilio says. \"He was a good kid and had big dreams, and for them to hide in the shadows-he deserves justice, the truth.\" \"Accountability and closure-that's what my mom really needs, what I really need,\" adds sister Marissa. \"I do want accountability, and I want them to admit this didn't have to happen,\" says Old Bull. On the drive home around 10 p.m., Old Bull sees a white owl sitting on the side of the road. In her tradition, owls are harbingers of death. The last time she encountered one, her mom died, and not too long afterward Braven did, too. When she arrives home it's almost midnight, and she lights a bundle of sage and cedar, calling her kids and grandkids out of the house to smudge them and help keep them safe. \"Bring the babies out,\" she instructs, walking to each person with the bundle and watching as they wave the smoke over their heads and into their hearts, all the way down to their legs. \"Who's next?\" This project was completed with the support of a grant from Columbia University's Ira A. Lipman Center for Journalism and Civil and Human Rights in conjunction with Arnold Ventures. Old Bull visits the memorial placed where Braven died.\n\nSubscribe to Mother Jones podcasts on Apple Podcasts or your favorite podcast app. The disappearance of a new police department so soon after the wreck was highly unusual, the kind of story you might never hear twice. But other parts of Braven's story were deeply familiar: unanswered questions after deaths on the reservation, inadequate law enforcement. Before 2020, the federal government controlled policing in the Crow Nation-providing only a handful of officers for an area two-thirds the size of Connecticut. Crimes went unsolved , grieving relatives complained of faulty investigations, and some victims wouldn't even call for help, fearing violence by officers. (Nationally, police kill Native Americans at higher rates than other people of color.) The Crow's tribal police department was a desperately needed but underfunded counterbalance to a federal system that isn't working. And Braven was caught up in the dysfunction. So, too, was Old Bull. After the tribal cops disappeared, it felt like nobody in power would talk to her, like nobody noticed the life that was lost or took responsibility for it. \"They come on Native land and they kill, and they just walk away. They think nobody is gonna care,\" she said as she drove home from the train tracks, the sun almost set, the clouds a deep blue behind her. \"I think they thought that's how our family was gonna be-that we were gonna let this go.\" \"They didn't expect us to speak out and try to get answers,\" she added. Blossom Old Bull in her home in Crow Agency, Montana The Crow tribe has about 13,400 members, most of whom live on or around the reservation in southeastern Montana, a lush landscape with towering mountains, open skies, and rivers teeming with trout. The tribal nation earns some revenue from its vast coal and oil reserves. Most people speak Crow as a first language, and the matrilineal clan system remains strong. Braven and his mom moved to the reservation when he was in eighth grade. Old Bull, a single mom and health care worker from South Dakota, is Lakota, not Crow, and she'd been raising Braven in New Mexico; he was her youngest boy, the eighth of nine siblings. But she wanted him to grow up closer to his father, who was Crow, and some of his older brothers and sisters, and to learn more about that part of his Native heritage. When she'd spent time on the reservation previously, she recalled families camping in teepees for Crow Fair, an annual celebration with a powwow and horse racing and a rodeo, or enjoying the Sun Dance and sweat lodges. Braven hadn't wanted to move away from Albuquerque. He was a sensitive kid, and he cried in 2017 when he learned he'd have to leave his basketball team behind. In Montana, the family settled in the town of Crow Agency in a shabby one-story house that they spruced up with fresh paint. It was a rough transition; weeks after they arrived, Braven's dad died from pneumonia after a struggle with alcoholism. Braven, only 13 years old, stood at his bedside the day they pulled him off life support. I know you weren't there for me because you were sick , he said, but I still love you. \"He was such a good-hearted person, to even think in those terms at that age,\" says his sister Marissa. Braven did his best to settle into the bunkbed room he now shared with his older brother Emilio, who played basketball with him on the corner courts. He grew closer with his half siblings' grandmother, who adopted him as her own grandson. He loved spending time at her house and would offer to drive her to appointments, help her carry groceries, and put the pots away on the top shelf of her kitchen. Braven was an honor-roll student who ran cross country and track and played JV basketball. Though he hadn't wanted to move to the reservation, it didn't take long for Braven to hit his stride. His cousin Jayden remembers how quickly Braven made friends: \"I left for the summer and came back and everyone knew him. He was really popular.\" \"He had a goofy personality,\" says his girlfriend, Jordan Jefferson. As the years passed, Braven excelled-an honor-roll student who ran cross country and track and played JV basketball, and who was unanimously chosen by his teammates to co-manage the varsity squad, which he hoped to eventually join himself, running miles most days to get in better shape. \"He was one of a kind and always ready to take the challenge,\" says Mike Beads Don't Mix, his freshman coach. But the pandemic marked the start of a shift after Braven's high school switched to remote learning and he couldn't see his friends much. In August 2020, the month he was turning 17, his grandma got Covid; she fell into a coma and was unable to sing him \"Happy Birthday\" like she normally did. Weeks later, she was dead. \"He took it really hard\" and \"got a little more distant from all of us,\" his sister JoLee remembers. In his bedroom, Braven played his grandma's favorite song, \"Blue Ain't Your Color\" by Keith Urban, over and over. His grades slipped, and he started drinking more. The week of Braven's birthday, Old Bull found him passed out on a couch at his older brother's house. He lashed out at her after she roused him, and she called the cops, hoping they might teach him a lesson. The police arrested him for disorderly conduct and took him to juvenile detention in Billings, about an hour away. \"My mom, she had to raise all these kids on her own, so I guess you could say she's tough, but not mean,\" Emilio says. \"She's loving, she'd get us a bunch of basketball shoes, but she's gonna give you the tough love you need to succeed in this world.\" \"But you need to learn now, Braven, that if somebody needs to call the cops on you, this is what will happen.\" When Braven returned three days later, now on probation, he hugged Old Bull and gave her a letter he'd written apologizing for the incident. \"I never want to leave your side again,\" he wrote. \"I know everybody in our family is disappointed in me...I was crying while writing this letter just because I realized how bad I hurt you.\" He told Old Bull that on his way to detention, an arresting officer from the Crow tribal police \"choked [him] out,\" according to court records, and that it had scared him, reaffirming all the bad stories he'd heard about law enforcement: His cousin Jayden once watched a cop push his uncle's head into the concrete, and they both remembered when officers at Crow Fair beat Braven's 15-year-old cousin Esaias Stops Pretty Places. This is why I didn't want to call the police , Old Bull told him. \"But you need to learn now, Braven, that if somebody needs to call the cops on you,\" she added, \"this is what will happen.\" Tattoos in memory of her son Braven Glenn adorn Blossom Old Bull's forearm. For centuries before the Europeans arrived, the Crow had no police. Instead, warrior groups protected people and enforced laws like the rules of the buffalo hunt. \"There's a big difference between a warrior and a cop,\" says Crow historian Alden Big Man Jr., who has studied the tribe's traditional systems of justice. Warriors' punishments could be harsh, including things like burning down a person's home or killing his horses, but if the offender responded favorably, the warriors would compensate his loss, perhaps giving him as many horses as had been taken away. In the 1800s, the federal government confined the Crow, also known as the Apsáalooke, to the reservation; white settlers often shot at people who tried to leave. The tribe's nomadic hunters and gatherers were forced to become sedentary farmers and to accept Christianity, learn English, and educate their kids in the colonizers' way. As railroads brought white ranchers into their grazing areas and banks denied Crows loans, the former warriors were \"reduced to begging for handouts during ration days,\" according to Big Man, while they \"witnessed a complete annihilation of the buffalo, as well as the disappearance of a whole way of life.\" In 1887, after a Crow man led a war party off the reservation to steal horses, a colonial agent sent the party to jail. \"It was right then and there,\" says Big Man, that in the Crow Nation \"the system changed from warrior societies to the government enforcing the law.\" Around that time, the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) began appointing Native officers to police reservations-ordering them to prohibit traditional rituals that the colonizers viewed as immoral, ration food and other supplies, and stop any activities that might interfere with white economic pursuits. In 1885, Congress had taken away Native nations' right to prosecute serious crimes like homicides committed by Native people against other Natives on reservations. (US lawmakers were outraged that a Sioux government in South Dakota had punished a killer according to its own principles of justice -rather than the death penalty, it had fined him $600, eight horses, and a blanket.) Instead, murders and other violent offenses would be investigated by federal agents, some of whom traveled long distances to tribal territories and had little to no long-standing relationship with the people who lived there. Nearly a century later, as activists from the American Indian Movement protested police brutality and rising crime, Congress passed the 1975 Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act , which created a path for tribes to take back more control of law enforcement. If tribal nations were able to jump through the hoops needed to secure a contract with the BIA, they could divert federal dollars intended for BIA cops to their own tribal police. \"It was a real game-changer,\" says Lauren van Schilfgaarde, an Indian law scholar who is Cochiti Pueblo and previously directed UCLA's Tribal Legal Development Clinic. Tribes have since set up more than 200 law enforcement agencies on reservations, far surpassing the number of BIA agencies. But many tribes were not able to get a contract, including the Crow, and those that have tribal police still lack jurisdiction over major crimes. In 1978, the Supreme Court also removed their ability to prosecute non-Natives, even for most minor crimes. \"Even if you have infinite dollars, if your police departments have questionable, shaky, or even no authority over any person within their territorial boundaries, that compromises the entire enterprise,\" van Schilfgaarde says. The federal government, meanwhile, skimped on funding for reservation cops, much as it skimped on health care, education, housing, and rural infrastructure. By 2001, violent crime on reservations was double or triple the national average. \"Ultimately, you are of your environment,\" Aaron Brien, a historian for the Crow tribe, says in the recent documentary Murder in Big Horn . \"When you take an entire society and strip them of any confidence and self-worth they have, it becomes very fragile.\" Tribes barely had half the policing resources per capita as non-Native communities: While Baltimore, Detroit, New York City, and DC had between four and seven officers per thousand residents, few tribal departments had ratios of more than two officers per thousand residents. As some communities of color protested overpolicing in cities, says van Schilfgaarde, reservations suffered the opposite extreme, coupled with a lack of resources to address public safety through other means like addiction treatment, employment, and schooling. \"It's incredibly frustrating and dangerous,\" she says. Under the Obama administration, Congress passed the Tribal Law and Order Act , creating a commission to study the problem. The commission, which included Republican and Democratic lawmakers along with Indian law experts, recommended the federal government pay to nearly double the number of reservation police-noting that crime dropped by more than one-third on four reservations that hired extra cops during a pilot program in 2009. The tribes themselves, instead of the BIA, should lead the police, the commission argued; this change would help build trust with the community and more closely reflect tribal priorities and customs. \"Public safety in Indian Country can improve dramatically once Native nations and Tribes have greater freedom to build and maintain their own criminal justice systems,\" the commission wrote , describing the federal policing system as \"a maze of injustice.\" The commission set a goal of 2024 to \"close the public safety gap\" on reservations. But by 2018, the number of BIA-funded officers on reservations hadn't grown at all-in fact, it had fallen by about one-third. Carole Goldberg, a commission member appointed by Obama, says Trump's administration seemed more focused on approving oil pipelines on Native land than on reforming reservation law enforcement. By 2020, the BIA estimated tribes needed $1.4 billion to handle policing nationally but admitted it was only providing $246 million, almost the same budget as a decade earlier. (The Department of Justice provided less than $100 million.) \"It's like working with strings and tin cans at times,\" Robert Bryant, chief of police for the Penobscot Nation, had testified to the commission. During parts of that year, the Crow Nation had just four BIA police to cover an expanse of 3,500 square miles. BIA cops were stretched so thin that \"we were pulling 18-hour days\" and \"going months without a day off,\" says Josie Passes, a former officer who wrote a letter to members of Congress begging for backup. A perceived lack of accountability contributed to a climate of fear. \"When you start thinking about it,\" says Birdie Real Bird, 70, a lifelong Crow resident whose aunt was assaulted during a home break-in and never received a visit from police, \"you're a sitting duck.\" \"When our Native women and girls go missing, law enforcement chooses to do nothing, and it's up to the family members to do the hard work of investigating.\" Add to that the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, an international problem that's particularly severe in the Crow Nation, where girls are sometimes sex-trafficked and used as drug mules along Interstate 90. Seventy-four people disappeared on the Crow and neighboring Northern Cheyenne reservations in 2019-more than any other area of Montana, which has one of the highest rates of missing Indigenous women nationally. One of them was Braven's cousin Kaysera Stops Pretty Places , an 18-year-old who loved to sing, dance, run, and wrestle. Five days after she disappeared, the sheriff's office found her body face down in a fenced backyard, but the office didn't notify her family for nearly two weeks. Four and a half years later, her cause of death remains undetermined . Families of the missing often complain about poor transparency and inadequate investigations, and jurisdictional barriers make the situation worse. The BIA can't arrest people for crimes committed off the reservation, even in border towns like Hardin, where Kaysera died. And on the reservation, other agencies-like the FBI or the sheriff's office-might have jurisdiction depending on the type of offense and whether the perpetrator was Native. Because it's often unclear whether a crime took place on or off the reservation and who the perpetrator was, it's easy for law enforcement to avoid responsibility. When corpses are discovered, investigators regularly write off the deaths as accidental. Commonly, \"when our Native women and girls go missing,\" says Mary Kathryn Nagle, a Cherokee attorney who assisted Kaysera's relatives, \"law enforcement chooses to do nothing, and it's up to the family members to do the hard work of investigating.\" \"When you start thinking about it, you're a sitting duck.\" By 2019, the Crow reservation was desperate for a change. In August, one of the few BIA cops there-the police chief, no less-quit in protest of his agency's understaffing. That November, Crow Chairman AJ Not Afraid, the tribe's chief executive, issued an emergency declaration over the shortage of police. Days later, he traveled to DC with other Native leaders to discuss the issue with President Trump, whose administration was announcing Operation Lady Justice, an initiative to improve the federal response to tribes' missing-persons cases. Some Indigenous critics described the effort as uninformed. Trump, for his part, seemed fixated on the Crow chairman's name. \"Is it true-you're not afraid? Are you not afraid of anything?\" Trump asked, laughing. On New Year's Day 2020, Not Afraid's 16-year-old niece, Selena Not Afraid, went missing at a rest stop between Hardin and Billings. A search party, which included Braven, scoured the surrounding fields with ATVs, helicopters, horses, dogs, and drones. Three weeks later, a team from the Interior Department discovered her body less than a mile away. Her death was attributed to hypothermia, but some locals suspected foul play. Selena's sister had previously died in a hit-and-run, and her brother was killed by the Billings police. \"The Crow Tribe,\" Not Afraid had said in his emergency declaration, \"will no longer accept 'lip service' for the unacceptable lack of law enforcement.\" It was long past time, he and his administration believed, to create their own tribal force. Not Afraid pleaded with the BIA to fund a new police department, according to records of their correspondence. But the BIA kept denying his request , arguing that the tribe, which didn't have a jail or other necessary infrastructure, hadn't fulfilled application requirements and couldn't effectively manage law enforcement. The pandemic provided Not Afraid with an opening. In May 2020, the Crow Nation received $27 million in coronavirus relief funding through the CARES Act. Suddenly, he didn't need the BIA's money; he had enough to launch a police department on his own. Soon he'd hired about 15 officers, tripling the police presence on the reservation. \"I was excited about it,\" says Yolanda Fraser, ­Kaysera's grandmother. \"I thought that finally we would have a justice unit that could dig into\" missing-persons cases. However, tribal legal experts say Not Afraid failed to get the necessary approval from tribal lawmakers. \"Police departments need to be established by legislation-that wasn't there,\" says Dennis Bear Don't Walk, the tribe's former chief judge and now legislative counsel, who says Not Afraid also likely needed lawmakers to sign off on using CARES Act money for policing. Not Afraid declined to comment, but former officials who helped him launch the department told me they believed he had the power to control spending and establish law enforcement during an emergency like the pandemic. (The Treasury Department is reviewing the matter and declined to comment, as did the BIA.) In Indian Country, tribal chairs have sometimes faced accusations of co-opting police departments for their own purposes-officers can act as enforcers for whoever has the upper hand in tribal management. After the department launched in late June, Not Afraid put out press releases promising to prioritize community involvement and rehabilitation. But he also embraced tactics that appeared to benefit him personally. In August 2020, he responded to an uptick in Covid deaths by imposing a reservation-wide lockdown and curfew , which had public health benefits but also ­prevented political opponents from campaigning ahead of the November election-even as he held events to drum up support himself. Some doubted the legitimacy of Not Afraid's new force. \"What if they pull a gun on you: Are they a real cop?\" Big Man, the historian, wondered. Gerald \"Jay\" Harris, the chief prosecutor in Big Horn County, which includes most of the reservation, sent a memo to the sheriff's department warning that the county could be exposed to lawsuits if it worked with the tribal police, which Harris, who is also Crow, did not view as legitimate. The BIA kept patrolling alongside the new officers but sometimes wouldn't send calls through to them, according to sources familiar with the tribal force. Passes, the BIA officer, viewed the tribal cops as more of a \"militia group than a law enforcement department.\" The federal government had never invested enough resources to create a strong pipeline of trained local police. Shilo Bad Bear was hired as a supervising dispatcher of the new department, even though she only had about 10 months of prior experience. \"I was so scared-I didn't have the proper qualifications,\" she says. \"I basically had to learn by myself,\" adds another dispatcher, who asked for anonymity; she had no prior experience and says she received a sheet of 10 codes but no formal training. Shilo Bad Bear, a former 911 dispatcher for the Crow tribal police, says she was hired without much experience. Passes questioned whether the force's employees had undergone sufficient background checks; she recalled that the BIA had arrested some of them in the past. Some of the cops had retired years ago from other agencies, which meant they were no longer certified, according to one former officer, who also requested anonymity. Others had never worked as a cop. Under Montana law, they could patrol for almost a year before attending a police academy to become certified. It's a delay that's common in small rural departments, but one that Michael Gennaco, a consultant in California who specializes in civilian oversight of law enforcement, describes as \"a tragedy waiting to happen.\" Geoffrey Eastman, a tribal patrol sergeant who did have his certification, later testified in litigation surrounding Braven's death that \"there were no policies in place\" to show officers what was expected of them. And resources were tight. For a police headquarters, Not Afraid's administration purchased a closed-down Subway restaurant attached to a museum that commemorated the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn. Confused tourists often dropped in looking to order sandwiches, but the counter that once stored cold cuts had become a temporary shelf for officers' guns. \"It felt like a joke,\" says Bad Bear. \"We were making do with what we had,\" says the department's first police chief, Terrill Bracken, and \"building an airplane as we were flying.\" The goal was to create \"a department of the people, for the people,\" says Bracken, \"with tribal members policing their own.\" But recruiting Crow cops was challenging because of the long hours, low pay, and limited benefits, and because of the reservation's extensive clan system; few locals wanted a job that might involve arresting their relatives. So Not Afraid also brought in outsiders, who he hoped would be more impartial. Bracken himself was a white martial arts instructor from Billings who had briefly worked as a sheriff's deputy; he moved into a camping trailer outside the tribal police headquarters, away from his wife and two kids, so he could devote more time to the force. \"I had so much passion for that project,\" he says. \"It wasn't going to get done unless somebody stepped up.\" After one month, he was unexpectedly replaced; Crow local Larry Tobacco, who had previously worked for the BIA, became chief. The new police department also recruited from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Sheridan, Wyoming, which staffs about a dozen federal cops to patrol a manicured VA campus. \"The reservation stays very busy and you would be exposed to a lot more major crime than you are here,\" the VA's police chief told his team in May 2020, according to emails obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request. Under VA ethics guidelines, the agency's cops generally could not moonlight on the reservation if the tribal police received federal funding. Even though Not Afraid launched the force with CARES Act funds, the tribe assured the VA that no federal funds would be used, according to emails and interviews, so the VA ethics committee gave its blessing. (One former police official told me he was present when an attorney told Not Afraid that the funds became tribal after entering the tribe's bank accounts; a Treasury Department spokesperson said the funds still would have been federal. Not Afraid did not respond to my request for comment.) Former tribal police vehicles sit abandoned on the Crow reservation. Some Crow residents, including Old Bull, questioned whether it made sense to invite outside law enforcement onto the reservation. And these VA officers may not have been prepared for real policing, says Seth Stoughton, a former cop who lectures on policing issues at the University of South Carolina; patrolling a VA medical center, he says, is more like working as a security guard than as a municipal cop. Bracken tells me these officers had previously completed training in operating a police vehicle to get federal certification at the VA. But a VA spokesperson told me its officers receive no training in high-speed chases because they are banned by the agency. The night Braven died, it was a VA police officer turned tribal cop, Pamela Klier, who chased him. The Crow tribal police \"was a good thought,\" says Bad Bear, the dispatcher, but \"it seemed like something bad was bound to happen because these guys didn't know what they were doing.\" The morning before Braven died, he and his brother Emilio played basketball for a couple of hours. Then Braven went to his late grandma's house in Hardin to see his cousins Jayden and Trey, who were still grieving her death. He seemed fine, remembers Jayden; they \"danced each other up,\" like they always did to say hello, and then Braven went to fish at a nearby pond. Around 1 p.m., he texted his girlfriend and offered to pick her up at home after her shift at the Boys & Girls Club that evening. He could borrow the car at his grandma's house, a black Chevy Malibu, to make the 35-minute ride. It was already dark out when he hit the road, a crisp November night, but it hadn't snowed yet so it would be an easy drive. Blossom Old Bull didn't learn about the crash until several hours afterward. She had just woken up from a nap when she got a phone call. Braven's older brother Gavin was sobbing. He'd heard that Braven had been in an accident. \"Where is he? Which hospital do I go to?\" Old Bull asked frantically. \"He's dead,\" Gavin said, still crying. Old Bull dropped the phone and screamed. No! she yelled. How do you know? Emilio hit a shelf in the room he shared with Braven, breaking it. His sister Jolene threw herself on the floor and sobbed. They were all still crying, struggling to comfort each other, when they heard a knock on the door a half-hour later at 10 p.m. Outside, a tall man with a black shirt and badge stood on the rickety front steps. It was BIA Special Agent Jose Figueroa Jr., who'd just come from the crash site. A banner demanding justice for Braven hangs outside Old Bull's home. I'm sure you guys already know what happened , Figueroa said to Braven's older brother Keenan outside, according to Old Bull and court records . They clocked him going 90 and chased him, and he ended up going head-on with the train . Figueroa said the family could go to the mortuary the next morning. He asked whether Braven drank or did drugs, then left without offering condolences. When Braven's older brother returned inside, he had a confused look on his face. Speed limits often weren't enforced on the reservation. And Braven was always so slow behind the wheel. \"I didn't know what to think,\" Old Bull says. She was inclined to trust Figueroa, because her dad worked as a cop in South Dakota when she was younger. But Figueroa had hardly given the family any details-not even which agency had pursued her son-and she couldn't square the story she had been told about Braven speeding with the cautious boy she had raised. The next morning, she grew even more baffled when the mortuary owner said she couldn't see Braven's body yet. The owner didn't tell her that it had already been sent to a crime lab for an autopsy. Her confusion turned to shock in the days that followed. On the TV news, she learned that it was the tribal police who'd chased Braven, so she drove to their headquarters. But the force had by then disbanded, and the windows of the old Subway were covered in paper. Seething with anger, she tugged on the locked door and pressed her face against the windows, trying to see inside. \"There was a life taken, and you just closed everything down without giving the family any answers?\" she thought. When she went to the BIA office instead, looking for a police report, an officer handed her a sticky note that simply said \"FOIA.\" Over the next few months, she got an attorney, Nagle, who'd also been helping Kaysera's family, and they filed a Freedom of Information Act request for documents with the BIA, but the agency rejected it , citing an ongoing investigation. The question was, who was investigating? The BIA told Nagle that the FBI had jurisdiction, but an FBI agent told her his office had no case file for Braven. (The FBI, in response to my own FOIA request in 2022, would not confirm or deny whether it possessed documents related to Braven's death. The BIA told me both agencies initially investigated, but the FBI eventually took control because Klier was non-Native.) When Old Bull tried to get Braven's death certificate, an assistant at the Big Horn County court couldn't find it. When she tried to locate his car, the insurance company Progressive said authorities hadn't released it yet. For weeks, the only information she could access was from Braven's toxicology report; the coroner personally called to offer his condolences and to tell her that Braven had been drunk and had THC in his system when he died. It would take her four months to get the full autopsy report. She still didn't know the name of the officer who'd pursued her son or how the chase had unfolded. \"There was a life taken, and you just closed everything down without giving the family any answers?\" Old Bull, a medication aide at a nursing home, is far from naive when it comes to requesting medical documentation. But federal and state law enforcement have a reputation for keeping Native families in the dark after killings. \"It's expected for families not to get information,\" says Rae Peppers, a Crow former state lawmaker. Other families have also struggled to get basic paperwork after their loved ones died. \"They never notified me, not once,\" Fraser, Kaysera's grandmother and legal guardian, says of the sheriff's office that found Kaysera's body. \"It was hard, not getting any support,\" says Alvilene Buffalo Bull Tail, whose 14-year-old grandson, nicknamed Jr. Boy, was fatally hit by a train on the Crow reservation in 2017. Authorities deemed his death an accident, surmising that he fell asleep on the tracks; Buffalo Bull Tail suspects someone pushed him, and that law enforcement never properly investigated. \"We don't have closure until at least we know what really happened.\" In Lame Deer, a town on the Northern Cheyenne reservation bordering Crow, Maureen Bryant says her family still hasn't obtained a death certificate or autopsy report more than two years after her niece DeAnna Limberhand was found hogtied in the Stillwater River. Going to the courthouse for documents felt \"like a dead end.\" \"We kept waiting for paperwork or some kind of information, but we never heard,\" she says. \"What do you do if no one is helping you?\" she adds tearily. \"We're just going through a lot right now, and the not-knowing makes it even worse.\" Rae Peppers, a Crow former state lawmaker, says Native families often struggle to get information from federal and state law enforcement agencies after killings. The stonewalling led Old Bull and her family to speculate about what happened to Braven, and sometimes they clung to upsetting theories. When they went to the railroad after the crash and observed a second set of tire marks alongside Braven's leading from the highway through the grass to the railroad, they wondered whether the police ran him into the train. And they wondered if perhaps law enforcement's lack of transparency was a sign of something more nefarious. \"If you did nothing wrong, just release the information,\" Old Bull wanted to tell them. \"What is it you are trying to hide?\" Her suspicions heightened as witnesses came forward. According to her lawsuit, Maurice and Mavis Mountain Sheep, the couple who'd passed the wreck on their way to get gas, told her they had waited near the railroad for about a half-hour and didn't see anyone offer Braven first aid. Braven \"kept saying, 'Help me,'\" Mavis told the family. But law enforcement \"just stood there and stared at him.\" Old Bull also got a text from Bad Bear, the tribal police's dispatcher. \"I had quit by the time that occurred with your son but I can tell you right now, absolutely nothing was in compliance,\" Bad Bear wrote. \"That place should have not ever been opened...It was a shitshow there.\" For Old Bull, the lack of clarity about the night Braven died was like torture. And she isn't one to let something like this slide. In February 2023, she tried to sue Klier in federal court for wrongful death, hoping the court proceedings would bring new information to light. She had also sued the BIA, which sent officers to the scene of the crash, accusing the agency of negligently allowing the tribal police to operate without proper training and of failing to offer Braven medical care. \"The acts of the agents of Defendant United States shock the conscience and offend the community's sense of fair play and decency,\" her attorney wrote . Last April, a judge allowed Old Bull's case to proceed against the BIA, but not against Klier, because Klier had chased Braven in her capacity as a tribal employee, not a federal one. By then, it was too late for Old Bull to sue Klier in tribal court; she'd missed the tribe's statute of limitations. Old Bull decided to try a different tactic. In July 2023, she drove to Billings to share her story with a broader audience, including federal officials who were seeking feedback about law enforcement on reservations. She wasn't sure what to expect, but she hoped someone in power might finally listen. In the years since Braven died, President Biden had appointed the country's first Indigenous secretary of the interior, Deb Haaland. Before Haaland left Congress to take the job, she and other Native lawmakers passed a bill to hear testimony about crime and the crisis of missing Indigenous people. Now, Native families were coming from Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota to testify to a federal commission, some driving 20 hours round trip for a chance to speak for 15 minutes. Grace Bulltail, Kaysera's aunt, was a member of the commission and encouraged Old Bull to join. But Bulltail felt disappointed at the turnout of elected officials. \"We invited the Montana Department of Justice-nobody came,\" she says. Not even many Crow tribal leaders showed up. (A DOJ spokesperson said he wasn't aware of an invitation.) Still, Old Bull told me afterward that the gathering made her \"a little optimistic that something will change.\" It helped her feel less alone knowing that her family wasn't the only one waiting for answers. \"Listening to everyone's stories, you realize you're a piece of a big, big thing.\" The next month, I was in Crow Agency again, reporting on Braven's case. It had been nearly three years since Old Bull first started investigating the circumstances surrounding her son's death, but there'd been a big development since the last time I visited: The BIA had sent me an email with a trove of documents about the incident. It had taken me months of corresponding with the agency-after a year examining the case, interviewing dozens of people, and scouring court and government records-to get the details of her son's final minutes. I wondered whether my luck with the BIA had something to do with all the time that had passed, or my status as an outsider. Nagle, Old Bull's attorney, told me journalists are \"much more likely\" than Indigenous families to get documents from the federal government via the Freedom of Information Act. At Old Bull's house, she put on her glasses and joined me on the couch, where I spread out the highlighted pages for her to see. At first, what Old Bull read in the BIA's investigative report lined up with what she already knew. It all started on Highway 451 on November 24, she read. But the next detail made her purse her lips: At 5:39 p.m., Braven made a \"legal pass\" of Klier's police car over a dotted yellow line, according to the BIA's description of Klier's dashcam footage, which doesn't specify how fast he drove past her. Then, once he got in front of her, he slowed back down to the speed limit, about 70 mph, and Klier turned on her emergency lights to pull him over. He kept driving. Maybe he was afraid, Old Bull thought, remembering the officer who had choked him on his way to juvenile hall just months before the crash. In any case, Braven drove, still close to the speed limit. Seconds later, he slowed down considerably, and it appeared he might pull over. Klier, now following him at 55 mph, called dispatch and reported that he'd passed her at 90 mph. But Braven did not pull over. Klier activated her siren. Now, Braven began to accelerate, and she chased him. Seventy-seven miles per hour within half a minute. One hundred and nine miles per hour within a minute. They passed two other cars driving the opposite direction. Then Braven made a bold move. He turned off his headlights and other exterior lights, a tactic that drivers sometimes use to hide from police. At a bend in the highway, he went onto the grass, driving in the dark toward the railroad. Old Bull stopped reading and pushed her glasses onto her forehead. \"He legally passed her,\" she said. \"All this kid wanted to do was to go see his girlfriend, that was it. It doesn't make sense.\" She covered her face with her hands and cried. A \"compelling need\" for a police chase \"does not include the mere act of fleeing, even if reckless.\" One-third of all police chases in the United States end with a crash, often causing property damage, injury, or death. Many of these chases begin after an officer observes a traffic infraction, but because of the risks involved, some police departments only allow pursuits after a violent felony or something that puts the public in imminent danger. It's unclear whether the Crow police had a similar rule. Police Chief Tobacco and Sergeant Eastman testified in the lawsuit over Braven's death that there was not a handbook of policies and procedures in place, or at least they weren't aware of one. But the tribe submitted one to the BIA in the months leading up to the crash, according to records I obtained . That handbook states that an officer can only pursue a driver if there's a \"compelling need\" and if the chase presents less risk to the public than the driver remaining at large. A \"compelling need,\" the manual adds, \"does not include the mere act of fleeing, even if reckless,\" or \"traffic and licensing infractions, including DUI.\" Some police officers argue it's worthwhile to chase after a traffic violation, because maybe the driver is actually fleeing due to a bigger offense, like a dead body or bags of cocaine in the trunk. But suspicion alone, says Stoughton, the South Carolina expert, is not enough. \"If you aren't sure what the benefits of the pursuit are, but you do know the dangers,\" including a deadly crash, \"clearly the risks should outweigh the benefits,\" he says. \"Failing to stop for a speeding violation is not a good reason to kill someone.\" And that's especially true if the driver may be intoxicated, he says. In Braven's case, \"what's more dangerous-him driving the speed limit while drunk,\" or him being chased and \"driving 100 mph while drunk?\" says Stoughton, adding that Klier could have arrested him later: According to court documents, she'd already noted his license plate number. \"Had she terminated the pursuit,\" policing expert Susan Peters testified in Old Bull's lawsuit, \"more likely than not, Braven J. Glenn would not have been involved in a vehicular fatality accident.\" Scraps of burned metal, including a suspension spring, a radiator, and a wheel, are what's left of Braven's car near the site of the crash. As Old Bull and I read over the BIA reports, it became more and more apparent that the investigation into the crash had been flawed from the start. Moments after the crash, Klier called dispatch. \"Send medical,\" she said, according to call logs. \"He just got hit.\" Soon, other law enforcement arrived-from the tribal police, the BIA, the state highway patrol, the sheriff's office, and the fire department. But according to other records from the investigation, they struggled to get on the same page, a common complaint on reservations. Bodycam footage from Deputy Sheriff Michael Colvin, a county cop who was assigned to divert traffic, offers a small glimpse into the confusion. \"Hey, where's the body at?\" an officer asked Colvin. \"I don't know,\" Colvin said. \"Tribal PD was first on scene, and they told BIA where it was at...He said it wrecked some place down here.\" \"Was it crossing or what?\" \"I don't know. That's what I asked, but he didn't really give me an answer.\" Seconds later, paramedics drove past Colvin, lights flashing. A voice came over his radio: \"They're on scene, but they've been canceled.\" The paramedics left. Six minutes later, a tribal police officer called dispatch, according to records I obtained from the county attorney's office. \"Tribal asked why EMS canceled,\" the dispatcher noted in a call log , \"because they didn't make the determination the individual(s) were deceased.\" The tribal officer asked the paramedics to return. Later, Braven's girlfriend, Jordan, who drove over after Braven didn't pick her up after work, saw men loading a body bag into a white truck. Meanwhile, BIA special agent Figueroa arrived. According to an investigative report , he told Klier that the BIA would investigate the crash. Later, he told another tribal officer on the scene that Klier would need to have her blood drawn and that he needed the dashcam footage from her patrol vehicle. The officer acknowledged his request, but when Figueroa returned from speaking with the train conductor, Klier was gone and had taken the police car with her. The tribal officer had given Klier permission to go home, according to the report; she'd been visibly shaken up after the crash. \"It's like, what the fuck?\" says attorney Tim Bechtold, who is representing Old Bull in her lawsuit. \"All these cops not knowing what the fuck to do.\" Klier's decision to take her vehicle was \"incredibly unusual and wildly inappropriate,\" says Stoughton, the police expert in South Carolina. \"It's not that much different from an officer who's involved with a shooting taking their gun home instead of turning that over for evidence.\" A former tribal police officer, who requested anonymity, later told me he saw Klier at the police station soon after the crash. The officer drove to the railroad and alerted Figueroa that the car might be at headquarters. \"You need to go down there and get that vehicle now,\" he recalls telling Figueroa. But it's unclear if Figueroa went; he didn't locate the car that night. The next day, Figueroa told the Crow police department that he would need a copy of Klier's incident report and the dashcam footage. The following day was Thanksgiving. And a day after that, Figueroa learned the police department had already \"disbanded and closed shop,\" according to the BIA investigation. \"No one knows who has access to their reports.\" Then things got even more complicated. In mid-December, when Figueroa reminded the tribe that he still needed the report, he learned that someone had broken into the former police headquarters. Now the records he needed were missing. Figueroa still didn't know where Klier's police car was, either. So in January, he drove to Wyoming, where she lived and worked with the VA, to find her. She said she was waiting for an attorney and didn't want to talk. (She also declined my request for comment.) Figueroa drove back to Montana and reached out to the tribe's homeland security director, who said he was \"unsure where anything was,\" this time citing two break-ins at the police ­headquarters,­ but that he would try his best to find the records. (Police equipment, including guns, had also gone missing.) Two weeks later, in February, Figueroa learned the headquarters had suffered four break-ins, but someone had finally located Klier's police car; Figueroa copied the dashcam footage. In May, he obtained the BIA's dispatch logs, but the tribal police's logs concerning Braven's death-and Klier's incident report for it-were still missing. (They don't appear to have ever been recovered.) Harris, the former Big Horn county attorney, whose term ended in late 2022, believes the US government may be responsible, at least in part, for mistakes made by law enforcement that night. In addition to allegedly failing to provide potentially lifesaving medical care, the BIA did not properly secure the scene of the crash and allowed Klier's police car to get away, and then took months to find it. \"You would think [the BIA] would have their hair on fire chasing everybody down,\" says Jonathan Smith, who oversaw investigations into police department misconduct at Obama's Justice Department. If it took that long to locate the car, he adds, \"it seems unlikely they tried as hard as they could.\" Old Bull's lawsuit is scheduled for trial this summer. The US government denies any wrongdoing. Since the BIA did not employ the Crow's tribal police force, an attorney for the government wrote in response to the complaint, \"the United States cannot be held liable...for their negligence.\" \"There's so much they did wrong...It's like a ton of bricks just hits you. I fought so hard...It's like we don't matter, like we are nothing.\" After reading the BIA reports, Old Bull retraced the new information. \"There's so much they did wrong...It's like a ton of bricks just hits you,\" she told me, motioning with her hands toward her chest. She wondered whether things might have been different if she'd gotten some of this information sooner-whether it would have helped her legal case, or at the very least helped her heal. And it stung, she added, knowing that an outsider like me-a white journalist with no connection to Braven-could access all these FOIA records, while she, Braven's mother, had been denied. It took suing for her to begin getting evidence, and even that, she said, didn't include some of the key details I'd just shared with her. \"I fought so hard to get that, years and years,\" she said. \"It's like we don't matter, like we are nothing.\" Two days later, former tribal police chief Terrill Bracken arrived at my Airbnb in Billings. I'd told him that Old Bull was interested in seeing him. Bracken wasn't leading the police department when Braven died, and he knew little about the chase. But if Old Bull wanted to talk, meeting her seemed like the Christian thing to do, he said. \"Anything I can do to help her with the grief that she is going through, that's why I'm here,\" he told me. Old Bull, who'd worked a 12-hour shift at the nursing home that day, sat in her car outside the house for a moment before entering. For months, she'd been asking God to help her forgive, but it was hard to let go of all the resentments she carried. Maybe, she thought, it would be easier after talking with Bracken and hearing another perspective. \"I have to come face-to-face with somebody that started this whole thing, and just get some straightforward answers,\" she told me at the front door. After taking a seat opposite the former police chief, Old Bull anxiously tapped on her glass of water with her fingers, tears welling in her eyes. Bracken said he was sorry for her loss. She thanked him. \"That's our right to know what happened to our child,\" she said. \"And I never got that. I had to fight and fight and fight.\" \"And it should not have to be that way,\" Bracken agreed. \"It's frustrating for me,\" he added, \"because I know what we were working toward was going to be so much better,\" he said of the tribal police. Their conversation stretched on for two hours. At points, Old Bull seemed to soften toward Bracken. \"I do feel better with you talking to me. I can see you now as a person,\" she said. But when he began talking about Officer Klier, the mood shifted. \"For all we know,\" Bracken said of Klier, \"she's not doing very well right now.\" \"She's not the one hurting,\" Old Bull said quietly. \"I'm not saying who's suffering more. It's not a contest,\" Bracken responded. \"But I'm just being honest with you: Given the information that I have, I can't see how I would have acted any differently than the officer. And that's a difficult part of the job.\" Old Bull sighed. \"I gotta work in the morning,\" she said, signaling her intent to leave. \"Would it be okay if I prayed with you?\" he asked. She nodded, her eyes shut, and began crying after he placed his hands over hers. Driving home, Old Bull was glad to have spoken with Bracken. But as she lay in bed the next morning, recalling the conversation, her anger grew. \"For him to say, 'Oh, poor Pamela, I wonder what she's going through'? How dare you ,\" she thought. She picked up her phone and texted me: \"Samantha there was a lot that bothered me. He put her on this pedestal,\" she wrote. \"To sit there and emphasize her feelings, when this is about the loss of my son and her actions made that loss happen. I feel like it was an attempt...to glorify what she did as a cop.\" \"This is a system made to oppress us. It's been this way since Columbus,\" she added, before putting down her phone and heading to work. The doors of the tribal police headquarters were locked the first time I visited last year, but I could peek inside to see how abruptly it was all abandoned. The police's whiteboard calendar still showed the Thanksgiving party scheduled for the day Braven died. Stacks of unused call logs sat in dusty boxes. In the parking lot, a makeshift jail remained, two tiny cells inside a shipping container. The refrigerated counter that once held Subway's sandwich ingredients-and then guns-had been removed. The dining tables that the cops used as desks were piled outside beneath cottonwood trees. The temporary holding cell in a modified shipping container outside the former tribal police station The former tribal police station in a closed-down Subway store on the Crow reservation There was never a public explanation for why the department closed in late November 2020, leading to speculation. Old Bull still wonders whether the police are hiding something. Big Man, the historian, wonders if they packed up and left because of poor training and lack of community support, and because Braven's chase was \"the final straw.\" \"There were a lot of reasons why it shut down,\" says one of the tribal police officers who requested anonymity. \"It was starting to fail\" even before Braven's accident, and then \"the money stopped coming in.\" Bracken doubts Braven's death was the only motivation for disbanding, if it was a motivation at all. He blames politics: A few weeks before the crash, Chairman Not Afraid lost the election to Frank White Clay, a former tribal lawmaker who believed propping up a new police force with Covid relief funding violated federal spending guidelines. \"We're still trying to figure out exactly where that money went,\" White Clay would later tell a journalism student at the University of Montana in 2021. He agreed the reservation needed more law enforcement but said this police force was just \"playing cops.\" Rather than give White Clay the satisfaction of disbanding the force, Not Afraid beat him to it and shut down the department about a week before the inauguration, according to another former tribal police official. It was possible Braven's accident may have been \"the catalyst, the icing on the cake,\" but it wasn't the primary reason for closing, he said. Harris, the former Big Horn county attorney, says the department's sudden ­closure was evidence that it was never properly established. \"A legitimate, lawful police agency doesn't just end because a chairman or president or governor says, 'All right. Enough,'\" he tells me. \"This [police department] was a mirage, a facade.\" It was \"a temporary fix, nothing more than a Band-Aid,\" one of the former police officers tells me. \"Did we do everything perfectly? Absolutely not,\" says Bracken. \"But were we doing the best we could with what we had? Yes. I really believe that department would have flourished into something had it gotten a fair opportunity.\" The Crow police force's brief existence and abrupt end is not just a story about a tribal administration's mistakes, says Big Man. It is also a story about the federal government's repeated failures leading up to 2020-to keep families informed, to conduct thorough investigations, to keep the reservation safe. And it shows \"a real need for clear, meaningful communication\" with Crow people, says Kristina Lucero, who directs the American Indian Governance and Policy Institute at the University of Montana, \"about expected goals and the mission of what law enforcement should be doing.\" The police department was \"a temporary fix, nothing more than a Band-Aid.\" Many of the families who testified with Old Bull in Billings were adamant that they want more transparent policing, including easier access to information after loved ones die or go missing. \"Authorities at all levels must improve communications with family members, who are too often left in the dark for days, weeks, or months,\" causing \"enormous stress,\" the federal commission wrote afterward. Indigenous communities also want more funding: In 2022, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe in Montana sued the US government because of a shortage of police. The state's Fort Belknap Indian Community sued too, after the BIA refused to provide more public safety money. \"What's happening at Crow, that's pretty extreme,\" says UCLA's van Schilfgaarde, but \"when budgets are tight, these [police] departments come and go in a way that would just never happen in other communities.\" The problem isn't just in Montana, she adds. Most Native villages in Alaska have no law enforcement presence whatsoever. Two days after his inauguration in 2020, White Clay informed the BIA that \"an independent law enforcement effort is not the direction that the new administration of the Crow Tribe intends to continue.\" Since then, complaints about BIA policing persist. In July 2021, the tribe sued a BIA officer after he was caught on video failing to stop his dog from biting someone handcuffed after a traffic stop, for nearly a minute, leading to three surgeries on the man's ankle and foot. \"Unfortunately, nothing in this video is surprising to anyone who has lived on the Crow Nation,\" the tribe's attorney wrote. \"I had a lot of faith in the police before,\" Old Bull says, \"but after Braven died, I don't believe they're there to protect us.\" In December, President Biden signed an executive order to remove red tape that has hampered Native access to law enforcement funding. But legal action might be more effective. In May, a US district judge encouraged the feds to meet with the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota and \"figure out how to more fairly fund\" tribal policing-or else go to trial. The decision was \"the first to acknowledge that the government owes a treaty-based duty to fund law enforcement for [an] Indian tribe,\" according to the Oglala Sioux's attorneys. And they say it could at last force a legal reckoning over Washington's centuries-long harm to Native justice systems. A successful reckoning must give tribes more jurisdiction and make room for them to reimagine policing and public safety in ways that reflect their own cultures and customs, says Goldberg, the Obama appointee to the Indian Law and Order Commission. She's seen Indigenous communities that involve spiritual leaders in justice proceedings to weigh in on punishments and design a path forward. The Tulalip reservation in Washington state, in keeping with its values, has required police to stop by the Boys & Girls Club twice a shift to help kids with homework, and they attend elders' breakfasts to share data and answer questions. A successful reckoning must give tribes more jurisdiction and make room for them to reimagine policing and public safety in ways that reflect their own cultures and customs. On the Crow reservation, most people I asked said the tribe needed more law enforcement, but they also emphasized the importance of better officer training. Some said they wanted to think about public safety in a more balanced way, with funding for mental health, addiction treatment, housing, and education. Investments like these could make it easier to recruit good local cops, says the University of Montana's Lucero, since people might be less hesitant to police their relatives if the justice system offered more second chances and paths toward healing. \"You just can't arrest people, lock them up, and expect to throw them back in the same situation and change,\" says Big Man. \"Past traumas have created who we are,\" adds Old Bull. \"Get people into treatment and get them help and programs before moving in a police department.\" Tribal nations that are successful with law enforcement, says Goldberg, are ones with \"strong congruence between the views of the community and the way it's done.\" Braven's family built a memorial for him near the site of his death. Old Bull buried Braven about an hour from home, at the foot of the Pryor Mountains, next to the graves of his father and his cousin Kaysera. The cemetery is small and quiet, off a dirt path surrounded by fields, and most of the gravestones are simple, some with fake flowers and crosses. Old Bull and her family go there often to mow the grass around Braven's plot and decorate it with gifts, like chocolate-covered pretzels, one of his favorite snacks, and a basketball covered in their handwritten messages for him. At times they'll play music and reminisce about the ways he made them laugh, like how he'd make a muscle like Popeye and kiss it. When two of his older sisters got pregnant, they went to the cemetery and told him about it. When his younger sister graduated high school, she wore a cap beaded with the words, \"We did it Brave.\" They feel sometimes like he's still with them, even sending them messages. The night before his funeral, when Old Bull slept in a teepee with his remains, in keeping with her Lakota traditions, she and another family member heard a basketball bouncing in the middle of the night, even though everyone else had long since gone to bed. In August 2023, on what would have been his 20th birthday, Old Bull and her kids drive to the cemetery to visit Braven. They eat chocolate cupcakes with sprinkles, Braven's favorite, and release balloons into the sky for him. \"I want them to know he was a person too,\" Emilio says. \"He was a good kid and had big dreams, and for them to hide in the shadows-he deserves justice, the truth.\" \"Accountability and closure-that's what my mom really needs, what I really need,\" adds sister Marissa. \"I do want accountability, and I want them to admit this didn't have to happen,\" says Old Bull. On the drive home around 10 p.m., Old Bull sees a white owl sitting on the side of the road. In her tradition, owls are harbingers of death. The last time she encountered one, her mom died, and not too long afterward Braven did, too. When she arrives home it's almost midnight, and she lights a bundle of sage and cedar, calling her kids and grandkids out of the house to smudge them and help keep them safe. \"Bring the babies out,\" she instructs, walking to each person with the bundle and watching as they wave the smoke over their heads and into their hearts, all the way down to their legs. \"Who's next?\" This project was completed with the support of a grant from Columbia University's Ira A. Lipman Center for Journalism and Civil and Human Rights in conjunction with Arnold Ventures. Old Bull visits the memorial placed where Braven died.\n\nSubscribe to Mother Jones podcasts on Apple Podcasts or your favorite podcast app.\n\nThe disappearance of a new police department so soon after the wreck was highly unusual, the kind of story you might never hear twice. But other parts of Braven's story were deeply familiar: unanswered questions after deaths on the reservation, inadequate law enforcement. Before 2020, the federal government controlled policing in the Crow Nation-providing only a handful of officers for an area two-thirds the size of Connecticut. Crimes went unsolved , grieving relatives complained of faulty investigations, and some victims wouldn't even call for help, fearing violence by officers. (Nationally, police kill Native Americans at higher rates than other people of color.) The Crow's tribal police department was a desperately needed but underfunded counterbalance to a federal system that isn't working. And Braven was caught up in the dysfunction.\n\nSo, too, was Old Bull. After the tribal cops disappeared, it felt like nobody in power would talk to her, like nobody noticed the life that was lost or took responsibility for it. \"They come on Native land and they kill, and they just walk away. They think nobody is gonna care,\" she said as she drove home from the train tracks, the sun almost set, the clouds a deep blue behind her. \"I think they thought that's how our family was gonna be-that we were gonna let this go.\"\n\n\"They didn't expect us to speak out and try to get answers,\" she added.\n\nBlossom Old Bull in her home in Crow Agency, Montana\n\nThe Crow tribe has about 13,400 members, most of whom live on or around the reservation in southeastern Montana, a lush landscape with towering mountains, open skies, and rivers teeming with trout. The tribal nation earns some revenue from its vast coal and oil reserves. Most people speak Crow as a first language, and the matrilineal clan system remains strong.\n\nBraven and his mom moved to the reservation when he was in eighth grade. Old Bull, a single mom and health care worker from South Dakota, is Lakota, not Crow, and she'd been raising Braven in New Mexico; he was her youngest boy, the eighth of nine siblings. But she wanted him to grow up closer to his father, who was Crow, and some of his older brothers and sisters, and to learn more about that part of his Native heritage. When she'd spent time on the reservation previously, she recalled families camping in teepees for Crow Fair, an annual celebration with a powwow and horse racing and a rodeo, or enjoying the Sun Dance and sweat lodges.\n\nBraven hadn't wanted to move away from Albuquerque. He was a sensitive kid, and he cried in 2017 when he learned he'd have to leave his basketball team behind. In Montana, the family settled in the town of Crow Agency in a shabby one-story house that they spruced up with fresh paint. It was a rough transition; weeks after they arrived, Braven's dad died from pneumonia after a struggle with alcoholism. Braven, only 13 years old, stood at his bedside the day they pulled him off life support. I know you weren't there for me because you were sick , he said, but I still love you. \"He was such a good-hearted person, to even think in those terms at that age,\" says his sister Marissa.\n\nBraven did his best to settle into the bunkbed room he now shared with his older brother Emilio, who played basketball with him on the corner courts. He grew closer with his half siblings' grandmother, who adopted him as her own grandson. He loved spending time at her house and would offer to drive her to appointments, help her carry groceries, and put the pots away on the top shelf of her kitchen.\n\nBraven was an honor-roll student who ran cross country and track and played JV basketball.\n\nThough he hadn't wanted to move to the reservation, it didn't take long for Braven to hit his stride. His cousin Jayden remembers how quickly Braven made friends: \"I left for the summer and came back and everyone knew him. He was really popular.\" \"He had a goofy personality,\" says his girlfriend, Jordan Jefferson. As the years passed, Braven excelled-an honor-roll student who ran cross country and track and played JV basketball, and who was unanimously chosen by his teammates to co-manage the varsity squad, which he hoped to eventually join himself, running miles most days to get in better shape. \"He was one of a kind and always ready to take the challenge,\" says Mike Beads Don't Mix, his freshman coach.\n\nBut the pandemic marked the start of a shift after Braven's high school switched to remote learning and he couldn't see his friends much. In August 2020, the month he was turning 17, his grandma got Covid; she fell into a coma and was unable to sing him \"Happy Birthday\" like she normally did. Weeks later, she was dead. \"He took it really hard\" and \"got a little more distant from all of us,\" his sister JoLee remembers. In his bedroom, Braven played his grandma's favorite song, \"Blue Ain't Your Color\" by Keith Urban, over and over. His grades slipped, and he started drinking more.\n\nThe week of Braven's birthday, Old Bull found him passed out on a couch at his older brother's house. He lashed out at her after she roused him, and she called the cops, hoping they might teach him a lesson. The police arrested him for disorderly conduct and took him to juvenile detention in Billings, about an hour away.\n\n\"My mom, she had to raise all these kids on her own, so I guess you could say she's tough, but not mean,\" Emilio says. \"She's loving, she'd get us a bunch of basketball shoes, but she's gonna give you the tough love you need to succeed in this world.\"\n\nWhen Braven returned three days later, now on probation, he hugged Old Bull and gave her a letter he'd written apologizing for the incident. \"I never want to leave your side again,\" he wrote. \"I know everybody in our family is disappointed in me...I was crying while writing this letter just because I realized how bad I hurt you.\"\n\nHe told Old Bull that on his way to detention, an arresting officer from the Crow tribal police \"choked [him] out,\" according to court records, and that it had scared him, reaffirming all the bad stories he'd heard about law enforcement: His cousin Jayden once watched a cop push his uncle's head into the concrete, and they both remembered when officers at Crow Fair beat Braven's 15-year-old cousin Esaias Stops Pretty Places. This is why I didn't want to call the police , Old Bull told him. \"But you need to learn now, Braven, that if somebody needs to call the cops on you,\" she added, \"this is what will happen.\"\n\nTattoos in memory of her son Braven Glenn adorn Blossom Old Bull's forearm.\n\nFor centuries before the Europeans arrived, the Crow had no police. Instead, warrior groups protected people and enforced laws like the rules of the buffalo hunt. \"There's a big difference between a warrior and a cop,\" says Crow historian Alden Big Man Jr., who has studied the tribe's traditional systems of justice. Warriors' punishments could be harsh, including things like burning down a person's home or killing his horses, but if the offender responded favorably, the warriors would compensate his loss, perhaps giving him as many horses as had been taken away.\n\nIn the 1800s, the federal government confined the Crow, also known as the Apsáalooke, to the reservation; white settlers often shot at people who tried to leave. The tribe's nomadic hunters and gatherers were forced to become sedentary farmers and to accept Christianity, learn English, and educate their kids in the colonizers' way. As railroads brought white ranchers into their grazing areas and banks denied Crows loans, the former warriors were \"reduced to begging for handouts during ration days,\" according to Big Man, while they \"witnessed a complete annihilation of the buffalo, as well as the disappearance of a whole way of life.\" In 1887, after a Crow man led a war party off the reservation to steal horses, a colonial agent sent the party to jail. \"It was right then and there,\" says Big Man, that in the Crow Nation \"the system changed from warrior societies to the government enforcing the law.\"\n\nAround that time, the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) began appointing Native officers to police reservations-ordering them to prohibit traditional rituals that the colonizers viewed as immoral, ration food and other supplies, and stop any activities that might interfere with white economic pursuits. In 1885, Congress had taken away Native nations' right to prosecute serious crimes like homicides committed by Native people against other Natives on reservations. (US lawmakers were outraged that a Sioux government in South Dakota had punished a killer according to its own principles of justice -rather than the death penalty, it had fined him $600, eight horses, and a blanket.) Instead, murders and other violent offenses would be investigated by federal agents, some of whom traveled long distances to tribal territories and had little to no long-standing relationship with the people who lived there.\n\nNearly a century later, as activists from the American Indian Movement protested police brutality and rising crime, Congress passed the 1975 Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act , which created a path for tribes to take back more control of law enforcement. If tribal nations were able to jump through the hoops needed to secure a contract with the BIA, they could divert federal dollars intended for BIA cops to their own tribal police. \"It was a real game-changer,\" says Lauren van Schilfgaarde, an Indian law scholar who is Cochiti Pueblo and previously directed UCLA's Tribal Legal Development Clinic. Tribes have since set up more than 200 law enforcement agencies on reservations, far surpassing the number of BIA agencies.\n\nBut many tribes were not able to get a contract, including the Crow, and those that have tribal police still lack jurisdiction over major crimes. In 1978, the Supreme Court also removed their ability to prosecute non-Natives, even for most minor crimes. \"Even if you have infinite dollars, if your police departments have questionable, shaky, or even no authority over any person within their territorial boundaries, that compromises the entire enterprise,\" van Schilfgaarde says.\n\nThe federal government, meanwhile, skimped on funding for reservation cops, much as it skimped on health care, education, housing, and rural infrastructure. By 2001, violent crime on reservations was double or triple the national average. \"Ultimately, you are of your environment,\" Aaron Brien, a historian for the Crow tribe, says in the recent documentary Murder in Big Horn . \"When you take an entire society and strip them of any confidence and self-worth they have, it becomes very fragile.\" Tribes barely had half the policing resources per capita as non-Native communities: While Baltimore, Detroit, New York City, and DC had between four and seven officers per thousand residents, few tribal departments had ratios of more than two officers per thousand residents. As some communities of color protested overpolicing in cities, says van Schilfgaarde, reservations suffered the opposite extreme, coupled with a lack of resources to address public safety through other means like addiction treatment, employment, and schooling. \"It's incredibly frustrating and dangerous,\" she says.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, Congress passed the Tribal Law and Order Act , creating a commission to study the problem. The commission, which included Republican and Democratic lawmakers along with Indian law experts, recommended the federal government pay to nearly double the number of reservation police-noting that crime dropped by more than one-third on four reservations that hired extra cops during a pilot program in 2009. The tribes themselves, instead of the BIA, should lead the police, the commission argued; this change would help build trust with the community and more closely reflect tribal priorities and customs. \"Public safety in Indian Country can improve dramatically once Native nations and Tribes have greater freedom to build and maintain their own criminal justice systems,\" the commission wrote , describing the federal policing system as \"a maze of injustice.\" The commission set a goal of 2024 to \"close the public safety gap\" on reservations.\n\nBut by 2018, the number of BIA-funded officers on reservations hadn't grown at all-in fact, it had fallen by about one-third. Carole Goldberg, a commission member appointed by Obama, says Trump's administration seemed more focused on approving oil pipelines on Native land than on reforming reservation law enforcement. By 2020, the BIA estimated tribes needed $1.4 billion to handle policing nationally but admitted it was only providing $246 million, almost the same budget as a decade earlier. (The Department of Justice provided less than $100 million.) \"It's like working with strings and tin cans at times,\" Robert Bryant, chief of police for the Penobscot Nation, had testified to the commission.\n\nDuring parts of that year, the Crow Nation had just four BIA police to cover an expanse of 3,500 square miles. BIA cops were stretched so thin that \"we were pulling 18-hour days\" and \"going months without a day off,\" says Josie Passes, a former officer who wrote a letter to members of Congress begging for backup. A perceived lack of accountability contributed to a climate of fear. \"When you start thinking about it,\" says Birdie Real Bird, 70, a lifelong Crow resident whose aunt was assaulted during a home break-in and never received a visit from police, \"you're a sitting duck.\"\n\nAdd to that the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, an international problem that's particularly severe in the Crow Nation, where girls are sometimes sex-trafficked and used as drug mules along Interstate 90. Seventy-four people disappeared on the Crow and neighboring Northern Cheyenne reservations in 2019-more than any other area of Montana, which has one of the highest rates of missing Indigenous women nationally. One of them was Braven's cousin Kaysera Stops Pretty Places , an 18-year-old who loved to sing, dance, run, and wrestle. Five days after she disappeared, the sheriff's office found her body face down in a fenced backyard, but the office didn't notify her family for nearly two weeks. Four and a half years later, her cause of death remains undetermined . Families of the missing often complain about poor transparency and inadequate investigations, and jurisdictional barriers make the situation worse. The BIA can't arrest people for crimes committed off the reservation, even in border towns like Hardin, where Kaysera died. And on the reservation, other agencies-like the FBI or the sheriff's office-might have jurisdiction depending on the type of offense and whether the perpetrator was Native. Because it's often unclear whether a crime took place on or off the reservation and who the perpetrator was, it's easy for law enforcement to avoid responsibility. When corpses are discovered, investigators regularly write off the deaths as accidental. Commonly, \"when our Native women and girls go missing,\" says Mary Kathryn Nagle, a Cherokee attorney who assisted Kaysera's relatives, \"law enforcement chooses to do nothing, and it's up to the family members to do the hard work of investigating.\" \"When you start thinking about it, you're a sitting duck.\" By 2019, the Crow reservation was desperate for a change. In August, one of the few BIA cops there-the police chief, no less-quit in protest of his agency's understaffing. That November, Crow Chairman AJ Not Afraid, the tribe's chief executive, issued an emergency declaration over the shortage of police. Days later, he traveled to DC with other Native leaders to discuss the issue with President Trump, whose administration was announcing Operation Lady Justice, an initiative to improve the federal response to tribes' missing-persons cases. Some Indigenous critics described the effort as uninformed. Trump, for his part, seemed fixated on the Crow chairman's name. \"Is it true-you're not afraid? Are you not afraid of anything?\" Trump asked, laughing. On New Year's Day 2020, Not Afraid's 16-year-old niece, Selena Not Afraid, went missing at a rest stop between Hardin and Billings. A search party, which included Braven, scoured the surrounding fields with ATVs, helicopters, horses, dogs, and drones. Three weeks later, a team from the Interior Department discovered her body less than a mile away. Her death was attributed to hypothermia, but some locals suspected foul play. Selena's sister had previously died in a hit-and-run, and her brother was killed by the Billings police. \"The Crow Tribe,\" Not Afraid had said in his emergency declaration, \"will no longer accept 'lip service' for the unacceptable lack of law enforcement.\" It was long past time, he and his administration believed, to create their own tribal force. Not Afraid pleaded with the BIA to fund a new police department, according to records of their correspondence. But the BIA kept denying his request , arguing that the tribe, which didn't have a jail or other necessary infrastructure, hadn't fulfilled application requirements and couldn't effectively manage law enforcement. The pandemic provided Not Afraid with an opening. In May 2020, the Crow Nation received $27 million in coronavirus relief funding through the CARES Act. Suddenly, he didn't need the BIA's money; he had enough to launch a police department on his own. Soon he'd hired about 15 officers, tripling the police presence on the reservation. \"I was excited about it,\" says Yolanda Fraser, ­Kaysera's grandmother. \"I thought that finally we would have a justice unit that could dig into\" missing-persons cases. However, tribal legal experts say Not Afraid failed to get the necessary approval from tribal lawmakers. \"Police departments need to be established by legislation-that wasn't there,\" says Dennis Bear Don't Walk, the tribe's former chief judge and now legislative counsel, who says Not Afraid also likely needed lawmakers to sign off on using CARES Act money for policing. Not Afraid declined to comment, but former officials who helped him launch the department told me they believed he had the power to control spending and establish law enforcement during an emergency like the pandemic. (The Treasury Department is reviewing the matter and declined to comment, as did the BIA.) In Indian Country, tribal chairs have sometimes faced accusations of co-opting police departments for their own purposes-officers can act as enforcers for whoever has the upper hand in tribal management. After the department launched in late June, Not Afraid put out press releases promising to prioritize community involvement and rehabilitation. But he also embraced tactics that appeared to benefit him personally. In August 2020, he responded to an uptick in Covid deaths by imposing a reservation-wide lockdown and curfew , which had public health benefits but also ­prevented political opponents from campaigning ahead of the November election-even as he held events to drum up support himself. Some doubted the legitimacy of Not Afraid's new force. \"What if they pull a gun on you: Are they a real cop?\" Big Man, the historian, wondered. Gerald \"Jay\" Harris, the chief prosecutor in Big Horn County, which includes most of the reservation, sent a memo to the sheriff's department warning that the county could be exposed to lawsuits if it worked with the tribal police, which Harris, who is also Crow, did not view as legitimate. The BIA kept patrolling alongside the new officers but sometimes wouldn't send calls through to them, according to sources familiar with the tribal force. Passes, the BIA officer, viewed the tribal cops as more of a \"militia group than a law enforcement department.\" The federal government had never invested enough resources to create a strong pipeline of trained local police. Shilo Bad Bear was hired as a supervising dispatcher of the new department, even though she only had about 10 months of prior experience. \"I was so scared-I didn't have the proper qualifications,\" she says. \"I basically had to learn by myself,\" adds another dispatcher, who asked for anonymity; she had no prior experience and says she received a sheet of 10 codes but no formal training. Shilo Bad Bear, a former 911 dispatcher for the Crow tribal police, says she was hired without much experience. Passes questioned whether the force's employees had undergone sufficient background checks; she recalled that the BIA had arrested some of them in the past. Some of the cops had retired years ago from other agencies, which meant they were no longer certified, according to one former officer, who also requested anonymity. Others had never worked as a cop. Under Montana law, they could patrol for almost a year before attending a police academy to become certified. It's a delay that's common in small rural departments, but one that Michael Gennaco, a consultant in California who specializes in civilian oversight of law enforcement, describes as \"a tragedy waiting to happen.\" Geoffrey Eastman, a tribal patrol sergeant who did have his certification, later testified in litigation surrounding Braven's death that \"there were no policies in place\" to show officers what was expected of them. And resources were tight. For a police headquarters, Not Afraid's administration purchased a closed-down Subway restaurant attached to a museum that commemorated the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn. Confused tourists often dropped in looking to order sandwiches, but the counter that once stored cold cuts had become a temporary shelf for officers' guns. \"It felt like a joke,\" says Bad Bear. \"We were making do with what we had,\" says the department's first police chief, Terrill Bracken, and \"building an airplane as we were flying.\" The goal was to create \"a department of the people, for the people,\" says Bracken, \"with tribal members policing their own.\" But recruiting Crow cops was challenging because of the long hours, low pay, and limited benefits, and because of the reservation's extensive clan system; few locals wanted a job that might involve arresting their relatives. So Not Afraid also brought in outsiders, who he hoped would be more impartial. Bracken himself was a white martial arts instructor from Billings who had briefly worked as a sheriff's deputy; he moved into a camping trailer outside the tribal police headquarters, away from his wife and two kids, so he could devote more time to the force. \"I had so much passion for that project,\" he says. \"It wasn't going to get done unless somebody stepped up.\" After one month, he was unexpectedly replaced; Crow local Larry Tobacco, who had previously worked for the BIA, became chief. The new police department also recruited from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Sheridan, Wyoming, which staffs about a dozen federal cops to patrol a manicured VA campus. \"The reservation stays very busy and you would be exposed to a lot more major crime than you are here,\" the VA's police chief told his team in May 2020, according to emails obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request. Under VA ethics guidelines, the agency's cops generally could not moonlight on the reservation if the tribal police received federal funding. Even though Not Afraid launched the force with CARES Act funds, the tribe assured the VA that no federal funds would be used, according to emails and interviews, so the VA ethics committee gave its blessing. (One former police official told me he was present when an attorney told Not Afraid that the funds became tribal after entering the tribe's bank accounts; a Treasury Department spokesperson said the funds still would have been federal. Not Afraid did not respond to my request for comment.) Former tribal police vehicles sit abandoned on the Crow reservation. Some Crow residents, including Old Bull, questioned whether it made sense to invite outside law enforcement onto the reservation. And these VA officers may not have been prepared for real policing, says Seth Stoughton, a former cop who lectures on policing issues at the University of South Carolina; patrolling a VA medical center, he says, is more like working as a security guard than as a municipal cop. Bracken tells me these officers had previously completed training in operating a police vehicle to get federal certification at the VA. But a VA spokesperson told me its officers receive no training in high-speed chases because they are banned by the agency. The night Braven died, it was a VA police officer turned tribal cop, Pamela Klier, who chased him. The Crow tribal police \"was a good thought,\" says Bad Bear, the dispatcher, but \"it seemed like something bad was bound to happen because these guys didn't know what they were doing.\" The morning before Braven died, he and his brother Emilio played basketball for a couple of hours. Then Braven went to his late grandma's house in Hardin to see his cousins Jayden and Trey, who were still grieving her death. He seemed fine, remembers Jayden; they \"danced each other up,\" like they always did to say hello, and then Braven went to fish at a nearby pond. Around 1 p.m., he texted his girlfriend and offered to pick her up at home after her shift at the Boys & Girls Club that evening. He could borrow the car at his grandma's house, a black Chevy Malibu, to make the 35-minute ride. It was already dark out when he hit the road, a crisp November night, but it hadn't snowed yet so it would be an easy drive. Blossom Old Bull didn't learn about the crash until several hours afterward. She had just woken up from a nap when she got a phone call. Braven's older brother Gavin was sobbing. He'd heard that Braven had been in an accident. \"Where is he? Which hospital do I go to?\" Old Bull asked frantically. \"He's dead,\" Gavin said, still crying. Old Bull dropped the phone and screamed. No! she yelled. How do you know? Emilio hit a shelf in the room he shared with Braven, breaking it. His sister Jolene threw herself on the floor and sobbed. They were all still crying, struggling to comfort each other, when they heard a knock on the door a half-hour later at 10 p.m. Outside, a tall man with a black shirt and badge stood on the rickety front steps. It was BIA Special Agent Jose Figueroa Jr., who'd just come from the crash site. A banner demanding justice for Braven hangs outside Old Bull's home. I'm sure you guys already know what happened , Figueroa said to Braven's older brother Keenan outside, according to Old Bull and court records . They clocked him going 90 and chased him, and he ended up going head-on with the train . Figueroa said the family could go to the mortuary the next morning. He asked whether Braven drank or did drugs, then left without offering condolences. When Braven's older brother returned inside, he had a confused look on his face. Speed limits often weren't enforced on the reservation. And Braven was always so slow behind the wheel. \"I didn't know what to think,\" Old Bull says. She was inclined to trust Figueroa, because her dad worked as a cop in South Dakota when she was younger. But Figueroa had hardly given the family any details-not even which agency had pursued her son-and she couldn't square the story she had been told about Braven speeding with the cautious boy she had raised. The next morning, she grew even more baffled when the mortuary owner said she couldn't see Braven's body yet. The owner didn't tell her that it had already been sent to a crime lab for an autopsy. Her confusion turned to shock in the days that followed. On the TV news, she learned that it was the tribal police who'd chased Braven, so she drove to their headquarters. But the force had by then disbanded, and the windows of the old Subway were covered in paper. Seething with anger, she tugged on the locked door and pressed her face against the windows, trying to see inside. \"There was a life taken, and you just closed everything down without giving the family any answers?\" she thought. When she went to the BIA office instead, looking for a police report, an officer handed her a sticky note that simply said \"FOIA.\" Over the next few months, she got an attorney, Nagle, who'd also been helping Kaysera's family, and they filed a Freedom of Information Act request for documents with the BIA, but the agency rejected it , citing an ongoing investigation. The question was, who was investigating? The BIA told Nagle that the FBI had jurisdiction, but an FBI agent told her his office had no case file for Braven. (The FBI, in response to my own FOIA request in 2022, would not confirm or deny whether it possessed documents related to Braven's death. The BIA told me both agencies initially investigated, but the FBI eventually took control because Klier was non-Native.) When Old Bull tried to get Braven's death certificate, an assistant at the Big Horn County court couldn't find it. When she tried to locate his car, the insurance company Progressive said authorities hadn't released it yet. For weeks, the only information she could access was from Braven's toxicology report; the coroner personally called to offer his condolences and to tell her that Braven had been drunk and had THC in his system when he died. It would take her four months to get the full autopsy report. She still didn't know the name of the officer who'd pursued her son or how the chase had unfolded. \"There was a life taken, and you just closed everything down without giving the family any answers?\" Old Bull, a medication aide at a nursing home, is far from naive when it comes to requesting medical documentation. But federal and state law enforcement have a reputation for keeping Native families in the dark after killings. \"It's expected for families not to get information,\" says Rae Peppers, a Crow former state lawmaker. Other families have also struggled to get basic paperwork after their loved ones died. \"They never notified me, not once,\" Fraser, Kaysera's grandmother and legal guardian, says of the sheriff's office that found Kaysera's body. \"It was hard, not getting any support,\" says Alvilene Buffalo Bull Tail, whose 14-year-old grandson, nicknamed Jr. Boy, was fatally hit by a train on the Crow reservation in 2017. Authorities deemed his death an accident, surmising that he fell asleep on the tracks; Buffalo Bull Tail suspects someone pushed him, and that law enforcement never properly investigated. \"We don't have closure until at least we know what really happened.\" In Lame Deer, a town on the Northern Cheyenne reservation bordering Crow, Maureen Bryant says her family still hasn't obtained a death certificate or autopsy report more than two years after her niece DeAnna Limberhand was found hogtied in the Stillwater River. Going to the courthouse for documents felt \"like a dead end.\" \"We kept waiting for paperwork or some kind of information, but we never heard,\" she says. \"What do you do if no one is helping you?\" she adds tearily. \"We're just going through a lot right now, and the not-knowing makes it even worse.\" Rae Peppers, a Crow former state lawmaker, says Native families often struggle to get information from federal and state law enforcement agencies after killings. The stonewalling led Old Bull and her family to speculate about what happened to Braven, and sometimes they clung to upsetting theories. When they went to the railroad after the crash and observed a second set of tire marks alongside Braven's leading from the highway through the grass to the railroad, they wondered whether the police ran him into the train. And they wondered if perhaps law enforcement's lack of transparency was a sign of something more nefarious. \"If you did nothing wrong, just release the information,\" Old Bull wanted to tell them. \"What is it you are trying to hide?\" Her suspicions heightened as witnesses came forward. According to her lawsuit, Maurice and Mavis Mountain Sheep, the couple who'd passed the wreck on their way to get gas, told her they had waited near the railroad for about a half-hour and didn't see anyone offer Braven first aid. Braven \"kept saying, 'Help me,'\" Mavis told the family. But law enforcement \"just stood there and stared at him.\" Old Bull also got a text from Bad Bear, the tribal police's dispatcher. \"I had quit by the time that occurred with your son but I can tell you right now, absolutely nothing was in compliance,\" Bad Bear wrote. \"That place should have not ever been opened...It was a shitshow there.\" For Old Bull, the lack of clarity about the night Braven died was like torture. And she isn't one to let something like this slide. In February 2023, she tried to sue Klier in federal court for wrongful death, hoping the court proceedings would bring new information to light. She had also sued the BIA, which sent officers to the scene of the crash, accusing the agency of negligently allowing the tribal police to operate without proper training and of failing to offer Braven medical care. \"The acts of the agents of Defendant United States shock the conscience and offend the community's sense of fair play and decency,\" her attorney wrote . Last April, a judge allowed Old Bull's case to proceed against the BIA, but not against Klier, because Klier had chased Braven in her capacity as a tribal employee, not a federal one. By then, it was too late for Old Bull to sue Klier in tribal court; she'd missed the tribe's statute of limitations. Old Bull decided to try a different tactic. In July 2023, she drove to Billings to share her story with a broader audience, including federal officials who were seeking feedback about law enforcement on reservations. She wasn't sure what to expect, but she hoped someone in power might finally listen. In the years since Braven died, President Biden had appointed the country's first Indigenous secretary of the interior, Deb Haaland. Before Haaland left Congress to take the job, she and other Native lawmakers passed a bill to hear testimony about crime and the crisis of missing Indigenous people. Now, Native families were coming from Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota to testify to a federal commission, some driving 20 hours round trip for a chance to speak for 15 minutes. Grace Bulltail, Kaysera's aunt, was a member of the commission and encouraged Old Bull to join. But Bulltail felt disappointed at the turnout of elected officials. \"We invited the Montana Department of Justice-nobody came,\" she says. Not even many Crow tribal leaders showed up. (A DOJ spokesperson said he wasn't aware of an invitation.) Still, Old Bull told me afterward that the gathering made her \"a little optimistic that something will change.\" It helped her feel less alone knowing that her family wasn't the only one waiting for answers. \"Listening to everyone's stories, you realize you're a piece of a big, big thing.\" The next month, I was in Crow Agency again, reporting on Braven's case. It had been nearly three years since Old Bull first started investigating the circumstances surrounding her son's death, but there'd been a big development since the last time I visited: The BIA had sent me an email with a trove of documents about the incident. It had taken me months of corresponding with the agency-after a year examining the case, interviewing dozens of people, and scouring court and government records-to get the details of her son's final minutes. I wondered whether my luck with the BIA had something to do with all the time that had passed, or my status as an outsider. Nagle, Old Bull's attorney, told me journalists are \"much more likely\" than Indigenous families to get documents from the federal government via the Freedom of Information Act. At Old Bull's house, she put on her glasses and joined me on the couch, where I spread out the highlighted pages for her to see. At first, what Old Bull read in the BIA's investigative report lined up with what she already knew. It all started on Highway 451 on November 24, she read. But the next detail made her purse her lips: At 5:39 p.m., Braven made a \"legal pass\" of Klier's police car over a dotted yellow line, according to the BIA's description of Klier's dashcam footage, which doesn't specify how fast he drove past her. Then, once he got in front of her, he slowed back down to the speed limit, about 70 mph, and Klier turned on her emergency lights to pull him over. He kept driving. Maybe he was afraid, Old Bull thought, remembering the officer who had choked him on his way to juvenile hall just months before the crash. In any case, Braven drove, still close to the speed limit. Seconds later, he slowed down considerably, and it appeared he might pull over. Klier, now following him at 55 mph, called dispatch and reported that he'd passed her at 90 mph. But Braven did not pull over. Klier activated her siren. Now, Braven began to accelerate, and she chased him. Seventy-seven miles per hour within half a minute. One hundred and nine miles per hour within a minute. They passed two other cars driving the opposite direction. Then Braven made a bold move. He turned off his headlights and other exterior lights, a tactic that drivers sometimes use to hide from police. At a bend in the highway, he went onto the grass, driving in the dark toward the railroad. Old Bull stopped reading and pushed her glasses onto her forehead. \"He legally passed her,\" she said. \"All this kid wanted to do was to go see his girlfriend, that was it. It doesn't make sense.\" She covered her face with her hands and cried. A \"compelling need\" for a police chase \"does not include the mere act of fleeing, even if reckless.\" One-third of all police chases in the United States end with a crash, often causing property damage, injury, or death. Many of these chases begin after an officer observes a traffic infraction, but because of the risks involved, some police departments only allow pursuits after a violent felony or something that puts the public in imminent danger. It's unclear whether the Crow police had a similar rule. Police Chief Tobacco and Sergeant Eastman testified in the lawsuit over Braven's death that there was not a handbook of policies and procedures in place, or at least they weren't aware of one. But the tribe submitted one to the BIA in the months leading up to the crash, according to records I obtained . That handbook states that an officer can only pursue a driver if there's a \"compelling need\" and if the chase presents less risk to the public than the driver remaining at large. A \"compelling need,\" the manual adds, \"does not include the mere act of fleeing, even if reckless,\" or \"traffic and licensing infractions, including DUI.\" Some police officers argue it's worthwhile to chase after a traffic violation, because maybe the driver is actually fleeing due to a bigger offense, like a dead body or bags of cocaine in the trunk. But suspicion alone, says Stoughton, the South Carolina expert, is not enough. \"If you aren't sure what the benefits of the pursuit are, but you do know the dangers,\" including a deadly crash, \"clearly the risks should outweigh the benefits,\" he says. \"Failing to stop for a speeding violation is not a good reason to kill someone.\" And that's especially true if the driver may be intoxicated, he says. In Braven's case, \"what's more dangerous-him driving the speed limit while drunk,\" or him being chased and \"driving 100 mph while drunk?\" says Stoughton, adding that Klier could have arrested him later: According to court documents, she'd already noted his license plate number. \"Had she terminated the pursuit,\" policing expert Susan Peters testified in Old Bull's lawsuit, \"more likely than not, Braven J. Glenn would not have been involved in a vehicular fatality accident.\" Scraps of burned metal, including a suspension spring, a radiator, and a wheel, are what's left of Braven's car near the site of the crash. As Old Bull and I read over the BIA reports, it became more and more apparent that the investigation into the crash had been flawed from the start. Moments after the crash, Klier called dispatch. \"Send medical,\" she said, according to call logs. \"He just got hit.\" Soon, other law enforcement arrived-from the tribal police, the BIA, the state highway patrol, the sheriff's office, and the fire department. But according to other records from the investigation, they struggled to get on the same page, a common complaint on reservations. Bodycam footage from Deputy Sheriff Michael Colvin, a county cop who was assigned to divert traffic, offers a small glimpse into the confusion. \"Hey, where's the body at?\" an officer asked Colvin. \"I don't know,\" Colvin said. \"Tribal PD was first on scene, and they told BIA where it was at...He said it wrecked some place down here.\" \"Was it crossing or what?\" \"I don't know. That's what I asked, but he didn't really give me an answer.\" Seconds later, paramedics drove past Colvin, lights flashing. A voice came over his radio: \"They're on scene, but they've been canceled.\" The paramedics left. Six minutes later, a tribal police officer called dispatch, according to records I obtained from the county attorney's office. \"Tribal asked why EMS canceled,\" the dispatcher noted in a call log , \"because they didn't make the determination the individual(s) were deceased.\" The tribal officer asked the paramedics to return. Later, Braven's girlfriend, Jordan, who drove over after Braven didn't pick her up after work, saw men loading a body bag into a white truck. Meanwhile, BIA special agent Figueroa arrived. According to an investigative report , he told Klier that the BIA would investigate the crash. Later, he told another tribal officer on the scene that Klier would need to have her blood drawn and that he needed the dashcam footage from her patrol vehicle. The officer acknowledged his request, but when Figueroa returned from speaking with the train conductor, Klier was gone and had taken the police car with her. The tribal officer had given Klier permission to go home, according to the report; she'd been visibly shaken up after the crash. \"It's like, what the fuck?\" says attorney Tim Bechtold, who is representing Old Bull in her lawsuit. \"All these cops not knowing what the fuck to do.\" Klier's decision to take her vehicle was \"incredibly unusual and wildly inappropriate,\" says Stoughton, the police expert in South Carolina. \"It's not that much different from an officer who's involved with a shooting taking their gun home instead of turning that over for evidence.\" A former tribal police officer, who requested anonymity, later told me he saw Klier at the police station soon after the crash. The officer drove to the railroad and alerted Figueroa that the car might be at headquarters. \"You need to go down there and get that vehicle now,\" he recalls telling Figueroa. But it's unclear if Figueroa went; he didn't locate the car that night. The next day, Figueroa told the Crow police department that he would need a copy of Klier's incident report and the dashcam footage. The following day was Thanksgiving. And a day after that, Figueroa learned the police department had already \"disbanded and closed shop,\" according to the BIA investigation. \"No one knows who has access to their reports.\" Then things got even more complicated. In mid-December, when Figueroa reminded the tribe that he still needed the report, he learned that someone had broken into the former police headquarters. Now the records he needed were missing. Figueroa still didn't know where Klier's police car was, either. So in January, he drove to Wyoming, where she lived and worked with the VA, to find her. She said she was waiting for an attorney and didn't want to talk. (She also declined my request for comment.) Figueroa drove back to Montana and reached out to the tribe's homeland security director, who said he was \"unsure where anything was,\" this time citing two break-ins at the police ­headquarters,­ but that he would try his best to find the records. (Police equipment, including guns, had also gone missing.) Two weeks later, in February, Figueroa learned the headquarters had suffered four break-ins, but someone had finally located Klier's police car; Figueroa copied the dashcam footage. In May, he obtained the BIA's dispatch logs, but the tribal police's logs concerning Braven's death-and Klier's incident report for it-were still missing. (They don't appear to have ever been recovered.) Harris, the former Big Horn county attorney, whose term ended in late 2022, believes the US government may be responsible, at least in part, for mistakes made by law enforcement that night. In addition to allegedly failing to provide potentially lifesaving medical care, the BIA did not properly secure the scene of the crash and allowed Klier's police car to get away, and then took months to find it. \"You would think [the BIA] would have their hair on fire chasing everybody down,\" says Jonathan Smith, who oversaw investigations into police department misconduct at Obama's Justice Department. If it took that long to locate the car, he adds, \"it seems unlikely they tried as hard as they could.\" Old Bull's lawsuit is scheduled for trial this summer. The US government denies any wrongdoing. Since the BIA did not employ the Crow's tribal police force, an attorney for the government wrote in response to the complaint, \"the United States cannot be held liable...for their negligence.\" \"There's so much they did wrong...It's like a ton of bricks just hits you. I fought so hard...It's like we don't matter, like we are nothing.\" After reading the BIA reports, Old Bull retraced the new information. \"There's so much they did wrong...It's like a ton of bricks just hits you,\" she told me, motioning with her hands toward her chest. She wondered whether things might have been different if she'd gotten some of this information sooner-whether it would have helped her legal case, or at the very least helped her heal. And it stung, she added, knowing that an outsider like me-a white journalist with no connection to Braven-could access all these FOIA records, while she, Braven's mother, had been denied. It took suing for her to begin getting evidence, and even that, she said, didn't include some of the key details I'd just shared with her. \"I fought so hard to get that, years and years,\" she said. \"It's like we don't matter, like we are nothing.\" Two days later, former tribal police chief Terrill Bracken arrived at my Airbnb in Billings. I'd told him that Old Bull was interested in seeing him. Bracken wasn't leading the police department when Braven died, and he knew little about the chase. But if Old Bull wanted to talk, meeting her seemed like the Christian thing to do, he said. \"Anything I can do to help her with the grief that she is going through, that's why I'm here,\" he told me. Old Bull, who'd worked a 12-hour shift at the nursing home that day, sat in her car outside the house for a moment before entering. For months, she'd been asking God to help her forgive, but it was hard to let go of all the resentments she carried. Maybe, she thought, it would be easier after talking with Bracken and hearing another perspective. \"I have to come face-to-face with somebody that started this whole thing, and just get some straightforward answers,\" she told me at the front door. After taking a seat opposite the former police chief, Old Bull anxiously tapped on her glass of water with her fingers, tears welling in her eyes. Bracken said he was sorry for her loss. She thanked him. \"That's our right to know what happened to our child,\" she said. \"And I never got that. I had to fight and fight and fight.\" \"And it should not have to be that way,\" Bracken agreed. \"It's frustrating for me,\" he added, \"because I know what we were working toward was going to be so much better,\" he said of the tribal police. Their conversation stretched on for two hours. At points, Old Bull seemed to soften toward Bracken. \"I do feel better with you talking to me. I can see you now as a person,\" she said. But when he began talking about Officer Klier, the mood shifted. \"For all we know,\" Bracken said of Klier, \"she's not doing very well right now.\" \"She's not the one hurting,\" Old Bull said quietly. \"I'm not saying who's suffering more. It's not a contest,\" Bracken responded. \"But I'm just being honest with you: Given the information that I have, I can't see how I would have acted any differently than the officer. And that's a difficult part of the job.\" Old Bull sighed. \"I gotta work in the morning,\" she said, signaling her intent to leave. \"Would it be okay if I prayed with you?\" he asked. She nodded, her eyes shut, and began crying after he placed his hands over hers. Driving home, Old Bull was glad to have spoken with Bracken. But as she lay in bed the next morning, recalling the conversation, her anger grew. \"For him to say, 'Oh, poor Pamela, I wonder what she's going through'? How dare you ,\" she thought. She picked up her phone and texted me: \"Samantha there was a lot that bothered me. He put her on this pedestal,\" she wrote. \"To sit there and emphasize her feelings, when this is about the loss of my son and her actions made that loss happen. I feel like it was an attempt...to glorify what she did as a cop.\" \"This is a system made to oppress us. It's been this way since Columbus,\" she added, before putting down her phone and heading to work. The doors of the tribal police headquarters were locked the first time I visited last year, but I could peek inside to see how abruptly it was all abandoned. The police's whiteboard calendar still showed the Thanksgiving party scheduled for the day Braven died. Stacks of unused call logs sat in dusty boxes. In the parking lot, a makeshift jail remained, two tiny cells inside a shipping container. The refrigerated counter that once held Subway's sandwich ingredients-and then guns-had been removed. The dining tables that the cops used as desks were piled outside beneath cottonwood trees. The temporary holding cell in a modified shipping container outside the former tribal police station The former tribal police station in a closed-down Subway store on the Crow reservation There was never a public explanation for why the department closed in late November 2020, leading to speculation. Old Bull still wonders whether the police are hiding something. Big Man, the historian, wonders if they packed up and left because of poor training and lack of community support, and because Braven's chase was \"the final straw.\" \"There were a lot of reasons why it shut down,\" says one of the tribal police officers who requested anonymity. \"It was starting to fail\" even before Braven's accident, and then \"the money stopped coming in.\" Bracken doubts Braven's death was the only motivation for disbanding, if it was a motivation at all. He blames politics: A few weeks before the crash, Chairman Not Afraid lost the election to Frank White Clay, a former tribal lawmaker who believed propping up a new police force with Covid relief funding violated federal spending guidelines. \"We're still trying to figure out exactly where that money went,\" White Clay would later tell a journalism student at the University of Montana in 2021. He agreed the reservation needed more law enforcement but said this police force was just \"playing cops.\" Rather than give White Clay the satisfaction of disbanding the force, Not Afraid beat him to it and shut down the department about a week before the inauguration, according to another former tribal police official. It was possible Braven's accident may have been \"the catalyst, the icing on the cake,\" but it wasn't the primary reason for closing, he said. Harris, the former Big Horn county attorney, says the department's sudden ­closure was evidence that it was never properly established. \"A legitimate, lawful police agency doesn't just end because a chairman or president or governor says, 'All right. Enough,'\" he tells me. \"This [police department] was a mirage, a facade.\" It was \"a temporary fix, nothing more than a Band-Aid,\" one of the former police officers tells me. \"Did we do everything perfectly? Absolutely not,\" says Bracken. \"But were we doing the best we could with what we had? Yes. I really believe that department would have flourished into something had it gotten a fair opportunity.\" The Crow police force's brief existence and abrupt end is not just a story about a tribal administration's mistakes, says Big Man. It is also a story about the federal government's repeated failures leading up to 2020-to keep families informed, to conduct thorough investigations, to keep the reservation safe. And it shows \"a real need for clear, meaningful communication\" with Crow people, says Kristina Lucero, who directs the American Indian Governance and Policy Institute at the University of Montana, \"about expected goals and the mission of what law enforcement should be doing.\" The police department was \"a temporary fix, nothing more than a Band-Aid.\" Many of the families who testified with Old Bull in Billings were adamant that they want more transparent policing, including easier access to information after loved ones die or go missing. \"Authorities at all levels must improve communications with family members, who are too often left in the dark for days, weeks, or months,\" causing \"enormous stress,\" the federal commission wrote afterward. Indigenous communities also want more funding: In 2022, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe in Montana sued the US government because of a shortage of police. The state's Fort Belknap Indian Community sued too, after the BIA refused to provide more public safety money. \"What's happening at Crow, that's pretty extreme,\" says UCLA's van Schilfgaarde, but \"when budgets are tight, these [police] departments come and go in a way that would just never happen in other communities.\" The problem isn't just in Montana, she adds. Most Native villages in Alaska have no law enforcement presence whatsoever. Two days after his inauguration in 2020, White Clay informed the BIA that \"an independent law enforcement effort is not the direction that the new administration of the Crow Tribe intends to continue.\" Since then, complaints about BIA policing persist. In July 2021, the tribe sued a BIA officer after he was caught on video failing to stop his dog from biting someone handcuffed after a traffic stop, for nearly a minute, leading to three surgeries on the man's ankle and foot. \"Unfortunately, nothing in this video is surprising to anyone who has lived on the Crow Nation,\" the tribe's attorney wrote. \"I had a lot of faith in the police before,\" Old Bull says, \"but after Braven died, I don't believe they're there to protect us.\" In December, President Biden signed an executive order to remove red tape that has hampered Native access to law enforcement funding. But legal action might be more effective. In May, a US district judge encouraged the feds to meet with the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota and \"figure out how to more fairly fund\" tribal policing-or else go to trial. The decision was \"the first to acknowledge that the government owes a treaty-based duty to fund law enforcement for [an] Indian tribe,\" according to the Oglala Sioux's attorneys. And they say it could at last force a legal reckoning over Washington's centuries-long harm to Native justice systems. A successful reckoning must give tribes more jurisdiction and make room for them to reimagine policing and public safety in ways that reflect their own cultures and customs, says Goldberg, the Obama appointee to the Indian Law and Order Commission. She's seen Indigenous communities that involve spiritual leaders in justice proceedings to weigh in on punishments and design a path forward. The Tulalip reservation in Washington state, in keeping with its values, has required police to stop by the Boys & Girls Club twice a shift to help kids with homework, and they attend elders' breakfasts to share data and answer questions. A successful reckoning must give tribes more jurisdiction and make room for them to reimagine policing and public safety in ways that reflect their own cultures and customs. On the Crow reservation, most people I asked said the tribe needed more law enforcement, but they also emphasized the importance of better officer training. Some said they wanted to think about public safety in a more balanced way, with funding for mental health, addiction treatment, housing, and education. Investments like these could make it easier to recruit good local cops, says the University of Montana's Lucero, since people might be less hesitant to police their relatives if the justice system offered more second chances and paths toward healing. \"You just can't arrest people, lock them up, and expect to throw them back in the same situation and change,\" says Big Man. \"Past traumas have created who we are,\" adds Old Bull. \"Get people into treatment and get them help and programs before moving in a police department.\" Tribal nations that are successful with law enforcement, says Goldberg, are ones with \"strong congruence between the views of the community and the way it's done.\" Braven's family built a memorial for him near the site of his death. Old Bull buried Braven about an hour from home, at the foot of the Pryor Mountains, next to the graves of his father and his cousin Kaysera. The cemetery is small and quiet, off a dirt path surrounded by fields, and most of the gravestones are simple, some with fake flowers and crosses. Old Bull and her family go there often to mow the grass around Braven's plot and decorate it with gifts, like chocolate-covered pretzels, one of his favorite snacks, and a basketball covered in their handwritten messages for him. At times they'll play music and reminisce about the ways he made them laugh, like how he'd make a muscle like Popeye and kiss it. When two of his older sisters got pregnant, they went to the cemetery and told him about it. When his younger sister graduated high school, she wore a cap beaded with the words, \"We did it Brave.\" They feel sometimes like he's still with them, even sending them messages. The night before his funeral, when Old Bull slept in a teepee with his remains, in keeping with her Lakota traditions, she and another family member heard a basketball bouncing in the middle of the night, even though everyone else had long since gone to bed. In August 2023, on what would have been his 20th birthday, Old Bull and her kids drive to the cemetery to visit Braven. They eat chocolate cupcakes with sprinkles, Braven's favorite, and release balloons into the sky for him. \"I want them to know he was a person too,\" Emilio says. \"He was a good kid and had big dreams, and for them to hide in the shadows-he deserves justice, the truth.\" \"Accountability and closure-that's what my mom really needs, what I really need,\" adds sister Marissa. \"I do want accountability, and I want them to admit this didn't have to happen,\" says Old Bull. On the drive home around 10 p.m., Old Bull sees a white owl sitting on the side of the road. In her tradition, owls are harbingers of death. The last time she encountered one, her mom died, and not too long afterward Braven did, too. When she arrives home it's almost midnight, and she lights a bundle of sage and cedar, calling her kids and grandkids out of the house to smudge them and help keep them safe. \"Bring the babies out,\" she instructs, walking to each person with the bundle and watching as they wave the smoke over their heads and into their hearts, all the way down to their legs. \"Who's next?\" This project was completed with the support of a grant from Columbia University's Ira A. Lipman Center for Journalism and Civil and Human Rights in conjunction with Arnold Ventures. Old Bull visits the memorial placed where Braven died.\n\nAdd to that the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, an international problem that's particularly severe in the Crow Nation, where girls are sometimes sex-trafficked and used as drug mules along Interstate 90. Seventy-four people disappeared on the Crow and neighboring Northern Cheyenne reservations in 2019-more than any other area of Montana, which has one of the highest rates of missing Indigenous women nationally. One of them was Braven's cousin Kaysera Stops Pretty Places , an 18-year-old who loved to sing, dance, run, and wrestle. Five days after she disappeared, the sheriff's office found her body face down in a fenced backyard, but the office didn't notify her family for nearly two weeks. Four and a half years later, her cause of death remains undetermined .\n\nFamilies of the missing often complain about poor transparency and inadequate investigations, and jurisdictional barriers make the situation worse. The BIA can't arrest people for crimes committed off the reservation, even in border towns like Hardin, where Kaysera died. And on the reservation, other agencies-like the FBI or the sheriff's office-might have jurisdiction depending on the type of offense and whether the perpetrator was Native. Because it's often unclear whether a crime took place on or off the reservation and who the perpetrator was, it's easy for law enforcement to avoid responsibility. When corpses are discovered, investigators regularly write off the deaths as accidental. Commonly, \"when our Native women and girls go missing,\" says Mary Kathryn Nagle, a Cherokee attorney who assisted Kaysera's relatives, \"law enforcement chooses to do nothing, and it's up to the family members to do the hard work of investigating.\"\n\nBy 2019, the Crow reservation was desperate for a change. In August, one of the few BIA cops there-the police chief, no less-quit in protest of his agency's understaffing. That November, Crow Chairman AJ Not Afraid, the tribe's chief executive, issued an emergency declaration over the shortage of police.\n\nDays later, he traveled to DC with other Native leaders to discuss the issue with President Trump, whose administration was announcing Operation Lady Justice, an initiative to improve the federal response to tribes' missing-persons cases. Some Indigenous critics described the effort as uninformed. Trump, for his part, seemed fixated on the Crow chairman's name. \"Is it true-you're not afraid? Are you not afraid of anything?\" Trump asked, laughing.\n\nOn New Year's Day 2020, Not Afraid's 16-year-old niece, Selena Not Afraid, went missing at a rest stop between Hardin and Billings. A search party, which included Braven, scoured the surrounding fields with ATVs, helicopters, horses, dogs, and drones. Three weeks later, a team from the Interior Department discovered her body less than a mile away. Her death was attributed to hypothermia, but some locals suspected foul play.\n\nSelena's sister had previously died in a hit-and-run, and her brother was killed by the Billings police. \"The Crow Tribe,\" Not Afraid had said in his emergency declaration, \"will no longer accept 'lip service' for the unacceptable lack of law enforcement.\" It was long past time, he and his administration believed, to create their own tribal force.\n\nNot Afraid pleaded with the BIA to fund a new police department, according to records of their correspondence. But the BIA kept denying his request , arguing that the tribe, which didn't have a jail or other necessary infrastructure, hadn't fulfilled application requirements and couldn't effectively manage law enforcement.\n\nThe pandemic provided Not Afraid with an opening. In May 2020, the Crow Nation received $27 million in coronavirus relief funding through the CARES Act. Suddenly, he didn't need the BIA's money; he had enough to launch a police department on his own. Soon he'd hired about 15 officers, tripling the police presence on the reservation. \"I was excited about it,\" says Yolanda Fraser, ­Kaysera's grandmother. \"I thought that finally we would have a justice unit that could dig into\" missing-persons cases.\n\nHowever, tribal legal experts say Not Afraid failed to get the necessary approval from tribal lawmakers. \"Police departments need to be established by legislation-that wasn't there,\" says Dennis Bear Don't Walk, the tribe's former chief judge and now legislative counsel, who says Not Afraid also likely needed lawmakers to sign off on using CARES Act money for policing. Not Afraid declined to comment, but former officials who helped him launch the department told me they believed he had the power to control spending and establish law enforcement during an emergency like the pandemic. (The Treasury Department is reviewing the matter and declined to comment, as did the BIA.)\n\nIn Indian Country, tribal chairs have sometimes faced accusations of co-opting police departments for their own purposes-officers can act as enforcers for whoever has the upper hand in tribal management. After the department launched in late June, Not Afraid put out press releases promising to prioritize community involvement and rehabilitation. But he also embraced tactics that appeared to benefit him personally. In August 2020, he responded to an uptick in Covid deaths by imposing a reservation-wide lockdown and curfew , which had public health benefits but also ­prevented political opponents from campaigning ahead of the November election-even as he held events to drum up support himself.\n\nSome doubted the legitimacy of Not Afraid's new force. \"What if they pull a gun on you: Are they a real cop?\" Big Man, the historian, wondered. Gerald \"Jay\" Harris, the chief prosecutor in Big Horn County, which includes most of the reservation, sent a memo to the sheriff's department warning that the county could be exposed to lawsuits if it worked with the tribal police, which Harris, who is also Crow, did not view as legitimate. The BIA kept patrolling alongside the new officers but sometimes wouldn't send calls through to them, according to sources familiar with the tribal force. Passes, the BIA officer, viewed the tribal cops as more of a \"militia group than a law enforcement department.\"\n\nThe federal government had never invested enough resources to create a strong pipeline of trained local police. Shilo Bad Bear was hired as a supervising dispatcher of the new department, even though she only had about 10 months of prior experience. \"I was so scared-I didn't have the proper qualifications,\" she says. \"I basically had to learn by myself,\" adds another dispatcher, who asked for anonymity; she had no prior experience and says she received a sheet of 10 codes but no formal training.\n\nShilo Bad Bear, a former 911 dispatcher for the Crow tribal police, says she was hired without much experience.\n\nPasses questioned whether the force's employees had undergone sufficient background checks; she recalled that the BIA had arrested some of them in the past. Some of the cops had retired years ago from other agencies, which meant they were no longer certified, according to one former officer, who also requested anonymity. Others had never worked as a cop. Under Montana law, they could patrol for almost a year before attending a police academy to become certified. It's a delay that's common in small rural departments, but one that Michael Gennaco, a consultant in California who specializes in civilian oversight of law enforcement, describes as \"a tragedy waiting to happen.\" Geoffrey Eastman, a tribal patrol sergeant who did have his certification, later testified in litigation surrounding Braven's death that \"there were no policies in place\" to show officers what was expected of them.\n\nAnd resources were tight. For a police headquarters, Not Afraid's administration purchased a closed-down Subway restaurant attached to a museum that commemorated the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn. Confused tourists often dropped in looking to order sandwiches, but the counter that once stored cold cuts had become a temporary shelf for officers' guns. \"It felt like a joke,\" says Bad Bear. \"We were making do with what we had,\" says the department's first police chief, Terrill Bracken, and \"building an airplane as we were flying.\"\n\nThe goal was to create \"a department of the people, for the people,\" says Bracken, \"with tribal members policing their own.\" But recruiting Crow cops was challenging because of the long hours, low pay, and limited benefits, and because of the reservation's extensive clan system; few locals wanted a job that might involve arresting their relatives. So Not Afraid also brought in outsiders, who he hoped would be more impartial.\n\nBracken himself was a white martial arts instructor from Billings who had briefly worked as a sheriff's deputy; he moved into a camping trailer outside the tribal police headquarters, away from his wife and two kids, so he could devote more time to the force. \"I had so much passion for that project,\" he says. \"It wasn't going to get done unless somebody stepped up.\" After one month, he was unexpectedly replaced; Crow local Larry Tobacco, who had previously worked for the BIA, became chief.\n\nThe new police department also recruited from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Sheridan, Wyoming, which staffs about a dozen federal cops to patrol a manicured VA campus. \"The reservation stays very busy and you would be exposed to a lot more major crime than you are here,\" the VA's police chief told his team in May 2020, according to emails obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request. Under VA ethics guidelines, the agency's cops generally could not moonlight on the reservation if the tribal police received federal funding. Even though Not Afraid launched the force with CARES Act funds, the tribe assured the VA that no federal funds would be used, according to emails and interviews, so the VA ethics committee gave its blessing. (One former police official told me he was present when an attorney told Not Afraid that the funds became tribal after entering the tribe's bank accounts; a Treasury Department spokesperson said the funds still would have been federal. Not Afraid did not respond to my request for comment.)\n\nFormer tribal police vehicles sit abandoned on the Crow reservation.\n\nSome Crow residents, including Old Bull, questioned whether it made sense to invite outside law enforcement onto the reservation. And these VA officers may not have been prepared for real policing, says Seth Stoughton, a former cop who lectures on policing issues at the University of South Carolina; patrolling a VA medical center, he says, is more like working as a security guard than as a municipal cop. Bracken tells me these officers had previously completed training in operating a police vehicle to get federal certification at the VA. But a VA spokesperson told me its officers receive no training in high-speed chases because they are banned by the agency.\n\nThe night Braven died, it was a VA police officer turned tribal cop, Pamela Klier, who chased him.\n\nThe Crow tribal police \"was a good thought,\" says Bad Bear, the dispatcher, but \"it seemed like something bad was bound to happen because these guys didn't know what they were doing.\"\n\nThe morning before Braven died, he and his brother Emilio played basketball for a couple of hours. Then Braven went to his late grandma's house in Hardin to see his cousins Jayden and Trey, who were still grieving her death. He seemed fine, remembers Jayden; they \"danced each other up,\" like they always did to say hello, and then Braven went to fish at a nearby pond.\n\nAround 1 p.m., he texted his girlfriend and offered to pick her up at home after her shift at the Boys & Girls Club that evening. He could borrow the car at his grandma's house, a black Chevy Malibu, to make the 35-minute ride. It was already dark out when he hit the road, a crisp November night, but it hadn't snowed yet so it would be an easy drive.\n\nBlossom Old Bull didn't learn about the crash until several hours afterward. She had just woken up from a nap when she got a phone call. Braven's older brother Gavin was sobbing. He'd heard that Braven had been in an accident.\n\n\"Where is he? Which hospital do I go to?\" Old Bull asked frantically.\n\n\"He's dead,\" Gavin said, still crying.\n\nOld Bull dropped the phone and screamed. No! she yelled. How do you know?\n\nEmilio hit a shelf in the room he shared with Braven, breaking it. His sister Jolene threw herself on the floor and sobbed. They were all still crying, struggling to comfort each other, when they heard a knock on the door a half-hour later at 10 p.m.\n\nOutside, a tall man with a black shirt and badge stood on the rickety front steps. It was BIA Special Agent Jose Figueroa Jr., who'd just come from the crash site.\n\nA banner demanding justice for Braven hangs outside Old Bull's home.\n\nI'm sure you guys already know what happened , Figueroa said to Braven's older brother Keenan outside, according to Old Bull and court records . They clocked him going 90 and chased him, and he ended up going head-on with the train . Figueroa said the family could go to the mortuary the next morning. He asked whether Braven drank or did drugs, then left without offering condolences.\n\nWhen Braven's older brother returned inside, he had a confused look on his face. Speed limits often weren't enforced on the reservation. And Braven was always so slow behind the wheel.\n\n\"I didn't know what to think,\" Old Bull says. She was inclined to trust Figueroa, because her dad worked as a cop in South Dakota when she was younger. But Figueroa had hardly given the family any details-not even which agency had pursued her son-and she couldn't square the story she had been told about Braven speeding with the cautious boy she had raised. The next morning, she grew even more baffled when the mortuary owner said she couldn't see Braven's body yet. The owner didn't tell her that it had already been sent to a crime lab for an autopsy.\n\nHer confusion turned to shock in the days that followed. On the TV news, she learned that it was the tribal police who'd chased Braven, so she drove to their headquarters. But the force had by then disbanded, and the windows of the old Subway were covered in paper. Seething with anger, she tugged on the locked door and pressed her face against the windows, trying to see inside. \"There was a life taken, and you just closed everything down without giving the family any answers?\" she thought. When she went to the BIA office instead, looking for a police report, an officer handed her a sticky note that simply said \"FOIA.\" Over the next few months, she got an attorney, Nagle, who'd also been helping Kaysera's family, and they filed a Freedom of Information Act request for documents with the BIA, but the agency rejected it , citing an ongoing investigation.\n\nThe question was, who was investigating? The BIA told Nagle that the FBI had jurisdiction, but an FBI agent told her his office had no case file for Braven. (The FBI, in response to my own FOIA request in 2022, would not confirm or deny whether it possessed documents related to Braven's death. The BIA told me both agencies initially investigated, but the FBI eventually took control because Klier was non-Native.) When Old Bull tried to get Braven's death certificate, an assistant at the Big Horn County court couldn't find it. When she tried to locate his car, the insurance company Progressive said authorities hadn't released it yet. For weeks, the only information she could access was from Braven's toxicology report; the coroner personally called to offer his condolences and to tell her that Braven had been drunk and had THC in his system when he died. It would take her four months to get the full autopsy report. She still didn't know the name of the officer who'd pursued her son or how the chase had unfolded.\n\nOld Bull, a medication aide at a nursing home, is far from naive when it comes to requesting medical documentation. But federal and state law enforcement have a reputation for keeping Native families in the dark after killings. \"It's expected for families not to get information,\" says Rae Peppers, a Crow former state lawmaker.\n\nOther families have also struggled to get basic paperwork after their loved ones died. \"They never notified me, not once,\" Fraser, Kaysera's grandmother and legal guardian, says of the sheriff's office that found Kaysera's body. \"It was hard, not getting any support,\" says Alvilene Buffalo Bull Tail, whose 14-year-old grandson, nicknamed Jr. Boy, was fatally hit by a train on the Crow reservation in 2017. Authorities deemed his death an accident, surmising that he fell asleep on the tracks; Buffalo Bull Tail suspects someone pushed him, and that law enforcement never properly investigated. \"We don't have closure until at least we know what really happened.\"\n\nIn Lame Deer, a town on the Northern Cheyenne reservation bordering Crow, Maureen Bryant says her family still hasn't obtained a death certificate or autopsy report more than two years after her niece DeAnna Limberhand was found hogtied in the Stillwater River. Going to the courthouse for documents felt \"like a dead end.\" \"We kept waiting for paperwork or some kind of information, but we never heard,\" she says. \"What do you do if no one is helping you?\" she adds tearily. \"We're just going through a lot right now, and the not-knowing makes it even worse.\"\n\nRae Peppers, a Crow former state lawmaker, says Native families often struggle to get information from federal and state law enforcement agencies after killings.\n\nThe stonewalling led Old Bull and her family to speculate about what happened to Braven, and sometimes they clung to upsetting theories. When they went to the railroad after the crash and observed a second set of tire marks alongside Braven's leading from the highway through the grass to the railroad, they wondered whether the police ran him into the train. And they wondered if perhaps law enforcement's lack of transparency was a sign of something more nefarious. \"If you did nothing wrong, just release the information,\" Old Bull wanted to tell them. \"What is it you are trying to hide?\"\n\nHer suspicions heightened as witnesses came forward. According to her lawsuit, Maurice and Mavis Mountain Sheep, the couple who'd passed the wreck on their way to get gas, told her they had waited near the railroad for about a half-hour and didn't see anyone offer Braven first aid. Braven \"kept saying, 'Help me,'\" Mavis told the family. But law enforcement \"just stood there and stared at him.\"\n\nOld Bull also got a text from Bad Bear, the tribal police's dispatcher. \"I had quit by the time that occurred with your son but I can tell you right now, absolutely nothing was in compliance,\" Bad Bear wrote. \"That place should have not ever been opened...It was a shitshow there.\"\n\nFor Old Bull, the lack of clarity about the night Braven died was like torture. And she isn't one to let something like this slide. In February 2023, she tried to sue Klier in federal court for wrongful death, hoping the court proceedings would bring new information to light. She had also sued the BIA, which sent officers to the scene of the crash, accusing the agency of negligently allowing the tribal police to operate without proper training and of failing to offer Braven medical care. \"The acts of the agents of Defendant United States shock the conscience and offend the community's sense of fair play and decency,\" her attorney wrote .\n\nLast April, a judge allowed Old Bull's case to proceed against the BIA, but not against Klier, because Klier had chased Braven in her capacity as a tribal employee, not a federal one. By then, it was too late for Old Bull to sue Klier in tribal court; she'd missed the tribe's statute of limitations.\n\nOld Bull decided to try a different tactic. In July 2023, she drove to Billings to share her story with a broader audience, including federal officials who were seeking feedback about law enforcement on reservations.\n\nShe wasn't sure what to expect, but she hoped someone in power might finally listen. In the years since Braven died, President Biden had appointed the country's first Indigenous secretary of the interior, Deb Haaland. Before Haaland left Congress to take the job, she and other Native lawmakers passed a bill to hear testimony about crime and the crisis of missing Indigenous people. Now, Native families were coming from Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota to testify to a federal commission, some driving 20 hours round trip for a chance to speak for 15 minutes.\n\nGrace Bulltail, Kaysera's aunt, was a member of the commission and encouraged Old Bull to join. But Bulltail felt disappointed at the turnout of elected officials. \"We invited the Montana Department of Justice-nobody came,\" she says. Not even many Crow tribal leaders showed up. (A DOJ spokesperson said he wasn't aware of an invitation.)\n\nStill, Old Bull told me afterward that the gathering made her \"a little optimistic that something will change.\" It helped her feel less alone knowing that her family wasn't the only one waiting for answers. \"Listening to everyone's stories, you realize you're a piece of a big, big thing.\"\n\nThe next month, I was in Crow Agency again, reporting on Braven's case. It had been nearly three years since Old Bull first started investigating the circumstances surrounding her son's death, but there'd been a big development since the last time I visited: The BIA had sent me an email with a trove of documents about the incident. It had taken me months of corresponding with the agency-after a year examining the case, interviewing dozens of people, and scouring court and government records-to get the details of her son's final minutes. I wondered whether my luck with the BIA had something to do with all the time that had passed, or my status as an outsider. Nagle, Old Bull's attorney, told me journalists are \"much more likely\" than Indigenous families to get documents from the federal government via the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nAt Old Bull's house, she put on her glasses and joined me on the couch, where I spread out the highlighted pages for her to see.\n\nAt first, what Old Bull read in the BIA's investigative report lined up with what she already knew. It all started on Highway 451 on November 24, she read. But the next detail made her purse her lips: At 5:39 p.m., Braven made a \"legal pass\" of Klier's police car over a dotted yellow line, according to the BIA's description of Klier's dashcam footage, which doesn't specify how fast he drove past her. Then, once he got in front of her, he slowed back down to the speed limit, about 70 mph, and Klier turned on her emergency lights to pull him over.\n\nHe kept driving.\n\nMaybe he was afraid, Old Bull thought, remembering the officer who had choked him on his way to juvenile hall just months before the crash.\n\nIn any case, Braven drove, still close to the speed limit.\n\nSeconds later, he slowed down considerably, and it appeared he might pull over. Klier, now following him at 55 mph, called dispatch and reported that he'd passed her at 90 mph. But Braven did not pull over. Klier activated her siren.\n\nNow, Braven began to accelerate, and she chased him. Seventy-seven miles per hour within half a minute. One hundred and nine miles per hour within a minute. They passed two other cars driving the opposite direction.\n\nThen Braven made a bold move. He turned off his headlights and other exterior lights, a tactic that drivers sometimes use to hide from police. At a bend in the highway, he went onto the grass, driving in the dark toward the railroad.\n\nOld Bull stopped reading and pushed her glasses onto her forehead. \"He legally passed her,\" she said. \"All this kid wanted to do was to go see his girlfriend, that was it. It doesn't make sense.\" She covered her face with her hands and cried.\n\nOne-third of all police chases in the United States end with a crash, often causing property damage, injury, or death. Many of these chases begin after an officer observes a traffic infraction, but because of the risks involved, some police departments only allow pursuits after a violent felony or something that puts the public in imminent danger. It's unclear whether the Crow police had a similar rule. Police Chief Tobacco and Sergeant Eastman testified in the lawsuit over Braven's death that there was not a handbook of policies and procedures in place, or at least they weren't aware of one. But the tribe submitted one to the BIA in the months leading up to the crash, according to records I obtained . That handbook states that an officer can only pursue a driver if there's a \"compelling need\" and if the chase presents less risk to the public than the driver remaining at large. A \"compelling need,\" the manual adds, \"does not include the mere act of fleeing, even if reckless,\" or \"traffic and licensing infractions, including DUI.\"\n\nSome police officers argue it's worthwhile to chase after a traffic violation, because maybe the driver is actually fleeing due to a bigger offense, like a dead body or bags of cocaine in the trunk. But suspicion alone, says Stoughton, the South Carolina expert, is not enough. \"If you aren't sure what the benefits of the pursuit are, but you do know the dangers,\" including a deadly crash, \"clearly the risks should outweigh the benefits,\" he says. \"Failing to stop for a speeding violation is not a good reason to kill someone.\" And that's especially true if the driver may be intoxicated, he says. In Braven's case, \"what's more dangerous-him driving the speed limit while drunk,\" or him being chased and \"driving 100 mph while drunk?\" says Stoughton, adding that Klier could have arrested him later: According to court documents, she'd already noted his license plate number. \"Had she terminated the pursuit,\" policing expert Susan Peters testified in Old Bull's lawsuit, \"more likely than not, Braven J. Glenn would not have been involved in a vehicular fatality accident.\"\n\nScraps of burned metal, including a suspension spring, a radiator, and a wheel, are what's left of Braven's car near the site of the crash.\n\nAs Old Bull and I read over the BIA reports, it became more and more apparent that the investigation into the crash had been flawed from the start.\n\nMoments after the crash, Klier called dispatch. \"Send medical,\" she said, according to call logs. \"He just got hit.\" Soon, other law enforcement arrived-from the tribal police, the BIA, the state highway patrol, the sheriff's office, and the fire department. But according to other records from the investigation, they struggled to get on the same page, a common complaint on reservations. Bodycam footage from Deputy Sheriff Michael Colvin, a county cop who was assigned to divert traffic, offers a small glimpse into the confusion.\n\n\"Hey, where's the body at?\" an officer asked Colvin.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Colvin said. \"Tribal PD was first on scene, and they told BIA where it was at...He said it wrecked some place down here.\"\n\n\"Was it crossing or what?\"\n\n\"I don't know. That's what I asked, but he didn't really give me an answer.\"\n\nSeconds later, paramedics drove past Colvin, lights flashing. A voice came over his radio: \"They're on scene, but they've been canceled.\" The paramedics left.\n\nSix minutes later, a tribal police officer called dispatch, according to records I obtained from the county attorney's office. \"Tribal asked why EMS canceled,\" the dispatcher noted in a call log , \"because they didn't make the determination the individual(s) were deceased.\" The tribal officer asked the paramedics to return. Later, Braven's girlfriend, Jordan, who drove over after Braven didn't pick her up after work, saw men loading a body bag into a white truck.\n\nMeanwhile, BIA special agent Figueroa arrived. According to an investigative report , he told Klier that the BIA would investigate the crash. Later, he told another tribal officer on the scene that Klier would need to have her blood drawn and that he needed the dashcam footage from her patrol vehicle. The officer acknowledged his request, but when Figueroa returned from speaking with the train conductor, Klier was gone and had taken the police car with her. The tribal officer had given Klier permission to go home, according to the report; she'd been visibly shaken up after the crash.\n\n\"It's like, what the fuck?\" says attorney Tim Bechtold, who is representing Old Bull in her lawsuit. \"All these cops not knowing what the fuck to do.\" Klier's decision to take her vehicle was \"incredibly unusual and wildly inappropriate,\" says Stoughton, the police expert in South Carolina. \"It's not that much different from an officer who's involved with a shooting taking their gun home instead of turning that over for evidence.\"\n\nA former tribal police officer, who requested anonymity, later told me he saw Klier at the police station soon after the crash. The officer drove to the railroad and alerted Figueroa that the car might be at headquarters. \"You need to go down there and get that vehicle now,\" he recalls telling Figueroa. But it's unclear if Figueroa went; he didn't locate the car that night.\n\nThe next day, Figueroa told the Crow police department that he would need a copy of Klier's incident report and the dashcam footage. The following day was Thanksgiving. And a day after that, Figueroa learned the police department had already \"disbanded and closed shop,\" according to the BIA investigation. \"No one knows who has access to their reports.\"\n\nThen things got even more complicated. In mid-December, when Figueroa reminded the tribe that he still needed the report, he learned that someone had broken into the former police headquarters. Now the records he needed were missing.\n\nFigueroa still didn't know where Klier's police car was, either. So in January, he drove to Wyoming, where she lived and worked with the VA, to find her. She said she was waiting for an attorney and didn't want to talk. (She also declined my request for comment.)\n\nFigueroa drove back to Montana and reached out to the tribe's homeland security director, who said he was \"unsure where anything was,\" this time citing two break-ins at the police ­headquarters,­ but that he would try his best to find the records. (Police equipment, including guns, had also gone missing.) Two weeks later, in February, Figueroa learned the headquarters had suffered four break-ins, but someone had finally located Klier's police car; Figueroa copied the dashcam footage. In May, he obtained the BIA's dispatch logs, but the tribal police's logs concerning Braven's death-and Klier's incident report for it-were still missing. (They don't appear to have ever been recovered.)\n\nHarris, the former Big Horn county attorney, whose term ended in late 2022, believes the US government may be responsible, at least in part, for mistakes made by law enforcement that night. In addition to allegedly failing to provide potentially lifesaving medical care, the BIA did not properly secure the scene of the crash and allowed Klier's police car to get away, and then took months to find it. \"You would think [the BIA] would have their hair on fire chasing everybody down,\" says Jonathan Smith, who oversaw investigations into police department misconduct at Obama's Justice Department. If it took that long to locate the car, he adds, \"it seems unlikely they tried as hard as they could.\"\n\nOld Bull's lawsuit is scheduled for trial this summer. The US government denies any wrongdoing. Since the BIA did not employ the Crow's tribal police force, an attorney for the government wrote in response to the complaint, \"the United States cannot be held liable...for their negligence.\"\n\nAfter reading the BIA reports, Old Bull retraced the new information. \"There's so much they did wrong...It's like a ton of bricks just hits you,\" she told me, motioning with her hands toward her chest. She wondered whether things might have been different if she'd gotten some of this information sooner-whether it would have helped her legal case, or at the very least helped her heal. And it stung, she added, knowing that an outsider like me-a white journalist with no connection to Braven-could access all these FOIA records, while she, Braven's mother, had been denied. It took suing for her to begin getting evidence, and even that, she said, didn't include some of the key details I'd just shared with her. \"I fought so hard to get that, years and years,\" she said. \"It's like we don't matter, like we are nothing.\" Two days later, former tribal police chief Terrill Bracken arrived at my Airbnb in Billings. I'd told him that Old Bull was interested in seeing him. Bracken wasn't leading the police department when Braven died, and he knew little about the chase. But if Old Bull wanted to talk, meeting her seemed like the Christian thing to do, he said. \"Anything I can do to help her with the grief that she is going through, that's why I'm here,\" he told me. Old Bull, who'd worked a 12-hour shift at the nursing home that day, sat in her car outside the house for a moment before entering. For months, she'd been asking God to help her forgive, but it was hard to let go of all the resentments she carried. Maybe, she thought, it would be easier after talking with Bracken and hearing another perspective. \"I have to come face-to-face with somebody that started this whole thing, and just get some straightforward answers,\" she told me at the front door. After taking a seat opposite the former police chief, Old Bull anxiously tapped on her glass of water with her fingers, tears welling in her eyes. Bracken said he was sorry for her loss. She thanked him. \"That's our right to know what happened to our child,\" she said. \"And I never got that. I had to fight and fight and fight.\" \"And it should not have to be that way,\" Bracken agreed. \"It's frustrating for me,\" he added, \"because I know what we were working toward was going to be so much better,\" he said of the tribal police. Their conversation stretched on for two hours. At points, Old Bull seemed to soften toward Bracken. \"I do feel better with you talking to me. I can see you now as a person,\" she said. But when he began talking about Officer Klier, the mood shifted. \"For all we know,\" Bracken said of Klier, \"she's not doing very well right now.\" \"She's not the one hurting,\" Old Bull said quietly. \"I'm not saying who's suffering more. It's not a contest,\" Bracken responded. \"But I'm just being honest with you: Given the information that I have, I can't see how I would have acted any differently than the officer. And that's a difficult part of the job.\" Old Bull sighed. \"I gotta work in the morning,\" she said, signaling her intent to leave. \"Would it be okay if I prayed with you?\" he asked. She nodded, her eyes shut, and began crying after he placed his hands over hers. Driving home, Old Bull was glad to have spoken with Bracken. But as she lay in bed the next morning, recalling the conversation, her anger grew. \"For him to say, 'Oh, poor Pamela, I wonder what she's going through'? How dare you ,\" she thought. She picked up her phone and texted me: \"Samantha there was a lot that bothered me. He put her on this pedestal,\" she wrote. \"To sit there and emphasize her feelings, when this is about the loss of my son and her actions made that loss happen. I feel like it was an attempt...to glorify what she did as a cop.\" \"This is a system made to oppress us. It's been this way since Columbus,\" she added, before putting down her phone and heading to work. The doors of the tribal police headquarters were locked the first time I visited last year, but I could peek inside to see how abruptly it was all abandoned. The police's whiteboard calendar still showed the Thanksgiving party scheduled for the day Braven died. Stacks of unused call logs sat in dusty boxes. In the parking lot, a makeshift jail remained, two tiny cells inside a shipping container. The refrigerated counter that once held Subway's sandwich ingredients-and then guns-had been removed. The dining tables that the cops used as desks were piled outside beneath cottonwood trees. The temporary holding cell in a modified shipping container outside the former tribal police station The former tribal police station in a closed-down Subway store on the Crow reservation There was never a public explanation for why the department closed in late November 2020, leading to speculation. Old Bull still wonders whether the police are hiding something. Big Man, the historian, wonders if they packed up and left because of poor training and lack of community support, and because Braven's chase was \"the final straw.\" \"There were a lot of reasons why it shut down,\" says one of the tribal police officers who requested anonymity. \"It was starting to fail\" even before Braven's accident, and then \"the money stopped coming in.\" Bracken doubts Braven's death was the only motivation for disbanding, if it was a motivation at all. He blames politics: A few weeks before the crash, Chairman Not Afraid lost the election to Frank White Clay, a former tribal lawmaker who believed propping up a new police force with Covid relief funding violated federal spending guidelines. \"We're still trying to figure out exactly where that money went,\" White Clay would later tell a journalism student at the University of Montana in 2021. He agreed the reservation needed more law enforcement but said this police force was just \"playing cops.\" Rather than give White Clay the satisfaction of disbanding the force, Not Afraid beat him to it and shut down the department about a week before the inauguration, according to another former tribal police official. It was possible Braven's accident may have been \"the catalyst, the icing on the cake,\" but it wasn't the primary reason for closing, he said. Harris, the former Big Horn county attorney, says the department's sudden ­closure was evidence that it was never properly established. \"A legitimate, lawful police agency doesn't just end because a chairman or president or governor says, 'All right. Enough,'\" he tells me. \"This [police department] was a mirage, a facade.\" It was \"a temporary fix, nothing more than a Band-Aid,\" one of the former police officers tells me. \"Did we do everything perfectly? Absolutely not,\" says Bracken. \"But were we doing the best we could with what we had? Yes. I really believe that department would have flourished into something had it gotten a fair opportunity.\" The Crow police force's brief existence and abrupt end is not just a story about a tribal administration's mistakes, says Big Man. It is also a story about the federal government's repeated failures leading up to 2020-to keep families informed, to conduct thorough investigations, to keep the reservation safe. And it shows \"a real need for clear, meaningful communication\" with Crow people, says Kristina Lucero, who directs the American Indian Governance and Policy Institute at the University of Montana, \"about expected goals and the mission of what law enforcement should be doing.\" The police department was \"a temporary fix, nothing more than a Band-Aid.\" Many of the families who testified with Old Bull in Billings were adamant that they want more transparent policing, including easier access to information after loved ones die or go missing. \"Authorities at all levels must improve communications with family members, who are too often left in the dark for days, weeks, or months,\" causing \"enormous stress,\" the federal commission wrote afterward. Indigenous communities also want more funding: In 2022, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe in Montana sued the US government because of a shortage of police. The state's Fort Belknap Indian Community sued too, after the BIA refused to provide more public safety money. \"What's happening at Crow, that's pretty extreme,\" says UCLA's van Schilfgaarde, but \"when budgets are tight, these [police] departments come and go in a way that would just never happen in other communities.\" The problem isn't just in Montana, she adds. Most Native villages in Alaska have no law enforcement presence whatsoever. Two days after his inauguration in 2020, White Clay informed the BIA that \"an independent law enforcement effort is not the direction that the new administration of the Crow Tribe intends to continue.\" Since then, complaints about BIA policing persist. In July 2021, the tribe sued a BIA officer after he was caught on video failing to stop his dog from biting someone handcuffed after a traffic stop, for nearly a minute, leading to three surgeries on the man's ankle and foot. \"Unfortunately, nothing in this video is surprising to anyone who has lived on the Crow Nation,\" the tribe's attorney wrote. \"I had a lot of faith in the police before,\" Old Bull says, \"but after Braven died, I don't believe they're there to protect us.\" In December, President Biden signed an executive order to remove red tape that has hampered Native access to law enforcement funding. But legal action might be more effective. In May, a US district judge encouraged the feds to meet with the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota and \"figure out how to more fairly fund\" tribal policing-or else go to trial. The decision was \"the first to acknowledge that the government owes a treaty-based duty to fund law enforcement for [an] Indian tribe,\" according to the Oglala Sioux's attorneys. And they say it could at last force a legal reckoning over Washington's centuries-long harm to Native justice systems. A successful reckoning must give tribes more jurisdiction and make room for them to reimagine policing and public safety in ways that reflect their own cultures and customs, says Goldberg, the Obama appointee to the Indian Law and Order Commission. She's seen Indigenous communities that involve spiritual leaders in justice proceedings to weigh in on punishments and design a path forward. The Tulalip reservation in Washington state, in keeping with its values, has required police to stop by the Boys & Girls Club twice a shift to help kids with homework, and they attend elders' breakfasts to share data and answer questions. A successful reckoning must give tribes more jurisdiction and make room for them to reimagine policing and public safety in ways that reflect their own cultures and customs. On the Crow reservation, most people I asked said the tribe needed more law enforcement, but they also emphasized the importance of better officer training. Some said they wanted to think about public safety in a more balanced way, with funding for mental health, addiction treatment, housing, and education. Investments like these could make it easier to recruit good local cops, says the University of Montana's Lucero, since people might be less hesitant to police their relatives if the justice system offered more second chances and paths toward healing. \"You just can't arrest people, lock them up, and expect to throw them back in the same situation and change,\" says Big Man. \"Past traumas have created who we are,\" adds Old Bull. \"Get people into treatment and get them help and programs before moving in a police department.\" Tribal nations that are successful with law enforcement, says Goldberg, are ones with \"strong congruence between the views of the community and the way it's done.\" Braven's family built a memorial for him near the site of his death. Old Bull buried Braven about an hour from home, at the foot of the Pryor Mountains, next to the graves of his father and his cousin Kaysera. The cemetery is small and quiet, off a dirt path surrounded by fields, and most of the gravestones are simple, some with fake flowers and crosses. Old Bull and her family go there often to mow the grass around Braven's plot and decorate it with gifts, like chocolate-covered pretzels, one of his favorite snacks, and a basketball covered in their handwritten messages for him. At times they'll play music and reminisce about the ways he made them laugh, like how he'd make a muscle like Popeye and kiss it. When two of his older sisters got pregnant, they went to the cemetery and told him about it. When his younger sister graduated high school, she wore a cap beaded with the words, \"We did it Brave.\" They feel sometimes like he's still with them, even sending them messages. The night before his funeral, when Old Bull slept in a teepee with his remains, in keeping with her Lakota traditions, she and another family member heard a basketball bouncing in the middle of the night, even though everyone else had long since gone to bed. In August 2023, on what would have been his 20th birthday, Old Bull and her kids drive to the cemetery to visit Braven. They eat chocolate cupcakes with sprinkles, Braven's favorite, and release balloons into the sky for him. \"I want them to know he was a person too,\" Emilio says. \"He was a good kid and had big dreams, and for them to hide in the shadows-he deserves justice, the truth.\" \"Accountability and closure-that's what my mom really needs, what I really need,\" adds sister Marissa. \"I do want accountability, and I want them to admit this didn't have to happen,\" says Old Bull. On the drive home around 10 p.m., Old Bull sees a white owl sitting on the side of the road. In her tradition, owls are harbingers of death. The last time she encountered one, her mom died, and not too long afterward Braven did, too. When she arrives home it's almost midnight, and she lights a bundle of sage and cedar, calling her kids and grandkids out of the house to smudge them and help keep them safe. \"Bring the babies out,\" she instructs, walking to each person with the bundle and watching as they wave the smoke over their heads and into their hearts, all the way down to their legs. \"Who's next?\" This project was completed with the support of a grant from Columbia University's Ira A. Lipman Center for Journalism and Civil and Human Rights in conjunction with Arnold Ventures. Old Bull visits the memorial placed where Braven died.\n\nAfter reading the BIA reports, Old Bull retraced the new information. \"There's so much they did wrong...It's like a ton of bricks just hits you,\" she told me, motioning with her hands toward her chest. She wondered whether things might have been different if she'd gotten some of this information sooner-whether it would have helped her legal case, or at the very least helped her heal.\n\nAnd it stung, she added, knowing that an outsider like me-a white journalist with no connection to Braven-could access all these FOIA records, while she, Braven's mother, had been denied.

      "text": "A New Police Force Chased a 17-Year-Old Boy to His Death. Then It Vanished.\n\nBraven Glenn Photo courtesy Blossom Old Bull\n\nBy Samantha Michaels; Film by Mark Helenowski; Photography by Tailyr Irvine March+April 2024 Issue\n\nCruising south down a two-lane highway in Montana, Braven Glenn looked out onto the open road, the evening sky chilly and dark. It was November 24, 2020-half a year into the pandemic and three months after his 17th birthday. He was a good student, on his way to pick up his girlfriend, a basketball player like him, at her house on the Crow Indian Reservation.\n\nMost days, Braven took his time while driving; his friends sometimes teased him for staying below the speed limit. But lately he hadn't been feeling like himself-not since his grandma died from Covid weeks earlier. On this particular night, when a car ahead of him sat at around 60 mph in a 70 mph zone, he signaled and passed it, slowing again to the speed limit after crossing back over the dotted yellow line.\n\nThen lights flashed behind him. The car he'd passed belonged to a white cop from the reservation's brand-new tribal police department. Headquartered inside a former Subway restaurant, the department had launched just five months earlier with Covid relief funding-an attempt by the tribal nation's chairman to address crime and a huge deficit of federal police.\n\nThe officer called dispatch to report a speeding driver, according to law enforcement records, even though Braven wasn't speeding when she activated her siren.\n\nA chase began.\n\nWithin 70 seconds, his car was struck by a train.\n\nMore than two years later, on a Sunday evening in May 2023, Braven's mother, Blossom Old Bull, took a deep breath as she parked her Honda Odyssey on the side of the highway near the site of the wreck. Together we walked through knee-high grass toward the railroad. \"This is what's left of it,\" she said, bending over to show me a scrap of burned metal. A suspension spring, a radiator, and a wheel also lay nearby.\n\nOld Bull tilted up one of the rims to get a better look, exposing a tattoo with Braven's name on her forearm. She often drove out of her way to make sure the memorial for him was still standing there, a cross with his basketball jersey draped over it.\n\nIt had been difficult for her to move forward after the crash; she still had so many questions about what happened. According to interviews, public records requests, and court documents from a lawsuit over Braven's death, a Crow couple who had pulled over at the wreck site said Braven was denied medical care for a half-hour as he begged for help. The cop who chased him, moonlighting from her job as a Veterans Affairs security officer, left the scene with a crucial piece of evidence: her patrol vehicle. Someone broke into the police headquarters, and the incident report went missing along with records from other cases. Two or three days after the crash, the entire police force disbanded , offering the community-and Braven's family-no explanation. When Old Bull went to the department for answers, she found a locked door and windows taped over with white paper. \"Everybody just up and left,\" she recalled.\n\nSubscribe to Mother Jones podcasts on Apple Podcasts or your favorite podcast app. The disappearance of a new police department so soon after the wreck was highly unusual, the kind of story you might never hear twice. But other parts of Braven's story were deeply familiar: unanswered questions after deaths on the reservation, inadequate law enforcement. Before 2020, the federal government controlled policing in the Crow Nation-providing only a handful of officers for an area two-thirds the size of Connecticut. Crimes went unsolved , grieving relatives complained of faulty investigations, and some victims wouldn't even call for help, fearing violence by officers. (Nationally, police kill Native Americans at higher rates than other people of color.) The Crow's tribal police department was a desperately needed but underfunded counterbalance to a federal system that isn't working. And Braven was caught up in the dysfunction. So, too, was Old Bull. After the tribal cops disappeared, it felt like nobody in power would talk to her, like nobody noticed the life that was lost or took responsibility for it. \"They come on Native land and they kill, and they just walk away. They think nobody is gonna care,\" she said as she drove home from the train tracks, the sun almost set, the clouds a deep blue behind her. \"I think they thought that's how our family was gonna be-that we were gonna let this go.\" \"They didn't expect us to speak out and try to get answers,\" she added. Blossom Old Bull in her home in Crow Agency, Montana The Crow tribe has about 13,400 members, most of whom live on or around the reservation in southeastern Montana, a lush landscape with towering mountains, open skies, and rivers teeming with trout. The tribal nation earns some revenue from its vast coal and oil reserves. Most people speak Crow as a first language, and the matrilineal clan system remains strong. Braven and his mom moved to the reservation when he was in eighth grade. Old Bull, a single mom and health care worker from South Dakota, is Lakota, not Crow, and she'd been raising Braven in New Mexico; he was her youngest boy, the eighth of nine siblings. But she wanted him to grow up closer to his father, who was Crow, and some of his older brothers and sisters, and to learn more about that part of his Native heritage. When she'd spent time on the reservation previously, she recalled families camping in teepees for Crow Fair, an annual celebration with a powwow and horse racing and a rodeo, or enjoying the Sun Dance and sweat lodges. Braven hadn't wanted to move away from Albuquerque. He was a sensitive kid, and he cried in 2017 when he learned he'd have to leave his basketball team behind. In Montana, the family settled in the town of Crow Agency in a shabby one-story house that they spruced up with fresh paint. It was a rough transition; weeks after they arrived, Braven's dad died from pneumonia after a struggle with alcoholism. Braven, only 13 years old, stood at his bedside the day they pulled him off life support. I know you weren't there for me because you were sick , he said, but I still love you. \"He was such a good-hearted person, to even think in those terms at that age,\" says his sister Marissa. Braven did his best to settle into the bunkbed room he now shared with his older brother Emilio, who played basketball with him on the corner courts. He grew closer with his half siblings' grandmother, who adopted him as her own grandson. He loved spending time at her house and would offer to drive her to appointments, help her carry groceries, and put the pots away on the top shelf of her kitchen. Braven was an honor-roll student who ran cross country and track and played JV basketball. Though he hadn't wanted to move to the reservation, it didn't take long for Braven to hit his stride. His cousin Jayden remembers how quickly Braven made friends: \"I left for the summer and came back and everyone knew him. He was really popular.\" \"He had a goofy personality,\" says his girlfriend, Jordan Jefferson. As the years passed, Braven excelled-an honor-roll student who ran cross country and track and played JV basketball, and who was unanimously chosen by his teammates to co-manage the varsity squad, which he hoped to eventually join himself, running miles most days to get in better shape. \"He was one of a kind and always ready to take the challenge,\" says Mike Beads Don't Mix, his freshman coach. But the pandemic marked the start of a shift after Braven's high school switched to remote learning and he couldn't see his friends much. In August 2020, the month he was turning 17, his grandma got Covid; she fell into a coma and was unable to sing him \"Happy Birthday\" like she normally did. Weeks later, she was dead. \"He took it really hard\" and \"got a little more distant from all of us,\" his sister JoLee remembers. In his bedroom, Braven played his grandma's favorite song, \"Blue Ain't Your Color\" by Keith Urban, over and over. His grades slipped, and he started drinking more. The week of Braven's birthday, Old Bull found him passed out on a couch at his older brother's house. He lashed out at her after she roused him, and she called the cops, hoping they might teach him a lesson. The police arrested him for disorderly conduct and took him to juvenile detention in Billings, about an hour away. \"My mom, she had to raise all these kids on her own, so I guess you could say she's tough, but not mean,\" Emilio says. \"She's loving, she'd get us a bunch of basketball shoes, but she's gonna give you the tough love you need to succeed in this world.\" \"But you need to learn now, Braven, that if somebody needs to call the cops on you, this is what will happen.\" When Braven returned three days later, now on probation, he hugged Old Bull and gave her a letter he'd written apologizing for the incident. \"I never want to leave your side again,\" he wrote. \"I know everybody in our family is disappointed in me...I was crying while writing this letter just because I realized how bad I hurt you.\" He told Old Bull that on his way to detention, an arresting officer from the Crow tribal police \"choked [him] out,\" according to court records, and that it had scared him, reaffirming all the bad stories he'd heard about law enforcement: His cousin Jayden once watched a cop push his uncle's head into the concrete, and they both remembered when officers at Crow Fair beat Braven's 15-year-old cousin Esaias Stops Pretty Places. This is why I didn't want to call the police , Old Bull told him. \"But you need to learn now, Braven, that if somebody needs to call the cops on you,\" she added, \"this is what will happen.\" Tattoos in memory of her son Braven Glenn adorn Blossom Old Bull's forearm. For centuries before the Europeans arrived, the Crow had no police. Instead, warrior groups protected people and enforced laws like the rules of the buffalo hunt. \"There's a big difference between a warrior and a cop,\" says Crow historian Alden Big Man Jr., who has studied the tribe's traditional systems of justice. Warriors' punishments could be harsh, including things like burning down a person's home or killing his horses, but if the offender responded favorably, the warriors would compensate his loss, perhaps giving him as many horses as had been taken away. In the 1800s, the federal government confined the Crow, also known as the Apsáalooke, to the reservation; white settlers often shot at people who tried to leave. The tribe's nomadic hunters and gatherers were forced to become sedentary farmers and to accept Christianity, learn English, and educate their kids in the colonizers' way. As railroads brought white ranchers into their grazing areas and banks denied Crows loans, the former warriors were \"reduced to begging for handouts during ration days,\" according to Big Man, while they \"witnessed a complete annihilation of the buffalo, as well as the disappearance of a whole way of life.\" In 1887, after a Crow man led a war party off the reservation to steal horses, a colonial agent sent the party to jail. \"It was right then and there,\" says Big Man, that in the Crow Nation \"the system changed from warrior societies to the government enforcing the law.\" Around that time, the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) began appointing Native officers to police reservations-ordering them to prohibit traditional rituals that the colonizers viewed as immoral, ration food and other supplies, and stop any activities that might interfere with white economic pursuits. In 1885, Congress had taken away Native nations' right to prosecute serious crimes like homicides committed by Native people against other Natives on reservations. (US lawmakers were outraged that a Sioux government in South Dakota had punished a killer according to its own principles of justice -rather than the death penalty, it had fined him $600, eight horses, and a blanket.) Instead, murders and other violent offenses would be investigated by federal agents, some of whom traveled long distances to tribal territories and had little to no long-standing relationship with the people who lived there. Nearly a century later, as activists from the American Indian Movement protested police brutality and rising crime, Congress passed the 1975 Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act , which created a path for tribes to take back more control of law enforcement. If tribal nations were able to jump through the hoops needed to secure a contract with the BIA, they could divert federal dollars intended for BIA cops to their own tribal police. \"It was a real game-changer,\" says Lauren van Schilfgaarde, an Indian law scholar who is Cochiti Pueblo and previously directed UCLA's Tribal Legal Development Clinic. Tribes have since set up more than 200 law enforcement agencies on reservations, far surpassing the number of BIA agencies. But many tribes were not able to get a contract, including the Crow, and those that have tribal police still lack jurisdiction over major crimes. In 1978, the Supreme Court also removed their ability to prosecute non-Natives, even for most minor crimes. \"Even if you have infinite dollars, if your police departments have questionable, shaky, or even no authority over any person within their territorial boundaries, that compromises the entire enterprise,\" van Schilfgaarde says. The federal government, meanwhile, skimped on funding for reservation cops, much as it skimped on health care, education, housing, and rural infrastructure. By 2001, violent crime on reservations was double or triple the national average. \"Ultimately, you are of your environment,\" Aaron Brien, a historian for the Crow tribe, says in the recent documentary Murder in Big Horn . \"When you take an entire society and strip them of any confidence and self-worth they have, it becomes very fragile.\" Tribes barely had half the policing resources per capita as non-Native communities: While Baltimore, Detroit, New York City, and DC had between four and seven officers per thousand residents, few tribal departments had ratios of more than two officers per thousand residents. As some communities of color protested overpolicing in cities, says van Schilfgaarde, reservations suffered the opposite extreme, coupled with a lack of resources to address public safety through other means like addiction treatment, employment, and schooling. \"It's incredibly frustrating and dangerous,\" she says. Under the Obama administration, Congress passed the Tribal Law and Order Act , creating a commission to study the problem. The commission, which included Republican and Democratic lawmakers along with Indian law experts, recommended the federal government pay to nearly double the number of reservation police-noting that crime dropped by more than one-third on four reservations that hired extra cops during a pilot program in 2009. The tribes themselves, instead of the BIA, should lead the police, the commission argued; this change would help build trust with the community and more closely reflect tribal priorities and customs. \"Public safety in Indian Country can improve dramatically once Native nations and Tribes have greater freedom to build and maintain their own criminal justice systems,\" the commission wrote , describing the federal policing system as \"a maze of injustice.\" The commission set a goal of 2024 to \"close the public safety gap\" on reservations. But by 2018, the number of BIA-funded officers on reservations hadn't grown at all-in fact, it had fallen by about one-third. Carole Goldberg, a commission member appointed by Obama, says Trump's administration seemed more focused on approving oil pipelines on Native land than on reforming reservation law enforcement. By 2020, the BIA estimated tribes needed $1.4 billion to handle policing nationally but admitted it was only providing $246 million, almost the same budget as a decade earlier. (The Department of Justice provided less than $100 million.) \"It's like working with strings and tin cans at times,\" Robert Bryant, chief of police for the Penobscot Nation, had testified to the commission. During parts of that year, the Crow Nation had just four BIA police to cover an expanse of 3,500 square miles. BIA cops were stretched so thin that \"we were pulling 18-hour days\" and \"going months without a day off,\" says Josie Passes, a former officer who wrote a letter to members of Congress begging for backup. A perceived lack of accountability contributed to a climate of fear. \"When you start thinking about it,\" says Birdie Real Bird, 70, a lifelong Crow resident whose aunt was assaulted during a home break-in and never received a visit from police, \"you're a sitting duck.\" \"When our Native women and girls go missing, law enforcement chooses to do nothing, and it's up to the family members to do the hard work of investigating.\" Add to that the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, an international problem that's particularly severe in the Crow Nation, where girls are sometimes sex-trafficked and used as drug mules along Interstate 90. Seventy-four people disappeared on the Crow and neighboring Northern Cheyenne reservations in 2019-more than any other area of Montana, which has one of the highest rates of missing Indigenous women nationally. One of them was Braven's cousin Kaysera Stops Pretty Places , an 18-year-old who loved to sing, dance, run, and wrestle. Five days after she disappeared, the sheriff's office found her body face down in a fenced backyard, but the office didn't notify her family for nearly two weeks. Four and a half years later, her cause of death remains undetermined . Families of the missing often complain about poor transparency and inadequate investigations, and jurisdictional barriers make the situation worse. The BIA can't arrest people for crimes committed off the reservation, even in border towns like Hardin, where Kaysera died. And on the reservation, other agencies-like the FBI or the sheriff's office-might have jurisdiction depending on the type of offense and whether the perpetrator was Native. Because it's often unclear whether a crime took place on or off the reservation and who the perpetrator was, it's easy for law enforcement to avoid responsibility. When corpses are discovered, investigators regularly write off the deaths as accidental. Commonly, \"when our Native women and girls go missing,\" says Mary Kathryn Nagle, a Cherokee attorney who assisted Kaysera's relatives, \"law enforcement chooses to do nothing, and it's up to the family members to do the hard work of investigating.\" \"When you start thinking about it, you're a sitting duck.\" By 2019, the Crow reservation was desperate for a change. In August, one of the few BIA cops there-the police chief, no less-quit in protest of his agency's understaffing. That November, Crow Chairman AJ Not Afraid, the tribe's chief executive, issued an emergency declaration over the shortage of police. Days later, he traveled to DC with other Native leaders to discuss the issue with President Trump, whose administration was announcing Operation Lady Justice, an initiative to improve the federal response to tribes' missing-persons cases. Some Indigenous critics described the effort as uninformed. Trump, for his part, seemed fixated on the Crow chairman's name. \"Is it true-you're not afraid? Are you not afraid of anything?\" Trump asked, laughing. On New Year's Day 2020, Not Afraid's 16-year-old niece, Selena Not Afraid, went missing at a rest stop between Hardin and Billings. A search party, which included Braven, scoured the surrounding fields with ATVs, helicopters, horses, dogs, and drones. Three weeks later, a team from the Interior Department discovered her body less than a mile away. Her death was attributed to hypothermia, but some locals suspected foul play. Selena's sister had previously died in a hit-and-run, and her brother was killed by the Billings police. \"The Crow Tribe,\" Not Afraid had said in his emergency declaration, \"will no longer accept 'lip service' for the unacceptable lack of law enforcement.\" It was long past time, he and his administration believed, to create their own tribal force. Not Afraid pleaded with the BIA to fund a new police department, according to records of their correspondence. But the BIA kept denying his request , arguing that the tribe, which didn't have a jail or other necessary infrastructure, hadn't fulfilled application requirements and couldn't effectively manage law enforcement. The pandemic provided Not Afraid with an opening. In May 2020, the Crow Nation received $27 million in coronavirus relief funding through the CARES Act. Suddenly, he didn't need the BIA's money; he had enough to launch a police department on his own. Soon he'd hired about 15 officers, tripling the police presence on the reservation. \"I was excited about it,\" says Yolanda Fraser, ­Kaysera's grandmother. \"I thought that finally we would have a justice unit that could dig into\" missing-persons cases. However, tribal legal experts say Not Afraid failed to get the necessary approval from tribal lawmakers. \"Police departments need to be established by legislation-that wasn't there,\" says Dennis Bear Don't Walk, the tribe's former chief judge and now legislative counsel, who says Not Afraid also likely needed lawmakers to sign off on using CARES Act money for policing. Not Afraid declined to comment, but former officials who helped him launch the department told me they believed he had the power to control spending and establish law enforcement during an emergency like the pandemic. (The Treasury Department is reviewing the matter and declined to comment, as did the BIA.) In Indian Country, tribal chairs have sometimes faced accusations of co-opting police departments for their own purposes-officers can act as enforcers for whoever has the upper hand in tribal management. After the department launched in late June, Not Afraid put out press releases promising to prioritize community involvement and rehabilitation. But he also embraced tactics that appeared to benefit him personally. In August 2020, he responded to an uptick in Covid deaths by imposing a reservation-wide lockdown and curfew , which had public health benefits but also ­prevented political opponents from campaigning ahead of the November election-even as he held events to drum up support himself. Some doubted the legitimacy of Not Afraid's new force. \"What if they pull a gun on you: Are they a real cop?\" Big Man, the historian, wondered. Gerald \"Jay\" Harris, the chief prosecutor in Big Horn County, which includes most of the reservation, sent a memo to the sheriff's department warning that the county could be exposed to lawsuits if it worked with the tribal police, which Harris, who is also Crow, did not view as legitimate. The BIA kept patrolling alongside the new officers but sometimes wouldn't send calls through to them, according to sources familiar with the tribal force. Passes, the BIA officer, viewed the tribal cops as more of a \"militia group than a law enforcement department.\" The federal government had never invested enough resources to create a strong pipeline of trained local police. Shilo Bad Bear was hired as a supervising dispatcher of the new department, even though she only had about 10 months of prior experience. \"I was so scared-I didn't have the proper qualifications,\" she says. \"I basically had to learn by myself,\" adds another dispatcher, who asked for anonymity; she had no prior experience and says she received a sheet of 10 codes but no formal training. Shilo Bad Bear, a former 911 dispatcher for the Crow tribal police, says she was hired without much experience. Passes questioned whether the force's employees had undergone sufficient background checks; she recalled that the BIA had arrested some of them in the past. Some of the cops had retired years ago from other agencies, which meant they were no longer certified, according to one former officer, who also requested anonymity. Others had never worked as a cop. Under Montana law, they could patrol for almost a year before attending a police academy to become certified. It's a delay that's common in small rural departments, but one that Michael Gennaco, a consultant in California who specializes in civilian oversight of law enforcement, describes as \"a tragedy waiting to happen.\" Geoffrey Eastman, a tribal patrol sergeant who did have his certification, later testified in litigation surrounding Braven's death that \"there were no policies in place\" to show officers what was expected of them. And resources were tight. For a police headquarters, Not Afraid's administration purchased a closed-down Subway restaurant attached to a museum that commemorated the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn. Confused tourists often dropped in looking to order sandwiches, but the counter that once stored cold cuts had become a temporary shelf for officers' guns. \"It felt like a joke,\" says Bad Bear. \"We were making do with what we had,\" says the department's first police chief, Terrill Bracken, and \"building an airplane as we were flying.\" The goal was to create \"a department of the people, for the people,\" says Bracken, \"with tribal members policing their own.\" But recruiting Crow cops was challenging because of the long hours, low pay, and limited benefits, and because of the reservation's extensive clan system; few locals wanted a job that might involve arresting their relatives. So Not Afraid also brought in outsiders, who he hoped would be more impartial. Bracken himself was a white martial arts instructor from Billings who had briefly worked as a sheriff's deputy; he moved into a camping trailer outside the tribal police headquarters, away from his wife and two kids, so he could devote more time to the force. \"I had so much passion for that project,\" he says. \"It wasn't going to get done unless somebody stepped up.\" After one month, he was unexpectedly replaced; Crow local Larry Tobacco, who had previously worked for the BIA, became chief. The new police department also recruited from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Sheridan, Wyoming, which staffs about a dozen federal cops to patrol a manicured VA campus. \"The reservation stays very busy and you would be exposed to a lot more major crime than you are here,\" the VA's police chief told his team in May 2020, according to emails obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request. Under VA ethics guidelines, the agency's cops generally could not moonlight on the reservation if the tribal police received federal funding. Even though Not Afraid launched the force with CARES Act funds, the tribe assured the VA that no federal funds would be used, according to emails and interviews, so the VA ethics committee gave its blessing. (One former police official told me he was present when an attorney told Not Afraid that the funds became tribal after entering the tribe's bank accounts; a Treasury Department spokesperson said the funds still would have been federal. Not Afraid did not respond to my request for comment.) Former tribal police vehicles sit abandoned on the Crow reservation. Some Crow residents, including Old Bull, questioned whether it made sense to invite outside law enforcement onto the reservation. And these VA officers may not have been prepared for real policing, says Seth Stoughton, a former cop who lectures on policing issues at the University of South Carolina; patrolling a VA medical center, he says, is more like working as a security guard than as a municipal cop. Bracken tells me these officers had previously completed training in operating a police vehicle to get federal certification at the VA. But a VA spokesperson told me its officers receive no training in high-speed chases because they are banned by the agency. The night Braven died, it was a VA police officer turned tribal cop, Pamela Klier, who chased him. The Crow tribal police \"was a good thought,\" says Bad Bear, the dispatcher, but \"it seemed like something bad was bound to happen because these guys didn't know what they were doing.\" The morning before Braven died, he and his brother Emilio played basketball for a couple of hours. Then Braven went to his late grandma's house in Hardin to see his cousins Jayden and Trey, who were still grieving her death. He seemed fine, remembers Jayden; they \"danced each other up,\" like they always did to say hello, and then Braven went to fish at a nearby pond. Around 1 p.m., he texted his girlfriend and offered to pick her up at home after her shift at the Boys & Girls Club that evening. He could borrow the car at his grandma's house, a black Chevy Malibu, to make the 35-minute ride. It was already dark out when he hit the road, a crisp November night, but it hadn't snowed yet so it would be an easy drive. Blossom Old Bull didn't learn about the crash until several hours afterward. She had just woken up from a nap when she got a phone call. Braven's older brother Gavin was sobbing. He'd heard that Braven had been in an accident. \"Where is he? Which hospital do I go to?\" Old Bull asked frantically. \"He's dead,\" Gavin said, still crying. Old Bull dropped the phone and screamed. No! she yelled. How do you know? Emilio hit a shelf in the room he shared with Braven, breaking it. His sister Jolene threw herself on the floor and sobbed. They were all still crying, struggling to comfort each other, when they heard a knock on the door a half-hour later at 10 p.m. Outside, a tall man with a black shirt and badge stood on the rickety front steps. It was BIA Special Agent Jose Figueroa Jr., who'd just come from the crash site. A banner demanding justice for Braven hangs outside Old Bull's home. I'm sure you guys already know what happened , Figueroa said to Braven's older brother Keenan outside, according to Old Bull and court records . They clocked him going 90 and chased him, and he ended up going head-on with the train . Figueroa said the family could go to the mortuary the next morning. He asked whether Braven drank or did drugs, then left without offering condolences. When Braven's older brother returned inside, he had a confused look on his face. Speed limits often weren't enforced on the reservation. And Braven was always so slow behind the wheel. \"I didn't know what to think,\" Old Bull says. She was inclined to trust Figueroa, because her dad worked as a cop in South Dakota when she was younger. But Figueroa had hardly given the family any details-not even which agency had pursued her son-and she couldn't square the story she had been told about Braven speeding with the cautious boy she had raised. The next morning, she grew even more baffled when the mortuary owner said she couldn't see Braven's body yet. The owner didn't tell her that it had already been sent to a crime lab for an autopsy. Her confusion turned to shock in the days that followed. On the TV news, she learned that it was the tribal police who'd chased Braven, so she drove to their headquarters. But the force had by then disbanded, and the windows of the old Subway were covered in paper. Seething with anger, she tugged on the locked door and pressed her face against the windows, trying to see inside. \"There was a life taken, and you just closed everything down without giving the family any answers?\" she thought. When she went to the BIA office instead, looking for a police report, an officer handed her a sticky note that simply said \"FOIA.\" Over the next few months, she got an attorney, Nagle, who'd also been helping Kaysera's family, and they filed a Freedom of Information Act request for documents with the BIA, but the agency rejected it , citing an ongoing investigation. The question was, who was investigating? The BIA told Nagle that the FBI had jurisdiction, but an FBI agent told her his office had no case file for Braven. (The FBI, in response to my own FOIA request in 2022, would not confirm or deny whether it possessed documents related to Braven's death. The BIA told me both agencies initially investigated, but the FBI eventually took control because Klier was non-Native.) When Old Bull tried to get Braven's death certificate, an assistant at the Big Horn County court couldn't find it. When she tried to locate his car, the insurance company Progressive said authorities hadn't released it yet. For weeks, the only information she could access was from Braven's toxicology report; the coroner personally called to offer his condolences and to tell her that Braven had been drunk and had THC in his system when he died. It would take her four months to get the full autopsy report. She still didn't know the name of the officer who'd pursued her son or how the chase had unfolded. \"There was a life taken, and you just closed everything down without giving the family any answers?\" Old Bull, a medication aide at a nursing home, is far from naive when it comes to requesting medical documentation. But federal and state law enforcement have a reputation for keeping Native families in the dark after killings. \"It's expected for families not to get information,\" says Rae Peppers, a Crow former state lawmaker. Other families have also struggled to get basic paperwork after their loved ones died. \"They never notified me, not once,\" Fraser, Kaysera's grandmother and legal guardian, says of the sheriff's office that found Kaysera's body. \"It was hard, not getting any support,\" says Alvilene Buffalo Bull Tail, whose 14-year-old grandson, nicknamed Jr. Boy, was fatally hit by a train on the Crow reservation in 2017. Authorities deemed his death an accident, surmising that he fell asleep on the tracks; Buffalo Bull Tail suspects someone pushed him, and that law enforcement never properly investigated. \"We don't have closure until at least we know what really happened.\" In Lame Deer, a town on the Northern Cheyenne reservation bordering Crow, Maureen Bryant says her family still hasn't obtained a death certificate or autopsy report more than two years after her niece DeAnna Limberhand was found hogtied in the Stillwater River. Going to the courthouse for documents felt \"like a dead end.\" \"We kept waiting for paperwork or some kind of information, but we never heard,\" she says. \"What do you do if no one is helping you?\" she adds tearily. \"We're just going through a lot right now, and the not-knowing makes it even worse.\" Rae Peppers, a Crow former state lawmaker, says Native families often struggle to get information from federal and state law enforcement agencies after killings. The stonewalling led Old Bull and her family to speculate about what happened to Braven, and sometimes they clung to upsetting theories. When they went to the railroad after the crash and observed a second set of tire marks alongside Braven's leading from the highway through the grass to the railroad, they wondered whether the police ran him into the train. And they wondered if perhaps law enforcement's lack of transparency was a sign of something more nefarious. \"If you did nothing wrong, just release the information,\" Old Bull wanted to tell them. \"What is it you are trying to hide?\" Her suspicions heightened as witnesses came forward. According to her lawsuit, Maurice and Mavis Mountain Sheep, the couple who'd passed the wreck on their way to get gas, told her they had waited near the railroad for about a half-hour and didn't see anyone offer Braven first aid. Braven \"kept saying, 'Help me,'\" Mavis told the family. But law enforcement \"just stood there and stared at him.\" Old Bull also got a text from Bad Bear, the tribal police's dispatcher. \"I had quit by the time that occurred with your son but I can tell you right now, absolutely nothing was in compliance,\" Bad Bear wrote. \"That place should have not ever been opened...It was a shitshow there.\" For Old Bull, the lack of clarity about the night Braven died was like torture. And she isn't one to let something like this slide. In February 2023, she tried to sue Klier in federal court for wrongful death, hoping the court proceedings would bring new information to light. She had also sued the BIA, which sent officers to the scene of the crash, accusing the agency of negligently allowing the tribal police to operate without proper training and of failing to offer Braven medical care. \"The acts of the agents of Defendant United States shock the conscience and offend the community's sense of fair play and decency,\" her attorney wrote . Last April, a judge allowed Old Bull's case to proceed against the BIA, but not against Klier, because Klier had chased Braven in her capacity as a tribal employee, not a federal one. By then, it was too late for Old Bull to sue Klier in tribal court; she'd missed the tribe's statute of limitations. Old Bull decided to try a different tactic. In July 2023, she drove to Billings to share her story with a broader audience, including federal officials who were seeking feedback about law enforcement on reservations. She wasn't sure what to expect, but she hoped someone in power might finally listen. In the years since Braven died, President Biden had appointed the country's first Indigenous secretary of the interior, Deb Haaland. Before Haaland left Congress to take the job, she and other Native lawmakers passed a bill to hear testimony about crime and the crisis of missing Indigenous people. Now, Native families were coming from Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota to testify to a federal commission, some driving 20 hours round trip for a chance to speak for 15 minutes. Grace Bulltail, Kaysera's aunt, was a member of the commission and encouraged Old Bull to join. But Bulltail felt disappointed at the turnout of elected officials. \"We invited the Montana Department of Justice-nobody came,\" she says. Not even many Crow tribal leaders showed up. (A DOJ spokesperson said he wasn't aware of an invitation.) Still, Old Bull told me afterward that the gathering made her \"a little optimistic that something will change.\" It helped her feel less alone knowing that her family wasn't the only one waiting for answers. \"Listening to everyone's stories, you realize you're a piece of a big, big thing.\" The next month, I was in Crow Agency again, reporting on Braven's case. It had been nearly three years since Old Bull first started investigating the circumstances surrounding her son's death, but there'd been a big development since the last time I visited: The BIA had sent me an email with a trove of documents about the incident. It had taken me months of corresponding with the agency-after a year examining the case, interviewing dozens of people, and scouring court and government records-to get the details of her son's final minutes. I wondered whether my luck with the BIA had something to do with all the time that had passed, or my status as an outsider. Nagle, Old Bull's attorney, told me journalists are \"much more likely\" than Indigenous families to get documents from the federal government via the Freedom of Information Act. At Old Bull's house, she put on her glasses and joined me on the couch, where I spread out the highlighted pages for her to see. At first, what Old Bull read in the BIA's investigative report lined up with what she already knew. It all started on Highway 451 on November 24, she read. But the next detail made her purse her lips: At 5:39 p.m., Braven made a \"legal pass\" of Klier's police car over a dotted yellow line, according to the BIA's description of Klier's dashcam footage, which doesn't specify how fast he drove past her. Then, once he got in front of her, he slowed back down to the speed limit, about 70 mph, and Klier turned on her emergency lights to pull him over. He kept driving. Maybe he was afraid, Old Bull thought, remembering the officer who had choked him on his way to juvenile hall just months before the crash. In any case, Braven drove, still close to the speed limit. Seconds later, he slowed down considerably, and it appeared he might pull over. Klier, now following him at 55 mph, called dispatch and reported that he'd passed her at 90 mph. But Braven did not pull over. Klier activated her siren. Now, Braven began to accelerate, and she chased him. Seventy-seven miles per hour within half a minute. One hundred and nine miles per hour within a minute. They passed two other cars driving the opposite direction. Then Braven made a bold move. He turned off his headlights and other exterior lights, a tactic that drivers sometimes use to hide from police. At a bend in the highway, he went onto the grass, driving in the dark toward the railroad. Old Bull stopped reading and pushed her glasses onto her forehead. \"He legally passed her,\" she said. \"All this kid wanted to do was to go see his girlfriend, that was it. It doesn't make sense.\" She covered her face with her hands and cried. A \"compelling need\" for a police chase \"does not include the mere act of fleeing, even if reckless.\" One-third of all police chases in the United States end with a crash, often causing property damage, injury, or death. Many of these chases begin after an officer observes a traffic infraction, but because of the risks involved, some police departments only allow pursuits after a violent felony or something that puts the public in imminent danger. It's unclear whether the Crow police had a similar rule. Police Chief Tobacco and Sergeant Eastman testified in the lawsuit over Braven's death that there was not a handbook of policies and procedures in place, or at least they weren't aware of one. But the tribe submitted one to the BIA in the months leading up to the crash, according to records I obtained . That handbook states that an officer can only pursue a driver if there's a \"compelling need\" and if the chase presents less risk to the public than the driver remaining at large. A \"compelling need,\" the manual adds, \"does not include the mere act of fleeing, even if reckless,\" or \"traffic and licensing infractions, including DUI.\" Some police officers argue it's worthwhile to chase after a traffic violation, because maybe the driver is actually fleeing due to a bigger offense, like a dead body or bags of cocaine in the trunk. But suspicion alone, says Stoughton, the South Carolina expert, is not enough. \"If you aren't sure what the benefits of the pursuit are, but you do know the dangers,\" including a deadly crash, \"clearly the risks should outweigh the benefits,\" he says. \"Failing to stop for a speeding violation is not a good reason to kill someone.\" And that's especially true if the driver may be intoxicated, he says. In Braven's case, \"what's more dangerous-him driving the speed limit while drunk,\" or him being chased and \"driving 100 mph while drunk?\" says Stoughton, adding that Klier could have arrested him later: According to court documents, she'd already noted his license plate number. \"Had she terminated the pursuit,\" policing expert Susan Peters testified in Old Bull's lawsuit, \"more likely than not, Braven J. Glenn would not have been involved in a vehicular fatality accident.\" Scraps of burned metal, including a suspension spring, a radiator, and a wheel, are what's left of Braven's car near the site of the crash. As Old Bull and I read over the BIA reports, it became more and more apparent that the investigation into the crash had been flawed from the start. Moments after the crash, Klier called dispatch. \"Send medical,\" she said, according to call logs. \"He just got hit.\" Soon, other law enforcement arrived-from the tribal police, the BIA, the state highway patrol, the sheriff's office, and the fire department. But according to other records from the investigation, they struggled to get on the same page, a common complaint on reservations. Bodycam footage from Deputy Sheriff Michael Colvin, a county cop who was assigned to divert traffic, offers a small glimpse into the confusion. \"Hey, where's the body at?\" an officer asked Colvin. \"I don't know,\" Colvin said. \"Tribal PD was first on scene, and they told BIA where it was at...He said it wrecked some place down here.\" \"Was it crossing or what?\" \"I don't know. That's what I asked, but he didn't really give me an answer.\" Seconds later, paramedics drove past Colvin, lights flashing. A voice came over his radio: \"They're on scene, but they've been canceled.\" The paramedics left. Six minutes later, a tribal police officer called dispatch, according to records I obtained from the county attorney's office. \"Tribal asked why EMS canceled,\" the dispatcher noted in a call log , \"because they didn't make the determination the individual(s) were deceased.\" The tribal officer asked the paramedics to return. Later, Braven's girlfriend, Jordan, who drove over after Braven didn't pick her up after work, saw men loading a body bag into a white truck. Meanwhile, BIA special agent Figueroa arrived. According to an investigative report , he told Klier that the BIA would investigate the crash. Later, he told another tribal officer on the scene that Klier would need to have her blood drawn and that he needed the dashcam footage from her patrol vehicle. The officer acknowledged his request, but when Figueroa returned from speaking with the train conductor, Klier was gone and had taken the police car with her. The tribal officer had given Klier permission to go home, according to the report; she'd been visibly shaken up after the crash. \"It's like, what the fuck?\" says attorney Tim Bechtold, who is representing Old Bull in her lawsuit. \"All these cops not knowing what the fuck to do.\" Klier's decision to take her vehicle was \"incredibly unusual and wildly inappropriate,\" says Stoughton, the police expert in South Carolina. \"It's not that much different from an officer who's involved with a shooting taking their gun home instead of turning that over for evidence.\" A former tribal police officer, who requested anonymity, later told me he saw Klier at the police station soon after the crash. The officer drove to the railroad and alerted Figueroa that the car might be at headquarters. \"You need to go down there and get that vehicle now,\" he recalls telling Figueroa. But it's unclear if Figueroa went; he didn't locate the car that night. The next day, Figueroa told the Crow police department that he would need a copy of Klier's incident report and the dashcam footage. The following day was Thanksgiving. And a day after that, Figueroa learned the police department had already \"disbanded and closed shop,\" according to the BIA investigation. \"No one knows who has access to their reports.\" Then things got even more complicated. In mid-December, when Figueroa reminded the tribe that he still needed the report, he learned that someone had broken into the former police headquarters. Now the records he needed were missing. Figueroa still didn't know where Klier's police car was, either. So in January, he drove to Wyoming, where she lived and worked with the VA, to find her. She said she was waiting for an attorney and didn't want to talk. (She also declined my request for comment.) Figueroa drove back to Montana and reached out to the tribe's homeland security director, who said he was \"unsure where anything was,\" this time citing two break-ins at the police ­headquarters,­ but that he would try his best to find the records. (Police equipment, including guns, had also gone missing.) Two weeks later, in February, Figueroa learned the headquarters had suffered four break-ins, but someone had finally located Klier's police car; Figueroa copied the dashcam footage. In May, he obtained the BIA's dispatch logs, but the tribal police's logs concerning Braven's death-and Klier's incident report for it-were still missing. (They don't appear to have ever been recovered.) Harris, the former Big Horn county attorney, whose term ended in late 2022, believes the US government may be responsible, at least in part, for mistakes made by law enforcement that night. In addition to allegedly failing to provide potentially lifesaving medical care, the BIA did not properly secure the scene of the crash and allowed Klier's police car to get away, and then took months to find it. \"You would think [the BIA] would have their hair on fire chasing everybody down,\" says Jonathan Smith, who oversaw investigations into police department misconduct at Obama's Justice Department. If it took that long to locate the car, he adds, \"it seems unlikely they tried as hard as they could.\" Old Bull's lawsuit is scheduled for trial this summer. The US government denies any wrongdoing. Since the BIA did not employ the Crow's tribal police force, an attorney for the government wrote in response to the complaint, \"the United States cannot be held liable...for their negligence.\" \"There's so much they did wrong...It's like a ton of bricks just hits you. I fought so hard...It's like we don't matter, like we are nothing.\" After reading the BIA reports, Old Bull retraced the new information. \"There's so much they did wrong...It's like a ton of bricks just hits you,\" she told me, motioning with her hands toward her chest. She wondered whether things might have been different if she'd gotten some of this information sooner-whether it would have helped her legal case, or at the very least helped her heal. And it stung, she added, knowing that an outsider like me-a white journalist with no connection to Braven-could access all these FOIA records, while she, Braven's mother, had been denied. It took suing for her to begin getting evidence, and even that, she said, didn't include some of the key details I'd just shared with her. \"I fought so hard to get that, years and years,\" she said. \"It's like we don't matter, like we are nothing.\" Two days later, former tribal police chief Terrill Bracken arrived at my Airbnb in Billings. I'd told him that Old Bull was interested in seeing him. Bracken wasn't leading the police department when Braven died, and he knew little about the chase. But if Old Bull wanted to talk, meeting her seemed like the Christian thing to do, he said. \"Anything I can do to help her with the grief that she is going through, that's why I'm here,\" he told me. Old Bull, who'd worked a 12-hour shift at the nursing home that day, sat in her car outside the house for a moment before entering. For months, she'd been asking God to help her forgive, but it was hard to let go of all the resentments she carried. Maybe, she thought, it would be easier after talking with Bracken and hearing another perspective. \"I have to come face-to-face with somebody that started this whole thing, and just get some straightforward answers,\" she told me at the front door. After taking a seat opposite the former police chief, Old Bull anxiously tapped on her glass of water with her fingers, tears welling in her eyes. Bracken said he was sorry for her loss. She thanked him. \"That's our right to know what happened to our child,\" she said. \"And I never got that. I had to fight and fight and fight.\" \"And it should not have to be that way,\" Bracken agreed. \"It's frustrating for me,\" he added, \"because I know what we were working toward was going to be so much better,\" he said of the tribal police. Their conversation stretched on for two hours. At points, Old Bull seemed to soften toward Bracken. \"I do feel better with you talking to me. I can see you now as a person,\" she said. But when he began talking about Officer Klier, the mood shifted. \"For all we know,\" Bracken said of Klier, \"she's not doing very well right now.\" \"She's not the one hurting,\" Old Bull said quietly. \"I'm not saying who's suffering more. It's not a contest,\" Bracken responded. \"But I'm just being honest with you: Given the information that I have, I can't see how I would have acted any differently than the officer. And that's a difficult part of the job.\" Old Bull sighed. \"I gotta work in the morning,\" she said, signaling her intent to leave. \"Would it be okay if I prayed with you?\" he asked. She nodded, her eyes shut, and began crying after he placed his hands over hers. Driving home, Old Bull was glad to have spoken with Bracken. But as she lay in bed the next morning, recalling the conversation, her anger grew. \"For him to say, 'Oh, poor Pamela, I wonder what she's going through'? How dare you ,\" she thought. She picked up her phone and texted me: \"Samantha there was a lot that bothered me. He put her on this pedestal,\" she wrote. \"To sit there and emphasize her feelings, when this is about the loss of my son and her actions made that loss happen. I feel like it was an attempt...to glorify what she did as a cop.\" \"This is a system made to oppress us. It's been this way since Columbus,\" she added, before putting down her phone and heading to work. The doors of the tribal police headquarters were locked the first time I visited last year, but I could peek inside to see how abruptly it was all abandoned. The police's whiteboard calendar still showed the Thanksgiving party scheduled for the day Braven died. Stacks of unused call logs sat in dusty boxes. In the parking lot, a makeshift jail remained, two tiny cells inside a shipping container. The refrigerated counter that once held Subway's sandwich ingredients-and then guns-had been removed. The dining tables that the cops used as desks were piled outside beneath cottonwood trees. The temporary holding cell in a modified shipping container outside the former tribal police station The former tribal police station in a closed-down Subway store on the Crow reservation There was never a public explanation for why the department closed in late November 2020, leading to speculation. Old Bull still wonders whether the police are hiding something. Big Man, the historian, wonders if they packed up and left because of poor training and lack of community support, and because Braven's chase was \"the final straw.\" \"There were a lot of reasons why it shut down,\" says one of the tribal police officers who requested anonymity. \"It was starting to fail\" even before Braven's accident, and then \"the money stopped coming in.\" Bracken doubts Braven's death was the only motivation for disbanding, if it was a motivation at all. He blames politics: A few weeks before the crash, Chairman Not Afraid lost the election to Frank White Clay, a former tribal lawmaker who believed propping up a new police force with Covid relief funding violated federal spending guidelines. \"We're still trying to figure out exactly where that money went,\" White Clay would later tell a journalism student at the University of Montana in 2021. He agreed the reservation needed more law enforcement but said this police force was just \"playing cops.\" Rather than give White Clay the satisfaction of disbanding the force, Not Afraid beat him to it and shut down the department about a week before the inauguration, according to another former tribal police official. It was possible Braven's accident may have been \"the catalyst, the icing on the cake,\" but it wasn't the primary reason for closing, he said. Harris, the former Big Horn county attorney, says the department's sudden ­closure was evidence that it was never properly established. \"A legitimate, lawful police agency doesn't just end because a chairman or president or governor says, 'All right. Enough,'\" he tells me. \"This [police department] was a mirage, a facade.\" It was \"a temporary fix, nothing more than a Band-Aid,\" one of the former police officers tells me. \"Did we do everything perfectly? Absolutely not,\" says Bracken. \"But were we doing the best we could with what we had? Yes. I really believe that department would have flourished into something had it gotten a fair opportunity.\" The Crow police force's brief existence and abrupt end is not just a story about a tribal administration's mistakes, says Big Man. It is also a story about the federal government's repeated failures leading up to 2020-to keep families informed, to conduct thorough investigations, to keep the reservation safe. And it shows \"a real need for clear, meaningful communication\" with Crow people, says Kristina Lucero, who directs the American Indian Governance and Policy Institute at the University of Montana, \"about expected goals and the mission of what law enforcement should be doing.\" The police department was \"a temporary fix, nothing more than a Band-Aid.\" Many of the families who testified with Old Bull in Billings were adamant that they want more transparent policing, including easier access to information after loved ones die or go missing. \"Authorities at all levels must improve communications with family members, who are too often left in the dark for days, weeks, or months,\" causing \"enormous stress,\" the federal commission wrote afterward. Indigenous communities also want more funding: In 2022, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe in Montana sued the US government because of a shortage of police. The state's Fort Belknap Indian Community sued too, after the BIA refused to provide more public safety money. \"What's happening at Crow, that's pretty extreme,\" says UCLA's van Schilfgaarde, but \"when budgets are tight, these [police] departments come and go in a way that would just never happen in other communities.\" The problem isn't just in Montana, she adds. Most Native villages in Alaska have no law enforcement presence whatsoever. Two days after his inauguration in 2020, White Clay informed the BIA that \"an independent law enforcement effort is not the direction that the new administration of the Crow Tribe intends to continue.\" Since then, complaints about BIA policing persist. In July 2021, the tribe sued a BIA officer after he was caught on video failing to stop his dog from biting someone handcuffed after a traffic stop, for nearly a minute, leading to three surgeries on the man's ankle and foot. \"Unfortunately, nothing in this video is surprising to anyone who has lived on the Crow Nation,\" the tribe's attorney wrote. \"I had a lot of faith in the police before,\" Old Bull says, \"but after Braven died, I don't believe they're there to protect us.\" In December, President Biden signed an executive order to remove red tape that has hampered Native access to law enforcement funding. But legal action might be more effective. In May, a US district judge encouraged the feds to meet with the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota and \"figure out how to more fairly fund\" tribal policing-or else go to trial. The decision was \"the first to acknowledge that the government owes a treaty-based duty to fund law enforcement for [an] Indian tribe,\" according to the Oglala Sioux's attorneys. And they say it could at last force a legal reckoning over Washington's centuries-long harm to Native justice systems. A successful reckoning must give tribes more jurisdiction and make room for them to reimagine policing and public safety in ways that reflect their own cultures and customs, says Goldberg, the Obama appointee to the Indian Law and Order Commission. She's seen Indigenous communities that involve spiritual leaders in justice proceedings to weigh in on punishments and design a path forward. The Tulalip reservation in Washington state, in keeping with its values, has required police to stop by the Boys & Girls Club twice a shift to help kids with homework, and they attend elders' breakfasts to share data and answer questions. A successful reckoning must give tribes more jurisdiction and make room for them to reimagine policing and public safety in ways that reflect their own cultures and customs. On the Crow reservation, most people I asked said the tribe needed more law enforcement, but they also emphasized the importance of better officer training. Some said they wanted to think about public safety in a more balanced way, with funding for mental health, addiction treatment, housing, and education. Investments like these could make it easier to recruit good local cops, says the University of Montana's Lucero, since people might be less hesitant to police their relatives if the justice system offered more second chances and paths toward healing. \"You just can't arrest people, lock them up, and expect to throw them back in the same situation and change,\" says Big Man. \"Past traumas have created who we are,\" adds Old Bull. \"Get people into treatment and get them help and programs before moving in a police department.\" Tribal nations that are successful with law enforcement, says Goldberg, are ones with \"strong congruence between the views of the community and the way it's done.\" Braven's family built a memorial for him near the site of his death. Old Bull buried Braven about an hour from home, at the foot of the Pryor Mountains, next to the graves of his father and his cousin Kaysera. The cemetery is small and quiet, off a dirt path surrounded by fields, and most of the gravestones are simple, some with fake flowers and crosses. Old Bull and her family go there often to mow the grass around Braven's plot and decorate it with gifts, like chocolate-covered pretzels, one of his favorite snacks, and a basketball covered in their handwritten messages for him. At times they'll play music and reminisce about the ways he made them laugh, like how he'd make a muscle like Popeye and kiss it. When two of his older sisters got pregnant, they went to the cemetery and told him about it. When his younger sister graduated high school, she wore a cap beaded with the words, \"We did it Brave.\" They feel sometimes like he's still with them, even sending them messages. The night before his funeral, when Old Bull slept in a teepee with his remains, in keeping with her Lakota traditions, she and another family member heard a basketball bouncing in the middle of the night, even though everyone else had long since gone to bed. In August 2023, on what would have been his 20th birthday, Old Bull and her kids drive to the cemetery to visit Braven. They eat chocolate cupcakes with sprinkles, Braven's favorite, and release balloons into the sky for him. \"I want them to know he was a person too,\" Emilio says. \"He was a good kid and had big dreams, and for them to hide in the shadows-he deserves justice, the truth.\" \"Accountability and closure-that's what my mom really needs, what I really need,\" adds sister Marissa. \"I do want accountability, and I want them to admit this didn't have to happen,\" says Old Bull. On the drive home around 10 p.m., Old Bull sees a white owl sitting on the side of the road. In her tradition, owls are harbingers of death. The last time she encountered one, her mom died, and not too long afterward Braven did, too. When she arrives home it's almost midnight, and she lights a bundle of sage and cedar, calling her kids and grandkids out of the house to smudge them and help keep them safe. \"Bring the babies out,\" she instructs, walking to each person with the bundle and watching as they wave the smoke over their heads and into their hearts, all the way down to their legs. \"Who's next?\" This project was completed with the support of a grant from Columbia University's Ira A. Lipman Center for Journalism and Civil and Human Rights in conjunction with Arnold Ventures. Old Bull visits the memorial placed where Braven died.\n\nSubscribe to Mother Jones podcasts on Apple Podcasts or your favorite podcast app. The disappearance of a new police department so soon after the wreck was highly unusual, the kind of story you might never hear twice. But other parts of Braven's story were deeply familiar: unanswered questions after deaths on the reservation, inadequate law enforcement. Before 2020, the federal government controlled policing in the Crow Nation-providing only a handful of officers for an area two-thirds the size of Connecticut. Crimes went unsolved , grieving relatives complained of faulty investigations, and some victims wouldn't even call for help, fearing violence by officers. (Nationally, police kill Native Americans at higher rates than other people of color.) The Crow's tribal police department was a desperately needed but underfunded counterbalance to a federal system that isn't working. And Braven was caught up in the dysfunction. So, too, was Old Bull. After the tribal cops disappeared, it felt like nobody in power would talk to her, like nobody noticed the life that was lost or took responsibility for it. \"They come on Native land and they kill, and they just walk away. They think nobody is gonna care,\" she said as she drove home from the train tracks, the sun almost set, the clouds a deep blue behind her. \"I think they thought that's how our family was gonna be-that we were gonna let this go.\" \"They didn't expect us to speak out and try to get answers,\" she added. Blossom Old Bull in her home in Crow Agency, Montana The Crow tribe has about 13,400 members, most of whom live on or around the reservation in southeastern Montana, a lush landscape with towering mountains, open skies, and rivers teeming with trout. The tribal nation earns some revenue from its vast coal and oil reserves. Most people speak Crow as a first language, and the matrilineal clan system remains strong. Braven and his mom moved to the reservation when he was in eighth grade. Old Bull, a single mom and health care worker from South Dakota, is Lakota, not Crow, and she'd been raising Braven in New Mexico; he was her youngest boy, the eighth of nine siblings. But she wanted him to grow up closer to his father, who was Crow, and some of his older brothers and sisters, and to learn more about that part of his Native heritage. When she'd spent time on the reservation previously, she recalled families camping in teepees for Crow Fair, an annual celebration with a powwow and horse racing and a rodeo, or enjoying the Sun Dance and sweat lodges. Braven hadn't wanted to move away from Albuquerque. He was a sensitive kid, and he cried in 2017 when he learned he'd have to leave his basketball team behind. In Montana, the family settled in the town of Crow Agency in a shabby one-story house that they spruced up with fresh paint. It was a rough transition; weeks after they arrived, Braven's dad died from pneumonia after a struggle with alcoholism. Braven, only 13 years old, stood at his bedside the day they pulled him off life support. I know you weren't there for me because you were sick , he said, but I still love you. \"He was such a good-hearted person, to even think in those terms at that age,\" says his sister Marissa. Braven did his best to settle into the bunkbed room he now shared with his older brother Emilio, who played basketball with him on the corner courts. He grew closer with his half siblings' grandmother, who adopted him as her own grandson. He loved spending time at her house and would offer to drive her to appointments, help her carry groceries, and put the pots away on the top shelf of her kitchen. Braven was an honor-roll student who ran cross country and track and played JV basketball. Though he hadn't wanted to move to the reservation, it didn't take long for Braven to hit his stride. His cousin Jayden remembers how quickly Braven made friends: \"I left for the summer and came back and everyone knew him. He was really popular.\" \"He had a goofy personality,\" says his girlfriend, Jordan Jefferson. As the years passed, Braven excelled-an honor-roll student who ran cross country and track and played JV basketball, and who was unanimously chosen by his teammates to co-manage the varsity squad, which he hoped to eventually join himself, running miles most days to get in better shape. \"He was one of a kind and always ready to take the challenge,\" says Mike Beads Don't Mix, his freshman coach. But the pandemic marked the start of a shift after Braven's high school switched to remote learning and he couldn't see his friends much. In August 2020, the month he was turning 17, his grandma got Covid; she fell into a coma and was unable to sing him \"Happy Birthday\" like she normally did. Weeks later, she was dead. \"He took it really hard\" and \"got a little more distant from all of us,\" his sister JoLee remembers. In his bedroom, Braven played his grandma's favorite song, \"Blue Ain't Your Color\" by Keith Urban, over and over. His grades slipped, and he started drinking more. The week of Braven's birthday, Old Bull found him passed out on a couch at his older brother's house. He lashed out at her after she roused him, and she called the cops, hoping they might teach him a lesson. The police arrested him for disorderly conduct and took him to juvenile detention in Billings, about an hour away. \"My mom, she had to raise all these kids on her own, so I guess you could say she's tough, but not mean,\" Emilio says. \"She's loving, she'd get us a bunch of basketball shoes, but she's gonna give you the tough love you need to succeed in this world.\" \"But you need to learn now, Braven, that if somebody needs to call the cops on you, this is what will happen.\" When Braven returned three days later, now on probation, he hugged Old Bull and gave her a letter he'd written apologizing for the incident. \"I never want to leave your side again,\" he wrote. \"I know everybody in our family is disappointed in me...I was crying while writing this letter just because I realized how bad I hurt you.\" He told Old Bull that on his way to detention, an arresting officer from the Crow tribal police \"choked [him] out,\" according to court records, and that it had scared him, reaffirming all the bad stories he'd heard about law enforcement: His cousin Jayden once watched a cop push his uncle's head into the concrete, and they both remembered when officers at Crow Fair beat Braven's 15-year-old cousin Esaias Stops Pretty Places. This is why I didn't want to call the police , Old Bull told him. \"But you need to learn now, Braven, that if somebody needs to call the cops on you,\" she added, \"this is what will happen.\" Tattoos in memory of her son Braven Glenn adorn Blossom Old Bull's forearm. For centuries before the Europeans arrived, the Crow had no police. Instead, warrior groups protected people and enforced laws like the rules of the buffalo hunt. \"There's a big difference between a warrior and a cop,\" says Crow historian Alden Big Man Jr., who has studied the tribe's traditional systems of justice. Warriors' punishments could be harsh, including things like burning down a person's home or killing his horses, but if the offender responded favorably, the warriors would compensate his loss, perhaps giving him as many horses as had been taken away. In the 1800s, the federal government confined the Crow, also known as the Apsáalooke, to the reservation; white settlers often shot at people who tried to leave. The tribe's nomadic hunters and gatherers were forced to become sedentary farmers and to accept Christianity, learn English, and educate their kids in the colonizers' way. As railroads brought white ranchers into their grazing areas and banks denied Crows loans, the former warriors were \"reduced to begging for handouts during ration days,\" according to Big Man, while they \"witnessed a complete annihilation of the buffalo, as well as the disappearance of a whole way of life.\" In 1887, after a Crow man led a war party off the reservation to steal horses, a colonial agent sent the party to jail. \"It was right then and there,\" says Big Man, that in the Crow Nation \"the system changed from warrior societies to the government enforcing the law.\" Around that time, the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) began appointing Native officers to police reservations-ordering them to prohibit traditional rituals that the colonizers viewed as immoral, ration food and other supplies, and stop any activities that might interfere with white economic pursuits. In 1885, Congress had taken away Native nations' right to prosecute serious crimes like homicides committed by Native people against other Natives on reservations. (US lawmakers were outraged that a Sioux government in South Dakota had punished a killer according to its own principles of justice -rather than the death penalty, it had fined him $600, eight horses, and a blanket.) Instead, murders and other violent offenses would be investigated by federal agents, some of whom traveled long distances to tribal territories and had little to no long-standing relationship with the people who lived there. Nearly a century later, as activists from the American Indian Movement protested police brutality and rising crime, Congress passed the 1975 Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act , which created a path for tribes to take back more control of law enforcement. If tribal nations were able to jump through the hoops needed to secure a contract with the BIA, they could divert federal dollars intended for BIA cops to their own tribal police. \"It was a real game-changer,\" says Lauren van Schilfgaarde, an Indian law scholar who is Cochiti Pueblo and previously directed UCLA's Tribal Legal Development Clinic. Tribes have since set up more than 200 law enforcement agencies on reservations, far surpassing the number of BIA agencies. But many tribes were not able to get a contract, including the Crow, and those that have tribal police still lack jurisdiction over major crimes. In 1978, the Supreme Court also removed their ability to prosecute non-Natives, even for most minor crimes. \"Even if you have infinite dollars, if your police departments have questionable, shaky, or even no authority over any person within their territorial boundaries, that compromises the entire enterprise,\" van Schilfgaarde says. The federal government, meanwhile, skimped on funding for reservation cops, much as it skimped on health care, education, housing, and rural infrastructure. By 2001, violent crime on reservations was double or triple the national average. \"Ultimately, you are of your environment,\" Aaron Brien, a historian for the Crow tribe, says in the recent documentary Murder in Big Horn . \"When you take an entire society and strip them of any confidence and self-worth they have, it becomes very fragile.\" Tribes barely had half the policing resources per capita as non-Native communities: While Baltimore, Detroit, New York City, and DC had between four and seven officers per thousand residents, few tribal departments had ratios of more than two officers per thousand residents. As some communities of color protested overpolicing in cities, says van Schilfgaarde, reservations suffered the opposite extreme, coupled with a lack of resources to address public safety through other means like addiction treatment, employment, and schooling. \"It's incredibly frustrating and dangerous,\" she says. Under the Obama administration, Congress passed the Tribal Law and Order Act , creating a commission to study the problem. The commission, which included Republican and Democratic lawmakers along with Indian law experts, recommended the federal government pay to nearly double the number of reservation police-noting that crime dropped by more than one-third on four reservations that hired extra cops during a pilot program in 2009. The tribes themselves, instead of the BIA, should lead the police, the commission argued; this change would help build trust with the community and more closely reflect tribal priorities and customs. \"Public safety in Indian Country can improve dramatically once Native nations and Tribes have greater freedom to build and maintain their own criminal justice systems,\" the commission wrote , describing the federal policing system as \"a maze of injustice.\" The commission set a goal of 2024 to \"close the public safety gap\" on reservations. But by 2018, the number of BIA-funded officers on reservations hadn't grown at all-in fact, it had fallen by about one-third. Carole Goldberg, a commission member appointed by Obama, says Trump's administration seemed more focused on approving oil pipelines on Native land than on reforming reservation law enforcement. By 2020, the BIA estimated tribes needed $1.4 billion to handle policing nationally but admitted it was only providing $246 million, almost the same budget as a decade earlier. (The Department of Justice provided less than $100 million.) \"It's like working with strings and tin cans at times,\" Robert Bryant, chief of police for the Penobscot Nation, had testified to the commission. During parts of that year, the Crow Nation had just four BIA police to cover an expanse of 3,500 square miles. BIA cops were stretched so thin that \"we were pulling 18-hour days\" and \"going months without a day off,\" says Josie Passes, a former officer who wrote a letter to members of Congress begging for backup. A perceived lack of accountability contributed to a climate of fear. \"When you start thinking about it,\" says Birdie Real Bird, 70, a lifelong Crow resident whose aunt was assaulted during a home break-in and never received a visit from police, \"you're a sitting duck.\" \"When our Native women and girls go missing, law enforcement chooses to do nothing, and it's up to the family members to do the hard work of investigating.\" Add to that the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, an international problem that's particularly severe in the Crow Nation, where girls are sometimes sex-trafficked and used as drug mules along Interstate 90. Seventy-four people disappeared on the Crow and neighboring Northern Cheyenne reservations in 2019-more than any other area of Montana, which has one of the highest rates of missing Indigenous women nationally. One of them was Braven's cousin Kaysera Stops Pretty Places , an 18-year-old who loved to sing, dance, run, and wrestle. Five days after she disappeared, the sheriff's office found her body face down in a fenced backyard, but the office didn't notify her family for nearly two weeks. Four and a half years later, her cause of death remains undetermined . Families of the missing often complain about poor transparency and inadequate investigations, and jurisdictional barriers make the situation worse. The BIA can't arrest people for crimes committed off the reservation, even in border towns like Hardin, where Kaysera died. And on the reservation, other agencies-like the FBI or the sheriff's office-might have jurisdiction depending on the type of offense and whether the perpetrator was Native. Because it's often unclear whether a crime took place on or off the reservation and who the perpetrator was, it's easy for law enforcement to avoid responsibility. When corpses are discovered, investigators regularly write off the deaths as accidental. Commonly, \"when our Native women and girls go missing,\" says Mary Kathryn Nagle, a Cherokee attorney who assisted Kaysera's relatives, \"law enforcement chooses to do nothing, and it's up to the family members to do the hard work of investigating.\" \"When you start thinking about it, you're a sitting duck.\" By 2019, the Crow reservation was desperate for a change. In August, one of the few BIA cops there-the police chief, no less-quit in protest of his agency's understaffing. That November, Crow Chairman AJ Not Afraid, the tribe's chief executive, issued an emergency declaration over the shortage of police. Days later, he traveled to DC with other Native leaders to discuss the issue with President Trump, whose administration was announcing Operation Lady Justice, an initiative to improve the federal response to tribes' missing-persons cases. Some Indigenous critics described the effort as uninformed. Trump, for his part, seemed fixated on the Crow chairman's name. \"Is it true-you're not afraid? Are you not afraid of anything?\" Trump asked, laughing. On New Year's Day 2020, Not Afraid's 16-year-old niece, Selena Not Afraid, went missing at a rest stop between Hardin and Billings. A search party, which included Braven, scoured the surrounding fields with ATVs, helicopters, horses, dogs, and drones. Three weeks later, a team from the Interior Department discovered her body less than a mile away. Her death was attributed to hypothermia, but some locals suspected foul play. Selena's sister had previously died in a hit-and-run, and her brother was killed by the Billings police. \"The Crow Tribe,\" Not Afraid had said in his emergency declaration, \"will no longer accept 'lip service' for the unacceptable lack of law enforcement.\" It was long past time, he and his administration believed, to create their own tribal force. Not Afraid pleaded with the BIA to fund a new police department, according to records of their correspondence. But the BIA kept denying his request , arguing that the tribe, which didn't have a jail or other necessary infrastructure, hadn't fulfilled application requirements and couldn't effectively manage law enforcement. The pandemic provided Not Afraid with an opening. In May 2020, the Crow Nation received $27 million in coronavirus relief funding through the CARES Act. Suddenly, he didn't need the BIA's money; he had enough to launch a police department on his own. Soon he'd hired about 15 officers, tripling the police presence on the reservation. \"I was excited about it,\" says Yolanda Fraser, ­Kaysera's grandmother. \"I thought that finally we would have a justice unit that could dig into\" missing-persons cases. However, tribal legal experts say Not Afraid failed to get the necessary approval from tribal lawmakers. \"Police departments need to be established by legislation-that wasn't there,\" says Dennis Bear Don't Walk, the tribe's former chief judge and now legislative counsel, who says Not Afraid also likely needed lawmakers to sign off on using CARES Act money for policing. Not Afraid declined to comment, but former officials who helped him launch the department told me they believed he had the power to control spending and establish law enforcement during an emergency like the pandemic. (The Treasury Department is reviewing the matter and declined to comment, as did the BIA.) In Indian Country, tribal chairs have sometimes faced accusations of co-opting police departments for their own purposes-officers can act as enforcers for whoever has the upper hand in tribal management. After the department launched in late June, Not Afraid put out press releases promising to prioritize community involvement and rehabilitation. But he also embraced tactics that appeared to benefit him personally. In August 2020, he responded to an uptick in Covid deaths by imposing a reservation-wide lockdown and curfew , which had public health benefits but also ­prevented political opponents from campaigning ahead of the November election-even as he held events to drum up support himself. Some doubted the legitimacy of Not Afraid's new force. \"What if they pull a gun on you: Are they a real cop?\" Big Man, the historian, wondered. Gerald \"Jay\" Harris, the chief prosecutor in Big Horn County, which includes most of the reservation, sent a memo to the sheriff's department warning that the county could be exposed to lawsuits if it worked with the tribal police, which Harris, who is also Crow, did not view as legitimate. The BIA kept patrolling alongside the new officers but sometimes wouldn't send calls through to them, according to sources familiar with the tribal force. Passes, the BIA officer, viewed the tribal cops as more of a \"militia group than a law enforcement department.\" The federal government had never invested enough resources to create a strong pipeline of trained local police. Shilo Bad Bear was hired as a supervising dispatcher of the new department, even though she only had about 10 months of prior experience. \"I was so scared-I didn't have the proper qualifications,\" she says. \"I basically had to learn by myself,\" adds another dispatcher, who asked for anonymity; she had no prior experience and says she received a sheet of 10 codes but no formal training. Shilo Bad Bear, a former 911 dispatcher for the Crow tribal police, says she was hired without much experience. Passes questioned whether the force's employees had undergone sufficient background checks; she recalled that the BIA had arrested some of them in the past. Some of the cops had retired years ago from other agencies, which meant they were no longer certified, according to one former officer, who also requested anonymity. Others had never worked as a cop. Under Montana law, they could patrol for almost a year before attending a police academy to become certified. It's a delay that's common in small rural departments, but one that Michael Gennaco, a consultant in California who specializes in civilian oversight of law enforcement, describes as \"a tragedy waiting to happen.\" Geoffrey Eastman, a tribal patrol sergeant who did have his certification, later testified in litigation surrounding Braven's death that \"there were no policies in place\" to show officers what was expected of them. And resources were tight. For a police headquarters, Not Afraid's administration purchased a closed-down Subway restaurant attached to a museum that commemorated the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn. Confused tourists often dropped in looking to order sandwiches, but the counter that once stored cold cuts had become a temporary shelf for officers' guns. \"It felt like a joke,\" says Bad Bear. \"We were making do with what we had,\" says the department's first police chief, Terrill Bracken, and \"building an airplane as we were flying.\" The goal was to create \"a department of the people, for the people,\" says Bracken, \"with tribal members policing their own.\" But recruiting Crow cops was challenging because of the long hours, low pay, and limited benefits, and because of the reservation's extensive clan system; few locals wanted a job that might involve arresting their relatives. So Not Afraid also brought in outsiders, who he hoped would be more impartial. Bracken himself was a white martial arts instructor from Billings who had briefly worked as a sheriff's deputy; he moved into a camping trailer outside the tribal police headquarters, away from his wife and two kids, so he could devote more time to the force. \"I had so much passion for that project,\" he says. \"It wasn't going to get done unless somebody stepped up.\" After one month, he was unexpectedly replaced; Crow local Larry Tobacco, who had previously worked for the BIA, became chief. The new police department also recruited from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Sheridan, Wyoming, which staffs about a dozen federal cops to patrol a manicured VA campus. \"The reservation stays very busy and you would be exposed to a lot more major crime than you are here,\" the VA's police chief told his team in May 2020, according to emails obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request. Under VA ethics guidelines, the agency's cops generally could not moonlight on the reservation if the tribal police received federal funding. Even though Not Afraid launched the force with CARES Act funds, the tribe assured the VA that no federal funds would be used, according to emails and interviews, so the VA ethics committee gave its blessing. (One former police official told me he was present when an attorney told Not Afraid that the funds became tribal after entering the tribe's bank accounts; a Treasury Department spokesperson said the funds still would have been federal. Not Afraid did not respond to my request for comment.) Former tribal police vehicles sit abandoned on the Crow reservation. Some Crow residents, including Old Bull, questioned whether it made sense to invite outside law enforcement onto the reservation. And these VA officers may not have been prepared for real policing, says Seth Stoughton, a former cop who lectures on policing issues at the University of South Carolina; patrolling a VA medical center, he says, is more like working as a security guard than as a municipal cop. Bracken tells me these officers had previously completed training in operating a police vehicle to get federal certification at the VA. But a VA spokesperson told me its officers receive no training in high-speed chases because they are banned by the agency. The night Braven died, it was a VA police officer turned tribal cop, Pamela Klier, who chased him. The Crow tribal police \"was a good thought,\" says Bad Bear, the dispatcher, but \"it seemed like something bad was bound to happen because these guys didn't know what they were doing.\" The morning before Braven died, he and his brother Emilio played basketball for a couple of hours. Then Braven went to his late grandma's house in Hardin to see his cousins Jayden and Trey, who were still grieving her death. He seemed fine, remembers Jayden; they \"danced each other up,\" like they always did to say hello, and then Braven went to fish at a nearby pond. Around 1 p.m., he texted his girlfriend and offered to pick her up at home after her shift at the Boys & Girls Club that evening. He could borrow the car at his grandma's house, a black Chevy Malibu, to make the 35-minute ride. It was already dark out when he hit the road, a crisp November night, but it hadn't snowed yet so it would be an easy drive. Blossom Old Bull didn't learn about the crash until several hours afterward. She had just woken up from a nap when she got a phone call. Braven's older brother Gavin was sobbing. He'd heard that Braven had been in an accident. \"Where is he? Which hospital do I go to?\" Old Bull asked frantically. \"He's dead,\" Gavin said, still crying. Old Bull dropped the phone and screamed. No! she yelled. How do you know? Emilio hit a shelf in the room he shared with Braven, breaking it. His sister Jolene threw herself on the floor and sobbed. They were all still crying, struggling to comfort each other, when they heard a knock on the door a half-hour later at 10 p.m. Outside, a tall man with a black shirt and badge stood on the rickety front steps. It was BIA Special Agent Jose Figueroa Jr., who'd just come from the crash site. A banner demanding justice for Braven hangs outside Old Bull's home. I'm sure you guys already know what happened , Figueroa said to Braven's older brother Keenan outside, according to Old Bull and court records . They clocked him going 90 and chased him, and he ended up going head-on with the train . Figueroa said the family could go to the mortuary the next morning. He asked whether Braven drank or did drugs, then left without offering condolences. When Braven's older brother returned inside, he had a confused look on his face. Speed limits often weren't enforced on the reservation. And Braven was always so slow behind the wheel. \"I didn't know what to think,\" Old Bull says. She was inclined to trust Figueroa, because her dad worked as a cop in South Dakota when she was younger. But Figueroa had hardly given the family any details-not even which agency had pursued her son-and she couldn't square the story she had been told about Braven speeding with the cautious boy she had raised. The next morning, she grew even more baffled when the mortuary owner said she couldn't see Braven's body yet. The owner didn't tell her that it had already been sent to a crime lab for an autopsy. Her confusion turned to shock in the days that followed. On the TV news, she learned that it was the tribal police who'd chased Braven, so she drove to their headquarters. But the force had by then disbanded, and the windows of the old Subway were covered in paper. Seething with anger, she tugged on the locked door and pressed her face against the windows, trying to see inside. \"There was a life taken, and you just closed everything down without giving the family any answers?\" she thought. When she went to the BIA office instead, looking for a police report, an officer handed her a sticky note that simply said \"FOIA.\" Over the next few months, she got an attorney, Nagle, who'd also been helping Kaysera's family, and they filed a Freedom of Information Act request for documents with the BIA, but the agency rejected it , citing an ongoing investigation. The question was, who was investigating? The BIA told Nagle that the FBI had jurisdiction, but an FBI agent told her his office had no case file for Braven. (The FBI, in response to my own FOIA request in 2022, would not confirm or deny whether it possessed documents related to Braven's death. The BIA told me both agencies initially investigated, but the FBI eventually took control because Klier was non-Native.) When Old Bull tried to get Braven's death certificate, an assistant at the Big Horn County court couldn't find it. When she tried to locate his car, the insurance company Progressive said authorities hadn't released it yet. For weeks, the only information she could access was from Braven's toxicology report; the coroner personally called to offer his condolences and to tell her that Braven had been drunk and had THC in his system when he died. It would take her four months to get the full autopsy report. She still didn't know the name of the officer who'd pursued her son or how the chase had unfolded. \"There was a life taken, and you just closed everything down without giving the family any answers?\" Old Bull, a medication aide at a nursing home, is far from naive when it comes to requesting medical documentation. But federal and state law enforcement have a reputation for keeping Native families in the dark after killings. \"It's expected for families not to get information,\" says Rae Peppers, a Crow former state lawmaker. Other families have also struggled to get basic paperwork after their loved ones died. \"They never notified me, not once,\" Fraser, Kaysera's grandmother and legal guardian, says of the sheriff's office that found Kaysera's body. \"It was hard, not getting any support,\" says Alvilene Buffalo Bull Tail, whose 14-year-old grandson, nicknamed Jr. Boy, was fatally hit by a train on the Crow reservation in 2017. Authorities deemed his death an accident, surmising that he fell asleep on the tracks; Buffalo Bull Tail suspects someone pushed him, and that law enforcement never properly investigated. \"We don't have closure until at least we know what really happened.\" In Lame Deer, a town on the Northern Cheyenne reservation bordering Crow, Maureen Bryant says her family still hasn't obtained a death certificate or autopsy report more than two years after her niece DeAnna Limberhand was found hogtied in the Stillwater River. Going to the courthouse for documents felt \"like a dead end.\" \"We kept waiting for paperwork or some kind of information, but we never heard,\" she says. \"What do you do if no one is helping you?\" she adds tearily. \"We're just going through a lot right now, and the not-knowing makes it even worse.\" Rae Peppers, a Crow former state lawmaker, says Native families often struggle to get information from federal and state law enforcement agencies after killings. The stonewalling led Old Bull and her family to speculate about what happened to Braven, and sometimes they clung to upsetting theories. When they went to the railroad after the crash and observed a second set of tire marks alongside Braven's leading from the highway through the grass to the railroad, they wondered whether the police ran him into the train. And they wondered if perhaps law enforcement's lack of transparency was a sign of something more nefarious. \"If you did nothing wrong, just release the information,\" Old Bull wanted to tell them. \"What is it you are trying to hide?\" Her suspicions heightened as witnesses came forward. According to her lawsuit, Maurice and Mavis Mountain Sheep, the couple who'd passed the wreck on their way to get gas, told her they had waited near the railroad for about a half-hour and didn't see anyone offer Braven first aid. Braven \"kept saying, 'Help me,'\" Mavis told the family. But law enforcement \"just stood there and stared at him.\" Old Bull also got a text from Bad Bear, the tribal police's dispatcher. \"I had quit by the time that occurred with your son but I can tell you right now, absolutely nothing was in compliance,\" Bad Bear wrote. \"That place should have not ever been opened...It was a shitshow there.\" For Old Bull, the lack of clarity about the night Braven died was like torture. And she isn't one to let something like this slide. In February 2023, she tried to sue Klier in federal court for wrongful death, hoping the court proceedings would bring new information to light. She had also sued the BIA, which sent officers to the scene of the crash, accusing the agency of negligently allowing the tribal police to operate without proper training and of failing to offer Braven medical care. \"The acts of the agents of Defendant United States shock the conscience and offend the community's sense of fair play and decency,\" her attorney wrote . Last April, a judge allowed Old Bull's case to proceed against the BIA, but not against Klier, because Klier had chased Braven in her capacity as a tribal employee, not a federal one. By then, it was too late for Old Bull to sue Klier in tribal court; she'd missed the tribe's statute of limitations. Old Bull decided to try a different tactic. In July 2023, she drove to Billings to share her story with a broader audience, including federal officials who were seeking feedback about law enforcement on reservations. She wasn't sure what to expect, but she hoped someone in power might finally listen. In the years since Braven died, President Biden had appointed the country's first Indigenous secretary of the interior, Deb Haaland. Before Haaland left Congress to take the job, she and other Native lawmakers passed a bill to hear testimony about crime and the crisis of missing Indigenous people. Now, Native families were coming from Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota to testify to a federal commission, some driving 20 hours round trip for a chance to speak for 15 minutes. Grace Bulltail, Kaysera's aunt, was a member of the commission and encouraged Old Bull to join. But Bulltail felt disappointed at the turnout of elected officials. \"We invited the Montana Department of Justice-nobody came,\" she says. Not even many Crow tribal leaders showed up. (A DOJ spokesperson said he wasn't aware of an invitation.) Still, Old Bull told me afterward that the gathering made her \"a little optimistic that something will change.\" It helped her feel less alone knowing that her family wasn't the only one waiting for answers. \"Listening to everyone's stories, you realize you're a piece of a big, big thing.\" The next month, I was in Crow Agency again, reporting on Braven's case. It had been nearly three years since Old Bull first started investigating the circumstances surrounding her son's death, but there'd been a big development since the last time I visited: The BIA had sent me an email with a trove of documents about the incident. It had taken me months of corresponding with the agency-after a year examining the case, interviewing dozens of people, and scouring court and government records-to get the details of her son's final minutes. I wondered whether my luck with the BIA had something to do with all the time that had passed, or my status as an outsider. Nagle, Old Bull's attorney, told me journalists are \"much more likely\" than Indigenous families to get documents from the federal government via the Freedom of Information Act. At Old Bull's house, she put on her glasses and joined me on the couch, where I spread out the highlighted pages for her to see. At first, what Old Bull read in the BIA's investigative report lined up with what she already knew. It all started on Highway 451 on November 24, she read. But the next detail made her purse her lips: At 5:39 p.m., Braven made a \"legal pass\" of Klier's police car over a dotted yellow line, according to the BIA's description of Klier's dashcam footage, which doesn't specify how fast he drove past her. Then, once he got in front of her, he slowed back down to the speed limit, about 70 mph, and Klier turned on her emergency lights to pull him over. He kept driving. Maybe he was afraid, Old Bull thought, remembering the officer who had choked him on his way to juvenile hall just months before the crash. In any case, Braven drove, still close to the speed limit. Seconds later, he slowed down considerably, and it appeared he might pull over. Klier, now following him at 55 mph, called dispatch and reported that he'd passed her at 90 mph. But Braven did not pull over. Klier activated her siren. Now, Braven began to accelerate, and she chased him. Seventy-seven miles per hour within half a minute. One hundred and nine miles per hour within a minute. They passed two other cars driving the opposite direction. Then Braven made a bold move. He turned off his headlights and other exterior lights, a tactic that drivers sometimes use to hide from police. At a bend in the highway, he went onto the grass, driving in the dark toward the railroad. Old Bull stopped reading and pushed her glasses onto her forehead. \"He legally passed her,\" she said. \"All this kid wanted to do was to go see his girlfriend, that was it. It doesn't make sense.\" She covered her face with her hands and cried. A \"compelling need\" for a police chase \"does not include the mere act of fleeing, even if reckless.\" One-third of all police chases in the United States end with a crash, often causing property damage, injury, or death. Many of these chases begin after an officer observes a traffic infraction, but because of the risks involved, some police departments only allow pursuits after a violent felony or something that puts the public in imminent danger. It's unclear whether the Crow police had a similar rule. Police Chief Tobacco and Sergeant Eastman testified in the lawsuit over Braven's death that there was not a handbook of policies and procedures in place, or at least they weren't aware of one. But the tribe submitted one to the BIA in the months leading up to the crash, according to records I obtained . That handbook states that an officer can only pursue a driver if there's a \"compelling need\" and if the chase presents less risk to the public than the driver remaining at large. A \"compelling need,\" the manual adds, \"does not include the mere act of fleeing, even if reckless,\" or \"traffic and licensing infractions, including DUI.\" Some police officers argue it's worthwhile to chase after a traffic violation, because maybe the driver is actually fleeing due to a bigger offense, like a dead body or bags of cocaine in the trunk. But suspicion alone, says Stoughton, the South Carolina expert, is not enough. \"If you aren't sure what the benefits of the pursuit are, but you do know the dangers,\" including a deadly crash, \"clearly the risks should outweigh the benefits,\" he says. \"Failing to stop for a speeding violation is not a good reason to kill someone.\" And that's especially true if the driver may be intoxicated, he says. In Braven's case, \"what's more dangerous-him driving the speed limit while drunk,\" or him being chased and \"driving 100 mph while drunk?\" says Stoughton, adding that Klier could have arrested him later: According to court documents, she'd already noted his license plate number. \"Had she terminated the pursuit,\" policing expert Susan Peters testified in Old Bull's lawsuit, \"more likely than not, Braven J. Glenn would not have been involved in a vehicular fatality accident.\" Scraps of burned metal, including a suspension spring, a radiator, and a wheel, are what's left of Braven's car near the site of the crash. As Old Bull and I read over the BIA reports, it became more and more apparent that the investigation into the crash had been flawed from the start. Moments after the crash, Klier called dispatch. \"Send medical,\" she said, according to call logs. \"He just got hit.\" Soon, other law enforcement arrived-from the tribal police, the BIA, the state highway patrol, the sheriff's office, and the fire department. But according to other records from the investigation, they struggled to get on the same page, a common complaint on reservations. Bodycam footage from Deputy Sheriff Michael Colvin, a county cop who was assigned to divert traffic, offers a small glimpse into the confusion. \"Hey, where's the body at?\" an officer asked Colvin. \"I don't know,\" Colvin said. \"Tribal PD was first on scene, and they told BIA where it was at...He said it wrecked some place down here.\" \"Was it crossing or what?\" \"I don't know. That's what I asked, but he didn't really give me an answer.\" Seconds later, paramedics drove past Colvin, lights flashing. A voice came over his radio: \"They're on scene, but they've been canceled.\" The paramedics left. Six minutes later, a tribal police officer called dispatch, according to records I obtained from the county attorney's office. \"Tribal asked why EMS canceled,\" the dispatcher noted in a call log , \"because they didn't make the determination the individual(s) were deceased.\" The tribal officer asked the paramedics to return. Later, Braven's girlfriend, Jordan, who drove over after Braven didn't pick her up after work, saw men loading a body bag into a white truck. Meanwhile, BIA special agent Figueroa arrived. According to an investigative report , he told Klier that the BIA would investigate the crash. Later, he told another tribal officer on the scene that Klier would need to have her blood drawn and that he needed the dashcam footage from her patrol vehicle. The officer acknowledged his request, but when Figueroa returned from speaking with the train conductor, Klier was gone and had taken the police car with her. The tribal officer had given Klier permission to go home, according to the report; she'd been visibly shaken up after the crash. \"It's like, what the fuck?\" says attorney Tim Bechtold, who is representing Old Bull in her lawsuit. \"All these cops not knowing what the fuck to do.\" Klier's decision to take her vehicle was \"incredibly unusual and wildly inappropriate,\" says Stoughton, the police expert in South Carolina. \"It's not that much different from an officer who's involved with a shooting taking their gun home instead of turning that over for evidence.\" A former tribal police officer, who requested anonymity, later told me he saw Klier at the police station soon after the crash. The officer drove to the railroad and alerted Figueroa that the car might be at headquarters. \"You need to go down there and get that vehicle now,\" he recalls telling Figueroa. But it's unclear if Figueroa went; he didn't locate the car that night. The next day, Figueroa told the Crow police department that he would need a copy of Klier's incident report and the dashcam footage. The following day was Thanksgiving. And a day after that, Figueroa learned the police department had already \"disbanded and closed shop,\" according to the BIA investigation. \"No one knows who has access to their reports.\" Then things got even more complicated. In mid-December, when Figueroa reminded the tribe that he still needed the report, he learned that someone had broken into the former police headquarters. Now the records he needed were missing. Figueroa still didn't know where Klier's police car was, either. So in January, he drove to Wyoming, where she lived and worked with the VA, to find her. She said she was waiting for an attorney and didn't want to talk. (She also declined my request for comment.) Figueroa drove back to Montana and reached out to the tribe's homeland security director, who said he was \"unsure where anything was,\" this time citing two break-ins at the police ­headquarters,­ but that he would try his best to find the records. (Police equipment, including guns, had also gone missing.) Two weeks later, in February, Figueroa learned the headquarters had suffered four break-ins, but someone had finally located Klier's police car; Figueroa copied the dashcam footage. In May, he obtained the BIA's dispatch logs, but the tribal police's logs concerning Braven's death-and Klier's incident report for it-were still missing. (They don't appear to have ever been recovered.) Harris, the former Big Horn county attorney, whose term ended in late 2022, believes the US government may be responsible, at least in part, for mistakes made by law enforcement that night. In addition to allegedly failing to provide potentially lifesaving medical care, the BIA did not properly secure the scene of the crash and allowed Klier's police car to get away, and then took months to find it. \"You would think [the BIA] would have their hair on fire chasing everybody down,\" says Jonathan Smith, who oversaw investigations into police department misconduct at Obama's Justice Department. If it took that long to locate the car, he adds, \"it seems unlikely they tried as hard as they could.\" Old Bull's lawsuit is scheduled for trial this summer. The US government denies any wrongdoing. Since the BIA did not employ the Crow's tribal police force, an attorney for the government wrote in response to the complaint, \"the United States cannot be held liable...for their negligence.\" \"There's so much they did wrong...It's like a ton of bricks just hits you. I fought so hard...It's like we don't matter, like we are nothing.\" After reading the BIA reports, Old Bull retraced the new information. \"There's so much they did wrong...It's like a ton of bricks just hits you,\" she told me, motioning with her hands toward her chest. She wondered whether things might have been different if she'd gotten some of this information sooner-whether it would have helped her legal case, or at the very least helped her heal. And it stung, she added, knowing that an outsider like me-a white journalist with no connection to Braven-could access all these FOIA records, while she, Braven's mother, had been denied. It took suing for her to begin getting evidence, and even that, she said, didn't include some of the key details I'd just shared with her. \"I fought so hard to get that, years and years,\" she said. \"It's like we don't matter, like we are nothing.\" Two days later, former tribal police chief Terrill Bracken arrived at my Airbnb in Billings. I'd told him that Old Bull was interested in seeing him. Bracken wasn't leading the police department when Braven died, and he knew little about the chase. But if Old Bull wanted to talk, meeting her seemed like the Christian thing to do, he said. \"Anything I can do to help her with the grief that she is going through, that's why I'm here,\" he told me. Old Bull, who'd worked a 12-hour shift at the nursing home that day, sat in her car outside the house for a moment before entering. For months, she'd been asking God to help her forgive, but it was hard to let go of all the resentments she carried. Maybe, she thought, it would be easier after talking with Bracken and hearing another perspective. \"I have to come face-to-face with somebody that started this whole thing, and just get some straightforward answers,\" she told me at the front door. After taking a seat opposite the former police chief, Old Bull anxiously tapped on her glass of water with her fingers, tears welling in her eyes. Bracken said he was sorry for her loss. She thanked him. \"That's our right to know what happened to our child,\" she said. \"And I never got that. I had to fight and fight and fight.\" \"And it should not have to be that way,\" Bracken agreed. \"It's frustrating for me,\" he added, \"because I know what we were working toward was going to be so much better,\" he said of the tribal police. Their conversation stretched on for two hours. At points, Old Bull seemed to soften toward Bracken. \"I do feel better with you talking to me. I can see you now as a person,\" she said. But when he began talking about Officer Klier, the mood shifted. \"For all we know,\" Bracken said of Klier, \"she's not doing very well right now.\" \"She's not the one hurting,\" Old Bull said quietly. \"I'm not saying who's suffering more. It's not a contest,\" Bracken responded. \"But I'm just being honest with you: Given the information that I have, I can't see how I would have acted any differently than the officer. And that's a difficult part of the job.\" Old Bull sighed. \"I gotta work in the morning,\" she said, signaling her intent to leave. \"Would it be okay if I prayed with you?\" he asked. She nodded, her eyes shut, and began crying after he placed his hands over hers. Driving home, Old Bull was glad to have spoken with Bracken. But as she lay in bed the next morning, recalling the conversation, her anger grew. \"For him to say, 'Oh, poor Pamela, I wonder what she's going through'? How dare you ,\" she thought. She picked up her phone and texted me: \"Samantha there was a lot that bothered me. He put her on this pedestal,\" she wrote. \"To sit there and emphasize her feelings, when this is about the loss of my son and her actions made that loss happen. I feel like it was an attempt...to glorify what she did as a cop.\" \"This is a system made to oppress us. It's been this way since Columbus,\" she added, before putting down her phone and heading to work. The doors of the tribal police headquarters were locked the first time I visited last year, but I could peek inside to see how abruptly it was all abandoned. The police's whiteboard calendar still showed the Thanksgiving party scheduled for the day Braven died. Stacks of unused call logs sat in dusty boxes. In the parking lot, a makeshift jail remained, two tiny cells inside a shipping container. The refrigerated counter that once held Subway's sandwich ingredients-and then guns-had been removed. The dining tables that the cops used as desks were piled outside beneath cottonwood trees. The temporary holding cell in a modified shipping container outside the former tribal police station The former tribal police station in a closed-down Subway store on the Crow reservation There was never a public explanation for why the department closed in late November 2020, leading to speculation. Old Bull still wonders whether the police are hiding something. Big Man, the historian, wonders if they packed up and left because of poor training and lack of community support, and because Braven's chase was \"the final straw.\" \"There were a lot of reasons why it shut down,\" says one of the tribal police officers who requested anonymity. \"It was starting to fail\" even before Braven's accident, and then \"the money stopped coming in.\" Bracken doubts Braven's death was the only motivation for disbanding, if it was a motivation at all. He blames politics: A few weeks before the crash, Chairman Not Afraid lost the election to Frank White Clay, a former tribal lawmaker who believed propping up a new police force with Covid relief funding violated federal spending guidelines. \"We're still trying to figure out exactly where that money went,\" White Clay would later tell a journalism student at the University of Montana in 2021. He agreed the reservation needed more law enforcement but said this police force was just \"playing cops.\" Rather than give White Clay the satisfaction of disbanding the force, Not Afraid beat him to it and shut down the department about a week before the inauguration, according to another former tribal police official. It was possible Braven's accident may have been \"the catalyst, the icing on the cake,\" but it wasn't the primary reason for closing, he said. Harris, the former Big Horn county attorney, says the department's sudden ­closure was evidence that it was never properly established. \"A legitimate, lawful police agency doesn't just end because a chairman or president or governor says, 'All right. Enough,'\" he tells me. \"This [police department] was a mirage, a facade.\" It was \"a temporary fix, nothing more than a Band-Aid,\" one of the former police officers tells me. \"Did we do everything perfectly? Absolutely not,\" says Bracken. \"But were we doing the best we could with what we had? Yes. I really believe that department would have flourished into something had it gotten a fair opportunity.\" The Crow police force's brief existence and abrupt end is not just a story about a tribal administration's mistakes, says Big Man. It is also a story about the federal government's repeated failures leading up to 2020-to keep families informed, to conduct thorough investigations, to keep the reservation safe. And it shows \"a real need for clear, meaningful communication\" with Crow people, says Kristina Lucero, who directs the American Indian Governance and Policy Institute at the University of Montana, \"about expected goals and the mission of what law enforcement should be doing.\" The police department was \"a temporary fix, nothing more than a Band-Aid.\" Many of the families who testified with Old Bull in Billings were adamant that they want more transparent policing, including easier access to information after loved ones die or go missing. \"Authorities at all levels must improve communications with family members, who are too often left in the dark for days, weeks, or months,\" causing \"enormous stress,\" the federal commission wrote afterward. Indigenous communities also want more funding: In 2022, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe in Montana sued the US government because of a shortage of police. The state's Fort Belknap Indian Community sued too, after the BIA refused to provide more public safety money. \"What's happening at Crow, that's pretty extreme,\" says UCLA's van Schilfgaarde, but \"when budgets are tight, these [police] departments come and go in a way that would just never happen in other communities.\" The problem isn't just in Montana, she adds. Most Native villages in Alaska have no law enforcement presence whatsoever. Two days after his inauguration in 2020, White Clay informed the BIA that \"an independent law enforcement effort is not the direction that the new administration of the Crow Tribe intends to continue.\" Since then, complaints about BIA policing persist. In July 2021, the tribe sued a BIA officer after he was caught on video failing to stop his dog from biting someone handcuffed after a traffic stop, for nearly a minute, leading to three surgeries on the man's ankle and foot. \"Unfortunately, nothing in this video is surprising to anyone who has lived on the Crow Nation,\" the tribe's attorney wrote. \"I had a lot of faith in the police before,\" Old Bull says, \"but after Braven died, I don't believe they're there to protect us.\" In December, President Biden signed an executive order to remove red tape that has hampered Native access to law enforcement funding. But legal action might be more effective. In May, a US district judge encouraged the feds to meet with the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota and \"figure out how to more fairly fund\" tribal policing-or else go to trial. The decision was \"the first to acknowledge that the government owes a treaty-based duty to fund law enforcement for [an] Indian tribe,\" according to the Oglala Sioux's attorneys. And they say it could at last force a legal reckoning over Washington's centuries-long harm to Native justice systems. A successful reckoning must give tribes more jurisdiction and make room for them to reimagine policing and public safety in ways that reflect their own cultures and customs, says Goldberg, the Obama appointee to the Indian Law and Order Commission. She's seen Indigenous communities that involve spiritual leaders in justice proceedings to weigh in on punishments and design a path forward. The Tulalip reservation in Washington state, in keeping with its values, has required police to stop by the Boys & Girls Club twice a shift to help kids with homework, and they attend elders' breakfasts to share data and answer questions. A successful reckoning must give tribes more jurisdiction and make room for them to reimagine policing and public safety in ways that reflect their own cultures and customs. On the Crow reservation, most people I asked said the tribe needed more law enforcement, but they also emphasized the importance of better officer training. Some said they wanted to think about public safety in a more balanced way, with funding for mental health, addiction treatment, housing, and education. Investments like these could make it easier to recruit good local cops, says the University of Montana's Lucero, since people might be less hesitant to police their relatives if the justice system offered more second chances and paths toward healing. \"You just can't arrest people, lock them up, and expect to throw them back in the same situation and change,\" says Big Man. \"Past traumas have created who we are,\" adds Old Bull. \"Get people into treatment and get them help and programs before moving in a police department.\" Tribal nations that are successful with law enforcement, says Goldberg, are ones with \"strong congruence between the views of the community and the way it's done.\" Braven's family built a memorial for him near the site of his death. Old Bull buried Braven about an hour from home, at the foot of the Pryor Mountains, next to the graves of his father and his cousin Kaysera. The cemetery is small and quiet, off a dirt path surrounded by fields, and most of the gravestones are simple, some with fake flowers and crosses. Old Bull and her family go there often to mow the grass around Braven's plot and decorate it with gifts, like chocolate-covered pretzels, one of his favorite snacks, and a basketball covered in their handwritten messages for him. At times they'll play music and reminisce about the ways he made them laugh, like how he'd make a muscle like Popeye and kiss it. When two of his older sisters got pregnant, they went to the cemetery and told him about it. When his younger sister graduated high school, she wore a cap beaded with the words, \"We did it Brave.\" They feel sometimes like he's still with them, even sending them messages. The night before his funeral, when Old Bull slept in a teepee with his remains, in keeping with her Lakota traditions, she and another family member heard a basketball bouncing in the middle of the night, even though everyone else had long since gone to bed. In August 2023, on what would have been his 20th birthday, Old Bull and her kids drive to the cemetery to visit Braven. They eat chocolate cupcakes with sprinkles, Braven's favorite, and release balloons into the sky for him. \"I want them to know he was a person too,\" Emilio says. \"He was a good kid and had big dreams, and for them to hide in the shadows-he deserves justice, the truth.\" \"Accountability and closure-that's what my mom really needs, what I really need,\" adds sister Marissa. \"I do want accountability, and I want them to admit this didn't have to happen,\" says Old Bull. On the drive home around 10 p.m., Old Bull sees a white owl sitting on the side of the road. In her tradition, owls are harbingers of death. The last time she encountered one, her mom died, and not too long afterward Braven did, too. When she arrives home it's almost midnight, and she lights a bundle of sage and cedar, calling her kids and grandkids out of the house to smudge them and help keep them safe. \"Bring the babies out,\" she instructs, walking to each person with the bundle and watching as they wave the smoke over their heads and into their hearts, all the way down to their legs. \"Who's next?\" This project was completed with the support of a grant from Columbia University's Ira A. Lipman Center for Journalism and Civil and Human Rights in conjunction with Arnold Ventures. Old Bull visits the memorial placed where Braven died.\n\nSubscribe to Mother Jones podcasts on Apple Podcasts or your favorite podcast app.\n\nThe disappearance of a new police department so soon after the wreck was highly unusual, the kind of story you might never hear twice. But other parts of Braven's story were deeply familiar: unanswered questions after deaths on the reservation, inadequate law enforcement. Before 2020, the federal government controlled policing in the Crow Nation-providing only a handful of officers for an area two-thirds the size of Connecticut. Crimes went unsolved , grieving relatives complained of faulty investigations, and some victims wouldn't even call for help, fearing violence by officers. (Nationally, police kill Native Americans at higher rates than other people of color.) The Crow's tribal police department was a desperately needed but underfunded counterbalance to a federal system that isn't working. And Braven was caught up in the dysfunction.\n\nSo, too, was Old Bull. After the tribal cops disappeared, it felt like nobody in power would talk to her, like nobody noticed the life that was lost or took responsibility for it. \"They come on Native land and they kill, and they just walk away. They think nobody is gonna care,\" she said as she drove home from the train tracks, the sun almost set, the clouds a deep blue behind her. \"I think they thought that's how our family was gonna be-that we were gonna let this go.\"\n\n\"They didn't expect us to speak out and try to get answers,\" she added.\n\nBlossom Old Bull in her home in Crow Agency, Montana\n\nThe Crow tribe has about 13,400 members, most of whom live on or around the reservation in southeastern Montana, a lush landscape with towering mountains, open skies, and rivers teeming with trout. The tribal nation earns some revenue from its vast coal and oil reserves. Most people speak Crow as a first language, and the matrilineal clan system remains strong.\n\nBraven and his mom moved to the reservation when he was in eighth grade. Old Bull, a single mom and health care worker from South Dakota, is Lakota, not Crow, and she'd been raising Braven in New Mexico; he was her youngest boy, the eighth of nine siblings. But she wanted him to grow up closer to his father, who was Crow, and some of his older brothers and sisters, and to learn more about that part of his Native heritage. When she'd spent time on the reservation previously, she recalled families camping in teepees for Crow Fair, an annual celebration with a powwow and horse racing and a rodeo, or enjoying the Sun Dance and sweat lodges.\n\nBraven hadn't wanted to move away from Albuquerque. He was a sensitive kid, and he cried in 2017 when he learned he'd have to leave his basketball team behind. In Montana, the family settled in the town of Crow Agency in a shabby one-story house that they spruced up with fresh paint. It was a rough transition; weeks after they arrived, Braven's dad died from pneumonia after a struggle with alcoholism. Braven, only 13 years old, stood at his bedside the day they pulled him off life support. I know you weren't there for me because you were sick , he said, but I still love you. \"He was such a good-hearted person, to even think in those terms at that age,\" says his sister Marissa.\n\nBraven did his best to settle into the bunkbed room he now shared with his older brother Emilio, who played basketball with him on the corner courts. He grew closer with his half siblings' grandmother, who adopted him as her own grandson. He loved spending time at her house and would offer to drive her to appointments, help her carry groceries, and put the pots away on the top shelf of her kitchen.\n\nBraven was an honor-roll student who ran cross country and track and played JV basketball.\n\nThough he hadn't wanted to move to the reservation, it didn't take long for Braven to hit his stride. His cousin Jayden remembers how quickly Braven made friends: \"I left for the summer and came back and everyone knew him. He was really popular.\" \"He had a goofy personality,\" says his girlfriend, Jordan Jefferson. As the years passed, Braven excelled-an honor-roll student who ran cross country and track and played JV basketball, and who was unanimously chosen by his teammates to co-manage the varsity squad, which he hoped to eventually join himself, running miles most days to get in better shape. \"He was one of a kind and always ready to take the challenge,\" says Mike Beads Don't Mix, his freshman coach.\n\nBut the pandemic marked the start of a shift after Braven's high school switched to remote learning and he couldn't see his friends much. In August 2020, the month he was turning 17, his grandma got Covid; she fell into a coma and was unable to sing him \"Happy Birthday\" like she normally did. Weeks later, she was dead. \"He took it really hard\" and \"got a little more distant from all of us,\" his sister JoLee remembers. In his bedroom, Braven played his grandma's favorite song, \"Blue Ain't Your Color\" by Keith Urban, over and over. His grades slipped, and he started drinking more.\n\nThe week of Braven's birthday, Old Bull found him passed out on a couch at his older brother's house. He lashed out at her after she roused him, and she called the cops, hoping they might teach him a lesson. The police arrested him for disorderly conduct and took him to juvenile detention in Billings, about an hour away.\n\n\"My mom, she had to raise all these kids on her own, so I guess you could say she's tough, but not mean,\" Emilio says. \"She's loving, she'd get us a bunch of basketball shoes, but she's gonna give you the tough love you need to succeed in this world.\"\n\nWhen Braven returned three days later, now on probation, he hugged Old Bull and gave her a letter he'd written apologizing for the incident. \"I never want to leave your side again,\" he wrote. \"I know everybody in our family is disappointed in me...I was crying while writing this letter just because I realized how bad I hurt you.\"\n\nHe told Old Bull that on his way to detention, an arresting officer from the Crow tribal police \"choked [him] out,\" according to court records, and that it had scared him, reaffirming all the bad stories he'd heard about law enforcement: His cousin Jayden once watched a cop push his uncle's head into the concrete, and they both remembered when officers at Crow Fair beat Braven's 15-year-old cousin Esaias Stops Pretty Places. This is why I didn't want to call the police , Old Bull told him. \"But you need to learn now, Braven, that if somebody needs to call the cops on you,\" she added, \"this is what will happen.\"\n\nTattoos in memory of her son Braven Glenn adorn Blossom Old Bull's forearm.\n\nFor centuries before the Europeans arrived, the Crow had no police. Instead, warrior groups protected people and enforced laws like the rules of the buffalo hunt. \"There's a big difference between a warrior and a cop,\" says Crow historian Alden Big Man Jr., who has studied the tribe's traditional systems of justice. Warriors' punishments could be harsh, including things like burning down a person's home or killing his horses, but if the offender responded favorably, the warriors would compensate his loss, perhaps giving him as many horses as had been taken away.\n\nIn the 1800s, the federal government confined the Crow, also known as the Apsáalooke, to the reservation; white settlers often shot at people who tried to leave. The tribe's nomadic hunters and gatherers were forced to become sedentary farmers and to accept Christianity, learn English, and educate their kids in the colonizers' way. As railroads brought white ranchers into their grazing areas and banks denied Crows loans, the former warriors were \"reduced to begging for handouts during ration days,\" according to Big Man, while they \"witnessed a complete annihilation of the buffalo, as well as the disappearance of a whole way of life.\" In 1887, after a Crow man led a war party off the reservation to steal horses, a colonial agent sent the party to jail. \"It was right then and there,\" says Big Man, that in the Crow Nation \"the system changed from warrior societies to the government enforcing the law.\"\n\nAround that time, the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) began appointing Native officers to police reservations-ordering them to prohibit traditional rituals that the colonizers viewed as immoral, ration food and other supplies, and stop any activities that might interfere with white economic pursuits. In 1885, Congress had taken away Native nations' right to prosecute serious crimes like homicides committed by Native people against other Natives on reservations. (US lawmakers were outraged that a Sioux government in South Dakota had punished a killer according to its own principles of justice -rather than the death penalty, it had fined him $600, eight horses, and a blanket.) Instead, murders and other violent offenses would be investigated by federal agents, some of whom traveled long distances to tribal territories and had little to no long-standing relationship with the people who lived there.\n\nNearly a century later, as activists from the American Indian Movement protested police brutality and rising crime, Congress passed the 1975 Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act , which created a path for tribes to take back more control of law enforcement. If tribal nations were able to jump through the hoops needed to secure a contract with the BIA, they could divert federal dollars intended for BIA cops to their own tribal police. \"It was a real game-changer,\" says Lauren van Schilfgaarde, an Indian law scholar who is Cochiti Pueblo and previously directed UCLA's Tribal Legal Development Clinic. Tribes have since set up more than 200 law enforcement agencies on reservations, far surpassing the number of BIA agencies.\n\nBut many tribes were not able to get a contract, including the Crow, and those that have tribal police still lack jurisdiction over major crimes. In 1978, the Supreme Court also removed their ability to prosecute non-Natives, even for most minor crimes. \"Even if you have infinite dollars, if your police departments have questionable, shaky, or even no authority over any person within their territorial boundaries, that compromises the entire enterprise,\" van Schilfgaarde says.\n\nThe federal government, meanwhile, skimped on funding for reservation cops, much as it skimped on health care, education, housing, and rural infrastructure. By 2001, violent crime on reservations was double or triple the national average. \"Ultimately, you are of your environment,\" Aaron Brien, a historian for the Crow tribe, says in the recent documentary Murder in Big Horn . \"When you take an entire society and strip them of any confidence and self-worth they have, it becomes very fragile.\" Tribes barely had half the policing resources per capita as non-Native communities: While Baltimore, Detroit, New York City, and DC had between four and seven officers per thousand residents, few tribal departments had ratios of more than two officers per thousand residents. As some communities of color protested overpolicing in cities, says van Schilfgaarde, reservations suffered the opposite extreme, coupled with a lack of resources to address public safety through other means like addiction treatment, employment, and schooling. \"It's incredibly frustrating and dangerous,\" she says.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, Congress passed the Tribal Law and Order Act , creating a commission to study the problem. The commission, which included Republican and Democratic lawmakers along with Indian law experts, recommended the federal government pay to nearly double the number of reservation police-noting that crime dropped by more than one-third on four reservations that hired extra cops during a pilot program in 2009. The tribes themselves, instead of the BIA, should lead the police, the commission argued; this change would help build trust with the community and more closely reflect tribal priorities and customs. \"Public safety in Indian Country can improve dramatically once Native nations and Tribes have greater freedom to build and maintain their own criminal justice systems,\" the commission wrote , describing the federal policing system as \"a maze of injustice.\" The commission set a goal of 2024 to \"close the public safety gap\" on reservations.\n\nBut by 2018, the number of BIA-funded officers on reservations hadn't grown at all-in fact, it had fallen by about one-third. Carole Goldberg, a commission member appointed by Obama, says Trump's administration seemed more focused on approving oil pipelines on Native land than on reforming reservation law enforcement. By 2020, the BIA estimated tribes needed $1.4 billion to handle policing nationally but admitted it was only providing $246 million, almost the same budget as a decade earlier. (The Department of Justice provided less than $100 million.) \"It's like working with strings and tin cans at times,\" Robert Bryant, chief of police for the Penobscot Nation, had testified to the commission.\n\nDuring parts of that year, the Crow Nation had just four BIA police to cover an expanse of 3,500 square miles. BIA cops were stretched so thin that \"we were pulling 18-hour days\" and \"going months without a day off,\" says Josie Passes, a former officer who wrote a letter to members of Congress begging for backup. A perceived lack of accountability contributed to a climate of fear. \"When you start thinking about it,\" says Birdie Real Bird, 70, a lifelong Crow resident whose aunt was assaulted during a home break-in and never received a visit from police, \"you're a sitting duck.\"\n\nAdd to that the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, an international problem that's particularly severe in the Crow Nation, where girls are sometimes sex-trafficked and used as drug mules along Interstate 90. Seventy-four people disappeared on the Crow and neighboring Northern Cheyenne reservations in 2019-more than any other area of Montana, which has one of the highest rates of missing Indigenous women nationally. One of them was Braven's cousin Kaysera Stops Pretty Places , an 18-year-old who loved to sing, dance, run, and wrestle. Five days after she disappeared, the sheriff's office found her body face down in a fenced backyard, but the office didn't notify her family for nearly two weeks. Four and a half years later, her cause of death remains undetermined . Families of the missing often complain about poor transparency and inadequate investigations, and jurisdictional barriers make the situation worse. The BIA can't arrest people for crimes committed off the reservation, even in border towns like Hardin, where Kaysera died. And on the reservation, other agencies-like the FBI or the sheriff's office-might have jurisdiction depending on the type of offense and whether the perpetrator was Native. Because it's often unclear whether a crime took place on or off the reservation and who the perpetrator was, it's easy for law enforcement to avoid responsibility. When corpses are discovered, investigators regularly write off the deaths as accidental. Commonly, \"when our Native women and girls go missing,\" says Mary Kathryn Nagle, a Cherokee attorney who assisted Kaysera's relatives, \"law enforcement chooses to do nothing, and it's up to the family members to do the hard work of investigating.\" \"When you start thinking about it, you're a sitting duck.\" By 2019, the Crow reservation was desperate for a change. In August, one of the few BIA cops there-the police chief, no less-quit in protest of his agency's understaffing. That November, Crow Chairman AJ Not Afraid, the tribe's chief executive, issued an emergency declaration over the shortage of police. Days later, he traveled to DC with other Native leaders to discuss the issue with President Trump, whose administration was announcing Operation Lady Justice, an initiative to improve the federal response to tribes' missing-persons cases. Some Indigenous critics described the effort as uninformed. Trump, for his part, seemed fixated on the Crow chairman's name. \"Is it true-you're not afraid? Are you not afraid of anything?\" Trump asked, laughing. On New Year's Day 2020, Not Afraid's 16-year-old niece, Selena Not Afraid, went missing at a rest stop between Hardin and Billings. A search party, which included Braven, scoured the surrounding fields with ATVs, helicopters, horses, dogs, and drones. Three weeks later, a team from the Interior Department discovered her body less than a mile away. Her death was attributed to hypothermia, but some locals suspected foul play. Selena's sister had previously died in a hit-and-run, and her brother was killed by the Billings police. \"The Crow Tribe,\" Not Afraid had said in his emergency declaration, \"will no longer accept 'lip service' for the unacceptable lack of law enforcement.\" It was long past time, he and his administration believed, to create their own tribal force. Not Afraid pleaded with the BIA to fund a new police department, according to records of their correspondence. But the BIA kept denying his request , arguing that the tribe, which didn't have a jail or other necessary infrastructure, hadn't fulfilled application requirements and couldn't effectively manage law enforcement. The pandemic provided Not Afraid with an opening. In May 2020, the Crow Nation received $27 million in coronavirus relief funding through the CARES Act. Suddenly, he didn't need the BIA's money; he had enough to launch a police department on his own. Soon he'd hired about 15 officers, tripling the police presence on the reservation. \"I was excited about it,\" says Yolanda Fraser, ­Kaysera's grandmother. \"I thought that finally we would have a justice unit that could dig into\" missing-persons cases. However, tribal legal experts say Not Afraid failed to get the necessary approval from tribal lawmakers. \"Police departments need to be established by legislation-that wasn't there,\" says Dennis Bear Don't Walk, the tribe's former chief judge and now legislative counsel, who says Not Afraid also likely needed lawmakers to sign off on using CARES Act money for policing. Not Afraid declined to comment, but former officials who helped him launch the department told me they believed he had the power to control spending and establish law enforcement during an emergency like the pandemic. (The Treasury Department is reviewing the matter and declined to comment, as did the BIA.) In Indian Country, tribal chairs have sometimes faced accusations of co-opting police departments for their own purposes-officers can act as enforcers for whoever has the upper hand in tribal management. After the department launched in late June, Not Afraid put out press releases promising to prioritize community involvement and rehabilitation. But he also embraced tactics that appeared to benefit him personally. In August 2020, he responded to an uptick in Covid deaths by imposing a reservation-wide lockdown and curfew , which had public health benefits but also ­prevented political opponents from campaigning ahead of the November election-even as he held events to drum up support himself. Some doubted the legitimacy of Not Afraid's new force. \"What if they pull a gun on you: Are they a real cop?\" Big Man, the historian, wondered. Gerald \"Jay\" Harris, the chief prosecutor in Big Horn County, which includes most of the reservation, sent a memo to the sheriff's department warning that the county could be exposed to lawsuits if it worked with the tribal police, which Harris, who is also Crow, did not view as legitimate. The BIA kept patrolling alongside the new officers but sometimes wouldn't send calls through to them, according to sources familiar with the tribal force. Passes, the BIA officer, viewed the tribal cops as more of a \"militia group than a law enforcement department.\" The federal government had never invested enough resources to create a strong pipeline of trained local police. Shilo Bad Bear was hired as a supervising dispatcher of the new department, even though she only had about 10 months of prior experience. \"I was so scared-I didn't have the proper qualifications,\" she says. \"I basically had to learn by myself,\" adds another dispatcher, who asked for anonymity; she had no prior experience and says she received a sheet of 10 codes but no formal training. Shilo Bad Bear, a former 911 dispatcher for the Crow tribal police, says she was hired without much experience. Passes questioned whether the force's employees had undergone sufficient background checks; she recalled that the BIA had arrested some of them in the past. Some of the cops had retired years ago from other agencies, which meant they were no longer certified, according to one former officer, who also requested anonymity. Others had never worked as a cop. Under Montana law, they could patrol for almost a year before attending a police academy to become certified. It's a delay that's common in small rural departments, but one that Michael Gennaco, a consultant in California who specializes in civilian oversight of law enforcement, describes as \"a tragedy waiting to happen.\" Geoffrey Eastman, a tribal patrol sergeant who did have his certification, later testified in litigation surrounding Braven's death that \"there were no policies in place\" to show officers what was expected of them. And resources were tight. For a police headquarters, Not Afraid's administration purchased a closed-down Subway restaurant attached to a museum that commemorated the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn. Confused tourists often dropped in looking to order sandwiches, but the counter that once stored cold cuts had become a temporary shelf for officers' guns. \"It felt like a joke,\" says Bad Bear. \"We were making do with what we had,\" says the department's first police chief, Terrill Bracken, and \"building an airplane as we were flying.\" The goal was to create \"a department of the people, for the people,\" says Bracken, \"with tribal members policing their own.\" But recruiting Crow cops was challenging because of the long hours, low pay, and limited benefits, and because of the reservation's extensive clan system; few locals wanted a job that might involve arresting their relatives. So Not Afraid also brought in outsiders, who he hoped would be more impartial. Bracken himself was a white martial arts instructor from Billings who had briefly worked as a sheriff's deputy; he moved into a camping trailer outside the tribal police headquarters, away from his wife and two kids, so he could devote more time to the force. \"I had so much passion for that project,\" he says. \"It wasn't going to get done unless somebody stepped up.\" After one month, he was unexpectedly replaced; Crow local Larry Tobacco, who had previously worked for the BIA, became chief. The new police department also recruited from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Sheridan, Wyoming, which staffs about a dozen federal cops to patrol a manicured VA campus. \"The reservation stays very busy and you would be exposed to a lot more major crime than you are here,\" the VA's police chief told his team in May 2020, according to emails obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request. Under VA ethics guidelines, the agency's cops generally could not moonlight on the reservation if the tribal police received federal funding. Even though Not Afraid launched the force with CARES Act funds, the tribe assured the VA that no federal funds would be used, according to emails and interviews, so the VA ethics committee gave its blessing. (One former police official told me he was present when an attorney told Not Afraid that the funds became tribal after entering the tribe's bank accounts; a Treasury Department spokesperson said the funds still would have been federal. Not Afraid did not respond to my request for comment.) Former tribal police vehicles sit abandoned on the Crow reservation. Some Crow residents, including Old Bull, questioned whether it made sense to invite outside law enforcement onto the reservation. And these VA officers may not have been prepared for real policing, says Seth Stoughton, a former cop who lectures on policing issues at the University of South Carolina; patrolling a VA medical center, he says, is more like working as a security guard than as a municipal cop. Bracken tells me these officers had previously completed training in operating a police vehicle to get federal certification at the VA. But a VA spokesperson told me its officers receive no training in high-speed chases because they are banned by the agency. The night Braven died, it was a VA police officer turned tribal cop, Pamela Klier, who chased him. The Crow tribal police \"was a good thought,\" says Bad Bear, the dispatcher, but \"it seemed like something bad was bound to happen because these guys didn't know what they were doing.\" The morning before Braven died, he and his brother Emilio played basketball for a couple of hours. Then Braven went to his late grandma's house in Hardin to see his cousins Jayden and Trey, who were still grieving her death. He seemed fine, remembers Jayden; they \"danced each other up,\" like they always did to say hello, and then Braven went to fish at a nearby pond. Around 1 p.m., he texted his girlfriend and offered to pick her up at home after her shift at the Boys & Girls Club that evening. He could borrow the car at his grandma's house, a black Chevy Malibu, to make the 35-minute ride. It was already dark out when he hit the road, a crisp November night, but it hadn't snowed yet so it would be an easy drive. Blossom Old Bull didn't learn about the crash until several hours afterward. She had just woken up from a nap when she got a phone call. Braven's older brother Gavin was sobbing. He'd heard that Braven had been in an accident. \"Where is he? Which hospital do I go to?\" Old Bull asked frantically. \"He's dead,\" Gavin said, still crying. Old Bull dropped the phone and screamed. No! she yelled. How do you know? Emilio hit a shelf in the room he shared with Braven, breaking it. His sister Jolene threw herself on the floor and sobbed. They were all still crying, struggling to comfort each other, when they heard a knock on the door a half-hour later at 10 p.m. Outside, a tall man with a black shirt and badge stood on the rickety front steps. It was BIA Special Agent Jose Figueroa Jr., who'd just come from the crash site. A banner demanding justice for Braven hangs outside Old Bull's home. I'm sure you guys already know what happened , Figueroa said to Braven's older brother Keenan outside, according to Old Bull and court records . They clocked him going 90 and chased him, and he ended up going head-on with the train . Figueroa said the family could go to the mortuary the next morning. He asked whether Braven drank or did drugs, then left without offering condolences. When Braven's older brother returned inside, he had a confused look on his face. Speed limits often weren't enforced on the reservation. And Braven was always so slow behind the wheel. \"I didn't know what to think,\" Old Bull says. She was inclined to trust Figueroa, because her dad worked as a cop in South Dakota when she was younger. But Figueroa had hardly given the family any details-not even which agency had pursued her son-and she couldn't square the story she had been told about Braven speeding with the cautious boy she had raised. The next morning, she grew even more baffled when the mortuary owner said she couldn't see Braven's body yet. The owner didn't tell her that it had already been sent to a crime lab for an autopsy. Her confusion turned to shock in the days that followed. On the TV news, she learned that it was the tribal police who'd chased Braven, so she drove to their headquarters. But the force had by then disbanded, and the windows of the old Subway were covered in paper. Seething with anger, she tugged on the locked door and pressed her face against the windows, trying to see inside. \"There was a life taken, and you just closed everything down without giving the family any answers?\" she thought. When she went to the BIA office instead, looking for a police report, an officer handed her a sticky note that simply said \"FOIA.\" Over the next few months, she got an attorney, Nagle, who'd also been helping Kaysera's family, and they filed a Freedom of Information Act request for documents with the BIA, but the agency rejected it , citing an ongoing investigation. The question was, who was investigating? The BIA told Nagle that the FBI had jurisdiction, but an FBI agent told her his office had no case file for Braven. (The FBI, in response to my own FOIA request in 2022, would not confirm or deny whether it possessed documents related to Braven's death. The BIA told me both agencies initially investigated, but the FBI eventually took control because Klier was non-Native.) When Old Bull tried to get Braven's death certificate, an assistant at the Big Horn County court couldn't find it. When she tried to locate his car, the insurance company Progressive said authorities hadn't released it yet. For weeks, the only information she could access was from Braven's toxicology report; the coroner personally called to offer his condolences and to tell her that Braven had been drunk and had THC in his system when he died. It would take her four months to get the full autopsy report. She still didn't know the name of the officer who'd pursued her son or how the chase had unfolded. \"There was a life taken, and you just closed everything down without giving the family any answers?\" Old Bull, a medication aide at a nursing home, is far from naive when it comes to requesting medical documentation. But federal and state law enforcement have a reputation for keeping Native families in the dark after killings. \"It's expected for families not to get information,\" says Rae Peppers, a Crow former state lawmaker. Other families have also struggled to get basic paperwork after their loved ones died. \"They never notified me, not once,\" Fraser, Kaysera's grandmother and legal guardian, says of the sheriff's office that found Kaysera's body. \"It was hard, not getting any support,\" says Alvilene Buffalo Bull Tail, whose 14-year-old grandson, nicknamed Jr. Boy, was fatally hit by a train on the Crow reservation in 2017. Authorities deemed his death an accident, surmising that he fell asleep on the tracks; Buffalo Bull Tail suspects someone pushed him, and that law enforcement never properly investigated. \"We don't have closure until at least we know what really happened.\" In Lame Deer, a town on the Northern Cheyenne reservation bordering Crow, Maureen Bryant says her family still hasn't obtained a death certificate or autopsy report more than two years after her niece DeAnna Limberhand was found hogtied in the Stillwater River. Going to the courthouse for documents felt \"like a dead end.\" \"We kept waiting for paperwork or some kind of information, but we never heard,\" she says. \"What do you do if no one is helping you?\" she adds tearily. \"We're just going through a lot right now, and the not-knowing makes it even worse.\" Rae Peppers, a Crow former state lawmaker, says Native families often struggle to get information from federal and state law enforcement agencies after killings. The stonewalling led Old Bull and her family to speculate about what happened to Braven, and sometimes they clung to upsetting theories. When they went to the railroad after the crash and observed a second set of tire marks alongside Braven's leading from the highway through the grass to the railroad, they wondered whether the police ran him into the train. And they wondered if perhaps law enforcement's lack of transparency was a sign of something more nefarious. \"If you did nothing wrong, just release the information,\" Old Bull wanted to tell them. \"What is it you are trying to hide?\" Her suspicions heightened as witnesses came forward. According to her lawsuit, Maurice and Mavis Mountain Sheep, the couple who'd passed the wreck on their way to get gas, told her they had waited near the railroad for about a half-hour and didn't see anyone offer Braven first aid. Braven \"kept saying, 'Help me,'\" Mavis told the family. But law enforcement \"just stood there and stared at him.\" Old Bull also got a text from Bad Bear, the tribal police's dispatcher. \"I had quit by the time that occurred with your son but I can tell you right now, absolutely nothing was in compliance,\" Bad Bear wrote. \"That place should have not ever been opened...It was a shitshow there.\" For Old Bull, the lack of clarity about the night Braven died was like torture. And she isn't one to let something like this slide. In February 2023, she tried to sue Klier in federal court for wrongful death, hoping the court proceedings would bring new information to light. She had also sued the BIA, which sent officers to the scene of the crash, accusing the agency of negligently allowing the tribal police to operate without proper training and of failing to offer Braven medical care. \"The acts of the agents of Defendant United States shock the conscience and offend the community's sense of fair play and decency,\" her attorney wrote . Last April, a judge allowed Old Bull's case to proceed against the BIA, but not against Klier, because Klier had chased Braven in her capacity as a tribal employee, not a federal one. By then, it was too late for Old Bull to sue Klier in tribal court; she'd missed the tribe's statute of limitations. Old Bull decided to try a different tactic. In July 2023, she drove to Billings to share her story with a broader audience, including federal officials who were seeking feedback about law enforcement on reservations. She wasn't sure what to expect, but she hoped someone in power might finally listen. In the years since Braven died, President Biden had appointed the country's first Indigenous secretary of the interior, Deb Haaland. Before Haaland left Congress to take the job, she and other Native lawmakers passed a bill to hear testimony about crime and the crisis of missing Indigenous people. Now, Native families were coming from Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota to testify to a federal commission, some driving 20 hours round trip for a chance to speak for 15 minutes. Grace Bulltail, Kaysera's aunt, was a member of the commission and encouraged Old Bull to join. But Bulltail felt disappointed at the turnout of elected officials. \"We invited the Montana Department of Justice-nobody came,\" she says. Not even many Crow tribal leaders showed up. (A DOJ spokesperson said he wasn't aware of an invitation.) Still, Old Bull told me afterward that the gathering made her \"a little optimistic that something will change.\" It helped her feel less alone knowing that her family wasn't the only one waiting for answers. \"Listening to everyone's stories, you realize you're a piece of a big, big thing.\" The next month, I was in Crow Agency again, reporting on Braven's case. It had been nearly three years since Old Bull first started investigating the circumstances surrounding her son's death, but there'd been a big development since the last time I visited: The BIA had sent me an email with a trove of documents about the incident. It had taken me months of corresponding with the agency-after a year examining the case, interviewing dozens of people, and scouring court and government records-to get the details of her son's final minutes. I wondered whether my luck with the BIA had something to do with all the time that had passed, or my status as an outsider. Nagle, Old Bull's attorney, told me journalists are \"much more likely\" than Indigenous families to get documents from the federal government via the Freedom of Information Act. At Old Bull's house, she put on her glasses and joined me on the couch, where I spread out the highlighted pages for her to see. At first, what Old Bull read in the BIA's investigative report lined up with what she already knew. It all started on Highway 451 on November 24, she read. But the next detail made her purse her lips: At 5:39 p.m., Braven made a \"legal pass\" of Klier's police car over a dotted yellow line, according to the BIA's description of Klier's dashcam footage, which doesn't specify how fast he drove past her. Then, once he got in front of her, he slowed back down to the speed limit, about 70 mph, and Klier turned on her emergency lights to pull him over. He kept driving. Maybe he was afraid, Old Bull thought, remembering the officer who had choked him on his way to juvenile hall just months before the crash. In any case, Braven drove, still close to the speed limit. Seconds later, he slowed down considerably, and it appeared he might pull over. Klier, now following him at 55 mph, called dispatch and reported that he'd passed her at 90 mph. But Braven did not pull over. Klier activated her siren. Now, Braven began to accelerate, and she chased him. Seventy-seven miles per hour within half a minute. One hundred and nine miles per hour within a minute. They passed two other cars driving the opposite direction. Then Braven made a bold move. He turned off his headlights and other exterior lights, a tactic that drivers sometimes use to hide from police. At a bend in the highway, he went onto the grass, driving in the dark toward the railroad. Old Bull stopped reading and pushed her glasses onto her forehead. \"He legally passed her,\" she said. \"All this kid wanted to do was to go see his girlfriend, that was it. It doesn't make sense.\" She covered her face with her hands and cried. A \"compelling need\" for a police chase \"does not include the mere act of fleeing, even if reckless.\" One-third of all police chases in the United States end with a crash, often causing property damage, injury, or death. Many of these chases begin after an officer observes a traffic infraction, but because of the risks involved, some police departments only allow pursuits after a violent felony or something that puts the public in imminent danger. It's unclear whether the Crow police had a similar rule. Police Chief Tobacco and Sergeant Eastman testified in the lawsuit over Braven's death that there was not a handbook of policies and procedures in place, or at least they weren't aware of one. But the tribe submitted one to the BIA in the months leading up to the crash, according to records I obtained . That handbook states that an officer can only pursue a driver if there's a \"compelling need\" and if the chase presents less risk to the public than the driver remaining at large. A \"compelling need,\" the manual adds, \"does not include the mere act of fleeing, even if reckless,\" or \"traffic and licensing infractions, including DUI.\" Some police officers argue it's worthwhile to chase after a traffic violation, because maybe the driver is actually fleeing due to a bigger offense, like a dead body or bags of cocaine in the trunk. But suspicion alone, says Stoughton, the South Carolina expert, is not enough. \"If you aren't sure what the benefits of the pursuit are, but you do know the dangers,\" including a deadly crash, \"clearly the risks should outweigh the benefits,\" he says. \"Failing to stop for a speeding violation is not a good reason to kill someone.\" And that's especially true if the driver may be intoxicated, he says. In Braven's case, \"what's more dangerous-him driving the speed limit while drunk,\" or him being chased and \"driving 100 mph while drunk?\" says Stoughton, adding that Klier could have arrested him later: According to court documents, she'd already noted his license plate number. \"Had she terminated the pursuit,\" policing expert Susan Peters testified in Old Bull's lawsuit, \"more likely than not, Braven J. Glenn would not have been involved in a vehicular fatality accident.\" Scraps of burned metal, including a suspension spring, a radiator, and a wheel, are what's left of Braven's car near the site of the crash. As Old Bull and I read over the BIA reports, it became more and more apparent that the investigation into the crash had been flawed from the start. Moments after the crash, Klier called dispatch. \"Send medical,\" she said, according to call logs. \"He just got hit.\" Soon, other law enforcement arrived-from the tribal police, the BIA, the state highway patrol, the sheriff's office, and the fire department. But according to other records from the investigation, they struggled to get on the same page, a common complaint on reservations. Bodycam footage from Deputy Sheriff Michael Colvin, a county cop who was assigned to divert traffic, offers a small glimpse into the confusion. \"Hey, where's the body at?\" an officer asked Colvin. \"I don't know,\" Colvin said. \"Tribal PD was first on scene, and they told BIA where it was at...He said it wrecked some place down here.\" \"Was it crossing or what?\" \"I don't know. That's what I asked, but he didn't really give me an answer.\" Seconds later, paramedics drove past Colvin, lights flashing. A voice came over his radio: \"They're on scene, but they've been canceled.\" The paramedics left. Six minutes later, a tribal police officer called dispatch, according to records I obtained from the county attorney's office. \"Tribal asked why EMS canceled,\" the dispatcher noted in a call log , \"because they didn't make the determination the individual(s) were deceased.\" The tribal officer asked the paramedics to return. Later, Braven's girlfriend, Jordan, who drove over after Braven didn't pick her up after work, saw men loading a body bag into a white truck. Meanwhile, BIA special agent Figueroa arrived. According to an investigative report , he told Klier that the BIA would investigate the crash. Later, he told another tribal officer on the scene that Klier would need to have her blood drawn and that he needed the dashcam footage from her patrol vehicle. The officer acknowledged his request, but when Figueroa returned from speaking with the train conductor, Klier was gone and had taken the police car with her. The tribal officer had given Klier permission to go home, according to the report; she'd been visibly shaken up after the crash. \"It's like, what the fuck?\" says attorney Tim Bechtold, who is representing Old Bull in her lawsuit. \"All these cops not knowing what the fuck to do.\" Klier's decision to take her vehicle was \"incredibly unusual and wildly inappropriate,\" says Stoughton, the police expert in South Carolina. \"It's not that much different from an officer who's involved with a shooting taking their gun home instead of turning that over for evidence.\" A former tribal police officer, who requested anonymity, later told me he saw Klier at the police station soon after the crash. The officer drove to the railroad and alerted Figueroa that the car might be at headquarters. \"You need to go down there and get that vehicle now,\" he recalls telling Figueroa. But it's unclear if Figueroa went; he didn't locate the car that night. The next day, Figueroa told the Crow police department that he would need a copy of Klier's incident report and the dashcam footage. The following day was Thanksgiving. And a day after that, Figueroa learned the police department had already \"disbanded and closed shop,\" according to the BIA investigation. \"No one knows who has access to their reports.\" Then things got even more complicated. In mid-December, when Figueroa reminded the tribe that he still needed the report, he learned that someone had broken into the former police headquarters. Now the records he needed were missing. Figueroa still didn't know where Klier's police car was, either. So in January, he drove to Wyoming, where she lived and worked with the VA, to find her. She said she was waiting for an attorney and didn't want to talk. (She also declined my request for comment.) Figueroa drove back to Montana and reached out to the tribe's homeland security director, who said he was \"unsure where anything was,\" this time citing two break-ins at the police ­headquarters,­ but that he would try his best to find the records. (Police equipment, including guns, had also gone missing.) Two weeks later, in February, Figueroa learned the headquarters had suffered four break-ins, but someone had finally located Klier's police car; Figueroa copied the dashcam footage. In May, he obtained the BIA's dispatch logs, but the tribal police's logs concerning Braven's death-and Klier's incident report for it-were still missing. (They don't appear to have ever been recovered.) Harris, the former Big Horn county attorney, whose term ended in late 2022, believes the US government may be responsible, at least in part, for mistakes made by law enforcement that night. In addition to allegedly failing to provide potentially lifesaving medical care, the BIA did not properly secure the scene of the crash and allowed Klier's police car to get away, and then took months to find it. \"You would think [the BIA] would have their hair on fire chasing everybody down,\" says Jonathan Smith, who oversaw investigations into police department misconduct at Obama's Justice Department. If it took that long to locate the car, he adds, \"it seems unlikely they tried as hard as they could.\" Old Bull's lawsuit is scheduled for trial this summer. The US government denies any wrongdoing. Since the BIA did not employ the Crow's tribal police force, an attorney for the government wrote in response to the complaint, \"the United States cannot be held liable...for their negligence.\" \"There's so much they did wrong...It's like a ton of bricks just hits you. I fought so hard...It's like we don't matter, like we are nothing.\" After reading the BIA reports, Old Bull retraced the new information. \"There's so much they did wrong...It's like a ton of bricks just hits you,\" she told me, motioning with her hands toward her chest. She wondered whether things might have been different if she'd gotten some of this information sooner-whether it would have helped her legal case, or at the very least helped her heal. And it stung, she added, knowing that an outsider like me-a white journalist with no connection to Braven-could access all these FOIA records, while she, Braven's mother, had been denied. It took suing for her to begin getting evidence, and even that, she said, didn't include some of the key details I'd just shared with her. \"I fought so hard to get that, years and years,\" she said. \"It's like we don't matter, like we are nothing.\" Two days later, former tribal police chief Terrill Bracken arrived at my Airbnb in Billings. I'd told him that Old Bull was interested in seeing him. Bracken wasn't leading the police department when Braven died, and he knew little about the chase. But if Old Bull wanted to talk, meeting her seemed like the Christian thing to do, he said. \"Anything I can do to help her with the grief that she is going through, that's why I'm here,\" he told me. Old Bull, who'd worked a 12-hour shift at the nursing home that day, sat in her car outside the house for a moment before entering. For months, she'd been asking God to help her forgive, but it was hard to let go of all the resentments she carried. Maybe, she thought, it would be easier after talking with Bracken and hearing another perspective. \"I have to come face-to-face with somebody that started this whole thing, and just get some straightforward answers,\" she told me at the front door. After taking a seat opposite the former police chief, Old Bull anxiously tapped on her glass of water with her fingers, tears welling in her eyes. Bracken said he was sorry for her loss. She thanked him. \"That's our right to know what happened to our child,\" she said. \"And I never got that. I had to fight and fight and fight.\" \"And it should not have to be that way,\" Bracken agreed. \"It's frustrating for me,\" he added, \"because I know what we were working toward was going to be so much better,\" he said of the tribal police. Their conversation stretched on for two hours. At points, Old Bull seemed to soften toward Bracken. \"I do feel better with you talking to me. I can see you now as a person,\" she said. But when he began talking about Officer Klier, the mood shifted. \"For all we know,\" Bracken said of Klier, \"she's not doing very well right now.\" \"She's not the one hurting,\" Old Bull said quietly. \"I'm not saying who's suffering more. It's not a contest,\" Bracken responded. \"But I'm just being honest with you: Given the information that I have, I can't see how I would have acted any differently than the officer. And that's a difficult part of the job.\" Old Bull sighed. \"I gotta work in the morning,\" she said, signaling her intent to leave. \"Would it be okay if I prayed with you?\" he asked. She nodded, her eyes shut, and began crying after he placed his hands over hers. Driving home, Old Bull was glad to have spoken with Bracken. But as she lay in bed the next morning, recalling the conversation, her anger grew. \"For him to say, 'Oh, poor Pamela, I wonder what she's going through'? How dare you ,\" she thought. She picked up her phone and texted me: \"Samantha there was a lot that bothered me. He put her on this pedestal,\" she wrote. \"To sit there and emphasize her feelings, when this is about the loss of my son and her actions made that loss happen. I feel like it was an attempt...to glorify what she did as a cop.\" \"This is a system made to oppress us. It's been this way since Columbus,\" she added, before putting down her phone and heading to work. The doors of the tribal police headquarters were locked the first time I visited last year, but I could peek inside to see how abruptly it was all abandoned. The police's whiteboard calendar still showed the Thanksgiving party scheduled for the day Braven died. Stacks of unused call logs sat in dusty boxes. In the parking lot, a makeshift jail remained, two tiny cells inside a shipping container. The refrigerated counter that once held Subway's sandwich ingredients-and then guns-had been removed. The dining tables that the cops used as desks were piled outside beneath cottonwood trees. The temporary holding cell in a modified shipping container outside the former tribal police station The former tribal police station in a closed-down Subway store on the Crow reservation There was never a public explanation for why the department closed in late November 2020, leading to speculation. Old Bull still wonders whether the police are hiding something. Big Man, the historian, wonders if they packed up and left because of poor training and lack of community support, and because Braven's chase was \"the final straw.\" \"There were a lot of reasons why it shut down,\" says one of the tribal police officers who requested anonymity. \"It was starting to fail\" even before Braven's accident, and then \"the money stopped coming in.\" Bracken doubts Braven's death was the only motivation for disbanding, if it was a motivation at all. He blames politics: A few weeks before the crash, Chairman Not Afraid lost the election to Frank White Clay, a former tribal lawmaker who believed propping up a new police force with Covid relief funding violated federal spending guidelines. \"We're still trying to figure out exactly where that money went,\" White Clay would later tell a journalism student at the University of Montana in 2021. He agreed the reservation needed more law enforcement but said this police force was just \"playing cops.\" Rather than give White Clay the satisfaction of disbanding the force, Not Afraid beat him to it and shut down the department about a week before the inauguration, according to another former tribal police official. It was possible Braven's accident may have been \"the catalyst, the icing on the cake,\" but it wasn't the primary reason for closing, he said. Harris, the former Big Horn county attorney, says the department's sudden ­closure was evidence that it was never properly established. \"A legitimate, lawful police agency doesn't just end because a chairman or president or governor says, 'All right. Enough,'\" he tells me. \"This [police department] was a mirage, a facade.\" It was \"a temporary fix, nothing more than a Band-Aid,\" one of the former police officers tells me. \"Did we do everything perfectly? Absolutely not,\" says Bracken. \"But were we doing the best we could with what we had? Yes. I really believe that department would have flourished into something had it gotten a fair opportunity.\" The Crow police force's brief existence and abrupt end is not just a story about a tribal administration's mistakes, says Big Man. It is also a story about the federal government's repeated failures leading up to 2020-to keep families informed, to conduct thorough investigations, to keep the reservation safe. And it shows \"a real need for clear, meaningful communication\" with Crow people, says Kristina Lucero, who directs the American Indian Governance and Policy Institute at the University of Montana, \"about expected goals and the mission of what law enforcement should be doing.\" The police department was \"a temporary fix, nothing more than a Band-Aid.\" Many of the families who testified with Old Bull in Billings were adamant that they want more transparent policing, including easier access to information after loved ones die or go missing. \"Authorities at all levels must improve communications with family members, who are too often left in the dark for days, weeks, or months,\" causing \"enormous stress,\" the federal commission wrote afterward. Indigenous communities also want more funding: In 2022, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe in Montana sued the US government because of a shortage of police. The state's Fort Belknap Indian Community sued too, after the BIA refused to provide more public safety money. \"What's happening at Crow, that's pretty extreme,\" says UCLA's van Schilfgaarde, but \"when budgets are tight, these [police] departments come and go in a way that would just never happen in other communities.\" The problem isn't just in Montana, she adds. Most Native villages in Alaska have no law enforcement presence whatsoever. Two days after his inauguration in 2020, White Clay informed the BIA that \"an independent law enforcement effort is not the direction that the new administration of the Crow Tribe intends to continue.\" Since then, complaints about BIA policing persist. In July 2021, the tribe sued a BIA officer after he was caught on video failing to stop his dog from biting someone handcuffed after a traffic stop, for nearly a minute, leading to three surgeries on the man's ankle and foot. \"Unfortunately, nothing in this video is surprising to anyone who has lived on the Crow Nation,\" the tribe's attorney wrote. \"I had a lot of faith in the police before,\" Old Bull says, \"but after Braven died, I don't believe they're there to protect us.\" In December, President Biden signed an executive order to remove red tape that has hampered Native access to law enforcement funding. But legal action might be more effective. In May, a US district judge encouraged the feds to meet with the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota and \"figure out how to more fairly fund\" tribal policing-or else go to trial. The decision was \"the first to acknowledge that the government owes a treaty-based duty to fund law enforcement for [an] Indian tribe,\" according to the Oglala Sioux's attorneys. And they say it could at last force a legal reckoning over Washington's centuries-long harm to Native justice systems. A successful reckoning must give tribes more jurisdiction and make room for them to reimagine policing and public safety in ways that reflect their own cultures and customs, says Goldberg, the Obama appointee to the Indian Law and Order Commission. She's seen Indigenous communities that involve spiritual leaders in justice proceedings to weigh in on punishments and design a path forward. The Tulalip reservation in Washington state, in keeping with its values, has required police to stop by the Boys & Girls Club twice a shift to help kids with homework, and they attend elders' breakfasts to share data and answer questions. A successful reckoning must give tribes more jurisdiction and make room for them to reimagine policing and public safety in ways that reflect their own cultures and customs. On the Crow reservation, most people I asked said the tribe needed more law enforcement, but they also emphasized the importance of better officer training. Some said they wanted to think about public safety in a more balanced way, with funding for mental health, addiction treatment, housing, and education. Investments like these could make it easier to recruit good local cops, says the University of Montana's Lucero, since people might be less hesitant to police their relatives if the justice system offered more second chances and paths toward healing. \"You just can't arrest people, lock them up, and expect to throw them back in the same situation and change,\" says Big Man. \"Past traumas have created who we are,\" adds Old Bull. \"Get people into treatment and get them help and programs before moving in a police department.\" Tribal nations that are successful with law enforcement, says Goldberg, are ones with \"strong congruence between the views of the community and the way it's done.\" Braven's family built a memorial for him near the site of his death. Old Bull buried Braven about an hour from home, at the foot of the Pryor Mountains, next to the graves of his father and his cousin Kaysera. The cemetery is small and quiet, off a dirt path surrounded by fields, and most of the gravestones are simple, some with fake flowers and crosses. Old Bull and her family go there often to mow the grass around Braven's plot and decorate it with gifts, like chocolate-covered pretzels, one of his favorite snacks, and a basketball covered in their handwritten messages for him. At times they'll play music and reminisce about the ways he made them laugh, like how he'd make a muscle like Popeye and kiss it. When two of his older sisters got pregnant, they went to the cemetery and told him about it. When his younger sister graduated high school, she wore a cap beaded with the words, \"We did it Brave.\" They feel sometimes like he's still with them, even sending them messages. The night before his funeral, when Old Bull slept in a teepee with his remains, in keeping with her Lakota traditions, she and another family member heard a basketball bouncing in the middle of the night, even though everyone else had long since gone to bed. In August 2023, on what would have been his 20th birthday, Old Bull and her kids drive to the cemetery to visit Braven. They eat chocolate cupcakes with sprinkles, Braven's favorite, and release balloons into the sky for him. \"I want them to know he was a person too,\" Emilio says. \"He was a good kid and had big dreams, and for them to hide in the shadows-he deserves justice, the truth.\" \"Accountability and closure-that's what my mom really needs, what I really need,\" adds sister Marissa. \"I do want accountability, and I want them to admit this didn't have to happen,\" says Old Bull. On the drive home around 10 p.m., Old Bull sees a white owl sitting on the side of the road. In her tradition, owls are harbingers of death. The last time she encountered one, her mom died, and not too long afterward Braven did, too. When she arrives home it's almost midnight, and she lights a bundle of sage and cedar, calling her kids and grandkids out of the house to smudge them and help keep them safe. \"Bring the babies out,\" she instructs, walking to each person with the bundle and watching as they wave the smoke over their heads and into their hearts, all the way down to their legs. \"Who's next?\" This project was completed with the support of a grant from Columbia University's Ira A. Lipman Center for Journalism and Civil and Human Rights in conjunction with Arnold Ventures. Old Bull visits the memorial placed where Braven died.\n\nAdd to that the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, an international problem that's particularly severe in the Crow Nation, where girls are sometimes sex-trafficked and used as drug mules along Interstate 90. Seventy-four people disappeared on the Crow and neighboring Northern Cheyenne reservations in 2019-more than any other area of Montana, which has one of the highest rates of missing Indigenous women nationally. One of them was Braven's cousin Kaysera Stops Pretty Places , an 18-year-old who loved to sing, dance, run, and wrestle. Five days after she disappeared, the sheriff's office found her body face down in a fenced backyard, but the office didn't notify her family for nearly two weeks. Four and a half years later, her cause of death remains undetermined .\n\nFamilies of the missing often complain about poor transparency and inadequate investigations, and jurisdictional barriers make the situation worse. The BIA can't arrest people for crimes committed off the reservation, even in border towns like Hardin, where Kaysera died. And on the reservation, other agencies-like the FBI or the sheriff's office-might have jurisdiction depending on the type of offense and whether the perpetrator was Native. Because it's often unclear whether a crime took place on or off the reservation and who the perpetrator was, it's easy for law enforcement to avoid responsibility. When corpses are discovered, investigators regularly write off the deaths as accidental. Commonly, \"when our Native women and girls go missing,\" says Mary Kathryn Nagle, a Cherokee attorney who assisted Kaysera's relatives, \"law enforcement chooses to do nothing, and it's up to the family members to do the hard work of investigating.\"\n\nBy 2019, the Crow reservation was desperate for a change. In August, one of the few BIA cops there-the police chief, no less-quit in protest of his agency's understaffing. That November, Crow Chairman AJ Not Afraid, the tribe's chief executive, issued an emergency declaration over the shortage of police.\n\nDays later, he traveled to DC with other Native leaders to discuss the issue with President Trump, whose administration was announcing Operation Lady Justice, an initiative to improve the federal response to tribes' missing-persons cases. Some Indigenous critics described the effort as uninformed. Trump, for his part, seemed fixated on the Crow chairman's name. \"Is it true-you're not afraid? Are you not afraid of anything?\" Trump asked, laughing.\n\nOn New Year's Day 2020, Not Afraid's 16-year-old niece, Selena Not Afraid, went missing at a rest stop between Hardin and Billings. A search party, which included Braven, scoured the surrounding fields with ATVs, helicopters, horses, dogs, and drones. Three weeks later, a team from the Interior Department discovered her body less than a mile away. Her death was attributed to hypothermia, but some locals suspected foul play.\n\nSelena's sister had previously died in a hit-and-run, and her brother was killed by the Billings police. \"The Crow Tribe,\" Not Afraid had said in his emergency declaration, \"will no longer accept 'lip service' for the unacceptable lack of law enforcement.\" It was long past time, he and his administration believed, to create their own tribal force.\n\nNot Afraid pleaded with the BIA to fund a new police department, according to records of their correspondence. But the BIA kept denying his request , arguing that the tribe, which didn't have a jail or other necessary infrastructure, hadn't fulfilled application requirements and couldn't effectively manage law enforcement.\n\nThe pandemic provided Not Afraid with an opening. In May 2020, the Crow Nation received $27 million in coronavirus relief funding through the CARES Act. Suddenly, he didn't need the BIA's money; he had enough to launch a police department on his own. Soon he'd hired about 15 officers, tripling the police presence on the reservation. \"I was excited about it,\" says Yolanda Fraser, ­Kaysera's grandmother. \"I thought that finally we would have a justice unit that could dig into\" missing-persons cases.\n\nHowever, tribal legal experts say Not Afraid failed to get the necessary approval from tribal lawmakers. \"Police departments need to be established by legislation-that wasn't there,\" says Dennis Bear Don't Walk, the tribe's former chief judge and now legislative counsel, who says Not Afraid also likely needed lawmakers to sign off on using CARES Act money for policing. Not Afraid declined to comment, but former officials who helped him launch the department told me they believed he had the power to control spending and establish law enforcement during an emergency like the pandemic. (The Treasury Department is reviewing the matter and declined to comment, as did the BIA.)\n\nIn Indian Country, tribal chairs have sometimes faced accusations of co-opting police departments for their own purposes-officers can act as enforcers for whoever has the upper hand in tribal management. After the department launched in late June, Not Afraid put out press releases promising to prioritize community involvement and rehabilitation. But he also embraced tactics that appeared to benefit him personally. In August 2020, he responded to an uptick in Covid deaths by imposing a reservation-wide lockdown and curfew , which had public health benefits but also ­prevented political opponents from campaigning ahead of the November election-even as he held events to drum up support himself.\n\nSome doubted the legitimacy of Not Afraid's new force. \"What if they pull a gun on you: Are they a real cop?\" Big Man, the historian, wondered. Gerald \"Jay\" Harris, the chief prosecutor in Big Horn County, which includes most of the reservation, sent a memo to the sheriff's department warning that the county could be exposed to lawsuits if it worked with the tribal police, which Harris, who is also Crow, did not view as legitimate. The BIA kept patrolling alongside the new officers but sometimes wouldn't send calls through to them, according to sources familiar with the tribal force. Passes, the BIA officer, viewed the tribal cops as more of a \"militia group than a law enforcement department.\"\n\nThe federal government had never invested enough resources to create a strong pipeline of trained local police. Shilo Bad Bear was hired as a supervising dispatcher of the new department, even though she only had about 10 months of prior experience. \"I was so scared-I didn't have the proper qualifications,\" she says. \"I basically had to learn by myself,\" adds another dispatcher, who asked for anonymity; she had no prior experience and says she received a sheet of 10 codes but no formal training.\n\nShilo Bad Bear, a former 911 dispatcher for the Crow tribal police, says she was hired without much experience.\n\nPasses questioned whether the force's employees had undergone sufficient background checks; she recalled that the BIA had arrested some of them in the past. Some of the cops had retired years ago from other agencies, which meant they were no longer certified, according to one former officer, who also requested anonymity. Others had never worked as a cop. Under Montana law, they could patrol for almost a year before attending a police academy to become certified. It's a delay that's common in small rural departments, but one that Michael Gennaco, a consultant in California who specializes in civilian oversight of law enforcement, describes as \"a tragedy waiting to happen.\" Geoffrey Eastman, a tribal patrol sergeant who did have his certification, later testified in litigation surrounding Braven's death that \"there were no policies in place\" to show officers what was expected of them.\n\nAnd resources were tight. For a police headquarters, Not Afraid's administration purchased a closed-down Subway restaurant attached to a museum that commemorated the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn. Confused tourists often dropped in looking to order sandwiches, but the counter that once stored cold cuts had become a temporary shelf for officers' guns. \"It felt like a joke,\" says Bad Bear. \"We were making do with what we had,\" says the department's first police chief, Terrill Bracken, and \"building an airplane as we were flying.\"\n\nThe goal was to create \"a department of the people, for the people,\" says Bracken, \"with tribal members policing their own.\" But recruiting Crow cops was challenging because of the long hours, low pay, and limited benefits, and because of the reservation's extensive clan system; few locals wanted a job that might involve arresting their relatives. So Not Afraid also brought in outsiders, who he hoped would be more impartial.\n\nBracken himself was a white martial arts instructor from Billings who had briefly worked as a sheriff's deputy; he moved into a camping trailer outside the tribal police headquarters, away from his wife and two kids, so he could devote more time to the force. \"I had so much passion for that project,\" he says. \"It wasn't going to get done unless somebody stepped up.\" After one month, he was unexpectedly replaced; Crow local Larry Tobacco, who had previously worked for the BIA, became chief.\n\nThe new police department also recruited from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Sheridan, Wyoming, which staffs about a dozen federal cops to patrol a manicured VA campus. \"The reservation stays very busy and you would be exposed to a lot more major crime than you are here,\" the VA's police chief told his team in May 2020, according to emails obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request. Under VA ethics guidelines, the agency's cops generally could not moonlight on the reservation if the tribal police received federal funding. Even though Not Afraid launched the force with CARES Act funds, the tribe assured the VA that no federal funds would be used, according to emails and interviews, so the VA ethics committee gave its blessing. (One former police official told me he was present when an attorney told Not Afraid that the funds became tribal after entering the tribe's bank accounts; a Treasury Department spokesperson said the funds still would have been federal. Not Afraid did not respond to my request for comment.)\n\nFormer tribal police vehicles sit abandoned on the Crow reservation.\n\nSome Crow residents, including Old Bull, questioned whether it made sense to invite outside law enforcement onto the reservation. And these VA officers may not have been prepared for real policing, says Seth Stoughton, a former cop who lectures on policing issues at the University of South Carolina; patrolling a VA medical center, he says, is more like working as a security guard than as a municipal cop. Bracken tells me these officers had previously completed training in operating a police vehicle to get federal certification at the VA. But a VA spokesperson told me its officers receive no training in high-speed chases because they are banned by the agency.\n\nThe night Braven died, it was a VA police officer turned tribal cop, Pamela Klier, who chased him.\n\nThe Crow tribal police \"was a good thought,\" says Bad Bear, the dispatcher, but \"it seemed like something bad was bound to happen because these guys didn't know what they were doing.\"\n\nThe morning before Braven died, he and his brother Emilio played basketball for a couple of hours. Then Braven went to his late grandma's house in Hardin to see his cousins Jayden and Trey, who were still grieving her death. He seemed fine, remembers Jayden; they \"danced each other up,\" like they always did to say hello, and then Braven went to fish at a nearby pond.\n\nAround 1 p.m., he texted his girlfriend and offered to pick her up at home after her shift at the Boys & Girls Club that evening. He could borrow the car at his grandma's house, a black Chevy Malibu, to make the 35-minute ride. It was already dark out when he hit the road, a crisp November night, but it hadn't snowed yet so it would be an easy drive.\n\nBlossom Old Bull didn't learn about the crash until several hours afterward. She had just woken up from a nap when she got a phone call. Braven's older brother Gavin was sobbing. He'd heard that Braven had been in an accident.\n\n\"Where is he? Which hospital do I go to?\" Old Bull asked frantically.\n\n\"He's dead,\" Gavin said, still crying.\n\nOld Bull dropped the phone and screamed. No! she yelled. How do you know?\n\nEmilio hit a shelf in the room he shared with Braven, breaking it. His sister Jolene threw herself on the floor and sobbed. They were all still crying, struggling to comfort each other, when they heard a knock on the door a half-hour later at 10 p.m.\n\nOutside, a tall man with a black shirt and badge stood on the rickety front steps. It was BIA Special Agent Jose Figueroa Jr., who'd just come from the crash site.\n\nA banner demanding justice for Braven hangs outside Old Bull's home.\n\nI'm sure you guys already know what happened , Figueroa said to Braven's older brother Keenan outside, according to Old Bull and court records . They clocked him going 90 and chased him, and he ended up going head-on with the train . Figueroa said the family could go to the mortuary the next morning. He asked whether Braven drank or did drugs, then left without offering condolences.\n\nWhen Braven's older brother returned inside, he had a confused look on his face. Speed limits often weren't enforced on the reservation. And Braven was always so slow behind the wheel.\n\n\"I didn't know what to think,\" Old Bull says. She was inclined to trust Figueroa, because her dad worked as a cop in South Dakota when she was younger. But Figueroa had hardly given the family any details-not even which agency had pursued her son-and she couldn't square the story she had been told about Braven speeding with the cautious boy she had raised. The next morning, she grew even more baffled when the mortuary owner said she couldn't see Braven's body yet. The owner didn't tell her that it had already been sent to a crime lab for an autopsy.\n\nHer confusion turned to shock in the days that followed. On the TV news, she learned that it was the tribal police who'd chased Braven, so she drove to their headquarters. But the force had by then disbanded, and the windows of the old Subway were covered in paper. Seething with anger, she tugged on the locked door and pressed her face against the windows, trying to see inside. \"There was a life taken, and you just closed everything down without giving the family any answers?\" she thought. When she went to the BIA office instead, looking for a police report, an officer handed her a sticky note that simply said \"FOIA.\" Over the next few months, she got an attorney, Nagle, who'd also been helping Kaysera's family, and they filed a Freedom of Information Act request for documents with the BIA, but the agency rejected it , citing an ongoing investigation.\n\nThe question was, who was investigating? The BIA told Nagle that the FBI had jurisdiction, but an FBI agent told her his office had no case file for Braven. (The FBI, in response to my own FOIA request in 2022, would not confirm or deny whether it possessed documents related to Braven's death. The BIA told me both agencies initially investigated, but the FBI eventually took control because Klier was non-Native.) When Old Bull tried to get Braven's death certificate, an assistant at the Big Horn County court couldn't find it. When she tried to locate his car, the insurance company Progressive said authorities hadn't released it yet. For weeks, the only information she could access was from Braven's toxicology report; the coroner personally called to offer his condolences and to tell her that Braven had been drunk and had THC in his system when he died. It would take her four months to get the full autopsy report. She still didn't know the name of the officer who'd pursued her son or how the chase had unfolded.\n\nOld Bull, a medication aide at a nursing home, is far from naive when it comes to requesting medical documentation. But federal and state law enforcement have a reputation for keeping Native families in the dark after killings. \"It's expected for families not to get information,\" says Rae Peppers, a Crow former state lawmaker.\n\nOther families have also struggled to get basic paperwork after their loved ones died. \"They never notified me, not once,\" Fraser, Kaysera's grandmother and legal guardian, says of the sheriff's office that found Kaysera's body. \"It was hard, not getting any support,\" says Alvilene Buffalo Bull Tail, whose 14-year-old grandson, nicknamed Jr. Boy, was fatally hit by a train on the Crow reservation in 2017. Authorities deemed his death an accident, surmising that he fell asleep on the tracks; Buffalo Bull Tail suspects someone pushed him, and that law enforcement never properly investigated. \"We don't have closure until at least we know what really happened.\"\n\nIn Lame Deer, a town on the Northern Cheyenne reservation bordering Crow, Maureen Bryant says her family still hasn't obtained a death certificate or autopsy report more than two years after her niece DeAnna Limberhand was found hogtied in the Stillwater River. Going to the courthouse for documents felt \"like a dead end.\" \"We kept waiting for paperwork or some kind of information, but we never heard,\" she says. \"What do you do if no one is helping you?\" she adds tearily. \"We're just going through a lot right now, and the not-knowing makes it even worse.\"\n\nRae Peppers, a Crow former state lawmaker, says Native families often struggle to get information from federal and state law enforcement agencies after killings.\n\nThe stonewalling led Old Bull and her family to speculate about what happened to Braven, and sometimes they clung to upsetting theories. When they went to the railroad after the crash and observed a second set of tire marks alongside Braven's leading from the highway through the grass to the railroad, they wondered whether the police ran him into the train. And they wondered if perhaps law enforcement's lack of transparency was a sign of something more nefarious. \"If you did nothing wrong, just release the information,\" Old Bull wanted to tell them. \"What is it you are trying to hide?\"\n\nHer suspicions heightened as witnesses came forward. According to her lawsuit, Maurice and Mavis Mountain Sheep, the couple who'd passed the wreck on their way to get gas, told her they had waited near the railroad for about a half-hour and didn't see anyone offer Braven first aid. Braven \"kept saying, 'Help me,'\" Mavis told the family. But law enforcement \"just stood there and stared at him.\"\n\nOld Bull also got a text from Bad Bear, the tribal police's dispatcher. \"I had quit by the time that occurred with your son but I can tell you right now, absolutely nothing was in compliance,\" Bad Bear wrote. \"That place should have not ever been opened...It was a shitshow there.\"\n\nFor Old Bull, the lack of clarity about the night Braven died was like torture. And she isn't one to let something like this slide. In February 2023, she tried to sue Klier in federal court for wrongful death, hoping the court proceedings would bring new information to light. She had also sued the BIA, which sent officers to the scene of the crash, accusing the agency of negligently allowing the tribal police to operate without proper training and of failing to offer Braven medical care. \"The acts of the agents of Defendant United States shock the conscience and offend the community's sense of fair play and decency,\" her attorney wrote .\n\nLast April, a judge allowed Old Bull's case to proceed against the BIA, but not against Klier, because Klier had chased Braven in her capacity as a tribal employee, not a federal one. By then, it was too late for Old Bull to sue Klier in tribal court; she'd missed the tribe's statute of limitations.\n\nOld Bull decided to try a different tactic. In July 2023, she drove to Billings to share her story with a broader audience, including federal officials who were seeking feedback about law enforcement on reservations.\n\nShe wasn't sure what to expect, but she hoped someone in power might finally listen. In the years since Braven died, President Biden had appointed the country's first Indigenous secretary of the interior, Deb Haaland. Before Haaland left Congress to take the job, she and other Native lawmakers passed a bill to hear testimony about crime and the crisis of missing Indigenous people. Now, Native families were coming from Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota to testify to a federal commission, some driving 20 hours round trip for a chance to speak for 15 minutes.\n\nGrace Bulltail, Kaysera's aunt, was a member of the commission and encouraged Old Bull to join. But Bulltail felt disappointed at the turnout of elected officials. \"We invited the Montana Department of Justice-nobody came,\" she says. Not even many Crow tribal leaders showed up. (A DOJ spokesperson said he wasn't aware of an invitation.)\n\nStill, Old Bull told me afterward that the gathering made her \"a little optimistic that something will change.\" It helped her feel less alone knowing that her family wasn't the only one waiting for answers. \"Listening to everyone's stories, you realize you're a piece of a big, big thing.\"\n\nThe next month, I was in Crow Agency again, reporting on Braven's case. It had been nearly three years since Old Bull first started investigating the circumstances surrounding her son's death, but there'd been a big development since the last time I visited: The BIA had sent me an email with a trove of documents about the incident. It had taken me months of corresponding with the agency-after a year examining the case, interviewing dozens of people, and scouring court and government records-to get the details of her son's final minutes. I wondered whether my luck with the BIA had something to do with all the time that had passed, or my status as an outsider. Nagle, Old Bull's attorney, told me journalists are \"much more likely\" than Indigenous families to get documents from the federal government via the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nAt Old Bull's house, she put on her glasses and joined me on the couch, where I spread out the highlighted pages for her to see.\n\nAt first, what Old Bull read in the BIA's investigative report lined up with what she already knew. It all started on Highway 451 on November 24, she read. But the next detail made her purse her lips: At 5:39 p.m., Braven made a \"legal pass\" of Klier's police car over a dotted yellow line, according to the BIA's description of Klier's dashcam footage, which doesn't specify how fast he drove past her. Then, once he got in front of her, he slowed back down to the speed limit, about 70 mph, and Klier turned on her emergency lights to pull him over.\n\nHe kept driving.\n\nMaybe he was afraid, Old Bull thought, remembering the officer who had choked him on his way to juvenile hall just months before the crash.\n\nIn any case, Braven drove, still close to the speed limit.\n\nSeconds later, he slowed down considerably, and it appeared he might pull over. Klier, now following him at 55 mph, called dispatch and reported that he'd passed her at 90 mph. But Braven did not pull over. Klier activated her siren.\n\nNow, Braven began to accelerate, and she chased him. Seventy-seven miles per hour within half a minute. One hundred and nine miles per hour within a minute. They passed two other cars driving the opposite direction.\n\nThen Braven made a bold move. He turned off his headlights and other exterior lights, a tactic that drivers sometimes use to hide from police. At a bend in the highway, he went onto the grass, driving in the dark toward the railroad.\n\nOld Bull stopped reading and pushed her glasses onto her forehead. \"He legally passed her,\" she said. \"All this kid wanted to do was to go see his girlfriend, that was it. It doesn't make sense.\" She covered her face with her hands and cried.\n\nOne-third of all police chases in the United States end with a crash, often causing property damage, injury, or death. Many of these chases begin after an officer observes a traffic infraction, but because of the risks involved, some police departments only allow pursuits after a violent felony or something that puts the public in imminent danger. It's unclear whether the Crow police had a similar rule. Police Chief Tobacco and Sergeant Eastman testified in the lawsuit over Braven's death that there was not a handbook of policies and procedures in place, or at least they weren't aware of one. But the tribe submitted one to the BIA in the months leading up to the crash, according to records I obtained . That handbook states that an officer can only pursue a driver if there's a \"compelling need\" and if the chase presents less risk to the public than the driver remaining at large. A \"compelling need,\" the manual adds, \"does not include the mere act of fleeing, even if reckless,\" or \"traffic and licensing infractions, including DUI.\"\n\nSome police officers argue it's worthwhile to chase after a traffic violation, because maybe the driver is actually fleeing due to a bigger offense, like a dead body or bags of cocaine in the trunk. But suspicion alone, says Stoughton, the South Carolina expert, is not enough. \"If you aren't sure what the benefits of the pursuit are, but you do know the dangers,\" including a deadly crash, \"clearly the risks should outweigh the benefits,\" he says. \"Failing to stop for a speeding violation is not a good reason to kill someone.\" And that's especially true if the driver may be intoxicated, he says. In Braven's case, \"what's more dangerous-him driving the speed limit while drunk,\" or him being chased and \"driving 100 mph while drunk?\" says Stoughton, adding that Klier could have arrested him later: According to court documents, she'd already noted his license plate number. \"Had she terminated the pursuit,\" policing expert Susan Peters testified in Old Bull's lawsuit, \"more likely than not, Braven J. Glenn would not have been involved in a vehicular fatality accident.\"\n\nScraps of burned metal, including a suspension spring, a radiator, and a wheel, are what's left of Braven's car near the site of the crash.\n\nAs Old Bull and I read over the BIA reports, it became more and more apparent that the investigation into the crash had been flawed from the start.\n\nMoments after the crash, Klier called dispatch. \"Send medical,\" she said, according to call logs. \"He just got hit.\" Soon, other law enforcement arrived-from the tribal police, the BIA, the state highway patrol, the sheriff's office, and the fire department. But according to other records from the investigation, they struggled to get on the same page, a common complaint on reservations. Bodycam footage from Deputy Sheriff Michael Colvin, a county cop who was assigned to divert traffic, offers a small glimpse into the confusion.\n\n\"Hey, where's the body at?\" an officer asked Colvin.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Colvin said. \"Tribal PD was first on scene, and they told BIA where it was at...He said it wrecked some place down here.\"\n\n\"Was it crossing or what?\"\n\n\"I don't know. That's what I asked, but he didn't really give me an answer.\"\n\nSeconds later, paramedics drove past Colvin, lights flashing. A voice came over his radio: \"They're on scene, but they've been canceled.\" The paramedics left.\n\nSix minutes later, a tribal police officer called dispatch, according to records I obtained from the county attorney's office. \"Tribal asked why EMS canceled,\" the dispatcher noted in a call log , \"because they didn't make the determination the individual(s) were deceased.\" The tribal officer asked the paramedics to return. Later, Braven's girlfriend, Jordan, who drove over after Braven didn't pick her up after work, saw men loading a body bag into a white truck.\n\nMeanwhile, BIA special agent Figueroa arrived. According to an investigative report , he told Klier that the BIA would investigate the crash. Later, he told another tribal officer on the scene that Klier would need to have her blood drawn and that he needed the dashcam footage from her patrol vehicle. The officer acknowledged his request, but when Figueroa returned from speaking with the train conductor, Klier was gone and had taken the police car with her. The tribal officer had given Klier permission to go home, according to the report; she'd been visibly shaken up after the crash.\n\n\"It's like, what the fuck?\" says attorney Tim Bechtold, who is representing Old Bull in her lawsuit. \"All these cops not knowing what the fuck to do.\" Klier's decision to take her vehicle was \"incredibly unusual and wildly inappropriate,\" says Stoughton, the police expert in South Carolina. \"It's not that much different from an officer who's involved with a shooting taking their gun home instead of turning that over for evidence.\"\n\nA former tribal police officer, who requested anonymity, later told me he saw Klier at the police station soon after the crash. The officer drove to the railroad and alerted Figueroa that the car might be at headquarters. \"You need to go down there and get that vehicle now,\" he recalls telling Figueroa. But it's unclear if Figueroa went; he didn't locate the car that night.\n\nThe next day, Figueroa told the Crow police department that he would need a copy of Klier's incident report and the dashcam footage. The following day was Thanksgiving. And a day after that, Figueroa learned the police department had already \"disbanded and closed shop,\" according to the BIA investigation. \"No one knows who has access to their reports.\"\n\nThen things got even more complicated. In mid-December, when Figueroa reminded the tribe that he still needed the report, he learned that someone had broken into the former police headquarters. Now the records he needed were missing.\n\nFigueroa still didn't know where Klier's police car was, either. So in January, he drove to Wyoming, where she lived and worked with the VA, to find her. She said she was waiting for an attorney and didn't want to talk. (She also declined my request for comment.)\n\nFigueroa drove back to Montana and reached out to the tribe's homeland security director, who said he was \"unsure where anything was,\" this time citing two break-ins at the police ­headquarters,­ but that he would try his best to find the records. (Police equipment, including guns, had also gone missing.) Two weeks later, in February, Figueroa learned the headquarters had suffered four break-ins, but someone had finally located Klier's police car; Figueroa copied the dashcam footage. In May, he obtained the BIA's dispatch logs, but the tribal police's logs concerning Braven's death-and Klier's incident report for it-were still missing. (They don't appear to have ever been recovered.)\n\nHarris, the former Big Horn county attorney, whose term ended in late 2022, believes the US government may be responsible, at least in part, for mistakes made by law enforcement that night. In addition to allegedly failing to provide potentially lifesaving medical care, the BIA did not properly secure the scene of the crash and allowed Klier's police car to get away, and then took months to find it. \"You would think [the BIA] would have their hair on fire chasing everybody down,\" says Jonathan Smith, who oversaw investigations into police department misconduct at Obama's Justice Department. If it took that long to locate the car, he adds, \"it seems unlikely they tried as hard as they could.\"\n\nOld Bull's lawsuit is scheduled for trial this summer. The US government denies any wrongdoing. Since the BIA did not employ the Crow's tribal police force, an attorney for the government wrote in response to the complaint, \"the United States cannot be held liable...for their negligence.\"\n\nAfter reading the BIA reports, Old Bull retraced the new information. \"There's so much they did wrong...It's like a ton of bricks just hits you,\" she told me, motioning with her hands toward her chest. She wondered whether things might have been different if she'd gotten some of this information sooner-whether it would have helped her legal case, or at the very least helped her heal. And it stung, she added, knowing that an outsider like me-a white journalist with no connection to Braven-could access all these FOIA records, while she, Braven's mother, had been denied. It took suing for her to begin getting evidence, and even that, she said, didn't include some of the key details I'd just shared with her. \"I fought so hard to get that, years and years,\" she said. \"It's like we don't matter, like we are nothing.\" Two days later, former tribal police chief Terrill Bracken arrived at my Airbnb in Billings. I'd told him that Old Bull was interested in seeing him. Bracken wasn't leading the police department when Braven died, and he knew little about the chase. But if Old Bull wanted to talk, meeting her seemed like the Christian thing to do, he said. \"Anything I can do to help her with the grief that she is going through, that's why I'm here,\" he told me. Old Bull, who'd worked a 12-hour shift at the nursing home that day, sat in her car outside the house for a moment before entering. For months, she'd been asking God to help her forgive, but it was hard to let go of all the resentments she carried. Maybe, she thought, it would be easier after talking with Bracken and hearing another perspective. \"I have to come face-to-face with somebody that started this whole thing, and just get some straightforward answers,\" she told me at the front door. After taking a seat opposite the former police chief, Old Bull anxiously tapped on her glass of water with her fingers, tears welling in her eyes. Bracken said he was sorry for her loss. She thanked him. \"That's our right to know what happened to our child,\" she said. \"And I never got that. I had to fight and fight and fight.\" \"And it should not have to be that way,\" Bracken agreed. \"It's frustrating for me,\" he added, \"because I know what we were working toward was going to be so much better,\" he said of the tribal police. Their conversation stretched on for two hours. At points, Old Bull seemed to soften toward Bracken. \"I do feel better with you talking to me. I can see you now as a person,\" she said. But when he began talking about Officer Klier, the mood shifted. \"For all we know,\" Bracken said of Klier, \"she's not doing very well right now.\" \"She's not the one hurting,\" Old Bull said quietly. \"I'm not saying who's suffering more. It's not a contest,\" Bracken responded. \"But I'm just being honest with you: Given the information that I have, I can't see how I would have acted any differently than the officer. And that's a difficult part of the job.\" Old Bull sighed. \"I gotta work in the morning,\" she said, signaling her intent to leave. \"Would it be okay if I prayed with you?\" he asked. She nodded, her eyes shut, and began crying after he placed his hands over hers. Driving home, Old Bull was glad to have spoken with Bracken. But as she lay in bed the next morning, recalling the conversation, her anger grew. \"For him to say, 'Oh, poor Pamela, I wonder what she's going through'? How dare you ,\" she thought. She picked up her phone and texted me: \"Samantha there was a lot that bothered me. He put her on this pedestal,\" she wrote. \"To sit there and emphasize her feelings, when this is about the loss of my son and her actions made that loss happen. I feel like it was an attempt...to glorify what she did as a cop.\" \"This is a system made to oppress us. It's been this way since Columbus,\" she added, before putting down her phone and heading to work. The doors of the tribal police headquarters were locked the first time I visited last year, but I could peek inside to see how abruptly it was all abandoned. The police's whiteboard calendar still showed the Thanksgiving party scheduled for the day Braven died. Stacks of unused call logs sat in dusty boxes. In the parking lot, a makeshift jail remained, two tiny cells inside a shipping container. The refrigerated counter that once held Subway's sandwich ingredients-and then guns-had been removed. The dining tables that the cops used as desks were piled outside beneath cottonwood trees. The temporary holding cell in a modified shipping container outside the former tribal police station The former tribal police station in a closed-down Subway store on the Crow reservation There was never a public explanation for why the department closed in late November 2020, leading to speculation. Old Bull still wonders whether the police are hiding something. Big Man, the historian, wonders if they packed up and left because of poor training and lack of community support, and because Braven's chase was \"the final straw.\" \"There were a lot of reasons why it shut down,\" says one of the tribal police officers who requested anonymity. \"It was starting to fail\" even before Braven's accident, and then \"the money stopped coming in.\" Bracken doubts Braven's death was the only motivation for disbanding, if it was a motivation at all. He blames politics: A few weeks before the crash, Chairman Not Afraid lost the election to Frank White Clay, a former tribal lawmaker who believed propping up a new police force with Covid relief funding violated federal spending guidelines. \"We're still trying to figure out exactly where that money went,\" White Clay would later tell a journalism student at the University of Montana in 2021. He agreed the reservation needed more law enforcement but said this police force was just \"playing cops.\" Rather than give White Clay the satisfaction of disbanding the force, Not Afraid beat him to it and shut down the department about a week before the inauguration, according to another former tribal police official. It was possible Braven's accident may have been \"the catalyst, the icing on the cake,\" but it wasn't the primary reason for closing, he said. Harris, the former Big Horn county attorney, says the department's sudden ­closure was evidence that it was never properly established. \"A legitimate, lawful police agency doesn't just end because a chairman or president or governor says, 'All right. Enough,'\" he tells me. \"This [police department] was a mirage, a facade.\" It was \"a temporary fix, nothing more than a Band-Aid,\" one of the former police officers tells me. \"Did we do everything perfectly? Absolutely not,\" says Bracken. \"But were we doing the best we could with what we had? Yes. I really believe that department would have flourished into something had it gotten a fair opportunity.\" The Crow police force's brief existence and abrupt end is not just a story about a tribal administration's mistakes, says Big Man. It is also a story about the federal government's repeated failures leading up to 2020-to keep families informed, to conduct thorough investigations, to keep the reservation safe. And it shows \"a real need for clear, meaningful communication\" with Crow people, says Kristina Lucero, who directs the American Indian Governance and Policy Institute at the University of Montana, \"about expected goals and the mission of what law enforcement should be doing.\" The police department was \"a temporary fix, nothing more than a Band-Aid.\" Many of the families who testified with Old Bull in Billings were adamant that they want more transparent policing, including easier access to information after loved ones die or go missing. \"Authorities at all levels must improve communications with family members, who are too often left in the dark for days, weeks, or months,\" causing \"enormous stress,\" the federal commission wrote afterward. Indigenous communities also want more funding: In 2022, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe in Montana sued the US government because of a shortage of police. The state's Fort Belknap Indian Community sued too, after the BIA refused to provide more public safety money. \"What's happening at Crow, that's pretty extreme,\" says UCLA's van Schilfgaarde, but \"when budgets are tight, these [police] departments come and go in a way that would just never happen in other communities.\" The problem isn't just in Montana, she adds. Most Native villages in Alaska have no law enforcement presence whatsoever. Two days after his inauguration in 2020, White Clay informed the BIA that \"an independent law enforcement effort is not the direction that the new administration of the Crow Tribe intends to continue.\" Since then, complaints about BIA policing persist. In July 2021, the tribe sued a BIA officer after he was caught on video failing to stop his dog from biting someone handcuffed after a traffic stop, for nearly a minute, leading to three surgeries on the man's ankle and foot. \"Unfortunately, nothing in this video is surprising to anyone who has lived on the Crow Nation,\" the tribe's attorney wrote. \"I had a lot of faith in the police before,\" Old Bull says, \"but after Braven died, I don't believe they're there to protect us.\" In December, President Biden signed an executive order to remove red tape that has hampered Native access to law enforcement funding. But legal action might be more effective. In May, a US district judge encouraged the feds to meet with the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota and \"figure out how to more fairly fund\" tribal policing-or else go to trial. The decision was \"the first to acknowledge that the government owes a treaty-based duty to fund law enforcement for [an] Indian tribe,\" according to the Oglala Sioux's attorneys. And they say it could at last force a legal reckoning over Washington's centuries-long harm to Native justice systems. A successful reckoning must give tribes more jurisdiction and make room for them to reimagine policing and public safety in ways that reflect their own cultures and customs, says Goldberg, the Obama appointee to the Indian Law and Order Commission. She's seen Indigenous communities that involve spiritual leaders in justice proceedings to weigh in on punishments and design a path forward. The Tulalip reservation in Washington state, in keeping with its values, has required police to stop by the Boys & Girls Club twice a shift to help kids with homework, and they attend elders' breakfasts to share data and answer questions. A successful reckoning must give tribes more jurisdiction and make room for them to reimagine policing and public safety in ways that reflect their own cultures and customs. On the Crow reservation, most people I asked said the tribe needed more law enforcement, but they also emphasized the importance of better officer training. Some said they wanted to think about public safety in a more balanced way, with funding for mental health, addiction treatment, housing, and education. Investments like these could make it easier to recruit good local cops, says the University of Montana's Lucero, since people might be less hesitant to police their relatives if the justice system offered more second chances and paths toward healing. \"You just can't arrest people, lock them up, and expect to throw them back in the same situation and change,\" says Big Man. \"Past traumas have created who we are,\" adds Old Bull. \"Get people into treatment and get them help and programs before moving in a police department.\" Tribal nations that are successful with law enforcement, says Goldberg, are ones with \"strong congruence between the views of the community and the way it's done.\" Braven's family built a memorial for him near the site of his death. Old Bull buried Braven about an hour from home, at the foot of the Pryor Mountains, next to the graves of his father and his cousin Kaysera. The cemetery is small and quiet, off a dirt path surrounded by fields, and most of the gravestones are simple, some with fake flowers and crosses. Old Bull and her family go there often to mow the grass around Braven's plot and decorate it with gifts, like chocolate-covered pretzels, one of his favorite snacks, and a basketball covered in their handwritten messages for him. At times they'll play music and reminisce about the ways he made them laugh, like how he'd make a muscle like Popeye and kiss it. When two of his older sisters got pregnant, they went to the cemetery and told him about it. When his younger sister graduated high school, she wore a cap beaded with the words, \"We did it Brave.\" They feel sometimes like he's still with them, even sending them messages. The night before his funeral, when Old Bull slept in a teepee with his remains, in keeping with her Lakota traditions, she and another family member heard a basketball bouncing in the middle of the night, even though everyone else had long since gone to bed. In August 2023, on what would have been his 20th birthday, Old Bull and her kids drive to the cemetery to visit Braven. They eat chocolate cupcakes with sprinkles, Braven's favorite, and release balloons into the sky for him. \"I want them to know he was a person too,\" Emilio says. \"He was a good kid and had big dreams, and for them to hide in the shadows-he deserves justice, the truth.\" \"Accountability and closure-that's what my mom really needs, what I really need,\" adds sister Marissa. \"I do want accountability, and I want them to admit this didn't have to happen,\" says Old Bull. On the drive home around 10 p.m., Old Bull sees a white owl sitting on the side of the road. In her tradition, owls are harbingers of death. The last time she encountered one, her mom died, and not too long afterward Braven did, too. When she arrives home it's almost midnight, and she lights a bundle of sage and cedar, calling her kids and grandkids out of the house to smudge them and help keep them safe. \"Bring the babies out,\" she instructs, walking to each person with the bundle and watching as they wave the smoke over their heads and into their hearts, all the way down to their legs. \"Who's next?\" This project was completed with the support of a grant from Columbia University's Ira A. Lipman Center for Journalism and Civil and Human Rights in conjunction with Arnold Ventures. Old Bull visits the memorial placed where Braven died.\n\nAfter reading the BIA reports, Old Bull retraced the new information. \"There's so much they did wrong...It's like a ton of bricks just hits you,\" she told me, motioning with her hands toward her chest. She wondered whether things might have been different if she'd gotten some of this information sooner-whether it would have helped her legal case, or at the very least helped her heal.\n\nAnd it stung, she added, knowing that an outsider like me-a white journalist with no connection to Braven-could access all these FOIA records, while she, Braven's mother, had been denied.

Earlier this month, Deputy Sean Grayson shot 36-year-old Sonya Massey after she attempted to move a pot of water off of her stove at the officer's behest.\n\nThe Sangamon County Sheriff's Office has reportedly fired Grayson, who was later charged with first-degree murder last week . He's pleaded not guilty.\n\n\"She needed a helping hand,\" attorney Ben Crump said at a press conference on Monday. \"She didn't need a bullet to the face.\" On July 6, Massey reportedly called the authorities about a potential prowler around her Springfield home. Officer Grayson and another deputy arrived on the scene.\n\nWhile asking her a few questions, Grayson asked her to turn off her stove, where a pot of water was reportedly boiling. Massey gets up to turn it off and pick up the pot. The officers then step back. She asks where they're going; Grayson replies, \"Away from your hot steaming water.\"\n\nMassey then says, \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\" Grayson responds that she \"better not,\" threatening to shoot her \"in her fucking face.\" She apologizes before three shots ring in the air.\n\nAs Massey laid bleeding in her kitchen, the other unnamed officer said he was going to get his medical kit from his car when Grayson said, \"Nah, she's done. You can go get it, but that's a headshot.\"\n\nFollowing the shooting, the 30-year-old deputy referred to Massey as a \"crazy fucking bitch\" to other officers who arrived on the scene. Grayson's body camera was reportedly turned off for most of the shooting.\n\nThe footage of Massey's death, captured by the other deputy's body camera, shocked the nation. Several local, state, and federal officials have condemned the officer's actions. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris both released statements calling for justice for Massey's family on Tuesday.\n\n\"Sonya Massey deserved to be safe,\" said Harris. \"After she called the police for help, she was tragically killed in her own home at the hands of a responding officer sworn to protect and serve.\"\n\nIn an interview with CNN, her father, James Wilburn, alleged that law enforcement had given them conflicting information about his daughter's death, leading him to believe that a robber had killed her. Massey's killing has devastated him.\n\n\"Sonya was a daddy's girl. She never ended a conversation-whether by text or telephone or in person-without saying, 'Daddy, I love you,\" her father, James Wilburn, told CNN's Laura Coates in an interview . \"And that's the last message I have from my daughter that's saved on my voicemail, was 'Daddy, I love you.'\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Albuquerque Cosper Head, a 34-year old man from Tennessee, was responsible for forcibly moving Fanone from a tunnel into a crowd of angry rioters who proceeded to beat him and shocked him with a stun gun at the base of his skull.\n\nBefore sentencing, Judge Amy Berman Jackson told Head, \"He was your prey. He was your trophy.\" Head, who declined to address the court,  is one of the hundreds of Trump supporters charged for their roles in storming the Capitol in a violent attempt to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nThe ex-construction worker, who pled guilty in April, has received one of the longest sentences of the convicted insurrectionists so far, second only to an ex-NYPD officer who was given nearly ten years last month. Head's sentence is only six months shy of the maximum eight years for these charges.\n\nThe details of the attack are shocking. According to prosecutors , Head yelled \"I got one!\" before grabbing Fanone around his neck and dragging him before the crowd. Head then held the officer in place as the crowd proceeded to beat and taze him repeatedly, leaving burn marks at the base of his neck. Body camera footage captured Fanone losing consciousness for more than two minutes during the assault. Court records also state that Head attempted to remove Fanone's weapon from its holster.\n\nThe former officer recounted the details of this attack during his testimony at the first congressional hearing during the January 6 investigation. As my colleague, Inae Oh, previously reported :\n\n\"I was grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country,\" Officer Michael Fanone told lawmakers in his opening statement. \"I was at risk of being stripped of and killed with my own firearm as I heard chants of 'Kill him with his own gun.' I can still hear those words in my head.\"\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing, Fanone said that he suffered a heart attack and sustained a traumatic brain injury from the attack, ending his career in law enforcement. While he's gained some fame from his testimony and even secured a book deal , he said he still misses the life he had before.\n\n\"I would trade all of this attention to return to policing, but I can't do that,\" he said , according to reports from the LA Time s. \"And the catalyst for my loss of career and the suffering that I've endured in the past 18 months is Albuquerque Head.\"\n\nThere are more than 900 people who've been federally charged for their actions on January 6. Donald Trump and his former chief of staff were both recently subpoenaed for various election interference investigations. Meanwhile, there are currently 291 election deniers who are running for office.\n\n\"The dark shadow of tyranny unfortunately has not gone away,\" Judge Jackson said at the hearing. \"There are people who are still disseminating the lie that the election was stolen. They're doing it today. And the people who are stoking that anger for their own selfish purposes, they need to think about the havoc they've wreaked, the lives they've ruined.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "A Mississippi Police Officer Who Shot a Black 15-Year-Old in the Head Won't Face Criminal Charges\n\nGulfport MS Police Department\n\nFour months after a Mississippi police officer shot a Black 15-year-old, Jaheim McMillan, in the head outside a Family Dollar store, the state's Department of Public Safety has released video footage of the encounter, following the state attorney general's announcement Wednesday that a grand jury found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by law enforcement.\n\nThe shooting of McMillan in Gulfport on October 6 sparked months of protest, after some witnesses outside the store said he was unarmed and had his hands up, and that he lay on the sidewalk for minutes without medical care as blood poured from his head. The officer who shot McMillan, Kenneth Nassar, who is white, said the teen turned toward him with a gun.\n\nThe video footage, including dash-cam footage, was released Wednesday to local journalists. It shows McMillan and another teen fleeing a parked car in front of the store after a police vehicle enters the lot. Both teens run in the same direction, away from the police vehicle, but as an officer comes toward them, McMillan turns and flees in the opposite direction, back toward the entrance of the store. As he runs, another officer, Nassar, approaches and quickly fires eight shots at him. McMillan is lying on the ground wounded within about five seconds of exiting the car.\n\nLaw enforcement edited the video, freezing it at certain points to show that McMillan is holding an object that resembles a firearm before Nassar shoots him. At least seven minutes pass before McMillan is offered medical care.\n\nThree other teens were in the car with McMillan and the other boy who fled; the video shows them following orders to get on the ground near the vehicle with their hands out, and the police arrest them while McMillan bleeds nearby. At one point, one of the teens asks Nassar to offer McMillan some aid. \"Sir, can you please check on him? I think he's dead,\" the teen says, according to the Huffington Post , which obtained more video through a records request.\n\nMcMillan died from his wounds two days later in a hospital.\n\nThe police say they were responding to a 911 complaint about teens in a silver Kia Soul who were \"brandishing firearms\" at a passing motorist and wearing camouflage masks. According to a redacted report from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, published by the Mississippi Free Press , Nassar said that he gave verbal commands for McMillan to stop running and drop his weapon, and that McMillan did not comply.\n\nAfter the shooting, investigators interviewed the four other teens. The 16-year-old boy who fled with McMillan said he did not hear any of the officers give commands to put down weapons, and that he could only hear gunshots. Another teen who remained in the car said he heard officers yelling but couldn't make out the words because the car door was shut, and added that he did not see a weapon in McMillan's hand when McMillan fled. Two other boys said McMillan had a pistol on him; one said McMillan didn't raise it or point it toward anyone, and the other said he didn't think McMillan would fire it toward an officer.\n\nAs other officers arrived to the scene, Nassar told one of them that he saw a gun in McMillan's hand while McMillan was running, but that McMillan did not appear to have the gun in his possession when Nassar handcuffed him afterward and turned over his body. Officers later discovered a gun in the parking lot.\n\nA grand jury heard evidence earlier this month and \"found no criminal conduct on behalf of the officer involved,\" the state attorney general's office announced on Wednesday, providing no further details on the factors the jury considered.\n\nAs I previously reported , McMillan's mother, Katrina Mateen, and other supporters have been calling for the release of body-cam video for months, saying they did not trust the police's version of events and wanted to see footage themselves. Mateen told me that when she went to the Family Dollar store after the shooting, she tried to run past officers to see whether the boy lying on the ground was her son, but that an officer handcuffed her and told her to \"shut up.\"\n\nMcMillan would have turned 16 earlier this month. Days after his birthday, protesters gathered outside the Family Dollar store to remember him. \"My son, he was a target,\" Mateen told me, crying. \"I couldn't be there for my son.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

McMillan is lying on the ground wounded within about five seconds of exiting the car.\n\nLaw enforcement edited the video, freezing it at certain points to show that McMillan is holding an object that resembles a firearm before Nassar shoots him. At least seven minutes pass before McMillan is offered medical care.\n\nThree other teens were in the car with McMillan and the other boy who fled; the video shows them following orders to get on the ground near the vehicle with their hands out, and the police arrest them while McMillan bleeds nearby. At one point, one of the teens asks Nassar to offer McMillan some aid. \"Sir, can you please check on him? I think he's dead,\" the teen says, according to the Huffington Post , which obtained more video through a records request.\n\nMcMillan died from his wounds two days later in a hospital.\n\nThe police say they were responding to a 911 complaint about teens in a silver Kia Soul who were \"brandishing firearms\" at a passing motorist and wearing camouflage masks. According to a redacted report from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, published by the Mississippi Free Press , Nassar said that he gave verbal commands for McMillan to stop running and drop his weapon, and that McMillan did not comply.\n\nAfter the shooting, investigators interviewed the four other teens. The 16-year-old boy who fled with McMillan said he did not hear any of the officers give commands to put down weapons, and that he could only hear gunshots. Another teen who remained in the car said he heard officers yelling but couldn't make out the words because the car door was shut, and added that he did not see a weapon in McMillan's hand when McMillan fled. Two other boys said McMillan had a pistol on him; one said McMillan didn't raise it or point it toward anyone, and the other said he didn't think McMillan would fire it toward an officer.\n\nAs other officers arrived to the scene, Nassar told one of them that he saw a gun in McMillan's hand while McMillan was running, but that McMillan did not appear to have the gun in his possession when Nassar handcuffed him afterward and turned over his body. Officers later discovered a gun in the parking lot.\n\nA grand jury heard evidence earlier this month and \"found no criminal conduct on behalf of the officer involved,\" the state attorney general's office announced on Wednesday, providing no further details on the factors the jury considered.\n\nAs I previously reported , McMillan's mother, Katrina Mateen, and other supporters have been calling for the release of body-cam video for months, saying they did not trust the police's version of events and wanted to see footage themselves. Mateen told me that when she went to the Family Dollar store after the shooting, she tried to run past officers to see whether the boy lying on the ground was her son, but that an officer handcuffed her and told her to \"shut up.\"\n\nMcMillan would have turned 16 earlier this month. Days after his birthday, protesters gathered outside the Family Dollar store to remember him. \"My son, he was a target,\" Mateen told me, crying. \"I couldn't be there for my son.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "What Does It Take to Convict a Cop?\n\nMichael Sokolove Mar/Apr 2017 Issue\n\nJeremy M. Lange\n\nWalter Scott's cellphone bill was current. In that small but not unimportant aspect of life, he was on solid ground. He had checked in with his elderly parents, called and texted friends. At 50 years old, Scott was a forklift driver, a dominoes aficionado, an extrovert with a buttery voice who sang soul music at social gatherings and spirituals in church. As a young man he'd served in the Coast Guard, but he was discharged after testing positive for marijuana. He drifted between jobs, earned a two-year degree at a technical college, and performed the national anthem at his commencement ceremony. He had four children from two past relationships and was chronically behind on support payments.\n\nOn the morning of April 4, 2015, Scott was driving a 1991 Mercedes sedan that he had agreed to purchase from a neighbor, though the paperwork had not yet been squared away. He had a friend with him. He was less than a mile from the home he shared with his girlfriend in North Charleston, South Carolina-genteel Charleston's poor cousin, a city of roughly 108,000 people that is bisected by railroad tracks and dotted with pawn shops and payday loan outlets. In parts of North Charleston, it seems like just about anything of value-tire superstores, small industrial sites, even residences-is protected by high cyclone fences and barbed wire.\n\nPolice Shootings Won't Stop Unless We Also Stop Shaking Down Black People\n\nAt about 9:30 a.m., a police cruiser pulled up behind Scott, lights flashing. Scott made an immediate left turn, then came to a stop in the parking lot of an auto-parts store and watched through the rearview mirror as an officer, dressed in shirt sleeves on that warm spring day, walked toward him. Patrolman Michael Slager, then 33, had his hands at his hips, his right one close to his gun. Also a Coast Guard veteran, and in his fifth year on the force, Slager had moved from out of state to a place where he had no history and few associations. He was an armed white man hired to police unfamiliar black streets. He had gone through nine weeks of training at the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy-nine, as opposed to the 26 weeks required for a New York City cop. Officers in Europe are typically trained for a year or more.\n\n\"The reason for the stop is your third brake light's out,\" Slager said through the driver's side window. It was the classic DWB (driving while black) rationale for a stop, but Scott knew he had a bigger problem. He was $18,104 in arrears on child support and there was a warrant out for his arrest. Scott had been to jail in the past for failure to pay support. It had cost him jobs and made his debt ever larger and harder to manage. He handed over his license and told Slager he planned to complete the purchase of the car in a couple of days. The interaction was entirely respectful. Scott said he had no registration or insurance card with him. \"I'm sorry about that,\" he said.\n\n\"Okay, but you're buying the car?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nThe officer returned to his cruiser intending to run Scott's license through an FBI database, standard procedure. Scott stepped out of his vehicle and then climbed back in when Slager, sitting in his squad car, instructed him to do so. But moments later, Scott got out a second time and ran toward an open field, the site of an abandoned trailer park, and onto a painted asphalt path known locally as the Yellow Brick Road. Slager pursued on foot, warning that he was preparing to fire his stun gun: \"Taser! Taser! Taser!\" Scott didn't stop, so Slager hit him with two darts.\n\nThe electricity brought Scott to his knees, but he refused to surrender. Slager then \"drive-stunned\" Scott-put the business end of the Taser directly on him and pulled the trigger-but could not cuff him. The men scuffled on the ground, and a winded Slager pleaded for backup. \"One-five-six,\" he said into his radio, calling out the badge number of the officer he knew was closest. \"Step it up!\"\n\nScott managed to break free and run away in a slow, wobbly gait. This time Slager did not give chase . He unholstered his .45-caliber Glock, took a stance, and put his left hand underneath to steady the weapon. His form was perfect, like in a training video. The only problem was that his gun was aimed at the back of a fleeing man. He squeezed off eight quick shots.\n\nOne round grazed Scott's ear, and four more-hollow-point bullets that expand after impact-ripped into his flesh. One of the bullets entered from the right side of Scott's back, went through his heart, and lodged just beneath his left nipple, causing massive internal bleeding. Scott fell by the side of a tree and Slager walked 20 or so unhurried steps until he reached the body, at which point he arranged Scott's arms behind his back and handcuffed a dead or dying man.\n\nFrom the other side of a fence line, Feidin Santana, a 23-year-old barber and Dominican immigrant who was walking to work, witnessed the chase and began recording on his phone just as Scott broke away from Slager. Of all the police shootings that had been captured by citizens, this one was the most shocking. To many observers, it was unambiguous: An unarmed black man runs. A white cop coldly takes aim, shoots him multiple times in the back, and then appears to plant evidence-the Taser, which Slager had retrieved from where they had scuffled-beside the body.\n\n\"I don't get surprised by much,\" says criminologist Philip Stinson, \"but that video took my breath away.\"\n\nIt is customary for police to close ranks around a colleague who is involved in a questionable shooting, but the emergence of Santana's video three days after the incident made Slager a pariah. North Charleston's police chief declared himself \"sickened.\" Slager was fired and charged with murder-a rarity. His first lawyer quit and his union refused to pay for his defense. The city reached a swift civil settlement with Walter Scott's family and paid out $6.5 million without even being sued. Initially denied bail, Slager spent months in solitary confinement-some of that time in a cell next to Dylann Roof , who murdered nine black parishioners at Charleston's Mother Emanuel Church two months after Scott's death.\n\nIt seemed as though the whole episode might finally answer the question: What does it take to convict a cop of murder? In early December, however, a jury of 12 citizens said it was unable to reach a consensus about Slager's guilt or innocence-even on a lesser charge of manslaughter. The judge declared a mistrial, and a new trial date was set for the end of August. But in a surprise development in early May, Slager pleaded guilty to separate federal charges related to the shooting. As part of the plea deal, the state charges will be dropped. Sentencing will take place at a date to be determined. In theory, Slager could face life in prison. In reality, he is likely to get far less.\n\nIt was clear, based on courtroom testimony as well as interviews with police trainers and other experts, that Slager had made a series of catastrophic decisions-not just in shooting Scott, but before he ever reached for his weapon. The slaying, its aftermath, and the trial itself would amount to an indictment of his inferior training and of questionable police policies in North Charleston. Several fellow officers, supervisors included, would insist that Slager had done what he was supposed to. He chased a \"bad guy,\" as one North Charleston cop put it, because that's what police do. He followed his department's procedures, and where there were none to guide him, he was led by his own flawed instincts.\n\nEach of the contested police shootings of black men we've witnessed in recent years has been a collision of two lives, two life histories. In most cases, they are first and final meetings of two men who would seem to have no other point of intersection. What transpires between them can seem like an accident of fate-wrong place, wrong time-predestined by racial bias and sealed by video footage.\n\nA few months before he shot Walter Scott, Michael Slager had moved to the day shift after several years of working overnight. He sought the change because his wife, Jamie, was pregnant with their first child. She had a son and a daughter from a previous marriage who lived with them and were home-schooled. Slager spent most of his off-hours with his family-going to movies and the mall and attending outdoor events and festivals in Charleston. He liked watching TV comedies and texted his favorite lines to one of his two younger sisters, Madeline Cosenzo. Slager patrolled a sector known as Charleston Farms, the city's highest-crime area, and his job consisted of driving the same rectangular three-minute loop over and over, 10 hours at a stretch. He told his family he liked the work but emphasized that it was dangerous.\n\nMichael Slager\n\nJeremy M. Lange\n\nSlager was making about $44,000 a year and money was tight-the couple had to take out a loan for Jamie's fertility treatments-but he could look forward to a reasonable degree of economic stability. Being a cop is one of the last careers left in America in which a person without a college degree can have job security and robust benefits-good health insurance, paid sick and vacation days, a dedicated pension. Slager drove a department-issued vehicle-a \"take-home car,\" as the perk is known-which he was allowed to use while off duty. His salary would have eventually reached about $54,000 a year, or more if he rose in rank. It was work that couldn't be shipped overseas or done by a robot, and a North Charleston cop could make extra money doing private-security gigs. Slager might have retired in his mid-50s, young enough to get another job, and collected pension payments worth more than half his peak salary. He was dutiful, competent, thoroughly average. \"He was a very sweet child. He was good. He obeyed,\" his mother, Karen Sharpe, told me. \"Mike is a person who is very by the book,\" his sister said. \"He always liked that structure of things.\"\n\nSlager had a way of moving through life without leaving a strong impression, good or bad. In the lead-up to the trial, his lawyer, Andrew Savage III, considered making him available for interviews but worried he was so \"low affect\" that people might wrongly get the impression he was unmoved by Scott's death. After Feidin Santana's video went viral, Slager was portrayed in media accounts as having been a troubled child who'd struggled after his parents divorced when he was in his early teens. A story in the New York Times depicted him as a \"shy loner\" who had a difficult time socializing. \"They made it sound like he was some kind of weirdo, which is not true,\" his mother said. \"He had friends. He was a normal kid.\"\n\nFollowing his parents' divorce, Slager chose to spend his high school years with his father in New Jersey while his mother and two sisters remained in Florida. He was not much one for sports, nor was he a star student-he was tutored by a school superintendent his father dated (and later married and divorced). Slager gravitated to vocations that put him in uniform. He volunteered with the local rescue squad and was trained as an EMT. After graduation, he took a couple of classes at a community college and then enlisted in the Coast Guard.\n\nFor six years he was stationed at a base at Cape Canaveral, Florida. There was a policing component to the job-Slager carried a gun, and on patrol he'd occasionally board suspicious vessels or deal with drunken boaters-but his main assignment was in port. He was what the Coast Guard calls a \"fireman,\" essentially a boat mechanic. He fixed leaks and changed oil and never rose beyond the rank of E-3, the level to which recruits are elevated after they graduate from boot camp and join their first unit.\n\nRob Almond, then a petty officer at the Cape Canaveral station, was Slager's supervisor and also spent time with him socially. Slager was \"a great worker,\" Almond told me. But he added that it was unusual for a person to serve as long as Slager did without a promotion: \"Typically, the Coast Guard does not allow you to extend if you have not made petty officer in four years.\" He tried to persuade Slager to pursue the Coast Guard as a career, but \"with a promotion comes a move,\" and Almond sensed that his friend wanted to remain in Florida near his mother and sisters. In any case, Slager had a different career in mind. \"He was passionate about law enforcement,\" Almond said. \"He had his mind set.\"\n\nThe Scott family , unlike Slager's, has deep roots in the Charleston area. They've been able to trace their lineage in South Carolina back to the 1800s, though some of their kin almost certainly arrived long before that, likely landing in the 1700s at one of the islands in the harbor-spits of land, now dotted with million-dollar homes, that were once America's primary slave ports . It is estimated that as many as 400,000 Africans were transported to Charleston in the 1700s and that 40 percent of all present-day African Americans are descended from them. Walter Scott's ancestors farmed on land outside of Charleston after the Civil War; later generations moved into the city and worked as cooks and domestics. His parents operated a small business that serviced vending machines in commercial buildings. \"My father is a go-getter,\" Rodney Scott, the youngest of the three Scott brothers, told me. \"He always would say to us, 'Be career-based. If you have one job and you lose it, have the skills to fall back on something else.'\"\n\nRodney is a UPS driver, a licensed funeral director, a \"casual longshoreman\" (meaning he can get work on the docks when it's available), and a church organist. The oldest brother, Anthony, is a team leader on an assembly line at a plant that manufactures auto parts, where he has been employed for decades. He has also played the saxophone professionally. Walter, the middle child, was the unsettled one. \"He hit a lot of bumps,\" Anthony said. \"But he didn't let it depress him. He always kept it moving.\"\n\nThe Scott family, from left: Rodney, parents Judy and Walter Sr., and Anthony.\n\nJeremy M. Lange\n\nLike many African American families, the Scott clan hosts regular family reunions with their extended kin-events that usually take place over long weekends in public parks. Walter was not given the responsibility of helping to organize these reunions, but he was the one who would show up early to set up, help cook, and then stay late to pack up the folding chairs and put away the chafing dishes. Once present, he was dependable.\n\nI talked with Rodney and Anthony Scott during breaks in Slager's trial. They came to court in suits and ties most days and sat with their parents, their jaws set-you could sense their efforts to stay composed. They were forthright about their brother's flaws. Walter had a GED rather than a high school diploma. He had served only two years in the Coast Guard before his discharge. But when he lost a job, he always managed to find a new one because \"he was personable, and he was good at taking tests,\" Rodney told me. Not long before his death, Walter was fired from a well-paid warehouse job and then quickly landed similar work via a temp agency. The toxicology tests from his autopsy turned up cocaine in his system. When I asked Anthony if he was surprised by that, he paused for a moment. \"Surprised,\" he finally answered, \"but not shocked.\"\n\nThe fact that Scott was living in North Charleston worried his loved ones. He had grown up in West Ashley, a middle-class part of neighboring Charleston where his parents still live, as do his brothers and their families. Charleston is about 70 percent white , with a median income of about $55,000, slightly above the national average. North Charleston is less prosperous, with a median income just under $40,000. African Americans make up about 47 percent of the population and Hispanics another 11 percent, while half the city leaders (including the mayor) and about 80 percent of the police force are white. In that way, North Charleston is typical of hundreds of communities across America. Research produced in 2015 by the Center for Public Integrity showed similar racial imbalances , often dramatic ones, between residents and cops in 49 of the nation's 50 biggest cities.\n\nWalter Scott in his Coast Guard days.\n\nCourtesy of the Scott family\n\nRelations between North Charleston police and the city's black community have been tense for years . At the time of the shooting, the city's officers were operating under quotas Slager's lawyer called \"three and three\"-meaning they were expected to make three stops of drivers and three of pedestrians on each shift. At one point in 2015, Slager's sergeant gave him a $10 auto-parts gift certificate for making his numbers. Slager used his Taser more frequently than most of his fellow officers-at least 14 times during his first five years on the force, including twice during one 24-hour period in 2014. ( The New York Times calculated that his stun gun use that year accounted for 4 percent of all tasings by a force of 340 officers.)\n\nThe three-and-three policy was referred to within the department as \"community policing,\" a term usually associated with police efforts to get better acquainted with local residents, but few locals regarded the stops as benign. \"North Charleston has been known as a very profiled area,\" Anthony Scott told me. \"You have to drive very carefully through there and make sure everything is correct because there's always been a dynamic with the police department and black men. It's nothing to see a black man stopped and the car being searched. There's other towns around here that are the same way, where you're very careful, but North Charleston was extreme.\"\n\nWalter Scott rose early on the Saturday morning of his death to pick up a work buddy and drive to a nearby church that was giving away food as part of a federally funded program. He was having a barbecue that night, and there were bags of meat and vegetables in the back seat when Slager pulled him over. Sitting in the passenger seat was his friend Pierre Fulton, who paid little attention to the initial exchange between Slager and Scott because he was busy texting with a woman he had met at the food giveaway. Scott's brothers had to laugh when they found out how Walter had spent the first part of the morning. \"We were, like, 'Our brother was that cheap?'\" Rodney said. \"He wasn't indigent and he's going to get free food?\"\n\nThere is scant evidence that Scott was a violent man, other than one arrest for assault more than a quarter century ago. He was 5-foot-9, overweight but solidly built. He lifted weights at home. Slager, a trim 6-foot-1 and 17 years Scott's junior, would testify that he was getting the worst of a fight and had to shoot Scott because he feared for his life. The Scott family vigorously rejects this claim. Walter, they insist, was doing nothing more than trying to wriggle free from the pain of the Taser.\n\nSlager had cuts on his hands and lacerations on his knees after the encounter, fairly minor injuries for a man in a life-and-death struggle. His face was unbruised. \"Walter didn't look like he was in top physical shape, but he could handle himself,\" Rodney Scott told me. \"If he had really fought Michael Slager, you would have known it. He could've beat the living crap out of him.\"\n\nA few days before testimony began in Slager's murder trial, I made the two-hour drive from Charleston to the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy on the outskirts of the capital city of Columbia. It is a bustling place. The academy produces close to 1,200 new cops each year and sends them out to police departments across the state, with new cadets arriving every three weeks. The barrier to admission is low. Recruits must have a high school diploma or a GED, no felony convictions, no past suggestive of \"moral turpitude,\" and a good credit history. The course is now 12 weeks rather than the 9 weeks that Slager received-but it is still far short of the national average of about 18 weeks. Trainees here must score 70 out of 100 in most courses to graduate. The passing grade used to be 80, but it was lowered several years ago to ensure there would be enough new cops to meet South Carolina's needs.\n\nMaria Haberfeld, an expert in police training and the chairwoman of the Department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College in New York, was withering in her assessment when we spoke by phone. \"South Carolina has one of the worst academies in the country, and that is saying a lot because police training in general is bad,\" she said. \"Even within the context of how poorly we train, they are an embarrassment to the police profession and a danger to society.\"\n\nA report issued in March 2016 by the Police Executive Research Forum argued that misguided training -specifically, instruction that teaches officers to \"draw a line in the sand\" and resolve confrontations quickly-contributes directly to problematic shootings by police. Cops in training spend a median of 58 hours on firearms proficiency but just 8 hours learning de-escalation tactics to bring episodes to peaceful conclusions, according to PERF's research. The mechanics of firing a weapon are usually taught separately from the question of when to use it. The report called for \"integrated training that combines these related topics in scenario-based sessions. Officers should be trained to consider all of their options in realistic exercises that mirror\" what they will encounter on the street.\n\nTraining for career officers is similarly gun-centric. Cops in North Charleston and elsewhere must requalify annually at the firing range, but ongoing education in other areas is minimal for officers who are not on SWAT teams or other specialized units. Chuck Wexler is the executive director of PERF, whose membership includes top police brass from around the nation. \"You get what the training is,\" he told me. \"We're not saying you don't need the firearms training...But it's skewed toward the firearm.\"\n\nThe teaching of de-escalation is also sometimes called scenario training or stress training. The idea is to put officers in settings that feel as realistic as possible and train them to respond with a sense of calm and, most importantly, to slow things down when faced with a potentially explosive situation. This is difficult, because cops on the street sometimes act out of fear-and they often have good reason to be fearful. \"It takes time,\" Haberfeld said. \"You're changing the way a person thinks, how he deals with pressure and stress.\"\n\nThe academy campus consists of buildings and training areas scattered over a 300-acre property neighbored by a state forest, a juvenile detention facility, and an adult prison. The cadets dress in khakis and carry holstered guns. They walk from class to class in formation. Florence McCants, the academy's public information officer, gives me a tour, and we stop to observe some of the instruction. In one session, held near an outdoor driving course, the trainees take turns approaching vehicles driven by instructors posing as noncooperative subjects. One driver, stopped for running a red light, hands the cadet a lawyer's business card and bellows, \"Call him! I ain't talkin' to you. I know how y'all treat people around here.\" He won't hand over his driver's license and he refuses to get out of the car when ordered to do so. In another scenario, the instructor mimes putting a knife to his own throat and threatens to kill himself. In each case, the trainees visibly struggle. They are flummoxed and unsure of how to resolve the situation peacefully.\n\nCar stops are the bread-and-butter work of patrol officers. Most are routine, but the ones that aren't put police to the test. Some suspects turn violent. Others, like Walter Scott, run away. This is the kind of training scenario that experts believe every cop should be put through dozens or perhaps even hundreds of times, but these cadets will experience it just three or four. The irony is that the academy is funded by fines and fees, with $5 from every ticket directed toward teaching future cops. Because the number of tickets varies from one year to the next, administrators cannot easily predict how much money they will have at their disposal. \"We train what we can afford to train,\" McCants told me.\n\nI did not come away from my day at the academy with a wholly negative impression. Much of what I observed seemed thoughtful-there was just too little of it. Administrators told me that in recent years, dating back to the shooting of Michael Brown by a policeman in Ferguson, Missouri, instruction had moved more in the direction of de-escalation and away from the traditional pedagogy that police must always stay \"one level of force\" above a noncompliant suspect. The force spectrum begins with an officer's mere presence on the scene, followed by verbal commands and \"empty hand\" control (physical restraint). Next comes the deployment of pepper spray, a baton, or a Taser-and finally, if all else fails, a service weapon. Once cops resort to their guns, they are trained to aim at \"center mass,\" as Slager did, to neutralize a threat. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive, but de-escalation is intended to give officers the skills and mindset to avoid using force in the first place.\n\nBefore leaving the academy, I wanted to see the obstacle course-for a specific reason. Slager had portrayed himself as a man neither powerful enough to contend with Scott nor fit enough to keep running after him to continue the fight. His weakness was a central element of his defense. Like most police departments, North Charleston's has no mandatory fitness training. The obstacle course was the only physical test Slager had to master over the course of his law enforcement career.\n\nThe 290-yard course is laid out in a gymnasium. It includes a pair of 18-inch-high hurdles, a short set of stairs, and some obstacles a runner must hop over or duck under. A \"ditch simulation\" is a six-foot jump-one long stride-marked by lines on the floor. The course must be completed in two minutes and six seconds. The only remotely challenging task-the requirement to drag a 150-pound sack 20 feet-is made easier by a slick floor. Except for that, the course could be aced by any reasonably fit 10-year-old.\n\nOne of the first things Slager told investigators after the shooting was, \"I'm not a real strong guy.\" And though no one wants police officers who are quick to resort to physical force, Slager may indeed have been too soft for the job-a patrolman who was assertive about stopping people but whose self-image of weakness led him to reach too quickly for his Taser, and ultimately his gun.\n\nAlso read: \"Are You Prepared to Kill Somebody?\" Meet one of America's leading police trainers.\n\nVanish Films\n\nThere are about 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the United States, and they have no standard set of procedures for handling noncompliant suspects. To give but one example, the New York City Police Department barred its officers from shooting at moving vehicles back in 1972, except in cases where the driver or passengers posed a deadly threat. The result was an immediate and sharp decrease in officer-involved shootings-a 33 percent drop the very next year. Yet more than four decades later, many departments still have no formal policy against firing at vehicles, despite the obvious dangers. (In November 2015, police in Marksville, Louisiana, fired on the car of a fleeing suspect , killing his six-year-old son.)\n\nDecisions about when to pursue a suspect on foot are almost always left to the officer's discretion, and many cops have a hard time resisting. When a suspect runs, \"the tendency is to chase,\" Wexler said. \"There's a sense that this person must be wanted for something more serious. Why is he running from me?\"\n\nSlager had Scott's ID and his car. He could have waited for backup before he gave chase, or pursued Scott but kept his distance until help arrived. Instead, his actions were guided by his gut, and perhaps informed by the aggressive culture of his workplace. The North Charleston Police Department has no formal policy on when to chase a suspect or whether an officer should do so without backup. At the trial, Slager's attorney asked one of his commanding officers, Lieutenant Walter Humphries, why Slager could not just have let Scott go and figured out a way to arrest him later. \"I suppose that's always an option, but I'd prefer not to have that officer working for me,\" he said. Asked whether the North Charleston police had ever undergone de-escalation training, Humphries replied, \"Within the last year or so, there's been a short video [we were] mandated to watch.\"\n\nIn January, the Department of Justice issued a report on the improper use of force by police in Chicago, but portions of it could just as well have applied to the Slager case. \"We found that officers engage in tactically unsound and unnecessary foot pursuits, and that these foot pursuits too often end with officers unreasonably shooting someone-including unarmed individuals,\" the report said. The chases are \"inherently dangerous and present substantial risks to officers and the public. Officers may experience fatigue or an adrenaline rush that compromises their ability to control a suspect they capture, to fire their weapons accurately, and even to make sound judgments.\"\n\nMichael Slager's trial began on Halloween day at the Charleston County Courthouse. The building is situated at an intersection known as the Four Corners of Law-the other corners are occupied by a historic Episcopal church, a federal courthouse, and City Hall.\n\nHe was represented by Andy Savage, a silver-haired, 69-year-old defense attorney who commands deep respect around Charleston. Savage has defended accused Islamic terrorists along with the usual run of murder and drug suspects. He also represents several of the families whose loved ones were slain by Dylann Roof, who was convicted and sentenced to death in January. Savage took Slager's case pro bono, he said, because he was incensed that the first lawyer had quit on him. (\"I'm not a priest. I'm not a rabbi. I'm a lawyer,\" he told the Washington Post .) He hasn't bothered to tally the hours he and other members of his firm have put into Slager's defense. If he had billed his client, Savage told me, the total would have come to well over $1 million.\n\nIt took just three days for a jury to be seated , and 11 of its 12 members were white-92 percent. Charleston County, from which the jury pool was drawn, is less than 70 percent white. Of the last 75 potential jurors remaining from a larger pool , 16 were black, and Savage used his peremptory challenges to dismiss five of them, along with two Hispanics. A 1968 Supreme Court ruling, Batson v. Kentucky , prohibits the striking of jurors based on their ethnicity, but the rule is easy to circumvent. Savage, responding to objections from the prosecution, gave other reasons for eliminating the minority jurors-one had a poor grasp of English, he said, and another had expressed anti-gun sentiments. When the case is retried, \"you could literally end up with a jury that looks exactly the same way,\" says Chris Stewart, a civil rights lawyer who represents the Scott family. \"The defense will use most of their strikes on minorities. There's no way to stop it.\"\n\nAndy Savage, Slager's attorney\n\nJeremy M. Lange\n\nProsecutor Scarlett Wilson acknowledged in her opening statement that Scott bore at least some responsibility for what happened. \"If Walter Scott had stayed in that car, he wouldn't have been shot,\" she said. \"If Walter Scott hadn't resisted arrest he wouldn't have been shot...He lost his life for his foolishness.\" She proceeded to call dozens of witnesses, including Santana, the only one who had seen the chase and the scuffle. And she replayed Santana's video, as powerful a piece of evidence as a prosecutor could hope for, at least a dozen times for the jury. Most court-watchers felt that Wilson did a competent job, but the room belonged to Savage. He managed to cast doubt on what Santana had observed prior to the start of the video, suggesting that the witness was too far away to see Scott pummel his client. Savage's investigators also unearthed song lyrics Santana had written that seemed anti-police and used those to try to discredit him.\n\nThe case was investigated on the prosecution side by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, whose agents had interviewed Slager after the shooting. Savage cross-examined them mercilessly: Why had they not found the bullets that missed Scott? Did they see the hole in a wooden fence that a bullet had made? Did they realize bullets were later found with a metal detector made by the toy company Fisher-Price? They hadn't initially taken custody of Slager's duty belt and boots to do forensic tests-why? The Taser was not comprehensively analyzed for DNA-had it been, couldn't that have proved that Scott had taken control of it?\n\nIt did, in fact, seem like the investigators had done a shoddy job at the scene, probably because they had assumed it was a good shooting, not a murder case. There were moments when Savage got on such a roll as he cross-examined the state's witnesses that I wondered why the prosecution did not object, if only to break his momentum.\n\nA native New Yorker, Savage has spent most of his adult life in South Carolina and now speaks in a quiet rasp with long pauses for effect, like a Southern-inflected Garrison Keillor. In a courthouse corridor one afternoon during a break in the trial, Savage turned to me: \"It's more than about the video, right?\" He was asking whether he'd been effective in constructing an alternate narrative and steering the jury away from the state's most damning evidence. I said yes, I thought he had.\n\nAlso read: \"None of Us Is Entirely Innocent\": A Timeline of Police Violence and Backlash.\n\nErik McGregor/Zuma; Cary Edmondson/Reuters; Kevin Terrell/AP\n\nSlager wore the same dark suit every day of the five-week trial. He sat at the defense table next to Savage's wife, Cheryl, who manages her husband's trial documents. Slager's wife and parents sat on the benches behind them, often joined by his sisters. In the same row, behind the prosecution table, sat Scott's family-parents, brothers, sisters-in-law, and sometimes Walter's adult children. Both families dressed as if for church. It was chilly in the courtroom, and Walter's mother-\"Miss Judy,\" as she is called-often wore a shawl. Several times when the video of the shooting was played, she buried her head on her husband's shoulder and didn't watch.\n\nThe Black and White Views of Charleston's Racially Charged Murder Trials\n\nIn Charleston, the threads of gentility and brutality run side by side. Gracious architecture and new Southern cooking exist in parallel with the city's history as a slavery hub. The courtroom was the city in microcosm, divided but at all times civil. Members of the Scott and Slager families greeted each other politely. \"I see his mama in the hallway,\" Rodney Scott told me. \"I say hello. I don't hate her. I don't even have hate for Michael Slager. He made a bad decision. Why didn't he stop? Just stand up and say it: 'I shot him for no reason.'\"\n\nA defendant does not have to testify on his own behalf, and many do not, but Slager took the stand during the fifth week of his trial, shortly after Thanksgiving. His testimony was oddly anticlimactic because his lawyer had already spooled out his story. He was soft. He was afraid. \"Speak up a little,\" Savage beckoned as he began his questioning. Slager explained that he had planned only to issue Scott a warning about the brake light. He didn't know why Scott ran, but it never occurred to him not to give chase. He felt in danger as soon as the physical confrontation began. \"At that point, I knew Mr. Scott was a lot stronger than me. I knew I was going to lose the fight.\"\n\n\"In my mind,\" he said, \"it was total fear.\" Scott had grabbed his Taser, he insisted. (In the video, Scott is seen running away from Slager, without the Taser.) \"I pulled my firearm and I pulled the trigger,\" Slager testified. \"I fired until the threat was stopped, like I'm trained to do.\"\n\nThe cross-examination of Slager was surprisingly short. The whole trial had focused on his actions, but assistant prosecutor Bruce DuRant questioned him for no more than 90 minutes, zeroing in on the numerous elements of his initial comments to investigators that did not square with the video. Slager responded that there were many things he didn't remember from that day, including retrieving the Taser and dropping it next to Scott's body-which the prosecution called \"staging the scene.\" The adrenaline from the fight and the trauma of the shooting had impaired his recollections: \"My mind,\" he said, \"was like spaghetti.\"\n\nRoughly 1,000 civilians were shot and killed by on-duty police officers in each of the past two years, according to data compiled by the Washington Post and Philip Stinson, a criminologist at Ohio's Bowling Green State University. The majority had a gun or a knife, but plenty were unarmed. Since 2005, 79 officers have been charged with murder or manslaughter as a result of such shootings, and 27 have been convicted, either by a guilty plea or a jury trial-22 cases are still pending. The convicted officers received an average of just under four years behind bars, Stinson says, although some have gotten as little as a few weeks. Only one officer has been convicted of intentional murder: a Colorado cop who followed an unarmed man into the man's home, shot him in the back while his mother watched, and then pepper-sprayed him. That officer received a 16-year sentence.\n\nThe Slager trial was an example, one among many, of how poorly the legal system functions as a remedy or a deterrent for bad police shootings, which some law enforcement professionals now refer to as \"lawful but awful.\" The term acknowledges the gap between an avoidable and tragic loss of life and what it takes to convince a jury of 12 citizens to convict a police officer. Stinson, a former cop himself, made his mark in academia by demonstrating how much officers can get away with before they are charged, let alone convicted. \"I don't get surprised by much, but that video took my breath away,\" he told me, referring to the Slager footage. \"If there was a case you would have expected a conviction, it would have been this one.\"\n\nThe November election fell on the seventh day of the trial. By the time the proceedings were over, Donald Trump was America's president-to-be. Andy Savage told me he is \"center-left\" politically, but his closing argument to a jury dominated by white South Carolinians had a distinctly Trumpian edge. \"It's true. Michael Slager is a white man. Mr. Scott is African American,\" Savage told them. But the media was pushing a \"false narrative.\" His client had unfairly become a \"poster boy\" for unjust police shootings. He urged the jury to \"tell the state of South Carolina, tell the media they have to do their job\" by finding Slager not guilty.\n\nA note passed from the jury to the judge during the deliberations seemed to indicate there was just one juror who would not vote to convict, a lone holdout, but the jury foreman and another juror said in interviews later that as many as six jurors were not yet willing to find Slager guilty. The Scott family wanted justice, which to them meant a conviction, but they were not naïve enough to count on one. \"He flat-out lied. He sat on the stand and lied. The whole world knows he lied,\" said Rodney Scott.\n\nOne day toward the end of the trial, I ate lunch with Rodney at a restaurant near the courthouse. \"When I drive for UPS, if I see a dog in the street I slam the brakes on,\" he told me. \"I don't want to kill a dog. I don't want to kill a squirrel. I don't want to kill a possum. How in the world do you shoot [at] him eight times?\"\n\nHe still couldn't get over Slager's ineptness. \"I don't know what was in my brother's mind,\" he said. \"But you've got his car, his license. You would have had him in 10 minutes. I sit there and I look at him and wonder, 'Why did you do that? Your family is hurting. My family is hurting. All you had to do was walk away.'\" ________\n\nThis story was updated to reflect Slager's guilty plea.

      "text": "What Does It Take to Convict a Cop?\n\nMichael Sokolove Mar/Apr 2017 Issue\n\nJeremy M. Lange\n\nWalter Scott's cellphone bill was current. In that small but not unimportant aspect of life, he was on solid ground. He had checked in with his elderly parents, called and texted friends. At 50 years old, Scott was a forklift driver, a dominoes aficionado, an extrovert with a buttery voice who sang soul music at social gatherings and spirituals in church. As a young man he'd served in the Coast Guard, but he was discharged after testing positive for marijuana. He drifted between jobs, earned a two-year degree at a technical college, and performed the national anthem at his commencement ceremony. He had four children from two past relationships and was chronically behind on support payments.\n\nOn the morning of April 4, 2015, Scott was driving a 1991 Mercedes sedan that he had agreed to purchase from a neighbor, though the paperwork had not yet been squared away. He had a friend with him. He was less than a mile from the home he shared with his girlfriend in North Charleston, South Carolina-genteel Charleston's poor cousin, a city of roughly 108,000 people that is bisected by railroad tracks and dotted with pawn shops and payday loan outlets. In parts of North Charleston, it seems like just about anything of value-tire superstores, small industrial sites, even residences-is protected by high cyclone fences and barbed wire.\n\nPolice Shootings Won't Stop Unless We Also Stop Shaking Down Black People\n\nAt about 9:30 a.m., a police cruiser pulled up behind Scott, lights flashing. Scott made an immediate left turn, then came to a stop in the parking lot of an auto-parts store and watched through the rearview mirror as an officer, dressed in shirt sleeves on that warm spring day, walked toward him. Patrolman Michael Slager, then 33, had his hands at his hips, his right one close to his gun. Also a Coast Guard veteran, and in his fifth year on the force, Slager had moved from out of state to a place where he had no history and few associations. He was an armed white man hired to police unfamiliar black streets. He had gone through nine weeks of training at the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy-nine, as opposed to the 26 weeks required for a New York City cop. Officers in Europe are typically trained for a year or more.\n\n\"The reason for the stop is your third brake light's out,\" Slager said through the driver's side window. It was the classic DWB (driving while black) rationale for a stop, but Scott knew he had a bigger problem. He was $18,104 in arrears on child support and there was a warrant out for his arrest. Scott had been to jail in the past for failure to pay support. It had cost him jobs and made his debt ever larger and harder to manage. He handed over his license and told Slager he planned to complete the purchase of the car in a couple of days. The interaction was entirely respectful. Scott said he had no registration or insurance card with him. \"I'm sorry about that,\" he said.\n\n\"Okay, but you're buying the car?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nThe officer returned to his cruiser intending to run Scott's license through an FBI database, standard procedure. Scott stepped out of his vehicle and then climbed back in when Slager, sitting in his squad car, instructed him to do so. But moments later, Scott got out a second time and ran toward an open field, the site of an abandoned trailer park, and onto a painted asphalt path known locally as the Yellow Brick Road. Slager pursued on foot, warning that he was preparing to fire his stun gun: \"Taser! Taser! Taser!\" Scott didn't stop, so Slager hit him with two darts.\n\nThe electricity brought Scott to his knees, but he refused to surrender. Slager then \"drive-stunned\" Scott-put the business end of the Taser directly on him and pulled the trigger-but could not cuff him. The men scuffled on the ground, and a winded Slager pleaded for backup. \"One-five-six,\" he said into his radio, calling out the badge number of the officer he knew was closest. \"Step it up!\"\n\nScott managed to break free and run away in a slow, wobbly gait. This time Slager did not give chase . He unholstered his .45-caliber Glock, took a stance, and put his left hand underneath to steady the weapon. His form was perfect, like in a training video. The only problem was that his gun was aimed at the back of a fleeing man. He squeezed off eight quick shots.\n\nOne round grazed Scott's ear, and four more-hollow-point bullets that expand after impact-ripped into his flesh. One of the bullets entered from the right side of Scott's back, went through his heart, and lodged just beneath his left nipple, causing massive internal bleeding. Scott fell by the side of a tree and Slager walked 20 or so unhurried steps until he reached the body, at which point he arranged Scott's arms behind his back and handcuffed a dead or dying man.\n\nFrom the other side of a fence line, Feidin Santana, a 23-year-old barber and Dominican immigrant who was walking to work, witnessed the chase and began recording on his phone just as Scott broke away from Slager. Of all the police shootings that had been captured by citizens, this one was the most shocking. To many observers, it was unambiguous: An unarmed black man runs. A white cop coldly takes aim, shoots him multiple times in the back, and then appears to plant evidence-the Taser, which Slager had retrieved from where they had scuffled-beside the body.\n\n\"I don't get surprised by much,\" says criminologist Philip Stinson, \"but that video took my breath away.\"\n\nIt is customary for police to close ranks around a colleague who is involved in a questionable shooting, but the emergence of Santana's video three days after the incident made Slager a pariah. North Charleston's police chief declared himself \"sickened.\" Slager was fired and charged with murder-a rarity. His first lawyer quit and his union refused to pay for his defense. The city reached a swift civil settlement with Walter Scott's family and paid out $6.5 million without even being sued. Initially denied bail, Slager spent months in solitary confinement-some of that time in a cell next to Dylann Roof , who murdered nine black parishioners at Charleston's Mother Emanuel Church two months after Scott's death.\n\nIt seemed as though the whole episode might finally answer the question: What does it take to convict a cop of murder? In early December, however, a jury of 12 citizens said it was unable to reach a consensus about Slager's guilt or innocence-even on a lesser charge of manslaughter. The judge declared a mistrial, and a new trial date was set for the end of August. But in a surprise development in early May, Slager pleaded guilty to separate federal charges related to the shooting. As part of the plea deal, the state charges will be dropped. Sentencing will take place at a date to be determined. In theory, Slager could face life in prison. In reality, he is likely to get far less.\n\nIt was clear, based on courtroom testimony as well as interviews with police trainers and other experts, that Slager had made a series of catastrophic decisions-not just in shooting Scott, but before he ever reached for his weapon. The slaying, its aftermath, and the trial itself would amount to an indictment of his inferior training and of questionable police policies in North Charleston. Several fellow officers, supervisors included, would insist that Slager had done what he was supposed to. He chased a \"bad guy,\" as one North Charleston cop put it, because that's what police do. He followed his department's procedures, and where there were none to guide him, he was led by his own flawed instincts.\n\nEach of the contested police shootings of black men we've witnessed in recent years has been a collision of two lives, two life histories. In most cases, they are first and final meetings of two men who would seem to have no other point of intersection. What transpires between them can seem like an accident of fate-wrong place, wrong time-predestined by racial bias and sealed by video footage.\n\nA few months before he shot Walter Scott, Michael Slager had moved to the day shift after several years of working overnight. He sought the change because his wife, Jamie, was pregnant with their first child. She had a son and a daughter from a previous marriage who lived with them and were home-schooled. Slager spent most of his off-hours with his family-going to movies and the mall and attending outdoor events and festivals in Charleston. He liked watching TV comedies and texted his favorite lines to one of his two younger sisters, Madeline Cosenzo. Slager patrolled a sector known as Charleston Farms, the city's highest-crime area, and his job consisted of driving the same rectangular three-minute loop over and over, 10 hours at a stretch. He told his family he liked the work but emphasized that it was dangerous.\n\nMichael Slager\n\nJeremy M. Lange\n\nSlager was making about $44,000 a year and money was tight-the couple had to take out a loan for Jamie's fertility treatments-but he could look forward to a reasonable degree of economic stability. Being a cop is one of the last careers left in America in which a person without a college degree can have job security and robust benefits-good health insurance, paid sick and vacation days, a dedicated pension. Slager drove a department-issued vehicle-a \"take-home car,\" as the perk is known-which he was allowed to use while off duty. His salary would have eventually reached about $54,000 a year, or more if he rose in rank. It was work that couldn't be shipped overseas or done by a robot, and a North Charleston cop could make extra money doing private-security gigs. Slager might have retired in his mid-50s, young enough to get another job, and collected pension payments worth more than half his peak salary. He was dutiful, competent, thoroughly average. \"He was a very sweet child. He was good. He obeyed,\" his mother, Karen Sharpe, told me. \"Mike is a person who is very by the book,\" his sister said. \"He always liked that structure of things.\"\n\nSlager had a way of moving through life without leaving a strong impression, good or bad. In the lead-up to the trial, his lawyer, Andrew Savage III, considered making him available for interviews but worried he was so \"low affect\" that people might wrongly get the impression he was unmoved by Scott's death. After Feidin Santana's video went viral, Slager was portrayed in media accounts as having been a troubled child who'd struggled after his parents divorced when he was in his early teens. A story in the New York Times depicted him as a \"shy loner\" who had a difficult time socializing. \"They made it sound like he was some kind of weirdo, which is not true,\" his mother said. \"He had friends. He was a normal kid.\"\n\nFollowing his parents' divorce, Slager chose to spend his high school years with his father in New Jersey while his mother and two sisters remained in Florida. He was not much one for sports, nor was he a star student-he was tutored by a school superintendent his father dated (and later married and divorced). Slager gravitated to vocations that put him in uniform. He volunteered with the local rescue squad and was trained as an EMT. After graduation, he took a couple of classes at a community college and then enlisted in the Coast Guard.\n\nFor six years he was stationed at a base at Cape Canaveral, Florida. There was a policing component to the job-Slager carried a gun, and on patrol he'd occasionally board suspicious vessels or deal with drunken boaters-but his main assignment was in port. He was what the Coast Guard calls a \"fireman,\" essentially a boat mechanic. He fixed leaks and changed oil and never rose beyond the rank of E-3, the level to which recruits are elevated after they graduate from boot camp and join their first unit.\n\nRob Almond, then a petty officer at the Cape Canaveral station, was Slager's supervisor and also spent time with him socially. Slager was \"a great worker,\" Almond told me. But he added that it was unusual for a person to serve as long as Slager did without a promotion: \"Typically, the Coast Guard does not allow you to extend if you have not made petty officer in four years.\" He tried to persuade Slager to pursue the Coast Guard as a career, but \"with a promotion comes a move,\" and Almond sensed that his friend wanted to remain in Florida near his mother and sisters. In any case, Slager had a different career in mind. \"He was passionate about law enforcement,\" Almond said. \"He had his mind set.\"\n\nThe Scott family , unlike Slager's, has deep roots in the Charleston area. They've been able to trace their lineage in South Carolina back to the 1800s, though some of their kin almost certainly arrived long before that, likely landing in the 1700s at one of the islands in the harbor-spits of land, now dotted with million-dollar homes, that were once America's primary slave ports . It is estimated that as many as 400,000 Africans were transported to Charleston in the 1700s and that 40 percent of all present-day African Americans are descended from them. Walter Scott's ancestors farmed on land outside of Charleston after the Civil War; later generations moved into the city and worked as cooks and domestics. His parents operated a small business that serviced vending machines in commercial buildings. \"My father is a go-getter,\" Rodney Scott, the youngest of the three Scott brothers, told me. \"He always would say to us, 'Be career-based. If you have one job and you lose it, have the skills to fall back on something else.'\"\n\nRodney is a UPS driver, a licensed funeral director, a \"casual longshoreman\" (meaning he can get work on the docks when it's available), and a church organist. The oldest brother, Anthony, is a team leader on an assembly line at a plant that manufactures auto parts, where he has been employed for decades. He has also played the saxophone professionally. Walter, the middle child, was the unsettled one. \"He hit a lot of bumps,\" Anthony said. \"But he didn't let it depress him. He always kept it moving.\"\n\nThe Scott family, from left: Rodney, parents Judy and Walter Sr., and Anthony.\n\nJeremy M. Lange\n\nLike many African American families, the Scott clan hosts regular family reunions with their extended kin-events that usually take place over long weekends in public parks. Walter was not given the responsibility of helping to organize these reunions, but he was the one who would show up early to set up, help cook, and then stay late to pack up the folding chairs and put away the chafing dishes. Once present, he was dependable.\n\nI talked with Rodney and Anthony Scott during breaks in Slager's trial. They came to court in suits and ties most days and sat with their parents, their jaws set-you could sense their efforts to stay composed. They were forthright about their brother's flaws. Walter had a GED rather than a high school diploma. He had served only two years in the Coast Guard before his discharge. But when he lost a job, he always managed to find a new one because \"he was personable, and he was good at taking tests,\" Rodney told me. Not long before his death, Walter was fired from a well-paid warehouse job and then quickly landed similar work via a temp agency. The toxicology tests from his autopsy turned up cocaine in his system. When I asked Anthony if he was surprised by that, he paused for a moment. \"Surprised,\" he finally answered, \"but not shocked.\"\n\nThe fact that Scott was living in North Charleston worried his loved ones. He had grown up in West Ashley, a middle-class part of neighboring Charleston where his parents still live, as do his brothers and their families. Charleston is about 70 percent white , with a median income of about $55,000, slightly above the national average. North Charleston is less prosperous, with a median income just under $40,000. African Americans make up about 47 percent of the population and Hispanics another 11 percent, while half the city leaders (including the mayor) and about 80 percent of the police force are white. In that way, North Charleston is typical of hundreds of communities across America. Research produced in 2015 by the Center for Public Integrity showed similar racial imbalances , often dramatic ones, between residents and cops in 49 of the nation's 50 biggest cities.\n\nWalter Scott in his Coast Guard days.\n\nCourtesy of the Scott family\n\nRelations between North Charleston police and the city's black community have been tense for years . At the time of the shooting, the city's officers were operating under quotas Slager's lawyer called \"three and three\"-meaning they were expected to make three stops of drivers and three of pedestrians on each shift. At one point in 2015, Slager's sergeant gave him a $10 auto-parts gift certificate for making his numbers. Slager used his Taser more frequently than most of his fellow officers-at least 14 times during his first five years on the force, including twice during one 24-hour period in 2014. ( The New York Times calculated that his stun gun use that year accounted for 4 percent of all tasings by a force of 340 officers.)\n\nThe three-and-three policy was referred to within the department as \"community policing,\" a term usually associated with police efforts to get better acquainted with local residents, but few locals regarded the stops as benign. \"North Charleston has been known as a very profiled area,\" Anthony Scott told me. \"You have to drive very carefully through there and make sure everything is correct because there's always been a dynamic with the police department and black men. It's nothing to see a black man stopped and the car being searched. There's other towns around here that are the same way, where you're very careful, but North Charleston was extreme.\"\n\nWalter Scott rose early on the Saturday morning of his death to pick up a work buddy and drive to a nearby church that was giving away food as part of a federally funded program. He was having a barbecue that night, and there were bags of meat and vegetables in the back seat when Slager pulled him over. Sitting in the passenger seat was his friend Pierre Fulton, who paid little attention to the initial exchange between Slager and Scott because he was busy texting with a woman he had met at the food giveaway. Scott's brothers had to laugh when they found out how Walter had spent the first part of the morning. \"We were, like, 'Our brother was that cheap?'\" Rodney said. \"He wasn't indigent and he's going to get free food?\"\n\nThere is scant evidence that Scott was a violent man, other than one arrest for assault more than a quarter century ago. He was 5-foot-9, overweight but solidly built. He lifted weights at home. Slager, a trim 6-foot-1 and 17 years Scott's junior, would testify that he was getting the worst of a fight and had to shoot Scott because he feared for his life. The Scott family vigorously rejects this claim. Walter, they insist, was doing nothing more than trying to wriggle free from the pain of the Taser.\n\nSlager had cuts on his hands and lacerations on his knees after the encounter, fairly minor injuries for a man in a life-and-death struggle. His face was unbruised. \"Walter didn't look like he was in top physical shape, but he could handle himself,\" Rodney Scott told me. \"If he had really fought Michael Slager, you would have known it. He could've beat the living crap out of him.\"\n\nA few days before testimony began in Slager's murder trial, I made the two-hour drive from Charleston to the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy on the outskirts of the capital city of Columbia. It is a bustling place. The academy produces close to 1,200 new cops each year and sends them out to police departments across the state, with new cadets arriving every three weeks. The barrier to admission is low. Recruits must have a high school diploma or a GED, no felony convictions, no past suggestive of \"moral turpitude,\" and a good credit history. The course is now 12 weeks rather than the 9 weeks that Slager received-but it is still far short of the national average of about 18 weeks. Trainees here must score 70 out of 100 in most courses to graduate. The passing grade used to be 80, but it was lowered several years ago to ensure there would be enough new cops to meet South Carolina's needs.\n\nMaria Haberfeld, an expert in police training and the chairwoman of the Department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College in New York, was withering in her assessment when we spoke by phone. \"South Carolina has one of the worst academies in the country, and that is saying a lot because police training in general is bad,\" she said. \"Even within the context of how poorly we train, they are an embarrassment to the police profession and a danger to society.\"\n\nA report issued in March 2016 by the Police Executive Research Forum argued that misguided training -specifically, instruction that teaches officers to \"draw a line in the sand\" and resolve confrontations quickly-contributes directly to problematic shootings by police. Cops in training spend a median of 58 hours on firearms proficiency but just 8 hours learning de-escalation tactics to bring episodes to peaceful conclusions, according to PERF's research. The mechanics of firing a weapon are usually taught separately from the question of when to use it. The report called for \"integrated training that combines these related topics in scenario-based sessions. Officers should be trained to consider all of their options in realistic exercises that mirror\" what they will encounter on the street.\n\nTraining for career officers is similarly gun-centric. Cops in North Charleston and elsewhere must requalify annually at the firing range, but ongoing education in other areas is minimal for officers who are not on SWAT teams or other specialized units. Chuck Wexler is the executive director of PERF, whose membership includes top police brass from around the nation. \"You get what the training is,\" he told me. \"We're not saying you don't need the firearms training...But it's skewed toward the firearm.\"\n\nThe teaching of de-escalation is also sometimes called scenario training or stress training. The idea is to put officers in settings that feel as realistic as possible and train them to respond with a sense of calm and, most importantly, to slow things down when faced with a potentially explosive situation. This is difficult, because cops on the street sometimes act out of fear-and they often have good reason to be fearful. \"It takes time,\" Haberfeld said. \"You're changing the way a person thinks, how he deals with pressure and stress.\"\n\nThe academy campus consists of buildings and training areas scattered over a 300-acre property neighbored by a state forest, a juvenile detention facility, and an adult prison. The cadets dress in khakis and carry holstered guns. They walk from class to class in formation. Florence McCants, the academy's public information officer, gives me a tour, and we stop to observe some of the instruction. In one session, held near an outdoor driving course, the trainees take turns approaching vehicles driven by instructors posing as noncooperative subjects. One driver, stopped for running a red light, hands the cadet a lawyer's business card and bellows, \"Call him! I ain't talkin' to you. I know how y'all treat people around here.\" He won't hand over his driver's license and he refuses to get out of the car when ordered to do so. In another scenario, the instructor mimes putting a knife to his own throat and threatens to kill himself. In each case, the trainees visibly struggle. They are flummoxed and unsure of how to resolve the situation peacefully.\n\nCar stops are the bread-and-butter work of patrol officers. Most are routine, but the ones that aren't put police to the test. Some suspects turn violent. Others, like Walter Scott, run away. This is the kind of training scenario that experts believe every cop should be put through dozens or perhaps even hundreds of times, but these cadets will experience it just three or four. The irony is that the academy is funded by fines and fees, with $5 from every ticket directed toward teaching future cops. Because the number of tickets varies from one year to the next, administrators cannot easily predict how much money they will have at their disposal. \"We train what we can afford to train,\" McCants told me.\n\nI did not come away from my day at the academy with a wholly negative impression. Much of what I observed seemed thoughtful-there was just too little of it. Administrators told me that in recent years, dating back to the shooting of Michael Brown by a policeman in Ferguson, Missouri, instruction had moved more in the direction of de-escalation and away from the traditional pedagogy that police must always stay \"one level of force\" above a noncompliant suspect. The force spectrum begins with an officer's mere presence on the scene, followed by verbal commands and \"empty hand\" control (physical restraint). Next comes the deployment of pepper spray, a baton, or a Taser-and finally, if all else fails, a service weapon. Once cops resort to their guns, they are trained to aim at \"center mass,\" as Slager did, to neutralize a threat. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive, but de-escalation is intended to give officers the skills and mindset to avoid using force in the first place.\n\nBefore leaving the academy, I wanted to see the obstacle course-for a specific reason. Slager had portrayed himself as a man neither powerful enough to contend with Scott nor fit enough to keep running after him to continue the fight. His weakness was a central element of his defense. Like most police departments, North Charleston's has no mandatory fitness training. The obstacle course was the only physical test Slager had to master over the course of his law enforcement career.\n\nThe 290-yard course is laid out in a gymnasium. It includes a pair of 18-inch-high hurdles, a short set of stairs, and some obstacles a runner must hop over or duck under. A \"ditch simulation\" is a six-foot jump-one long stride-marked by lines on the floor. The course must be completed in two minutes and six seconds. The only remotely challenging task-the requirement to drag a 150-pound sack 20 feet-is made easier by a slick floor. Except for that, the course could be aced by any reasonably fit 10-year-old.\n\nOne of the first things Slager told investigators after the shooting was, \"I'm not a real strong guy.\" And though no one wants police officers who are quick to resort to physical force, Slager may indeed have been too soft for the job-a patrolman who was assertive about stopping people but whose self-image of weakness led him to reach too quickly for his Taser, and ultimately his gun.\n\nAlso read: \"Are You Prepared to Kill Somebody?\" Meet one of America's leading police trainers.\n\nVanish Films\n\nThere are about 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the United States, and they have no standard set of procedures for handling noncompliant suspects. To give but one example, the New York City Police Department barred its officers from shooting at moving vehicles back in 1972, except in cases where the driver or passengers posed a deadly threat. The result was an immediate and sharp decrease in officer-involved shootings-a 33 percent drop the very next year. Yet more than four decades later, many departments still have no formal policy against firing at vehicles, despite the obvious dangers. (In November 2015, police in Marksville, Louisiana, fired on the car of a fleeing suspect , killing his six-year-old son.)\n\nDecisions about when to pursue a suspect on foot are almost always left to the officer's discretion, and many cops have a hard time resisting. When a suspect runs, \"the tendency is to chase,\" Wexler said. \"There's a sense that this person must be wanted for something more serious. Why is he running from me?\"\n\nSlager had Scott's ID and his car. He could have waited for backup before he gave chase, or pursued Scott but kept his distance until help arrived. Instead, his actions were guided by his gut, and perhaps informed by the aggressive culture of his workplace. The North Charleston Police Department has no formal policy on when to chase a suspect or whether an officer should do so without backup. At the trial, Slager's attorney asked one of his commanding officers, Lieutenant Walter Humphries, why Slager could not just have let Scott go and figured out a way to arrest him later. \"I suppose that's always an option, but I'd prefer not to have that officer working for me,\" he said. Asked whether the North Charleston police had ever undergone de-escalation training, Humphries replied, \"Within the last year or so, there's been a short video [we were] mandated to watch.\"\n\nIn January, the Department of Justice issued a report on the improper use of force by police in Chicago, but portions of it could just as well have applied to the Slager case. \"We found that officers engage in tactically unsound and unnecessary foot pursuits, and that these foot pursuits too often end with officers unreasonably shooting someone-including unarmed individuals,\" the report said. The chases are \"inherently dangerous and present substantial risks to officers and the public. Officers may experience fatigue or an adrenaline rush that compromises their ability to control a suspect they capture, to fire their weapons accurately, and even to make sound judgments.\"\n\nMichael Slager's trial began on Halloween day at the Charleston County Courthouse. The building is situated at an intersection known as the Four Corners of Law-the other corners are occupied by a historic Episcopal church, a federal courthouse, and City Hall.\n\nHe was represented by Andy Savage, a silver-haired, 69-year-old defense attorney who commands deep respect around Charleston. Savage has defended accused Islamic terrorists along with the usual run of murder and drug suspects. He also represents several of the families whose loved ones were slain by Dylann Roof, who was convicted and sentenced to death in January. Savage took Slager's case pro bono, he said, because he was incensed that the first lawyer had quit on him. (\"I'm not a priest. I'm not a rabbi. I'm a lawyer,\" he told the Washington Post .) He hasn't bothered to tally the hours he and other members of his firm have put into Slager's defense. If he had billed his client, Savage told me, the total would have come to well over $1 million.\n\nIt took just three days for a jury to be seated , and 11 of its 12 members were white-92 percent. Charleston County, from which the jury pool was drawn, is less than 70 percent white. Of the last 75 potential jurors remaining from a larger pool , 16 were black, and Savage used his peremptory challenges to dismiss five of them, along with two Hispanics. A 1968 Supreme Court ruling, Batson v. Kentucky , prohibits the striking of jurors based on their ethnicity, but the rule is easy to circumvent. Savage, responding to objections from the prosecution, gave other reasons for eliminating the minority jurors-one had a poor grasp of English, he said, and another had expressed anti-gun sentiments. When the case is retried, \"you could literally end up with a jury that looks exactly the same way,\" says Chris Stewart, a civil rights lawyer who represents the Scott family. \"The defense will use most of their strikes on minorities. There's no way to stop it.\"\n\nAndy Savage, Slager's attorney\n\nJeremy M. Lange\n\nProsecutor Scarlett Wilson acknowledged in her opening statement that Scott bore at least some responsibility for what happened. \"If Walter Scott had stayed in that car, he wouldn't have been shot,\" she said. \"If Walter Scott hadn't resisted arrest he wouldn't have been shot...He lost his life for his foolishness.\" She proceeded to call dozens of witnesses, including Santana, the only one who had seen the chase and the scuffle. And she replayed Santana's video, as powerful a piece of evidence as a prosecutor could hope for, at least a dozen times for the jury. Most court-watchers felt that Wilson did a competent job, but the room belonged to Savage. He managed to cast doubt on what Santana had observed prior to the start of the video, suggesting that the witness was too far away to see Scott pummel his client. Savage's investigators also unearthed song lyrics Santana had written that seemed anti-police and used those to try to discredit him.\n\nThe case was investigated on the prosecution side by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, whose agents had interviewed Slager after the shooting. Savage cross-examined them mercilessly: Why had they not found the bullets that missed Scott? Did they see the hole in a wooden fence that a bullet had made? Did they realize bullets were later found with a metal detector made by the toy company Fisher-Price? They hadn't initially taken custody of Slager's duty belt and boots to do forensic tests-why? The Taser was not comprehensively analyzed for DNA-had it been, couldn't that have proved that Scott had taken control of it?\n\nIt did, in fact, seem like the investigators had done a shoddy job at the scene, probably because they had assumed it was a good shooting, not a murder case. There were moments when Savage got on such a roll as he cross-examined the state's witnesses that I wondered why the prosecution did not object, if only to break his momentum.\n\nA native New Yorker, Savage has spent most of his adult life in South Carolina and now speaks in a quiet rasp with long pauses for effect, like a Southern-inflected Garrison Keillor. In a courthouse corridor one afternoon during a break in the trial, Savage turned to me: \"It's more than about the video, right?\" He was asking whether he'd been effective in constructing an alternate narrative and steering the jury away from the state's most damning evidence. I said yes, I thought he had.\n\nAlso read: \"None of Us Is Entirely Innocent\": A Timeline of Police Violence and Backlash.\n\nErik McGregor/Zuma; Cary Edmondson/Reuters; Kevin Terrell/AP\n\nSlager wore the same dark suit every day of the five-week trial. He sat at the defense table next to Savage's wife, Cheryl, who manages her husband's trial documents. Slager's wife and parents sat on the benches behind them, often joined by his sisters. In the same row, behind the prosecution table, sat Scott's family-parents, brothers, sisters-in-law, and sometimes Walter's adult children. Both families dressed as if for church. It was chilly in the courtroom, and Walter's mother-\"Miss Judy,\" as she is called-often wore a shawl. Several times when the video of the shooting was played, she buried her head on her husband's shoulder and didn't watch.\n\nThe Black and White Views of Charleston's Racially Charged Murder Trials\n\nIn Charleston, the threads of gentility and brutality run side by side. Gracious architecture and new Southern cooking exist in parallel with the city's history as a slavery hub. The courtroom was the city in microcosm, divided but at all times civil. Members of the Scott and Slager families greeted each other politely. \"I see his mama in the hallway,\" Rodney Scott told me. \"I say hello. I don't hate her. I don't even have hate for Michael Slager. He made a bad decision. Why didn't he stop? Just stand up and say it: 'I shot him for no reason.'\"\n\nA defendant does not have to testify on his own behalf, and many do not, but Slager took the stand during the fifth week of his trial, shortly after Thanksgiving. His testimony was oddly anticlimactic because his lawyer had already spooled out his story. He was soft. He was afraid. \"Speak up a little,\" Savage beckoned as he began his questioning. Slager explained that he had planned only to issue Scott a warning about the brake light. He didn't know why Scott ran, but it never occurred to him not to give chase. He felt in danger as soon as the physical confrontation began. \"At that point, I knew Mr. Scott was a lot stronger than me. I knew I was going to lose the fight.\"\n\n\"In my mind,\" he said, \"it was total fear.\" Scott had grabbed his Taser, he insisted. (In the video, Scott is seen running away from Slager, without the Taser.) \"I pulled my firearm and I pulled the trigger,\" Slager testified. \"I fired until the threat was stopped, like I'm trained to do.\"\n\nThe cross-examination of Slager was surprisingly short. The whole trial had focused on his actions, but assistant prosecutor Bruce DuRant questioned him for no more than 90 minutes, zeroing in on the numerous elements of his initial comments to investigators that did not square with the video. Slager responded that there were many things he didn't remember from that day, including retrieving the Taser and dropping it next to Scott's body-which the prosecution called \"staging the scene.\" The adrenaline from the fight and the trauma of the shooting had impaired his recollections: \"My mind,\" he said, \"was like spaghetti.\"\n\nRoughly 1,000 civilians were shot and killed by on-duty police officers in each of the past two years, according to data compiled by the Washington Post and Philip Stinson, a criminologist at Ohio's Bowling Green State University. The majority had a gun or a knife, but plenty were unarmed. Since 2005, 79 officers have been charged with murder or manslaughter as a result of such shootings, and 27 have been convicted, either by a guilty plea or a jury trial-22 cases are still pending. The convicted officers received an average of just under four years behind bars, Stinson says, although some have gotten as little as a few weeks. Only one officer has been convicted of intentional murder: a Colorado cop who followed an unarmed man into the man's home, shot him in the back while his mother watched, and then pepper-sprayed him. That officer received a 16-year sentence.\n\nThe Slager trial was an example, one among many, of how poorly the legal system functions as a remedy or a deterrent for bad police shootings, which some law enforcement professionals now refer to as \"lawful but awful.\" The term acknowledges the gap between an avoidable and tragic loss of life and what it takes to convince a jury of 12 citizens to convict a police officer. Stinson, a former cop himself, made his mark in academia by demonstrating how much officers can get away with before they are charged, let alone convicted. \"I don't get surprised by much, but that video took my breath away,\" he told me, referring to the Slager footage. \"If there was a case you would have expected a conviction, it would have been this one.\"\n\nThe November election fell on the seventh day of the trial. By the time the proceedings were over, Donald Trump was America's president-to-be. Andy Savage told me he is \"center-left\" politically, but his closing argument to a jury dominated by white South Carolinians had a distinctly Trumpian edge. \"It's true. Michael Slager is a white man. Mr. Scott is African American,\" Savage told them. But the media was pushing a \"false narrative.\" His client had unfairly become a \"poster boy\" for unjust police shootings. He urged the jury to \"tell the state of South Carolina, tell the media they have to do their job\" by finding Slager not guilty.\n\nA note passed from the jury to the judge during the deliberations seemed to indicate there was just one juror who would not vote to convict, a lone holdout, but the jury foreman and another juror said in interviews later that as many as six jurors were not yet willing to find Slager guilty. The Scott family wanted justice, which to them meant a conviction, but they were not naïve enough to count on one. \"He flat-out lied. He sat on the stand and lied. The whole world knows he lied,\" said Rodney Scott.\n\nOne day toward the end of the trial, I ate lunch with Rodney at a restaurant near the courthouse. \"When I drive for UPS, if I see a dog in the street I slam the brakes on,\" he told me. \"I don't want to kill a dog. I don't want to kill a squirrel. I don't want to kill a possum. How in the world do you shoot [at] him eight times?\"\n\nHe still couldn't get over Slager's ineptness. \"I don't know what was in my brother's mind,\" he said. \"But you've got his car, his license. You would have had him in 10 minutes. I sit there and I look at him and wonder, 'Why did you do that? Your family is hurting. My family is hurting. All you had to do was walk away.'\" ________\n\nThis story was updated to reflect Slager's guilty plea. On April 19, 2021, an appeals judge upheld Slager's 20-year prison sentence.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Paul Kitagaki Jr./ZUMA Press Wire\n\nNineteen minutes is basically enough time to watch a sitcom without commercials, cook a frozen pizza in the oven at 400 degrees, or walk one mile at a leisurely pace. But somehow within the first 19 minutes that EMTs Robert Long and JaMichael Sandridge were on the scene after 29-year-old Tyre Nichols was severely beaten by Memphis police, they provided Nichols no medical care.\n\nThough they assisted Nichols-slumped over on the ground and handcuffed-in sitting up a few times, they did not take his vital signs, provide him oxygen, or even give him a physical examination. Sandridge, who is certified to administer IV lines and monitor cardiac activity as an advanced EMT, did neither, an investigation concluded.\n\nNichols died three days later from injuries sustained in the Jan. 7 beating, which was initiated by a traffic stop. Police body camera footage depicts police holding him down, kicking him, and punching him as he called out for help from his mother who lived nearby.\n\nOn Friday, the Tennessee Emergency Medical Services Board voted unanimously to suspend Long and Sandridge's EMT licenses, based on this information.\n\nDennis Rowe, a member of the board, said there was \"every reason to believe\" that the lack of action by Long and Sandridge in those first 19 minutes \"may have contributed to the demise of that patient.\"\n\nBoard member Sullivan Smith added it was \"obvious to even a lay person\" that Nichols \"was in terrible distress and needed help.\"\n\n\"They were his best shot,\" Smith said. \"And they failed to help.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Memphis Fire Department chief Gina Sweat fired Long and Sandridge. The chief also fired lieutenant Michelle Whitaker, who had been driving the fire truck and never left the vehicle to help. \"After concluding our internal investigation, it was determined that EMT-B Long, EMT-A Sandridge and Lt. Whitaker violated numerous MFD Policies and Protocols,\" Sweat said in a statement .\n\nThe Memphis Police Department also announced Friday that it had fired police officer Preston Hemphill, who was at the scene of the initial traffic stop of Nichols. Hemphill was the sixth police officer to be fired over the incident. The earlier five were charged with second-degree murder.\n\nHemphill's lawyer said that his client \"was never present at the second scene,\" where Nichols was beaten. Hemphill's body camera footage, however, shows the first police confrontation with Nichols, during which Hemphill used his taser. Later in the footage, a voice seeming to be Hemphill's says, \"I hope they stomp his ass.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Paul Kitagaki Jr./ZUMA Press Wire\n\nNineteen minutes is basically enough time to watch a sitcom without commercials, cook a frozen pizza in the oven at 400 degrees, or walk one mile at a leisurely pace. But somehow within the first 19 minutes that EMTs Robert Long and JaMichael Sandridge were on the scene after 29-year-old Tyre Nichols was severely beaten by Memphis police, they provided Nichols no medical care.\n\nThough they assisted Nichols-slumped over on the ground and handcuffed-in sitting up a few times, they did not take his vital signs, provide him oxygen, or even give him a physical examination. Sandridge, who is certified to administer IV lines and monitor cardiac activity as an advanced EMT, did neither, an investigation concluded.\n\nNichols died three days later from injuries sustained in the Jan. 7 beating, which was initiated by a traffic stop. Police body camera footage depicts police holding him down, kicking him, and punching him as he called out for help from his mother who lived nearby.\n\nOn Friday, the Tennessee Emergency Medical Services Board voted unanimously to suspend Long and Sandridge's EMT licenses, based on this information.\n\nDennis Rowe, a member of the board, said there was \"every reason to believe\" that the lack of action by Long and Sandridge in those first 19 minutes \"may have contributed to the demise of that patient.\"\n\nBoard member Sullivan Smith added it was \"obvious to even a lay person\" that Nichols \"was in terrible distress and needed help.\"\n\n\"They were his best shot,\" Smith said. \"And they failed to help.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Memphis Fire Department chief Gina Sweat fired Long and Sandridge. The chief also fired lieutenant Michelle Whitaker, who had been driving the fire truck and never left the vehicle to help. \"After concluding our internal investigation, it was determined that EMT-B Long, EMT-A Sandridge and Lt. Whitaker violated numerous MFD Policies and Protocols,\" Sweat said in a statement .\n\nThe Memphis Police Department also announced Friday that it had fired police officer Preston Hemphill, who was at the scene of the initial traffic stop of Nichols. Hemphill was the sixth police officer to be fired over the incident. The earlier five were charged with second-degree murder.\n\nHemphill's lawyer said that his client \"was never present at the second scene,\" where Nichols was beaten. Hemphill's body camera footage, however, shows the first police confrontation with Nichols, during which Hemphill used his taser. Later in the footage, a voice seeming to be Hemphill's says, \"I hope they stomp his ass.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Cop Who Killed Breonna Taylor Just Got a New Policing Job\n\nTamika Palmer, Breonna Taylor's mom, joins protesters on the one-year anniversary of Taylor's death. Chris Tuite/ImageSPACE/MediaPunch/IPX via AP\n\nMyles Cosgrove, the former Louisville, Kentucky, police officer who fired the shot that killed Breonna Taylor in 2020, just got a new job at a nearby sheriff's office.\n\nThe Carroll County Sheriff's Office confirmed to local reporters on Saturday that it hired Cosgrove after he passed a background check; following investigations by the state attorney general's office and federal prosecutors, he never faced criminal charges for his role in Taylor's death. \"This is a prime example of how police officers are protected\" and \"able to get away with such vicious crimes with no accountability,\" Taylor's aunt Bianca Austin told Mother Jones on Sunday. While she and her family continue to mourn for Taylor, she said, the officers \"get to move on living their lives.\"\n\nCosgrove was one of three Louisville officers who shot their weapons during the botched drug raid on Taylor's home in March 2020. Taylor was a 26-year-old emergency room technician and aspiring nurse. She and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were sleeping when seven plainclothes officers broke down her front door with a battering ram. Walker, thinking they were intruders, grabbed a gun and fired a single shot that struck one of them, and the others returned with a barrage of bullets that killed Taylor. Walker called 911 for help, not realizing it was the police who attacked her. The officers did not find drugs on the premises, and the incident led to nationwide protests that grew after a Minneapolis officer killed George Floyd two months later.\n\nThe Louisville Metro Police Department fired Cosgrove in January 2021 for failing to \"properly identify a target\" when he shot 16 times into Taylor's apartment, and for failing to use his body camera. The department also fired three other officers involved with the raid.\n\nAccording to an investigation by Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, it was Cosgrove who shot the bullet that killed Taylor. But Cameron did not charge Cosgrove, saying he was justified in shooting because Taylor's boyfriend fired a weapon first.\n\nInstead, Cameron charged another officer, Brett Hankison-not for attacking Taylor, but for endangering her neighbors by shooting so recklessly. A jury then acquitted him. Federal prosecutors also charged Hankison with civil rights violations and three other officers for their alleged role falsifying a search warrant for the raid, but they are not prosecuting Cosgrove, who they said was not involved in obtaining the warrant and did not know it contained inaccurate information. (Former officer Kelly Goodlett pleaded guilty, while the other officers' cases are ongoing.) Last year, Cosgrove sued the police department for firing him, but a judge upheld the termination.\n\nThe Carroll County Sheriff's Office, about an hour northeast of Louisville, cited the lack of criminal charges for Cosgrove as a reason for giving him a new job, along with his two decades of police experience. \"We think he will help reduce the flow of drugs in our area and reduce property crimes,\" Chief Deputy Rob Miller told the Courier Journal . \"We felt like he was a good candidate to help us in our county.\" Police accountability activists are planning protests for Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, another officer who shot his weapon during the raid is defending Cosgrove's right to work in policing again. John Mattingly, who retired from the Louisville police department last year, went on Twitter this weekend to criticize the protesters. \" These intolerant crazies want to deprive American citizens, who've been cleared, an opportunity at supporting their families,\" he wrote . \"I'm sick of these social justice warriors, who have no clue what the facts are, spreading lies and misinformation.\"\n\nMattingly wrote a book about the raid and its aftermath. In January, he did a publicity event for it at a restaurant in Kentucky, playing audio of gunshots as diners who had not signed up for the event ate their meals. \"These people think they can do whatever they want, say whatever they want,\" Austin, Taylor's aunt, said afterward. \"It was just wrong and indecent.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Capitol Police Officer Charged With Covering Up January 6 Crimes\n\nViolent protesters storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. John Minchillo/AP\n\nA 25-year veteran of the US Capitol Police faces obstruction of justice charges over allegations that he tried to cover up crimes related to the January 6 insurrection. Federal prosecutors say that the officer warned a man who participated in the attack to delete Facebook posts showing himself inside the Capitol-and that the officer subsequently deleted his own Facebook messages in an effort to cover his tracks.\n\n\"[I']m a capitol police officer who agrees with your political stance,\" Michael Angelo Riley told the riot suspect in a January 7 Facebook direct message, according to a grand jury indictment dated October 14. \"Take down the part about being in the building[.] they are currently investigating and everyone who was is in the building is going to [be] charged. Just looking out!\"\n\nRiley is the first Capitol Police officer to face charges for actions related to January 6. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger said Riley had been placed on leave. \"Obstruction of justice is a very serious allegation,\" Manger said in a statement. \"The department was notified about this investigation several weeks ago. Upon his arrest, the officer was placed on administrative leave pending the completion of the case.\"\n\nLast month, the Capitol Police announced that after an internal investigation, six of its officers would face disciplinary measures for conduct on January 6. The department did not name those officers or say what they did.\n\nRiley, a member of the police K-9 unit, did not personally know the man he was messaging, but both were avid fisherman and members of fishing-related Facebook groups,\" prosecutors say.\n\nProsecutors didn't name the man Riley warned. But NBC News identified him as Jacob Hiles, a Virginia Beach charter boat captain who pleaded guilty in September to a misdemeanor count of parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building. Details of Hiles' case, including his arrest on January 19, appear to confirm that he is the person that Riley messaged.\n\nThe indictment notes that Riley on January 9 had seen a video of the man he messaged \"smoking an unknown substance inside the Capitol building.\" A January affidavit detailing Hiles' actions notes that he posted a \"selfie\"-style video on Facebook on January 6 that showed him smoking an \"unidentified substance\" in the Capitol earlier that day. \"I'm not a smoker AT ALL, but when the cop asks you if you are gonna hit that, I ain't gonna let it g...\" Hiles wrote. (It's not clear if a police officer actually said that.)\n\nRiley's initial message led to an exchange of dozens of messages, according to prosecutors. When Hiles said he did not think he had done anything wrong, Riley responded: \"The only thing I can see is if you went into the building and they have proof you will be charged.\" On January 13, Riley told Hiles: \"Get off of social media.\"\n\nAfter Hiles was charged, the men spoke by phone for 23 minutes, according to Riley's indictment. Following his January 19 arrest, Hiles was interviewed by FBI agents. The next day, he told Riley in a message that the FBI \"was very curious that I had been speaking to you if they havent already asked you about me they are gonna. They took my phone and downloaded everything.\"\n\nThe next day Riley allegedly sent a message to Hiles in which he claimed to have just seen a video of \"you in the Capitol smoking weed and acting like a moron. I have to say, I was shocked and dumbfounded.\" Riley added had he believed Hiles had lied to him, adding: \"I was so mad last night that I deleted all your post [sic], but I wanted to text you this morning and let you know that I will longer be conversing with you.\" Prosecutors noted that Riley had known about the video for 12 days and continued to converse amicably after seeing it. The implication appears to be that the feds believe that message was part of an effort by Riley to cover his tracks.\n\nAn attorney representing Riley did not respond to inquires. Hiles also did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Activate your online access\n\nSociologist Michael Sierra-Arévalo's recent book explains how an obsession with violence has defined the police's purpose and worldview.\n\nPolice in Baltimore, Maryland, 2015.\n\nIn a working-class neighborhood in a midsize Northeastern town, a police officer is driving his cruiser down a darkened street when he passes a group of six Latino teenagers walking and talking together. \"Look at these little shitheads,\" he mutters. He stops his car, throws it in reverse, and backs down the one-way street, unholstering his pistol and laying it in his lap. When he reaches the group, all of whom are boys, he rolls down his window and, keeping the pistol in his lap, just out of sight, points it at them through the panel of the cruiser door. \"What's up, guys?\" the officer says. \"What's up?\" they reply. He questions them about how they're doing in school; they joke nervously about their grades. Eventually, without acknowledging their jokes, the officer ends the encounter. \"All right, you guys stay out of trouble,\" he says and then drives away, slowly reholstering his pistol.\n\nIn the passenger seat, Michael Sierra-Arévalo, a sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin, silently observes the interaction. Soon enough, the officer explains the unholstered gun: \"They would have been able to shoot at us in a split second if they wanted,\" he says. \"You have to be ready for that. Always have a plan of attack.\"\n\nThis short but haunting exchange illustrates a central ethos of American law enforcement, as Sierra-Arévalo argues in a new book, The Danger Imperative: Violence, Death, and the Soul of Policing . In quietly reaching for his firearm, the officer was indulging a now-routine impulse. It may be irrational, given how rarely police are attacked. But policing, as a profession, is obsessed with violence and officer safety, a worldview that Sierra-Arévalo calls \"the danger imperative.\" Within its ambit, the officer's actions make perfect sense.\n\nA focus on danger pervades police culture, from drills in the academy to self-defense tactics on the street. Officers are taught from the start that the very people they are sworn to serve might harm them at any moment: Even if department policy states that they are never to draw a weapon unless an emergency arises, the philosophy of policing in America is to treat every interaction as a potential crisis. And despite the modern color-blind logic of the profession, police disproportionately use these tactics in poor communities of color, often causing harm.\n\n\"The danger imperative is policing's governing institutional frame,\" Sierra-Arévalo writes. More simply, it is \"the 'soul' of policing.\" The Danger Imperative studies several police departments around the country to catalog the often hidden mechanisms that animate police violence. Beyond that, Sierra-Arévalo reveals how danger has become a useful focus for a reactionary social project: A vigilant police force is a necessary ingredient in protecting the interests of both capital and the state. In an era when demands for racial and economic justice have reached a fever pitch, the book explains how a preoccupation with violence helps perpetuate a system of inequality.\n\nIt was Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Missouri, and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement that convinced Sierra-Arévalo that he should study cops. People filled the streets, decrying long-standing patterns of police brutality; the police responded with tear gas, nightsticks, and arrests. To some pundits , policymakers , and police representatives , these confrontations amounted to a \"war on cops,\" the latest rhetorical front in a counterrevolutionary battle, growing since the 1960s, that targeted protesters as criminal enemies. When disturbed citizens ambushed and killed police officers in New York City and Dallas, it only served as further proof that the thin blue line between chaos and order was under attack. Never acknowledged by this same commentariat is that policing today is safer than ever. It's not danger-free, of course: Officers suffer a violent injury rate more than 16 times the national average for all jobs. But deaths in the line of duty have dropped by 75 percent in the last 50 years, and violence against police has not spiked since 2014.\n\nWhy, then, do police see threats all around them? To understand this phenomenon, Sierra-Arévalo spent four years, from 2014 to 2018, observing three police departments in the Northeast, the Southwest, and the West, pseudonymized as Elmont, Sunshine, and West River. From the moment that officers join the force, he found, they are bombarded with the message that the public is out to get them. In academy rooms bedecked with military imagery, instructors screen grisly videos of officers murdered on the job. \"Reality-based\" scenarios suggest, falsely, that hidden guns are common during traffic stops. A PRISim simulation video in Sunshine teaches recruits when to \"neutralize\" an armed suspect-and how to justify it despite the department's stated policies. This tough-sounding \"tactical\" stuff far outweighs the instruction on defusing potentially violent situations. Elmont, for example, devotes 170 hours to weapons training and just 10 to de-escalation techniques. The ruling message of police education, Sierra-Arévalo writes, is that their work is defined by \"a constant fight for survival that must be won at all costs.\"\n\nOn the job, a barrage of information reiterates the lethal dangers of policing. Public memorials to fallen officers are ubiquitous. Elmont's headquarters displays plaques for each officer killed on duty going back to the 19th century. Privately, officers possess a \"hidden world of cultural artifacts\" to commemorate the dead: bracelets, tattoos, and personal shrines. Meanwhile, the daily functions of the department reinforce the sense of threat. Sierra-Arévalo takes us into the \"lineup\" room where officers start their shift; there the walls are plastered with warnings about volatile gang members and exotic weapons. Supervisors distribute \"hot sheets\" with information about violent crimes around the region. Never mind that these offenses represent a tiny fraction of any agency's thousands of routine calls for service; they take center stage in the police imagination. Occasionally, actual violence strikes. When an unruly crowd in West River injures an officer during an illegal street race, her colleagues understand the incident as confirmation of the widespread danger to police across the country in the wake of BLM. \"This just goes to show how the climate is right now,\" one tells Sierra-Arévalo. \"It's disturbing how violent and aggressive people are with officers.\"\n\nThe perception of the public as dangerous and unruly is not limited, of course, to police. It reaches the highest levels of the state, transcending the partisan divide of mainstream politics. Thus every modern political elite, whatever their high-flown incantations in favor of \"police reform\" or \"law and order,\" must pay rhetorical tribute to the brave law-enforcement officers who put their lives in harm's way so that the rest of us can stay safe . The ruling class has always been incentivized to breed a fear of the other among police: It serves to protect their interests. Our political economy creates an underclass, and that underclass must be managed. A certain measure of indoctrination, it seems, is necessary to convince agents of the state, transformed from ordinary citizens, that they are righteous in repressing the least powerful among us, and in doubling down when those disempowered take to the streets.\n\nFor police, the danger imperative is more than mere rhetoric. They are true believers, and it's stunning to see how their fear materializes in real-world behavior, particularly toward the urban poor. It's not that officers discuss these perceived threats in explicitly racial terms, Sierra-Arévalo writes. No longer do Black and Latino \"superpredators\" prowl our streets. Instead, police today justify violence in the race-neutral language of \"tactics\" and \"officer safety.\" But the fact remains that the police are disproportionately sent into communities of color. Because of historic racism, disinvestment, and abuse, these neighborhoods suffer the bulk of violent crime and therefore the brunt of police stops, arrests, and violence. In a wretched and unending cycle, police target a population that the state has largely abandoned.\n\nThus it is no wonder that police feel unsafe in the neighborhoods they patrol. The Danger Imperative documents the \"safety-enhancing\" tactics that officers routinely use-and how they go maddeningly wrong. Particularly eye-popping is the concept of \"command presence,\" a demeanor and appearance taught in the academy that \"exudes authority\" and is meant to maintain control over a volatile public. In practice, this often looks like plain old disrespect. One Elmont officer regularly shouts at people who question him. At one point, he barges into a woman's apartment building when she asks whether he has a warrant, rather than simply explain that he's trying to return her neighbor's lost wallet. Ironically, in behaving so rudely, officers lethally \"neutralize\" whatever shreds of public trust they might otherwise enjoy, leading to more resentment and generating more danger .\n\nIn other scenarios, officers are simply not equipped to help, and the danger imperative causes them to perceive threats where none exist. When two Elmont officers respond to a family's call to assist with their son's mental health crisis, Sierra-Arévalo observes a harrowing situation. After the man behaves erratically and tries to leave the room, officers fear that he could be retrieving a weapon, so they instantly go \"hands on,\" wrestling him to the ground, pepper-spraying him in the face, and handcuffing him before an ambulance arrives to take him away. His family is furious. \"Fucking pigs!\" his sister yells. The man, who ends up being transported to the hospital for observation, was in acute mental distress and did little wrong aside from putting up a futile resistance to the officers' rough treatment. These aggressive tactics are fairly commonplace-much more so than high-profile police killings. In 2018, officers pushed, grabbed, or struck 430,000 people nationwide; by comparison, they fatally shot 990. \"Most police violence,\" Sierra-Arévalo writes, \"is used to preemptively assert control over interactions or in response to passive, nonviolent resistance.\"\n\nWhat is policing for? Far from creating safety , in America the profession has always been a means of asserting control. In its origins, policing as we know it today was created to put down slave revolts. During the civil rights era, police brutally suppressed peaceful marchers. Today, police remain the frontline force cracking down on demonstrations for racial and economic justice, and the danger imperative remains a powerful tool in explaining away their actions. Just last year, when police shot and killed an unarmed activist opposing Atlanta's proposed Cop City training facility, they claimed self-defense and escaped repercussions. But these continued confrontations announce a new and durable public refusal to accept the violence that police mete out. \"Something has changed in America,\" Tobi Haslett wrote in n+1 in 2021, reflecting on the historic uprisings over the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. \"The rebellion didn't just release a jet of fury but lodged the riot, without apology, in the very rhythm of political life.\"\n\nSierra-Arévalo's conclusions are, in part, a product of that change. Having spent more than 1,000 hours watching officers invent threats where there were none (be it a homeless person in the park or a crowd of political protesters) and abuse their power (whether by handcuffing innocent motorists or tackling mentally ill patients), he recognizes the cultural and institutional limits of reform. The book largely arrives at non-reformist solutions, ones that don't rely on the police to solve society's ills.

Activate your online access\n\nSociologist Michael Sierra-Arévalo's recent book explains how an obsession with violence has defined the police's purpose and worldview.\n\nPolice in Baltimore, Maryland, 2015.\n\nIn a working-class neighborhood in a midsize Northeastern town, a police officer is driving his cruiser down a darkened street when he passes a group of six Latino teenagers walking and talking together. \"Look at these little shitheads,\" he mutters. He stops his car, throws it in reverse, and backs down the one-way street, unholstering his pistol and laying it in his lap. When he reaches the group, all of whom are boys, he rolls down his window and, keeping the pistol in his lap, just out of sight, points it at them through the panel of the cruiser door. \"What's up, guys?\" the officer says. \"What's up?\" they reply. He questions them about how they're doing in school; they joke nervously about their grades. Eventually, without acknowledging their jokes, the officer ends the encounter. \"All right, you guys stay out of trouble,\" he says and then drives away, slowly reholstering his pistol.\n\nIn the passenger seat, Michael Sierra-Arévalo, a sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin, silently observes the interaction. Soon enough, the officer explains the unholstered gun: \"They would have been able to shoot at us in a split second if they wanted,\" he says. \"You have to be ready for that. Always have a plan of attack.\"\n\nThis short but haunting exchange illustrates a central ethos of American law enforcement, as Sierra-Arévalo argues in a new book, The Danger Imperative: Violence, Death, and the Soul of Policing . In quietly reaching for his firearm, the officer was indulging a now-routine impulse. It may be irrational, given how rarely police are attacked. But policing, as a profession, is obsessed with violence and officer safety, a worldview that Sierra-Arévalo calls \"the danger imperative.\" Within its ambit, the officer's actions make perfect sense.\n\nA focus on danger pervades police culture, from drills in the academy to self-defense tactics on the street. Officers are taught from the start that the very people they are sworn to serve might harm them at any moment: Even if department policy states that they are never to draw a weapon unless an emergency arises, the philosophy of policing in America is to treat every interaction as a potential crisis. And despite the modern color-blind logic of the profession, police disproportionately use these tactics in poor communities of color, often causing harm.\n\n\"The danger imperative is policing's governing institutional frame,\" Sierra-Arévalo writes. More simply, it is \"the 'soul' of policing.\" The Danger Imperative studies several police departments around the country to catalog the often hidden mechanisms that animate police violence. Beyond that, Sierra-Arévalo reveals how danger has become a useful focus for a reactionary social project: A vigilant police force is a necessary ingredient in protecting the interests of both capital and the state. In an era when demands for racial and economic justice have reached a fever pitch, the book explains how a preoccupation with violence helps perpetuate a system of inequality.\n\nIt was Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Missouri, and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement that convinced Sierra-Arévalo that he should study cops. People filled the streets, decrying long-standing patterns of police brutality; the police responded with tear gas, nightsticks, and arrests. To some pundits , policymakers , and police representatives , these confrontations amounted to a \"war on cops,\" the latest rhetorical front in a counterrevolutionary battle, growing since the 1960s, that targeted protesters as criminal enemies. When disturbed citizens ambushed and killed police officers in New York City and Dallas, it only served as further proof that the thin blue line between chaos and order was under attack. Never acknowledged by this same commentariat is that policing today is safer than ever. It's not danger-free, of course: Officers suffer a violent injury rate more than 16 times the national average for all jobs. But deaths in the line of duty have dropped by 75 percent in the last 50 years, and violence against police has not spiked since 2014.\n\nWhy, then, do police see threats all around them? To understand this phenomenon, Sierra-Arévalo spent four years, from 2014 to 2018, observing three police departments in the Northeast, the Southwest, and the West, pseudonymized as Elmont, Sunshine, and West River. From the moment that officers join the force, he found, they are bombarded with the message that the public is out to get them. In academy rooms bedecked with military imagery, instructors screen grisly videos of officers murdered on the job. \"Reality-based\" scenarios suggest, falsely, that hidden guns are common during traffic stops. A PRISim simulation video in Sunshine teaches recruits when to \"neutralize\" an armed suspect-and how to justify it despite the department's stated policies. This tough-sounding \"tactical\" stuff far outweighs the instruction on defusing potentially violent situations. Elmont, for example, devotes 170 hours to weapons training and just 10 to de-escalation techniques. The ruling message of police education, Sierra-Arévalo writes, is that their work is defined by \"a constant fight for survival that must be won at all costs.\"\n\nOn the job, a barrage of information reiterates the lethal dangers of policing. Public memorials to fallen officers are ubiquitous. Elmont's headquarters displays plaques for each officer killed on duty going back to the 19th century. Privately, officers possess a \"hidden world of cultural artifacts\" to commemorate the dead: bracelets, tattoos, and personal shrines. Meanwhile, the daily functions of the department reinforce the sense of threat. Sierra-Arévalo takes us into the \"lineup\" room where officers start their shift; there the walls are plastered with warnings about volatile gang members and exotic weapons. Supervisors distribute \"hot sheets\" with information about violent crimes around the region. Never mind that these offenses represent a tiny fraction of any agency's thousands of routine calls for service; they take center stage in the police imagination. Occasionally, actual violence strikes. When an unruly crowd in West River injures an officer during an illegal street race, her colleagues understand the incident as confirmation of the widespread danger to police across the country in the wake of BLM. \"This just goes to show how the climate is right now,\" one tells Sierra-Arévalo. \"It's disturbing how violent and aggressive people are with officers.\"\n\nThe perception of the public as dangerous and unruly is not limited, of course, to police.

Millions took to the streets around the world, and cops responded with the same violence that was being protested. As Brooks Laughlin watched from a prison cell in Washington state, he was sure he could help the protesters and the police understand each other. He thought he knew from experience exactly what was toxic with police culture and how it could be overcome. In December, I sat with him on the gymnasium floor of the Monroe Correctional Complex. He leaned back against a brick wall-his wide, muscular build a testament to his love of powerlifting. Laughlin always seems tough and collected, and seldom shows any emotion. In 2006, he graduated from Washington state's police academy with top honors, and then at 21, became the Bellingham Police Department's youngest hire in decades. For the next 13 years, he worked as a drug detective; a range master, charged with training and qualifying officers with guns; a member of the National Tactical Officers' Association; and an undercover operative in federal organized crime investigations. He literally wrote the test given to all new officers in his department. He planned and executed drug raids, was involved in shoot-outs, and trained SWAT teams. He was the type of cop about which movies are made. But all the while a secret haunted him that would eventually help land him in prison: \"Since I was young, I knew I had Bipolar Disorder Type I. My mum recognized a lot of it, because growing up her dad was bipolar, and he went to prison and mental institutions for robbing his bank.\" By the time Laughlin was 13, he said he also knew that he would grow up to become a cop. At 14, he joined the Police Explorers, where he got to do ride-alongs and participate in training simulations with the SWAT team. For him, he said, \"there was this picture of law enforcement that was a false picture of perfection.\" His assimilation into police culture started early. \"As an Explorer, I learned there are slangs for everything. Four-eighty-one was the clearing code for someone who was crazy. That was my first glimpse into the dehumanization,\" he told me. \"They didn't call it someone who is having a crisis. No, this is a four-eighty-one. I was like I can't be a four-eighty-one, so I didn't go get a diagnosis.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Current Issue View our current issue At the Academy, he was indoctrinated into an \"us versus the world\" mentality and learned just how deep such dehumanization ran. He said he learned the \"colloquial terms for people you encounter, such as 'doper,' 'skell' [short for skeleton], 'mope,' and 'thug.'\" He said he understands now how they carry \"clear racial undertones,\" but explained that \"it doesn't take long for a recruit to be totally enmeshed into their new cop identity.\" As a young officer, he embraced police culture, which he now describes as cult-like. He married a girl with whom he had been an Explorer and whose father was on the force. They bought a home in suburbia, and had their first child when he was 26. To onlookers, he was a poster child for the aforementioned picture of police perfection, but at work, very different images were being seared into his memory. \"I responded to dead bodies, ranging from suicides, drug overdoses, car accidents, to natural causes. I was in a shoot-out before my training was even over. Less than a month off, I was the first on the scene of a drug homicide, where I had to hold someone's brains in with a towel. He didn't make it. That was just the tip of the iceberg of the horrors I would see and experience over the next dozen years.\" He told me that witnessing the carnage and suffering-often the result of the War on Drugs-drove even the most callous of cops into self-imposed isolation: \"It becomes hard to relate to outsiders. The only people you can relate to are those in your tribe. Your identity becomes fused to that of a cop. This extreme tribalism is the root of toxic police culture. Those that don't face the isolation are ostracized and usually don't make probationary officer status.\" Related Article Incarcerated, Infected, and Ignored: Inside an Arkansas Prison Outbreak Molly Minta The hiring practices, he explained, also play a role. The typical recruit is a white male in his mid-20s with at least some college education. Combine this with a screening for mental illness and a criminal background, and you end up with officers without the experiences of hardship that can help them relate to those they meet in the field. Before long, the Laughlins brought another child into the world. During the birth, Brook Laughlin's mother was rushed to a hospital in Seattle for an emergency operation related to a softball-sized tumor in her brain. \"I couldn't be there because my daughter was being born. It triggered me being manic, because everything was about me or my mum. That's when I stopped giving a shit,\" he said. She survived the surgery and got to meet her second granddaughter, but missed the birth of her third by two weeks. In 2015, Laughlin received a call on his birthday from his father telling him he needed to go see his mum. In February, he lost the person who had kept him grounded since he was a child. Within months, Laughlin's marriage unraveled. He began drinking heavily and soon eloped with a woman from the force with whom he'd been having an affair. Fully immersed in a macho workplace, he ignored his declining mental health and normalized his own violent behavior. In 2018, Laughlin was arrested for second degree assault/domestic violence against his wife and sentenced to 96 months in prison. He told me, \"What I did to my ex-wife is inexcusable... The fact is I hurt the person, other than my kids, I loved the most.\" He said being in prison challenged everything he had been trained to believe about the criminal justice system. \"During my trial, they said I had attended something like 3,800 hours of training, not including the ones I spent teaching. The thing that struck me was that in all those hundreds of hours, none of it told me anything about what life in prison and convict culture is really like. I had no idea what psychosocial factors from prison led to behaviors on the streets.\" Laughlin said that it was the people he met in county jail and prison that led to his realization about the police: \"It was people that led me to see and understand that mass incarceration and aggressive policing is doing no good for this country. We are systemically setting up generations of disenfranchised people for state-sponsored slavery.\" In an era where the idea of police reform has become popular, Laughlin said he feels a responsibility to use his experience on both sides of the system to offer practical solutions: \"Our nation's drug strategies have done a lot to shape modern policing. Drug enforcement is mostly done where it's most visible: the urban street level in poor communities, primarily of color. Drug arrests are easy to self-initiate, which makes them very appealing for cops wishing to generate stats. I believe shifting the drug strategy away from a law enforcement issue to a public health one would improve police's relationships with the communities they serve. Mental health also needs to be handled differently. Not only does law enforcement need to change how they view mental health in the community, but also among their own ranks.\" Related Article The Devastating Emotional Toll of Suspending Prison Visits Karina Piser Laughlin is set for release in 2023, and he said he wants to use his expertise to fight for social justice. He spends his days in prison strumming an acoustic guitar and developing a consulting program that will work with police departments to hold meetings with the formerly incarcerated to further what he believes might be the most important conversation in the country. Recognizing the transformative power of getting to know the people he once viewed as enemies, he said he believes that it's crucial for officers to experience these encounters as well. \"I want to use my experience to help bridge gaps with police agencies and those they serve. I have a plan for classes for law enforcement, where I would bring in convicts to help facilitate learning. Not to lecture or share trade secrets by either side, but in collaborative groups, to work towards solutions.\" He also pointed out that police performance is typically measured in arrests, tickets, warrants, and other enforcement means. \"Reviews and statistics for arrests are used when officers try out for special units and promotions,\" he told me. \"There's no measure of 'What good did you do in people's lives?' Drug crimes, which are predominantly enforced in communities of color, are the easiest target for a stat-hungry officer. The way we allow agencies to use enforcement statistics as a metric of performance is, in itself a testament to systemic racism within the force, and needs to be eliminated.\" Lastly, he said his time as a convict has changed his views about outside oversight. The Department of Corrections, much like the police force, handles all complaints in-house. He said that this means they're likely handled by friends of those in power and thrown out, which provides police and prison guards with almost complete impunity. Laughlin knows the underlying system needs to be changed, but he urged individual officers to not lose themselves in the uniform, and wanted to make a plea to every cop reading this: \"Ignore the stigma our police culture has created about mental health. The most manly thing you can do is ask for help. If your anger is getting out of control, your work life is perfect, but marriage is a mess, or you think of harming yourself, deal with it now, so you don't end up as the next cop making headlines.\"\n\nGeorge Floyd uttered the phrase with the simple hope that the police officer kneeling on his neck would let him live, but the words resonated through communities that understood what it meant to be suffocated by those entrusted to protect them. Millions took to the streets around the world, and cops responded with the same violence that was being protested. As Brooks Laughlin watched from a prison cell in Washington state, he was sure he could help the protesters and the police understand each other. He thought he knew from experience exactly what was toxic with police culture and how it could be overcome. In December, I sat with him on the gymnasium floor of the Monroe Correctional Complex. He leaned back against a brick wall-his wide, muscular build a testament to his love of powerlifting. Laughlin always seems tough and collected, and seldom shows any emotion. In 2006, he graduated from Washington state's police academy with top honors, and then at 21, became the Bellingham Police Department's youngest hire in decades. For the next 13 years, he worked as a drug detective; a range master, charged with training and qualifying officers with guns; a member of the National Tactical Officers' Association; and an undercover operative in federal organized crime investigations. He literally wrote the test given to all new officers in his department. He planned and executed drug raids, was involved in shoot-outs, and trained SWAT teams. He was the type of cop about which movies are made. But all the while a secret haunted him that would eventually help land him in prison: \"Since I was young, I knew I had Bipolar Disorder Type I. My mum recognized a lot of it, because growing up her dad was bipolar, and he went to prison and mental institutions for robbing his bank.\" By the time Laughlin was 13, he said he also knew that he would grow up to become a cop. At 14, he joined the Police Explorers, where he got to do ride-alongs and participate in training simulations with the SWAT team. For him, he said, \"there was this picture of law enforcement that was a false picture of perfection.\" His assimilation into police culture started early. \"As an Explorer, I learned there are slangs for everything. Four-eighty-one was the clearing code for someone who was crazy. That was my first glimpse into the dehumanization,\" he told me. \"They didn't call it someone who is having a crisis. No, this is a four-eighty-one.

He said he learned the \"colloquial terms for people you encounter, such as 'doper,' 'skell' [short for skeleton], 'mope,' and 'thug.'\" He said he understands now how they carry \"clear racial undertones,\" but explained that \"it doesn't take long for a recruit to be totally enmeshed into their new cop identity.\" As a young officer, he embraced police culture, which he now describes as cult-like. He married a girl with whom he had been an Explorer and whose father was on the force. They bought a home in suburbia, and had their first child when he was 26. To onlookers, he was a poster child for the aforementioned picture of police perfection, but at work, very different images were being seared into his memory. \"I responded to dead bodies, ranging from suicides, drug overdoses, car accidents, to natural causes. I was in a shoot-out before my training was even over. Less than a month off, I was the first on the scene of a drug homicide, where I had to hold someone's brains in with a towel. He didn't make it. That was just the tip of the iceberg of the horrors I would see and experience over the next dozen years.\" He told me that witnessing the carnage and suffering-often the result of the War on Drugs-drove even the most callous of cops into self-imposed isolation: \"It becomes hard to relate to outsiders. The only people you can relate to are those in your tribe. Your identity becomes fused to that of a cop. This extreme tribalism is the root of toxic police culture.

The typical recruit is a white male in his mid-20s with at least some college education. Combine this with a screening for mental illness and a criminal background, and you end up with officers without the experiences of hardship that can help them relate to those they meet in the field. Before long, the Laughlins brought another child into the world. During the birth, Brook Laughlin's mother was rushed to a hospital in Seattle for an emergency operation related to a softball-sized tumor in her brain. \"I couldn't be there because my daughter was being born. It triggered me being manic, because everything was about me or my mum. That's when I stopped giving a shit,\" he said. She survived the surgery and got to meet her second granddaughter, but missed the birth of her third by two weeks. In 2015, Laughlin received a call on his birthday from his father telling him he needed to go see his mum. In February, he lost the person who had kept him grounded since he was a child. Within months, Laughlin's marriage unraveled. He began drinking heavily and soon eloped with a woman from the force with whom he'd been having an affair. Fully immersed in a macho workplace, he ignored his declining mental health and normalized his own violent behavior. In 2018, Laughlin was arrested for second degree assault/domestic violence against his wife and sentenced to 96 months in prison. He told me, \"What I did to my ex-wife is inexcusable... The fact is I hurt the person, other than my kids, I loved the most.\" He said being in prison challenged everything he had been trained to believe about the criminal justice system. \"During my trial, they said I had attended something like 3,800 hours of training, not including the ones I spent teaching. The thing that struck me was that in all those hundreds of hours, none of it told me anything about what life in prison and convict culture is really like. I had no idea what psychosocial factors from prison led to behaviors on the streets.\" Laughlin said that it was the people he met in county jail and prison that led to his realization about the police: \"It was people that led me to see and understand that mass incarceration and aggressive policing is doing no good for this country. We are systemically setting up generations of disenfranchised people for state-sponsored slavery.\" In an era where the idea of police reform has become popular, Laughlin said he feels a responsibility to use his experience on both sides of the system to offer practical solutions: \"Our nation's drug strategies have done a lot to shape modern policing.

Before long, the Laughlins brought another child into the world. During the birth, Brook Laughlin's mother was rushed to a hospital in Seattle for an emergency operation related to a softball-sized tumor in her brain. \"I couldn't be there because my daughter was being born. It triggered me being manic, because everything was about me or my mum. That's when I stopped giving a shit,\" he said. She survived the surgery and got to meet her second granddaughter, but missed the birth of her third by two weeks. In 2015, Laughlin received a call on his birthday from his father telling him he needed to go see his mum. In February, he lost the person who had kept him grounded since he was a child. Within months, Laughlin's marriage unraveled. He began drinking heavily and soon eloped with a woman from the force with whom he'd been having an affair. Fully immersed in a macho workplace, he ignored his declining mental health and normalized his own violent behavior. In 2018, Laughlin was arrested for second degree assault/domestic violence against his wife and sentenced to 96 months in prison. He told me, \"What I did to my ex-wife is inexcusable... The fact is I hurt the person, other than my kids, I loved the most.\" He said being in prison challenged everything he had been trained to believe about the criminal justice system. \"During my trial, they said I had attended something like 3,800 hours of training, not including the ones I spent teaching. The thing that struck me was that in all those hundreds of hours, none of it told me anything about what life in prison and convict culture is really like. I had no idea what psychosocial factors from prison led to behaviors on the streets.\" Laughlin said that it was the people he met in county jail and prison that led to his realization about the police: \"It was people that led me to see and understand that mass incarceration and aggressive policing is doing no good for this country. We are systemically setting up generations of disenfranchised people for state-sponsored slavery.\" In an era where the idea of police reform has become popular, Laughlin said he feels a responsibility to use his experience on both sides of the system to offer practical solutions: \"Our nation's drug strategies have done a lot to shape modern policing. Drug enforcement is mostly done where it's most visible: the urban street level in poor communities, primarily of color. Drug arrests are easy to self-initiate, which makes them very appealing for cops wishing to generate stats. I believe shifting the drug strategy away from a law enforcement issue to a public health one would improve police's relationships with the communities they serve. Mental health also needs to be handled differently. Not only does law enforcement need to change how they view mental health in the community, but also among their own ranks.\" Related Article The Devastating Emotional Toll of Suspending Prison Visits Karina Piser Laughlin is set for release in 2023, and he said he wants to use his expertise to fight for social justice. He spends his days in prison strumming an acoustic guitar and developing a consulting program that will work with police departments to hold meetings with the formerly incarcerated to further what he believes might be the most important conversation in the country. Recognizing the transformative power of getting to know the people he once viewed as enemies, he said he believes that it's crucial for officers to experience these encounters as well. \"I want to use my experience to help bridge gaps with police agencies and those they serve. I have a plan for classes for law enforcement, where I would bring in convicts to help facilitate learning. Not to lecture or share trade secrets by either side, but in collaborative groups, to work towards solutions.\" He also pointed out that police performance is typically measured in arrests, tickets, warrants, and other enforcement means. \"Reviews and statistics for arrests are used when officers try out for special units and promotions,\" he told me. \"There's no measure of 'What good did you do in people's lives?' Drug crimes, which are predominantly enforced in communities of color, are the easiest target for a stat-hungry officer. The way we allow agencies to use enforcement statistics as a metric of performance is, in itself a testament to systemic racism within the force, and needs to be eliminated.\" Lastly, he said his time as a convict has changed his views about outside oversight. The Department of Corrections, much like the police force, handles all complaints in-house. He said that this means they're likely handled by friends of those in power and thrown out, which provides police and prison guards with almost complete impunity. Laughlin knows the underlying system needs to be changed, but he urged individual officers to not lose themselves in the uniform, and wanted to make a plea to every cop reading this: \"Ignore the stigma our police culture has created about mental health. The most manly thing you can do is ask for help. If your anger is getting out of control, your work life is perfect, but marriage is a mess, or you think of harming yourself, deal with it now, so you don't end up as the next cop making headlines.\"\n\nBy the time Laughlin was 13, he said he also knew that he would grow up to become a cop. At 14, he joined the Police Explorers, where he got to do ride-alongs and participate in training simulations with the SWAT team. For him, he said, \"there was this picture of law enforcement that was a false picture of perfection.\" His assimilation into police culture started early. \"As an Explorer, I learned there are slangs for everything.

Those that don't face the isolation are ostracized and usually don't make probationary officer status.\" Related Article Incarcerated, Infected, and Ignored: Inside an Arkansas Prison Outbreak Molly Minta The hiring practices, he explained, also play a role. The typical recruit is a white male in his mid-20s with at least some college education. Combine this with a screening for mental illness and a criminal background, and you end up with officers without the experiences of hardship that can help them relate to those they meet in the field. Before long, the Laughlins brought another child into the world. During the birth, Brook Laughlin's mother was rushed to a hospital in Seattle for an emergency operation related to a softball-sized tumor in her brain. \"I couldn't be there because my daughter was being born. It triggered me being manic, because everything was about me or my mum. That's when I stopped giving a shit,\" he said. She survived the surgery and got to meet her second granddaughter, but missed the birth of her third by two weeks. In 2015, Laughlin received a call on his birthday from his father telling him he needed to go see his mum. In February, he lost the person who had kept him grounded since he was a child. Within months, Laughlin's marriage unraveled. He began drinking heavily and soon eloped with a woman from the force with whom he'd been having an affair. Fully immersed in a macho workplace, he ignored his declining mental health and normalized his own violent behavior. In 2018, Laughlin was arrested for second degree assault/domestic violence against his wife and sentenced to 96 months in prison. He told me, \"What I did to my ex-wife is inexcusable... The fact is I hurt the person, other than my kids, I loved the most.\" He said being in prison challenged everything he had been trained to believe about the criminal justice system. \"During my trial, they said I had attended something like 3,800 hours of training, not including the ones I spent teaching. The thing that struck me was that in all those hundreds of hours, none of it told me anything about what life in prison and convict culture is really like. I had no idea what psychosocial factors from prison led to behaviors on the streets.\" Laughlin said that it was the people he met in county jail and prison that led to his realization about the police: \"It was people that led me to see and understand that mass incarceration and aggressive policing is doing no good for this country. We are systemically setting up generations of disenfranchised people for state-sponsored slavery.\" In an era where the idea of police reform has become popular, Laughlin said he feels a responsibility to use his experience on both sides of the system to offer practical solutions: \"Our nation's drug strategies have done a lot to shape modern policing. Drug enforcement is mostly done where it's most visible: the urban street level in poor communities, primarily of color. Drug arrests are easy to self-initiate, which makes them very appealing for cops wishing to generate stats. I believe shifting the drug strategy away from a law enforcement issue to a public health one would improve police's relationships with the communities they serve. Mental health also needs to be handled differently. Not only does law enforcement need to change how they view mental health in the community, but also among their own ranks.\" Related Article The Devastating Emotional Toll of Suspending Prison Visits Karina Piser Laughlin is set for release in 2023, and he said he wants to use his expertise to fight for social justice. He spends his days in prison strumming an acoustic guitar and developing a consulting program that will work with police departments to hold meetings with the formerly incarcerated to further what he believes might be the most important conversation in the country. Recognizing the transformative power of getting to know the people he once viewed as enemies, he said he believes that it's crucial for officers to experience these encounters as well. \"I want to use my experience to help bridge gaps with police agencies and those they serve. I have a plan for classes for law enforcement, where I would bring in convicts to help facilitate learning. Not to lecture or share trade secrets by either side, but in collaborative groups, to work towards solutions.\" He also pointed out that police performance is typically measured in arrests, tickets, warrants, and other enforcement means. \"Reviews and statistics for arrests are used when officers try out for special units and promotions,\" he told me. \"There's no measure of 'What good did you do in people's lives?' Drug crimes, which are predominantly enforced in communities of color, are the easiest target for a stat-hungry officer. The way we allow agencies to use enforcement statistics as a metric of performance is, in itself a testament to systemic racism within the force, and needs to be eliminated.\" Lastly, he said his time as a convict has changed his views about outside oversight. The Department of Corrections, much like the police force, handles all complaints in-house. He said that this means they're likely handled by friends of those in power and thrown out, which provides police and prison guards with almost complete impunity. Laughlin knows the underlying system needs to be changed, but he urged individual officers to not lose themselves in the uniform, and wanted to make a plea to every cop reading this: \"Ignore the stigma our police culture has created about mental health. The most manly thing you can do is ask for help. If your anger is getting out of control, your work life is perfect, but marriage is a mess, or you think of harming yourself, deal with it now, so you don't end up as the next cop making headlines.\"\n\nHe told me that witnessing the carnage and suffering-often the result of the War on Drugs-drove even the most callous of cops into self-imposed isolation: \"It becomes hard to relate to outsiders.

Not only does law enforcement need to change how they view mental health in the community, but also among their own ranks.\" Related Article The Devastating Emotional Toll of Suspending Prison Visits Karina Piser Laughlin is set for release in 2023, and he said he wants to use his expertise to fight for social justice. He spends his days in prison strumming an acoustic guitar and developing a consulting program that will work with police departments to hold meetings with the formerly incarcerated to further what he believes might be the most important conversation in the country. Recognizing the transformative power of getting to know the people he once viewed as enemies, he said he believes that it's crucial for officers to experience these encounters as well. \"I want to use my experience to help bridge gaps with police agencies and those they serve. I have a plan for classes for law enforcement, where I would bring in convicts to help facilitate learning. Not to lecture or share trade secrets by either side, but in collaborative groups, to work towards solutions.\" He also pointed out that police performance is typically measured in arrests, tickets, warrants, and other enforcement means. \"Reviews and statistics for arrests are used when officers try out for special units and promotions,\" he told me. \"There's no measure of 'What good did you do in people's lives?' Drug crimes, which are predominantly enforced in communities of color, are the easiest target for a stat-hungry officer. The way we allow agencies to use enforcement statistics as a metric of performance is, in itself a testament to systemic racism within the force, and needs to be eliminated.\" Lastly, he said his time as a convict has changed his views about outside oversight. The Department of Corrections, much like the police force, handles all complaints in-house. He said that this means they're likely handled by friends of those in power and thrown out, which provides police and prison guards with almost complete impunity. Laughlin knows the underlying system needs to be changed, but he urged individual officers to not lose themselves in the uniform, and wanted to make a plea to every cop reading this: \"Ignore the stigma our police culture has created about mental health. The most manly thing you can do is ask for help. If your anger is getting out of control, your work life is perfect, but marriage is a mess, or you think of harming yourself, deal with it now, so you don't end up as the next cop making headlines.\"\n\nIn an era where the idea of police reform has become popular, Laughlin said he feels a responsibility to use his experience on both sides of the system to offer practical solutions: \"Our nation's drug strategies have done a lot to shape modern policing. Drug enforcement is mostly done where it's most visible: the urban street level in poor communities, primarily of color. Drug arrests are easy to self-initiate, which makes them very appealing for cops wishing to generate stats.

While some of the most egregious behavior has come from local and state police-such as placing snipers on the roof of a building overlooking protests at Ohio State and Indiana University and the violent mass arrests of peaceful student protesters at Columbia, City College, and University of South Florida -university-based police departments have played their part too. And they have shown themselves to be just as capable of brutalizing students and faculty as state and local police.\n\nAmong the more egregious incidents, we have seen campus police join with official law enforcement to violently arrest students and faculty at Emory , the University of Illinois, and the University of Texas . At UCLA , university police stood by as an encampment was overrun by violent counter-protesters.\n\nThe history of campus police goes back to 1894 and the emergence of a watchman-like system at Yale. These watchmen were granted the legal powers of municipal police and were able to execute arrests and use force as necessary, differentiating them from security guards who generally are unarmed and must rely on local police to make arrests. Modern campus policing as we know it, however, emerged for the most part much later in the 1960s and '70s, in the wake of the violent police repression of student protests in those decades. During that era, universities invited law enforcement onto campuses, where they famously brought the heavy weight of their force down on students-from the arrests of Free Speech Movement protesters in Berkeley to the NYPD's violent attack on students at Columbia to the killing of four Kent State students by Ohio National Guard troops\n\nIn response, beginning in the 1970s, universities decided to follow a different approach to campus unrest: Rather than deploy local police who worked at the behest of city officials often wanting to \" send a message \" to protesters, universities developed campus police forces that, at least in theory, would be under the direct control of administrators and thus able to provide a more nuanced, preventive, and less violent approach to campus protests. The hope was that this would minimize disruption to campus life, restore legitimacy to university administrations in the eyes of students, parents, and the general public, and give schools more resources to protect campus infrastructure.\n\nTo justify these new and expanded campus police forces, university officials invoked the rhetoric of local control and community service. They argued that that having a police force under the direct authority of college administrators would reduce the level of violence around policing protests because these forces could be more proactive and preventative rather than reactive and retributive. By being a full-time presence on campus, they could channel protest activity into approved methods that didn't disrupt college operations and didn't require the involvement of outside police forces.\n\nIn practice these new forces tended to be a lot like their municipal peers. Headed up and staffed with officers from surrounding departments, they shared the same training and worldview as police generally. As recent research by Samantha Simon in Before the Badge and Michael Sierra-Arévalo in The Danger Imperative shows, this training and worldview instilled in them a deep culture of fear that bred a high level of defensiveness, suspicion, and unwarranted use of force. They viewed disruption as inherently threatening to the social order and thus worthy of criminalization. As with other police forces racism and sexism also became rampant .\n\nDuring the last two decades, these campus police have become even more like local police. As a new volume Cops on Campus , edited by Yalile Suriel, Grace Watkins, Jude Paul Matias Dizon, and John J. Sloan, details: campus police have largely followed the rest of policing in becoming more warrior-like since 9/11. Many university police departments have formed tactical squads and received military surplus equipment from the Department of Defense's 1099 weapons transfer program. A 2016 Associated Press report found that campus police departments across the country have obtained assault rifles either through the 1099 program or through direct purchases. It also disclosed a DOD report that 91 campus police departments had obtained over 800 rifles in the prior decade. While most departments refused to disclose direct purchases, the University of Wisconsin-Madison reported spending $11,000 on AR-15s in 2010 with plans to purchase more in the following years.\n\nUnder normal circumstances campus police play two primary roles, one is the protection of university resources and property and the other is the protection of members of the campus community-that is, students, staff, faculty, and administrators. Most of this work involves the surveillance and harassment of those deemed outside the campus community. In 2018, for example, Portland State University police operating off campus shot and killed Jason Washington, an unarmed young African American man involved in breaking up a fight. Police fired 17 rounds, striking him nine times. Students had opposed giving PSU police firearms in 2014 raising concerns about exactly such a scenario.\n\nCampus police have not reserved their force only for those deemed outside the community, however. During the Occupy protests, University of California Police subjected UC Davis students to direct application of pepper spray in a video that became a viral meme at the time. There have also been cases where police have racially profiled non-white students and even arrested, brutalized, and shot them-including during mental health crises. In 2010 University of Florida police shot a graduate student in the face and hand causing permanent injuries. This March, a Washington State University officer shot at a student having a mental health crisis. As is too often the case, the student called for help and was greeted with armed police instead of a mental health response.\n\nUniversity police forces have also been expanding in recent years as their campuses expand into surrounding communities. Both the University of Chicago and Johns Hopkins University Police Departments were given permission to expand policing into surrounding communities where the universities have extensive real estate interests and in the process subject local residents, many of whom are poor and non-white, to an additional layer of intensive policing. In an essay for the Cops on Campus volume, the scholar Davarian Baldwin argues that this is in keeping with the larger vision of the neoliberal university and its efforts to expand research, medical services, and urban redevelopment without regard to their impact on displaced communities.\n\nBy unleashing both campus and other police forces on student protesters, administrators are making the same mistakes they made in the past. They are brutalizing their students and faculty-the very communities that define their institutions as \"universities\" and as a result, are contributing to a legitimacy crisis that runs the risk of escalating into a profound crisis of confidence in universities. Already, we have seen commencement ceremonies canceled at USC and Columbia as well as the cancelation of in-person classes and campus services at Columbia, UCLA , and the City College of New York.\n\nOver the last several years student movements across the country have called for an end to campus-based police forces. They want all cops off campus-university-affiliated and municipal. Students at Portland State successfully de-armed their campus police and students at the University of Chicago and Johns Hopkins partnered with community-based organizations to oppose police expansions.\n\nIn 2022, a \" Cops off Campus \" coalition was formed that links these efforts together across the United States and Canada. The presence of armed police on college campuses, they insist, has done little to enhance a university's public safety and instead serves as a private army to be used by administrators to advance institutional interests that often clash with the well-being of students and surrounding communities. When push comes to shove, campus police are no better than their off-campus counterparts and should be disbanded. The existence of campus police forces are a profound threat to our social movements and exist primarily to enable the ongoing work of the neoliberal university that places a significant burden on surrounding communities.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

You can read our Privacy Policy here.\n\nI've written recently about qualified immunity , which is the concept that law enforcement or other government officials cannot be held personally liable for the harm they cause doing their jobs. Lawyers and activists have noted that the doctrine essentially shields law officers from accountability when they violate people's constitutional rights, allowing cops to shoot people and face no consequences. But courts have steadfastly upheld qualified immunity-a fact that has led me to argue that congressional action is the only hope for rolling back the current rules. It turns out, I was wrong. This week, I found a case where a court, not Congress, stripped away qualified immunity from a cop and is allowing him to be sued civilly for his violent behavior. The problem, it seems, with my earlier analysis was that I focused on how courts treat cops who shoot or harm people, specifically Black people. That was foolish. I should have been looking at how courts treat cops who brutalize something this country actually cares about. Dogs. On Monday, the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (which covers Minnesota, Missouri, and some random states that have fewer people but more senators than a rush-hour 7 train) issued a ruling that pierced the veil of qualified immunity and allowed a lawsuit to go forward against a cop that shot some lady's dog. Two dogs, in fact. Apparently, qualified immunity-which courts are constantly telling us is necessary to protect cops who have to respond to dangerous situations quickly-can be thrown right out the window if the officer involved shoots a pair of canines. The facts of the case are not in dispute. In 2017, Minneapolis police responded to a house alarm that was accidentally set off at the home of Jennifer LeMay. One of her kids had tripped the alarm by mistake, and when the home security company called, LeMay told them to cancel the alert. But the cops were already on their way. One officer went to the front of the house and was met by one of LeMay's kids, who told the officer there was no problem. But a different cop, officer Michael Mays, went around the back of the house, scaled a privacy fence, and ended up in the backyard. There, the cop was greeted by the LeMays' service dogs, Ciroc and Rocko, both of whom were 5-year-old American Staffordshire Terriers (\"pit bulls\" to those who really need to watch more dog shows). Mays says Ciroc \"charged\" him, but his body camera footage shows the dog walking toward him, wagging his tail. Mays backs up, Ciroc keeps approaching, and Mays shoots it in the face. Ciroc runs away, but at that point Rocko moves towards Mays, again in a friendly, tail-wagging manner (what a good boy). Mays then shoots Rocko multiple times. Both dogs lived and will go to heaven later. The Eighth Circuit court ruled that Mays was not entitled to qualified immunity because he did not face imminent danger. The court argued that Mays violated a clear constitutional rule, finding that it is \"clearly established\" that an officer cannot shoot a dog in the absence of an \"objectively legitimate\" threat. This language is important. The court is saying that a general fear of dogs-or, specifically, pit bulls-is not enough to justify deadly force. The threat to the officer has to be an objective one.

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement Feature / Vincent Bevins Current Issue View our current issue It's interesting, because when it comes to people, courts regularly rule the opposite: that a cop's own hysterical fear is enough to justify excessive force. It doesn't matter if the person did not pose a deadly threat; all that matters is whether the cop was afraid. But in this case, the court demanded an objective reason to shoot an animal. This is a good time to mention that the Eighth Circuit panel that unanimously ruled against the cop was made up of three judges appointed by Republican presidents. And the all-conservative court didn't stop there. To defend himself, Mays offered his police report, which said that the dogs \"charged\" at him; the court ruled that it is not obligated to accept the police report's \"narrative as truth.\" I cannot recall reading an opinion in which the court basically called a police report a lie and declared that it was not bound to lend it any weight. But in this case, the court argued both that it did not have to trust the police report and, without the aid of that report, that Mays had to establish an objective case for imminent harm before using deadly force. On dogs. We're talking about dogs . Not people. Not Black children playing with toys. But dogs. Dogs! It should be said that the Eighth Circuit is clearly right here. Cops should not be allowed to barge into a person's house or yard and shoot their pets. There is no evidence that dogs pose a deadly threat to law enforcement. In fact, there is not one recorded case of a police officer being killed in the line of duty by a dog. And it almost goes without saying that police are more likely to shoot the dogs owned by Black and brown people than they are to shoot white people's pets. We should stop police puppycides. There's no reason for brutality against pets. But there's also-clearly-no reason for brutality against people. We should stop cops from shooting people and hold them accountable when they do. In fact, the Eighth Circuit has laid out some perfectly reasonable rules for stripping officers of qualified immunity when the victims are human, not canine: Ignore the police report and use an objective standard of imminent, deadly violence.

More from Mystal The Supreme Court Wants to Make It Even Harder to Sue Abusive Cops Elie Mystal White People Explain Racism to Me Elie Mystal Why can a court see the right answer so clearly when it comes to dogs, but loses the plot when cops turn their guns on people?

'Cause, let me tell you, if it would keep my kids safer, I'd sew a tail onto every pair of pants they wear.

In the meantime, I will continue to nurse my dream that one day Black people are treated by the white justice system with the same dignity and respect for our lives that it grants a dog. It would be an improvement.\n\nThe Eighth Circuit court ruled that Mays was not entitled to qualified immunity because he did not face imminent danger. The court argued that Mays violated a clear constitutional rule, finding that it is \"clearly established\" that an officer cannot shoot a dog in the absence of an \"objectively legitimate\" threat. This language is important. The court is saying that a general fear of dogs-or, specifically, pit bulls-is not enough to justify deadly force. The threat to the officer has to be an objective one.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Lawyers and activists have noted that the doctrine essentially shields law officers from accountability when they violate people's constitutional rights, allowing cops to shoot people and face no consequences. But courts have steadfastly upheld qualified immunity-a fact that has led me to argue that congressional action is the only hope for rolling back the current rules. It turns out, I was wrong. This week, I found a case where a court, not Congress, stripped away qualified immunity from a cop and is allowing him to be sued civilly for his violent behavior. The problem, it seems, with my earlier analysis was that I focused on how courts treat cops who shoot or harm people, specifically Black people. That was foolish. I should have been looking at how courts treat cops who brutalize something this country actually cares about. Dogs. On Monday, the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (which covers Minnesota, Missouri, and some random states that have fewer people but more senators than a rush-hour 7 train) issued a ruling that pierced the veil of qualified immunity and allowed a lawsuit to go forward against a cop that shot some lady's dog. Two dogs, in fact. Apparently, qualified immunity-which courts are constantly telling us is necessary to protect cops who have to respond to dangerous situations quickly-can be thrown right out the window if the officer involved shoots a pair of canines. The facts of the case are not in dispute. In 2017, Minneapolis police responded to a house alarm that was accidentally set off at the home of Jennifer LeMay. One of her kids had tripped the alarm by mistake, and when the home security company called, LeMay told them to cancel the alert. But the cops were already on their way. One officer went to the front of the house and was met by one of LeMay's kids, who told the officer there was no problem. But a different cop, officer Michael Mays, went around the back of the house, scaled a privacy fence, and ended up in the backyard. There, the cop was greeted by the LeMays' service dogs, Ciroc and Rocko, both of whom were 5-year-old American Staffordshire Terriers (\"pit bulls\" to those who really need to watch more dog shows). Mays says Ciroc \"charged\" him, but his body camera footage shows the dog walking toward him, wagging his tail. Mays backs up, Ciroc keeps approaching, and Mays shoots it in the face. Ciroc runs away, but at that point Rocko moves towards Mays, again in a friendly, tail-wagging manner (what a good boy). Mays then shoots Rocko multiple times. Both dogs lived and will go to heaven later. The Eighth Circuit court ruled that Mays was not entitled to qualified immunity because he did not face imminent danger. The court argued that Mays violated a clear constitutional rule, finding that it is \"clearly established\" that an officer cannot shoot a dog in the absence of an \"objectively legitimate\" threat. This language is important. The court is saying that a general fear of dogs-or, specifically, pit bulls-is not enough to justify deadly force. The threat to the officer has to be an objective one.

In fact, there is not one recorded case of a police officer being killed in the line of duty by a dog. And it almost goes without saying that police are more likely to shoot the dogs owned by Black and brown people than they are to shoot white people's pets. We should stop police puppycides. There's no reason for brutality against pets. But there's also-clearly-no reason for brutality against people. We should stop cops from shooting people and hold them accountable when they do. In fact, the Eighth Circuit has laid out some perfectly reasonable rules for stripping officers of qualified immunity when the victims are human, not canine: Ignore the police report and use an objective standard of imminent, deadly violence. More from Mystal The Supreme Court Wants to Make It Even Harder to Sue Abusive Cops Elie Mystal White People Explain Racism to Me Elie Mystal Why can a court see the right answer so clearly when it comes to dogs, but loses the plot when cops turn their guns on people? Is it the tails? Would Black people get justice in front of conservative courts if we grew tails that wagged our intentions? 'Cause, let me tell you, if it would keep my kids safer, I'd sew a tail onto every pair of pants they wear. This case could get appealed to the Supreme Court, but I have every reason to expect it will be upheld, because again, the Eighth Circuit is clearly right. I hope this ruling is affirmed. In the meantime, I will continue to nurse my dream that one day Black people are treated by the white justice system with the same dignity and respect for our lives that it grants a dog. It would be an improvement.\n\nDogs. On Monday, the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (which covers Minnesota, Missouri, and some random states that have fewer people but more senators than a rush-hour 7 train) issued a ruling that pierced the veil of qualified immunity and allowed a lawsuit to go forward against a cop that shot some lady's dog. Two dogs, in fact. Apparently, qualified immunity-which courts are constantly telling us is necessary to protect cops who have to respond to dangerous situations quickly-can be thrown right out the window if the officer involved shoots a pair of canines. The facts of the case are not in dispute. In 2017, Minneapolis police responded to a house alarm that was accidentally set off at the home of Jennifer LeMay. One of her kids had tripped the alarm by mistake, and when the home security company called, LeMay told them to cancel the alert. But the cops were already on their way. One officer went to the front of the house and was met by one of LeMay's kids, who told the officer there was no problem. But a different cop, officer Michael Mays, went around the back of the house, scaled a privacy fence, and ended up in the backyard. There, the cop was greeted by the LeMays' service dogs, Ciroc and Rocko, both of whom were 5-year-old American Staffordshire Terriers (\"pit bulls\" to those who really need to watch more dog shows). Mays says Ciroc \"charged\" him, but his body camera footage shows the dog walking toward him, wagging his tail. Mays backs up, Ciroc keeps approaching, and Mays shoots it in the face. Ciroc runs away, but at that point Rocko moves towards Mays, again in a friendly, tail-wagging manner (what a good boy). Mays then shoots Rocko multiple times. Both dogs lived and will go to heaven later. The Eighth Circuit court ruled that Mays was not entitled to qualified immunity because he did not face imminent danger. The court argued that Mays violated a clear constitutional rule, finding that it is \"clearly established\" that an officer cannot shoot a dog in the absence of an \"objectively legitimate\" threat. This language is important. The court is saying that a general fear of dogs-or, specifically, pit bulls-is not enough to justify deadly force. The threat to the officer has to be an objective one.

And the all-conservative court didn't stop there. To defend himself, Mays offered his police report, which said that the dogs \"charged\" at him; the court ruled that it is not obligated to accept the police report's \"narrative as truth.\" I cannot recall reading an opinion in which the court basically called a police report a lie and declared that it was not bound to lend it any weight.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

The trial has produced no made-for-television stunts or rhetorical flourishes. There's no bloody glove, no rhyming couplets. Chauvin's defense is so basic that an attorney straight out of law school could pull it off. His lawyers are simply arguing that cops have the right to kill people, if they think they need to. That strategy might seem foolish to the untrained eye. After all, there is incontrovertible video evidence that Chauvin did not \"need\" to kill George Floyd. The video shows that Floyd posed no threat to the police or anybody else: He was prone and handcuffed while Chauvin slowly choked the life out of him over the course of eight minutes and 46 seconds. Any reasonable human being can see that Chauvin should have taken his knee off of Floyd's neck. But the defense lawyers know that the law does not require Chauvin to behave like a human being; it only requires him to behave like a cop. It doesn't hold cops to an objective standard of behavior. Instead, the law allows an individual cop's own frailties-their fears, their racist misconceptions, and even their own hysteria-to define the scope of acceptable cop behavior. If Chauvin's lawyers were better showmen, they'd be telling the jury, \"If Chauvin could imagine being hit, you must acquit.\" As it is, Chauvin's attorneys have taken to citing the 1989 Supreme Court case Graham v. Connor -and doing it so frequently that you'd think a man named Graham V. Connor told Chauvin he could get away with murder. In a way, that's exactly what the case did. Graham v. Connor changed the use-of-force guidelines for police all across the country, allowing them to be more violent and homicidal. To understand how one case has authorized brutality, you have to appreciate that our only real constitutional protection from police violence is the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on \"unreasonable search and seizure.\" \"Unreasonable\" was, naturally, poorly defined by the collection of white men who wrote and ratified the Constitution and determined that things such as slavery and genocide were totally \"reasonable\" uses of state power. Still, for most of American history, the Fourth Amendment followed a \"reasonable [white] man\" standard: The actions of the government, or its agents, were judged through the lens of what an average person would find reasonable. In practice, this allowed for plenty of abuse. Victims of police brutality had to show that officers acted \"unreasonably\" and with malicious intent. As one can imagine, it was always hard for victims (or their surviving family members) to prove that a violently homicidal police officer intended to kill them. Before camera phones, it was nearly impossible to get white people to believe the cops acted like Black people have always said they do.

Connor took this loophole and made it so big that whole police forces could simply saunter right through it. Instead of limiting police use of force to what a reasonable person might expect, the Supreme Court said that force could only be judged against what a reasonable \"officer on the scene\" would do. In the actual Graham v. Connor case, that meant the court found that a \"reasonable officer\" could slam Dethorne Graham's head into his car and break his foot, because Graham was resisting arrest, never mind that he was a diabetic going into shock who was being detained on the suspicion that he stole some orange juice-which he did not. Current Issue View our current issue Graham v. Connor was authored by the conservative Justice William Rehnquist, but the decision was unanimous. The liberals on the court thought this new \"reasonable officer\" standard was an upgrade over trying to prove malicious intent. History has proven them woefully wrong. Graham v. Connor is the reason every officer accused of murder claims \"I feared for my life.\" It's the reason most officers are never charged in the first place and the reason a police officer's saying \"I thought he had a gun\" nullifies the objective truth that a suspect was unarmed. Since Graham v. Connor , it doesn't even matter if the police are malicious or not; they can be malicious so long as they can argue that a \"reasonable police officer\" would be just as malicious under the circumstances. The result is a self-fulfilling loop of violence: As additional officers respond violently to situations, it becomes easier for other officers to argue that violence is a reasonable police response in a similar situation in the future. And Graham v. Connor does all that before we get to the racism. Those who have watched the Chauvin trial have undoubtedly noticed the string of racist bread crumbs laid out by the defense about Floyd's apparent \"strength.\" There is a long and ugly history of white people ascribing super strength to Black people as a way to justify the use of deadly force against those Black people. There's even a controversial medical term, \" excited delirium ,\" that is often cited by the police to explain why they just had to kill an unarmed Black person. At trial, Chauvin's lawyers have argued that even after Chauvin choked Floyd unconscious, he needed to keep choking him, lest Floyd regain consciousness and access his hidden reservoir of big Black power. They've argued that the crowd, the group of bystanders who filmed the murder, might have encouraged Floyd to wake up and start beating Chauvin and the other police officers at the scene-all by himself. When the defense gets to call witnesses, I half expect them to put Bruce Banner on the stand to testify that it's not gamma radiation but colored melanin that makes him swole. All of this racism isn't being offered by the defense to confuse the issue. It's not a sideshow. It goes to the heart of their Graham v. Connor defense. If they can convince even a single juror that large Black people can beat up four cops while almost dead, then they can convince them that a \"reasonable cop\" would keep his knee on a man's neck for nearly 10 minutes. That's why, during cross-examination, the defense keeps asking the cops who are testifying as witnesses against Chauvin-cops who are being called specifically to rebut Chauvin's idea of a \"reasonable officer\"-questions prefaced with \"Is it possible...?\" and \"Have you ever heard of...?\" Is it \"possible\" that Floyd could have entered an excited delirium state and then posed a threat to the officers? Have you ever \"heard\" of a person waking up from being choked unconscious and then hurting somebody? The defense lawyers aren't asking about what actually happened. In reality, Floyd never posed a threat and never was allowed to wake up, because Chauvin killed him right there on the street. His lawyers are asking about a fantasy world of what might have happened if Floyd were the supernaturally dangerous man Chauvin wanted him to be, instead of the real world where Chauvin tortured and murdered a normal man in a cold-blooded way. This will all come together during closing arguments. Chauvin's lawyers will argue that if it's \"possible\" that Floyd could have called upon the strength of his ancestors and the spirit of the Black Panther to re-breathe and crush his enemies, if Chauvin could have \"reasonably feared\" that zombie-Floyd would reanimate himself and come for Chauvin's brains, then a \"reasonable police officer\" would continue suffocating him until there was no chance of revival. \"Because police officers have the right to go home.\" That's an entirely valid legal argument under our current laws. The legal debate about whether an officer's actions are justified now takes place within the hysterical headspace and fever dreams of a cop, instead of on the plane of objective reality. I don't know if the cop defense will work this time. First of all, Black people do not have superpowers, and it is unreasonable to think that they do. Secondly, I'm not the only one saying that: This time, t here are other cops testifying against Chauvin , arguing that what he did \"absolutely\" defied police training, policy, and procedure. I think it's pretty hard to argue that you are a reasonable cop when other cops testify against you. The Chauvin Trial The Blue Wall of Silence Is Crumbling Around Derek Chauvin Elie Mystal Arradondo Condemned Him, but All Cops Are Derek Chauvin Alyssa Oursler and Anna DalCortivo But the fact that this is even considered a valid defense strategy illustrates, once again, that our laws are objectively pro-police brutality. The Supreme Court has given cops license to kill people, and the only limit it has placed on that violence is what another cop would do in the same situation. It's like a chef telling sheep the wolf gets to set the menu. Congress could repudiate the court's holding in Graham v. Connor and set a new national use-of-force guideline tomorrow, if it wanted to. State governments could define \"reasonable\" force as something more robust than \"whatever the cops say,\" if they wanted to. Many Democratic presidential candidates, from Julián Castro to Cory Booker to Kamala Harris, supported new national use-of-force guidelines and restrictions that, if adopted by states, could render the Chauvin defense inoperable for future murderous cops. But the person who won, President Joe Biden, was not one of them. Biden favors community policing, accountability review boards, and bringing people together to \"figure it out,\" but he hasn't been out front on changing the actual legal standard cops use to get away with murder (or packing the Supreme Court with the kind of liberals who will do it on their own). Unless Biden and the Democrats use their moment of total control of government to change the Graham v. Connor standard, the next cop who shoots an unarmed Black person will claim he feared for his life. And the next one after that. And all the other next ones who will brutalize and kill in this country that refuses to address the state-sponsored terrorism directed against Black bodies. When you watch the Chauvin trial and listen to the defense put on their case, remember that all the victim blaming, fearmongering, and racism is not a fancy lawyer trick aimed at subverting justice. It's a policy choice, made by the Supreme Court.\n\nThat strategy might seem foolish to the untrained eye. After all, there is incontrovertible video evidence that Chauvin did not \"need\" to kill George Floyd.

Connor took this loophole and made it so big that whole police forces could simply saunter right through it. Instead of limiting police use of force to what a reasonable person might expect, the Supreme Court said that force could only be judged against what a reasonable \"officer on the scene\" would do. In the actual Graham v. Connor case, that meant the court found that a \"reasonable officer\" could slam Dethorne Graham's head into his car and break his foot, because Graham was resisting arrest, never mind that he was a diabetic going into shock who was being detained on the suspicion that he stole some orange juice-which he did not. Current Issue View our current issue Graham v. Connor was authored by the conservative Justice William Rehnquist, but the decision was unanimous. The liberals on the court thought this new \"reasonable officer\" standard was an upgrade over trying to prove malicious intent. History has proven them woefully wrong. Graham v. Connor is the reason every officer accused of murder claims \"I feared for my life.\" It's the reason most officers are never charged in the first place and the reason a police officer's saying \"I thought he had a gun\" nullifies the objective truth that a suspect was unarmed. Since Graham v. Connor , it doesn't even matter if the police are malicious or not; they can be malicious so long as they can argue that a \"reasonable police officer\" would be just as malicious under the circumstances. The result is a self-fulfilling loop of violence: As additional officers respond violently to situations, it becomes easier for other officers to argue that violence is a reasonable police response in a similar situation in the future. And Graham v. Connor does all that before we get to the racism. Those who have watched the Chauvin trial have undoubtedly noticed the string of racist bread crumbs laid out by the defense about Floyd's apparent \"strength.\" There is a long and ugly history of white people ascribing super strength to Black people as a way to justify the use of deadly force against those Black people. There's even a controversial medical term, \" excited delirium ,\" that is often cited by the police to explain why they just had to kill an unarmed Black person. At trial, Chauvin's lawyers have argued that even after Chauvin choked Floyd unconscious, he needed to keep choking him, lest Floyd regain consciousness and access his hidden reservoir of big Black power. They've argued that the crowd, the group of bystanders who filmed the murder, might have encouraged Floyd to wake up and start beating Chauvin and the other police officers at the scene-all by himself. When the defense gets to call witnesses, I half expect them to put Bruce Banner on the stand to testify that it's not gamma radiation but colored melanin that makes him swole. All of this racism isn't being offered by the defense to confuse the issue. It's not a sideshow. It goes to the heart of their Graham v. Connor defense. If they can convince even a single juror that large Black people can beat up four cops while almost dead, then they can convince them that a \"reasonable cop\" would keep his knee on a man's neck for nearly 10 minutes. That's why, during cross-examination, the defense keeps asking the cops who are testifying as witnesses against Chauvin-cops who are being called specifically to rebut Chauvin's idea of a \"reasonable officer\"-questions prefaced with \"Is it possible...?\" and \"Have you ever heard of...?\" Is it \"possible\" that Floyd could have entered an excited delirium state and then posed a threat to the officers? Have you ever \"heard\" of a person waking up from being choked unconscious and then hurting somebody? The defense lawyers aren't asking about what actually happened. In reality, Floyd never posed a threat and never was allowed to wake up, because Chauvin killed him right there on the street. His lawyers are asking about a fantasy world of what might have happened if Floyd were the supernaturally dangerous man Chauvin wanted him to be, instead of the real world where Chauvin tortured and murdered a normal man in a cold-blooded way. This will all come together during closing arguments. Chauvin's lawyers will argue that if it's \"possible\" that Floyd could have called upon the strength of his ancestors and the spirit of the Black Panther to re-breathe and crush his enemies, if Chauvin could have \"reasonably feared\" that zombie-Floyd would reanimate himself and come for Chauvin's brains, then a \"reasonable police officer\" would continue suffocating him until there was no chance of revival. \"Because police officers have the right to go home.\" That's an entirely valid legal argument under our current laws. The legal debate about whether an officer's actions are justified now takes place within the hysterical headspace and fever dreams of a cop, instead of on the plane of objective reality. I don't know if the cop defense will work this time. First of all, Black people do not have superpowers, and it is unreasonable to think that they do. Secondly, I'm not the only one saying that: This time, t here are other cops testifying against Chauvin , arguing that what he did \"absolutely\" defied police training, policy, and procedure. I think it's pretty hard to argue that you are a reasonable cop when other cops testify against you. The Chauvin Trial The Blue Wall of Silence Is Crumbling Around Derek Chauvin Elie Mystal Arradondo Condemned Him, but All Cops Are Derek Chauvin Alyssa Oursler and Anna DalCortivo But the fact that this is even considered a valid defense strategy illustrates, once again, that our laws are objectively pro-police brutality. The Supreme Court has given cops license to kill people, and the only limit it has placed on that violence is what another cop would do in the same situation. It's like a chef telling sheep the wolf gets to set the menu. Congress could repudiate the court's holding in Graham v. Connor and set a new national use-of-force guideline tomorrow, if it wanted to. State governments could define \"reasonable\" force as something more robust than \"whatever the cops say,\" if they wanted to. Many Democratic presidential candidates, from Julián Castro to Cory Booker to Kamala Harris, supported new national use-of-force guidelines and restrictions that, if adopted by states, could render the Chauvin defense inoperable for future murderous cops. But the person who won, President Joe Biden, was not one of them. Biden favors community policing, accountability review boards, and bringing people together to \"figure it out,\" but he hasn't been out front on changing the actual legal standard cops use to get away with murder (or packing the Supreme Court with the kind of liberals who will do it on their own). Unless Biden and the Democrats use their moment of total control of government to change the Graham v. Connor standard, the next cop who shoots an unarmed Black person will claim he feared for his life. And the next one after that. And all the other next ones who will brutalize and kill in this country that refuses to address the state-sponsored terrorism directed against Black bodies. When you watch the Chauvin trial and listen to the defense put on their case, remember that all the victim blaming, fearmongering, and racism is not a fancy lawyer trick aimed at subverting justice. It's a policy choice, made by the Supreme Court.\n\nAs it is, Chauvin's attorneys have taken to citing the 1989 Supreme Court case Graham v. Connor -and doing it so frequently that you'd think a man named Graham V. Connor told Chauvin he could get away with murder. In a way, that's exactly what the case did. Graham v. Connor changed the use-of-force guidelines for police all across the country, allowing them to be more violent and homicidal. To understand how one case has authorized brutality, you have to appreciate that our only real constitutional protection from police violence is the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on \"unreasonable search and seizure.\" \"Unreasonable\" was, naturally, poorly defined by the collection of white men who wrote and ratified the Constitution and determined that things such as slavery and genocide were totally \"reasonable\" uses of state power. Still, for most of American history, the Fourth Amendment followed a \"reasonable [white] man\" standard: The actions of the government, or its agents, were judged through the lens of what an average person would find reasonable. In practice, this allowed for plenty of abuse. Victims of police brutality had to show that officers acted \"unreasonably\" and with malicious intent. As one can imagine, it was always hard for victims (or their surviving family members) to prove that a violently homicidal police officer intended to kill them. Before camera phones, it was nearly impossible to get white people to believe the cops acted like Black people have always said they do.

It's a policy choice, made by the Supreme Court.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nGraham v. Connor took this loophole and made it so big that whole police forces could simply saunter right through it. Instead of limiting police use of force to what a reasonable person might expect, the Supreme Court said that force could only be judged against what a reasonable \"officer on the scene\" would do. In the actual Graham v. Connor case, that meant the court found that a \"reasonable officer\" could slam Dethorne Graham's head into his car and break his foot, because Graham was resisting arrest, never mind that he was a diabetic going into shock who was being detained on the suspicion that he stole some orange juice-which he did not. Current Issue View our current issue Graham v. Connor was authored by the conservative Justice William Rehnquist, but the decision was unanimous. The liberals on the court thought this new \"reasonable officer\" standard was an upgrade over trying to prove malicious intent. History has proven them woefully wrong. Graham v. Connor is the reason every officer accused of murder claims \"I feared for my life.\" It's the reason most officers are never charged in the first place and the reason a police officer's saying \"I thought he had a gun\" nullifies the objective truth that a suspect was unarmed. Since Graham v. Connor , it doesn't even matter if the police are malicious or not; they can be malicious so long as they can argue that a \"reasonable police officer\" would be just as malicious under the circumstances. The result is a self-fulfilling loop of violence: As additional officers respond violently to situations, it becomes easier for other officers to argue that violence is a reasonable police response in a similar situation in the future. And Graham v. Connor does all that before we get to the racism. Those who have watched the Chauvin trial have undoubtedly noticed the string of racist bread crumbs laid out by the defense about Floyd's apparent \"strength.\" There is a long and ugly history of white people ascribing super strength to Black people as a way to justify the use of deadly force against those Black people. There's even a controversial medical term, \" excited delirium ,\" that is often cited by the police to explain why they just had to kill an unarmed Black person. At trial, Chauvin's lawyers have argued that even after Chauvin choked Floyd unconscious, he needed to keep choking him, lest Floyd regain consciousness and access his hidden reservoir of big Black power. They've argued that the crowd, the group of bystanders who filmed the murder, might have encouraged Floyd to wake up and start beating Chauvin and the other police officers at the scene-all by himself. When the defense gets to call witnesses, I half expect them to put Bruce Banner on the stand to testify that it's not gamma radiation but colored melanin that makes him swole. All of this racism isn't being offered by the defense to confuse the issue. It's not a sideshow. It goes to the heart of their Graham v. Connor defense. If they can convince even a single juror that large Black people can beat up four cops while almost dead, then they can convince them that a \"reasonable cop\" would keep his knee on a man's neck for nearly 10 minutes. That's why, during cross-examination, the defense keeps asking the cops who are testifying as witnesses against Chauvin-cops who are being called specifically to rebut Chauvin's idea of a \"reasonable officer\"-questions prefaced with \"Is it possible...?\" and \"Have you ever heard of...?\" Is it \"possible\" that Floyd could have entered an excited delirium state and then posed a threat to the officers? Have you ever \"heard\" of a person waking up from being choked unconscious and then hurting somebody? The defense lawyers aren't asking about what actually happened. In reality, Floyd never posed a threat and never was allowed to wake up, because Chauvin killed him right there on the street. His lawyers are asking about a fantasy world of what might have happened if Floyd were the supernaturally dangerous man Chauvin wanted him to be, instead of the real world where Chauvin tortured and murdered a normal man in a cold-blooded way. This will all come together during closing arguments. Chauvin's lawyers will argue that if it's \"possible\" that Floyd could have called upon the strength of his ancestors and the spirit of the Black Panther to re-breathe and crush his enemies, if Chauvin could have \"reasonably feared\" that zombie-Floyd would reanimate himself and come for Chauvin's brains, then a \"reasonable police officer\" would continue suffocating him until there was no chance of revival. \"Because police officers have the right to go home.\" That's an entirely valid legal argument under our current laws. The legal debate about whether an officer's actions are justified now takes place within the hysterical headspace and fever dreams of a cop, instead of on the plane of objective reality. I don't know if the cop defense will work this time. First of all, Black people do not have superpowers, and it is unreasonable to think that they do. Secondly, I'm not the only one saying that: This time, t here are other cops testifying against Chauvin , arguing that what he did \"absolutely\" defied police training, policy, and procedure. I think it's pretty hard to argue that you are a reasonable cop when other cops testify against you. The Chauvin Trial The Blue Wall of Silence Is Crumbling Around Derek Chauvin Elie Mystal Arradondo Condemned Him, but All Cops Are Derek Chauvin Alyssa Oursler and Anna DalCortivo But the fact that this is even considered a valid defense strategy illustrates, once again, that our laws are objectively pro-police brutality. The Supreme Court has given cops license to kill people, and the only limit it has placed on that violence is what another cop would do in the same situation. It's like a chef telling sheep the wolf gets to set the menu. Congress could repudiate the court's holding in Graham v. Connor and set a new national use-of-force guideline tomorrow, if it wanted to. State governments could define \"reasonable\" force as something more robust than \"whatever the cops say,\" if they wanted to. Many Democratic presidential candidates, from Julián Castro to Cory Booker to Kamala Harris, supported new national use-of-force guidelines and restrictions that, if adopted by states, could render the Chauvin defense inoperable for future murderous cops. But the person who won, President Joe Biden, was not one of them. Biden favors community policing, accountability review boards, and bringing people together to \"figure it out,\" but he hasn't been out front on changing the actual legal standard cops use to get away with murder (or packing the Supreme Court with the kind of liberals who will do it on their own). Unless Biden and the Democrats use their moment of total control of government to change the Graham v. Connor standard, the next cop who shoots an unarmed Black person will claim he feared for his life. And the next one after that. And all the other next ones who will brutalize and kill in this country that refuses to address the state-sponsored terrorism directed against Black bodies.

Chauvin's lawyers will argue that if it's \"possible\" that Floyd could have called upon the strength of his ancestors and the spirit of the Black Panther to re-breathe and crush his enemies, if Chauvin could have \"reasonably feared\" that zombie-Floyd would reanimate himself and come for Chauvin's brains, then a \"reasonable police officer\" would continue suffocating him until there was no chance of revival. \"Because police officers have the right to go home.\" That's an entirely valid legal argument under our current laws. The legal debate about whether an officer's actions are justified now takes place within the hysterical headspace and fever dreams of a cop, instead of on the plane of objective reality. I don't know if the cop defense will work this time. First of all, Black people do not have superpowers, and it is unreasonable to think that they do. Secondly, I'm not the only one saying that: This time, t here are other cops testifying against Chauvin , arguing that what he did \"absolutely\" defied police training, policy, and procedure. I think it's pretty hard to argue that you are a reasonable cop when other cops testify against you. The Chauvin Trial The Blue Wall of Silence Is Crumbling Around Derek Chauvin Elie Mystal Arradondo Condemned Him, but All Cops Are Derek Chauvin Alyssa Oursler and Anna DalCortivo But the fact that this is even considered a valid defense strategy illustrates, once again, that our laws are objectively pro-police brutality. The Supreme Court has given cops license to kill people, and the only limit it has placed on that violence is what another cop would do in the same situation. It's like a chef telling sheep the wolf gets to set the menu. Congress could repudiate the court's holding in Graham v. Connor and set a new national use-of-force guideline tomorrow, if it wanted to. State governments could define \"reasonable\" force as something more robust than \"whatever the cops say,\" if they wanted to. Many Democratic presidential candidates, from Julián Castro to Cory Booker to Kamala Harris, supported new national use-of-force guidelines and restrictions that, if adopted by states, could render the Chauvin defense inoperable for future murderous cops. But the person who won, President Joe Biden, was not one of them. Biden favors community policing, accountability review boards, and bringing people together to \"figure it out,\" but he hasn't been out front on changing the actual legal standard cops use to get away with murder (or packing the Supreme Court with the kind of liberals who will do it on their own). Unless Biden and the Democrats use their moment of total control of government to change the Graham v. Connor standard, the next cop who shoots an unarmed Black person will claim he feared for his life. And the next one after that. And all the other next ones who will brutalize and kill in this country that refuses to address the state-sponsored terrorism directed against Black bodies. When you watch the Chauvin trial and listen to the defense put on their case, remember that all the victim blaming, fearmongering, and racism is not a fancy lawyer trick aimed at subverting justice.

I had walked along the protesters for a short distance, a block or two, from the elementary school where Philando Castile worked serving lunch to kids, to the governor's house. At the front of the protest was Castile's family and his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, crying as she held up a \"Black Lives Matter\" T-shirt-Reynolds, along with her 4-year-old daughter, witnessed a police officer shoot and kill Castile in his car after he announced to the officer that he had a licensed gun in the glove compartment. The protest was unlike any other I'd covered. It was truly diverse. There were so many residents of St. Paul's black community there; the Castiles, a childhood friend told me, were \"a big family\" in St. Paul. And there were lots of people from his school, colleagues who attested to his warm and friendly character. He was one of those \"perfect negroes,\" I thought to myself, one of the ones you can't mess up with a flimsy story about how he sold loose cigarettes, like Eric Garner was. \"There probably wasn't even a story raising questions about him stealing a cigarillo,\" I thought to myself, sickly hopeful. Since all human beings are fallible, \"perfect negroes\" are an impossibility, but I thought, because I was desperate, that Philando Castile might be one. The only time I held out hope that there might be consequences for the police following the shooting death of a black American was for Tamir Rice, a child so young that to create a myth around him being a big, bad miscreant would be impossible. I was wrong there. And I'm wrong here. The \"perfect negro,\" a description so unfair it's absurd, doesn't work. The not-guilty verdict, returned after an initially deadlocked jury and after more than 25 hours of deliberation, proves that even in a liberal enclave like the one Castile lived and worked in, having a licensed gun, like the one Castile had, and having a 4-year-old girl in the back of the vehicle he is operating cannot bring worth to a black man's life in the eyes of a cruelly racist justice system. The officer, Jeronimo Yanez, who is Latino, shot Castile in the head last July in a suburb right outside St. Paul. Reynolds, who somehow had the presence to capture it on video, broadcast the minutes after his shooting on Facebook Live. That didn't make a difference, either. Soon after that hot, sticky protest outside the governor's house, Governor Mark Dayton said that Castile's being black had something to do with his death , but that didn't make a difference, either. Technology, political will, nothing makes a difference. \"The system continues to fail black people,\" said Castile's mother, Valerie, following the verdict. \"My son loved this city and this city killed my son and let the murderer get away.\" I remember, again, what Castile's childhood friend told me. They're a \"big family\" in St. Paul. Now they're less big, and the city he loved so much, the one that in death couldn't find a way to soil his character, couldn't bring his killer to justice.\n\nThe protest was unlike any other I'd covered.

He was one of those \"perfect negroes,\" I thought to myself, one of the ones you can't mess up with a flimsy story about how he sold loose cigarettes, like Eric Garner was. \"There probably wasn't even a story raising questions about him stealing a cigarillo,\" I thought to myself, sickly hopeful. Since all human beings are fallible, \"perfect negroes\" are an impossibility, but I thought, because I was desperate, that Philando Castile might be one. The only time I held out hope that there might be consequences for the police following the shooting death of a black American was for Tamir Rice, a child so young that to create a myth around him being a big, bad miscreant would be impossible. I was wrong there. And I'm wrong here. The \"perfect negro,\" a description so unfair it's absurd, doesn't work. The not-guilty verdict, returned after an initially deadlocked jury and after more than 25 hours of deliberation, proves that even in a liberal enclave like the one Castile lived and worked in, having a licensed gun, like the one Castile had, and having a 4-year-old girl in the back of the vehicle he is operating cannot bring worth to a black man's life in the eyes of a cruelly racist justice system. The officer, Jeronimo Yanez, who is Latino, shot Castile in the head last July in a suburb right outside St. Paul. Reynolds, who somehow had the presence to capture it on video, broadcast the minutes after his shooting on Facebook Live. That didn't make a difference, either. Soon after that hot, sticky protest outside the governor's house, Governor Mark Dayton said that Castile's being black had something to do with his death , but that didn't make a difference, either. Technology, political will, nothing makes a difference. \"The system continues to fail black people,\" said Castile's mother, Valerie, following the verdict. \"My son loved this city and this city killed my son and let the murderer get away.\" I remember, again, what Castile's childhood friend told me. They're a \"big family\" in St. Paul. Now they're less big, and the city he loved so much, the one that in death couldn't find a way to soil his character, couldn't bring his killer to justice.\n\nThe \"perfect negro,\" a description so unfair it's absurd, doesn't work.

You can read our Privacy Policy here.\n\nGeorge Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis police in broad daylight this Memorial Day weekend. We know he was murdered because a video shows Floyd handcuffed and pinned under the knee of an officer who was crushing his throat into the pavement. Floyd could be heard telling the officer that he couldn't breathe. He could be heard telling the officer, \"Don't kill me.\" Onlookers were heard begging the officer to stop killing the man. The police didn't stop. The police are never going to voluntarily stop killing black and brown people. The killings will continue until the majority of white people in this country make the killings stop. The police work for white people, and they know it. White people know it too. Deep down, white people know exactly whom the police are supposed to protect and serve, and they damn well know it's not black and brown people. We saw some video of that too , over the weekend. Amy Cooper, who is white, was walking in Central Park with her dog. Her dog was off its leash, in violation of park rules and city ordinances . A bird-watcher, Christian Cooper, who happens to be black, asked her to follow the rules. Instead of just putting her dog on a leash, she decided to use his race against him. She first threatened to call the cops and then did just that, claiming that an \"African American man\" was \"threatening\" her in the park. The very instant that Amy Cooper felt she needed the support of institutionalized racism to get her through her morning, she knew exactly where to find it. She knew exactly whom to call. She was the one in violation of the rules. Yet there she was, calling the cops. No doubt, it wouldn't have even occurred to her to call them to the scene of her lawlessness if not for the way cops tend to harass, jail, and yes, murder people who look like Christian Cooper. Or George Floyd. Or Eric Garner. Or Terence Crutcher. Or Alton Sterling. Or Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. Or Amadou Diallo. When Amy Cooper threatened to call the cops, she was threatening to take a black man's life. It's a threat that works only because cops are so consistently willing to murder black and brown men. She was able to dial up 400 years of racial oppression and violence on her phone more easily than I am able to order a pizza. It doesn't have to be this way. It is entirely within the scope of white power in America to rein in its police. White people could elect mayors and prosecutors who are committed to police reform. White judges and juries could hold the police accountable for their crimes. White Republicans could challenge and eventually break the power of police unions just as easily as they break teachers' unions or any labor union that stands in the way of rapacious capitalism. If a majority of white people decided, today, that racist policing should end, we'd start seeing changes to police forces by the middle of next week.

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins Current Issue View our current issue But white people do not stop their cops. A majority of them clearly want the cops to behave this way. They want the viciousness. They want the horror. Why? It's not just that a majority of white America probably thinks Amy Cooper did the right thing in her specific situation; it's that they think they will one day be in a situation in which such actions are justified. One day they might be alone in a park around a strange black man, and what might happen then? Sure, Christian Cooper seems like a \"nice\" black person, but what if he weren't? What if he were a \"mean\" or \"aggressive\" black person, and you were just alone in the park, illegally walking your dog? Best to keep brutal, dangerous, and racist cops around, because, hey, you never know. White people think they might one day be Amy Cooper, and they want to have somebody to call, just in case. They know they'll never be Christian Cooper. Making a society that's safe for Christian Cooper to bird-watch while black just isn't the most important thing to a majority of white America. Oh, a bunch of white people will be performatively outraged and saddened by Amy Cooper's behavior. They'll gladly participate in her online dragging. But when it comes to neutering the police so that the Amy Coopers of the world don't have that kind of privilege and power over the Christian Coopers of the world, most of those white people will fall silent. By the same token, white people will participate in the outrage over specific murders, like George Floyd's and Breonna Taylor 's. They will join in calls to bring individual racists to account, like Amy Cooper and Gregory and Travis McMichael . But when it comes time to deal with institutional purveyors of racism, as opposed to individual bad actors, the outrage and support of the white community is not there. We see that disconnect on display now as police use the coronavirus to threaten and harass black and brown people. The Center for Constitutional Rights, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the Legal Aid Society have joined a motion asking courts to investigate the New York Police Department's enforcement of social distancing during the pandemic. The legal motion suggests that the NYPD is in violation of court orders imposed on the city because of its unconstitutional stop-and-frisk program. The lawyers are asking for an immediate moratorium on NYPD enforcement of social distancing orders. Since March, 81 percent of social distancing violations issued by the NYPD have been made against black or Latinx people. And those stats simply confirm what our eyes are already telling us. We've all seen the pictures of white people gathered in parks as police officers politely hand out masks but no tickets, just as we've all seen videos, shot just a neighborhood away, showing black and brown people getting beaten and manhandled by the cops for allegedly violating social distancing protocols. Anybody could have seen this coming. In fact, I wrote about how this would happen once the NYPD was empowered to enforce social distancing. I don't have a crystal ball. I'm not a wizard. I just know that cops cannot be trusted with the power they already have-and should never be given any more. Putting the NYPD in charge of enforcing social distancing was a decision that was so obviously going to lead to racially biased enforcement of the orders that one has to assume it was intentional. Most black people know what happens when cops are given power, but we can't get 51 percent of white people to do anything about it. We can't get New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who centered his first mayoral campaign on his opposition to stop-and-frisk, to take a stand against the racist actions of his police force. We can't get the white people who are willing to gather in large crowds to enjoy a spring day to gather in a large crowd to protest at City Hall.

White people are not ignorant, and they're not blind. They see the racial bias in policing, and they know that bias benefits them. They know they're not going to catch a beatdown for not wearing a mask. They know they're not going to be choked to death on the street in broad daylight. They know that having racist police officers around gives them incredible power, and power makes people feel good, even if they never use it. I've been in rooms where I've heard white people congratulate themselves for not calling the cops on some black person, as if declining the option to use terrorism against a black person was some kind of proof of liberal good faith.

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins Current Issue View our current issue But white people do not stop their cops. A majority of them clearly want the cops to behave this way. They want the viciousness. They want the horror. Why? It's not just that a majority of white America probably thinks Amy Cooper did the right thing in her specific situation; it's that they think they will one day be in a situation in which such actions are justified. One day they might be alone in a park around a strange black man, and what might happen then? Sure, Christian Cooper seems like a \"nice\" black person, but what if he weren't? What if he were a \"mean\" or \"aggressive\" black person, and you were just alone in the park, illegally walking your dog? Best to keep brutal, dangerous, and racist cops around, because, hey, you never know. White people think they might one day be Amy Cooper, and they want to have somebody to call, just in case. They know they'll never be Christian Cooper. Making a society that's safe for Christian Cooper to bird-watch while black just isn't the most important thing to a majority of white America. Oh, a bunch of white people will be performatively outraged and saddened by Amy Cooper's behavior. They'll gladly participate in her online dragging. But when it comes to neutering the police so that the Amy Coopers of the world don't have that kind of privilege and power over the Christian Coopers of the world, most of those white people will fall silent. By the same token, white people will participate in the outrage over specific murders, like George Floyd's and Breonna Taylor 's. They will join in calls to bring individual racists to account, like Amy Cooper and Gregory and Travis McMichael . But when it comes time to deal with institutional purveyors of racism, as opposed to individual bad actors, the outrage and support of the white community is not there. We see that disconnect on display now as police use the coronavirus to threaten and harass black and brown people. The Center for Constitutional Rights, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the Legal Aid Society have joined a motion asking courts to investigate the New York Police Department's enforcement of social distancing during the pandemic. The legal motion suggests that the NYPD is in violation of court orders imposed on the city because of its unconstitutional stop-and-frisk program. The lawyers are asking for an immediate moratorium on NYPD enforcement of social distancing orders. Since March, 81 percent of social distancing violations issued by the NYPD have been made against black or Latinx people. And those stats simply confirm what our eyes are already telling us. We've all seen the pictures of white people gathered in parks as police officers politely hand out masks but no tickets, just as we've all seen videos, shot just a neighborhood away, showing black and brown people getting beaten and manhandled by the cops for allegedly violating social distancing protocols. Anybody could have seen this coming. In fact, I wrote about how this would happen once the NYPD was empowered to enforce social distancing. I don't have a crystal ball. I'm not a wizard. I just know that cops cannot be trusted with the power they already have-and should never be given any more. Putting the NYPD in charge of enforcing social distancing was a decision that was so obviously going to lead to racially biased enforcement of the orders that one has to assume it was intentional. Most black people know what happens when cops are given power, but we can't get 51 percent of white people to do anything about it. We can't get New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who centered his first mayoral campaign on his opposition to stop-and-frisk, to take a stand against the racist actions of his police force. We can't get the white people who are willing to gather in large crowds to enjoy a spring day to gather in a large crowd to protest at City Hall.

White people are not ignorant, and they're not blind. They see the racial bias in policing, and they know that bias benefits them. They know they're not going to catch a beatdown for not wearing a mask. They know they're not going to be choked to death on the street in broad daylight. They know that having racist police officers around gives them incredible power, and power makes people feel good, even if they never use it. I've been in rooms where I've heard white people congratulate themselves for not calling the cops on some black person, as if declining the option to use terrorism against a black person was some kind of proof of liberal good faith. Black people have tried, again and again, to end the horror of police brutality against us. We march, we protest, we educate, we vote. We teach our children a special set of rules. We produce art and literature and music documenting our pain. We start organizations and movements. And yet we can't achieve structural change in policing because a majority of white America always sets its will against us. White people in our own communities, our alleged friends and neighbors, consistently vote and act in ways that empower the police and ignore their brutality against us. White people could put their police dogs on a leash. But they won't. And more black and brown people will get mauled and killed until white people decide to do better. More black people will die like George Floyd, because most white people want to live like Amy Cooper.\n\nThe very instant that Amy Cooper felt she needed the support of institutionalized racism to get her through her morning, she knew exactly where to find it. She knew exactly whom to call. She was the one in violation of the rules. Yet there she was, calling the cops. No doubt, it wouldn't have even occurred to her to call them to the scene of her lawlessness if not for the way cops tend to harass, jail, and yes, murder people who look like Christian Cooper. Or George Floyd. Or Eric Garner. Or Terence Crutcher. Or Alton Sterling. Or Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. Or Amadou Diallo. When Amy Cooper threatened to call the cops, she was threatening to take a black man's life. It's a threat that works only because cops are so consistently willing to murder black and brown men. She was able to dial up 400 years of racial oppression and violence on her phone more easily than I am able to order a pizza. It doesn't have to be this way. It is entirely within the scope of white power in America to rein in its police. White people could elect mayors and prosecutors who are committed to police reform. White judges and juries could hold the police accountable for their crimes. White Republicans could challenge and eventually break the power of police unions just as easily as they break teachers' unions or any labor union that stands in the way of rapacious capitalism. If a majority of white people decided, today, that racist policing should end, we'd start seeing changes to police forces by the middle of next week.

Oh, a bunch of white people will be performatively outraged and saddened by Amy Cooper's behavior. They'll gladly participate in her online dragging. But when it comes to neutering the police so that the Amy Coopers of the world don't have that kind of privilege and power over the Christian Coopers of the world, most of those white people will fall silent. By the same token, white people will participate in the outrage over specific murders, like George Floyd's and Breonna Taylor 's. They will join in calls to bring individual racists to account, like Amy Cooper and Gregory and Travis McMichael . But when it comes time to deal with institutional purveyors of racism, as opposed to individual bad actors, the outrage and support of the white community is not there. We see that disconnect on display now as police use the coronavirus to threaten and harass black and brown people. The Center for Constitutional Rights, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the Legal Aid Society have joined a motion asking courts to investigate the New York Police Department's enforcement of social distancing during the pandemic. The legal motion suggests that the NYPD is in violation of court orders imposed on the city because of its unconstitutional stop-and-frisk program. The lawyers are asking for an immediate moratorium on NYPD enforcement of social distancing orders. Since March, 81 percent of social distancing violations issued by the NYPD have been made against black or Latinx people. And those stats simply confirm what our eyes are already telling us. We've all seen the pictures of white people gathered in parks as police officers politely hand out masks but no tickets, just as we've all seen videos, shot just a neighborhood away, showing black and brown people getting beaten and manhandled by the cops for allegedly violating social distancing protocols. Anybody could have seen this coming. In fact, I wrote about how this would happen once the NYPD was empowered to enforce social distancing. I don't have a crystal ball. I'm not a wizard. I just know that cops cannot be trusted with the power they already have-and should never be given any more. Putting the NYPD in charge of enforcing social distancing was a decision that was so obviously going to lead to racially biased enforcement of the orders that one has to assume it was intentional. Most black people know what happens when cops are given power, but we can't get 51 percent of white people to do anything about it. We can't get New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who centered his first mayoral campaign on his opposition to stop-and-frisk, to take a stand against the racist actions of his police force. We can't get the white people who are willing to gather in large crowds to enjoy a spring day to gather in a large crowd to protest at City Hall.

White people are not ignorant, and they're not blind. They see the racial bias in policing, and they know that bias benefits them. They know they're not going to catch a beatdown for not wearing a mask. They know they're not going to be choked to death on the street in broad daylight. They know that having racist police officers around gives them incredible power, and power makes people feel good, even if they never use it. I've been in rooms where I've heard white people congratulate themselves for not calling the cops on some black person, as if declining the option to use terrorism against a black person was some kind of proof of liberal good faith.

And yet we can't achieve structural change in policing because a majority of white America always sets its will against us. White people in our own communities, our alleged friends and neighbors, consistently vote and act in ways that empower the police and ignore their brutality against us.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

We know he was murdered because a video shows Floyd handcuffed and pinned under the knee of an officer who was crushing his throat into the pavement. Floyd could be heard telling the officer that he couldn't breathe. He could be heard telling the officer, \"Don't kill me.\" Onlookers were heard begging the officer to stop killing the man. The police didn't stop. The police are never going to voluntarily stop killing black and brown people. The killings will continue until the majority of white people in this country make the killings stop. The police work for white people, and they know it. White people know it too. Deep down, white people know exactly whom the police are supposed to protect and serve, and they damn well know it's not black and brown people. We saw some video of that too , over the weekend. Amy Cooper, who is white, was walking in Central Park with her dog. Her dog was off its leash, in violation of park rules and city ordinances . A bird-watcher, Christian Cooper, who happens to be black, asked her to follow the rules. Instead of just putting her dog on a leash, she decided to use his race against him. She first threatened to call the cops and then did just that, claiming that an \"African American man\" was \"threatening\" her in the park. The very instant that Amy Cooper felt she needed the support of institutionalized racism to get her through her morning, she knew exactly where to find it. She knew exactly whom to call. She was the one in violation of the rules. Yet there she was, calling the cops. No doubt, it wouldn't have even occurred to her to call them to the scene of her lawlessness if not for the way cops tend to harass, jail, and yes, murder people who look like Christian Cooper. Or George Floyd. Or Eric Garner. Or Terence Crutcher. Or Alton Sterling. Or Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. Or Amadou Diallo. When Amy Cooper threatened to call the cops, she was threatening to take a black man's life. It's a threat that works only because cops are so consistently willing to murder black and brown men. She was able to dial up 400 years of racial oppression and violence on her phone more easily than I am able to order a pizza. It doesn't have to be this way. It is entirely within the scope of white power in America to rein in its police. White people could elect mayors and prosecutors who are committed to police reform. White judges and juries could hold the police accountable for their crimes. White Republicans could challenge and eventually break the power of police unions just as easily as they break teachers' unions or any labor union that stands in the way of rapacious capitalism. If a majority of white people decided, today, that racist policing should end, we'd start seeing changes to police forces by the middle of next week.

A majority of them clearly want the cops to behave this way. They want the viciousness. They want the horror. Why? It's not just that a majority of white America probably thinks Amy Cooper did the right thing in her specific situation; it's that they think they will one day be in a situation in which such actions are justified. One day they might be alone in a park around a strange black man, and what might happen then? Sure, Christian Cooper seems like a \"nice\" black person, but what if he weren't? What if he were a \"mean\" or \"aggressive\" black person, and you were just alone in the park, illegally walking your dog? Best to keep brutal, dangerous, and racist cops around, because, hey, you never know. White people think they might one day be Amy Cooper, and they want to have somebody to call, just in case. They know they'll never be Christian Cooper. Making a society that's safe for Christian Cooper to bird-watch while black just isn't the most important thing to a majority of white America. Oh, a bunch of white people will be performatively outraged and saddened by Amy Cooper's behavior. They'll gladly participate in her online dragging. But when it comes to neutering the police so that the Amy Coopers of the world don't have that kind of privilege and power over the Christian Coopers of the world, most of those white people will fall silent. By the same token, white people will participate in the outrage over specific murders, like George Floyd's and Breonna Taylor 's. They will join in calls to bring individual racists to account, like Amy Cooper and Gregory and Travis McMichael . But when it comes time to deal with institutional purveyors of racism, as opposed to individual bad actors, the outrage and support of the white community is not there. We see that disconnect on display now as police use the coronavirus to threaten and harass black and brown people. The Center for Constitutional Rights, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the Legal Aid Society have joined a motion asking courts to investigate the New York Police Department's enforcement of social distancing during the pandemic. The legal motion suggests that the NYPD is in violation of court orders imposed on the city because of its unconstitutional stop-and-frisk program. The lawyers are asking for an immediate moratorium on NYPD enforcement of social distancing orders. Since March, 81 percent of social distancing violations issued by the NYPD have been made against black or Latinx people. And those stats simply confirm what our eyes are already telling us. We've all seen the pictures of white people gathered in parks as police officers politely hand out masks but no tickets, just as we've all seen videos, shot just a neighborhood away, showing black and brown people getting beaten and manhandled by the cops for allegedly violating social distancing protocols. Anybody could have seen this coming. In fact, I wrote about how this would happen once the NYPD was empowered to enforce social distancing. I don't have a crystal ball. I'm not a wizard. I just know that cops cannot be trusted with the power they already have-and should never be given any more. Putting the NYPD in charge of enforcing social distancing was a decision that was so obviously going to lead to racially biased enforcement of the orders that one has to assume it was intentional. Most black people know what happens when cops are given power, but we can't get 51 percent of white people to do anything about it. We can't get New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who centered his first mayoral campaign on his opposition to stop-and-frisk, to take a stand against the racist actions of his police force. We can't get the white people who are willing to gather in large crowds to enjoy a spring day to gather in a large crowd to protest at City Hall.

White people are not ignorant, and they're not blind. They see the racial bias in policing, and they know that bias benefits them. They know they're not going to catch a beatdown for not wearing a mask. They know they're not going to be choked to death on the street in broad daylight. They know that having racist police officers around gives them incredible power, and power makes people feel good, even if they never use it. I've been in rooms where I've heard white people congratulate themselves for not calling the cops on some black person, as if declining the option to use terrorism against a black person was some kind of proof of liberal good faith. Black people have tried, again and again, to end the horror of police brutality against us. We march, we protest, we educate, we vote. We teach our children a special set of rules. We produce art and literature and music documenting our pain. We start organizations and movements. And yet we can't achieve structural change in policing because a majority of white America always sets its will against us. White people in our own communities, our alleged friends and neighbors, consistently vote and act in ways that empower the police and ignore their brutality against us. White people could put their police dogs on a leash. But they won't. And more black and brown people will get mauled and killed until white people decide to do better. More black people will die like George Floyd, because most white people want to live like Amy Cooper.\n\nThe police didn't stop. The police are never going to voluntarily stop killing black and brown people. The killings will continue until the majority of white people in this country make the killings stop. The police work for white people, and they know it. White people know it too. Deep down, white people know exactly whom the police are supposed to protect and serve, and they damn well know it's not black and brown people. We saw some video of that too , over the weekend. Amy Cooper, who is white, was walking in Central Park with her dog. Her dog was off its leash, in violation of park rules and city ordinances . A bird-watcher, Christian Cooper, who happens to be black, asked her to follow the rules. Instead of just putting her dog on a leash, she decided to use his race against him. She first threatened to call the cops and then did just that, claiming that an \"African American man\" was \"threatening\" her in the park. The very instant that Amy Cooper felt she needed the support of institutionalized racism to get her through her morning, she knew exactly where to find it. She knew exactly whom to call. She was the one in violation of the rules. Yet there she was, calling the cops. No doubt, it wouldn't have even occurred to her to call them to the scene of her lawlessness if not for the way cops tend to harass, jail, and yes, murder people who look like Christian Cooper. Or George Floyd. Or Eric Garner. Or Terence Crutcher. Or Alton Sterling. Or Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. Or Amadou Diallo. When Amy Cooper threatened to call the cops, she was threatening to take a black man's life. It's a threat that works only because cops are so consistently willing to murder black and brown men. She was able to dial up 400 years of racial oppression and violence on her phone more easily than I am able to order a pizza. It doesn't have to be this way. It is entirely within the scope of white power in America to rein in its police. White people could elect mayors and prosecutors who are committed to police reform. White judges and juries could hold the police accountable for their crimes. White Republicans could challenge and eventually break the power of police unions just as easily as they break teachers' unions or any labor union that stands in the way of rapacious capitalism. If a majority of white people decided, today, that racist policing should end, we'd start seeing changes to police forces by the middle of next week.

We've all seen the pictures of white people gathered in parks as police officers politely hand out masks but no tickets, just as we've all seen videos, shot just a neighborhood away, showing black and brown people getting beaten and manhandled by the cops for allegedly violating social distancing protocols. Anybody could have seen this coming. In fact, I wrote about how this would happen once the NYPD was empowered to enforce social distancing. I don't have a crystal ball. I'm not a wizard. I just know that cops cannot be trusted with the power they already have-and should never be given any more. Putting the NYPD in charge of enforcing social distancing was a decision that was so obviously going to lead to racially biased enforcement of the orders that one has to assume it was intentional. Most black people know what happens when cops are given power, but we can't get 51 percent of white people to do anything about it. We can't get New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who centered his first mayoral campaign on his opposition to stop-and-frisk, to take a stand against the racist actions of his police force. We can't get the white people who are willing to gather in large crowds to enjoy a spring day to gather in a large crowd to protest at City Hall.

White people are not ignorant, and they're not blind. They see the racial bias in policing, and they know that bias benefits them. They know they're not going to catch a beatdown for not wearing a mask. They know they're not going to be choked to death on the street in broad daylight. They know that having racist police officers around gives them incredible power, and power makes people feel good, even if they never use it. I've been in rooms where I've heard white people congratulate themselves for not calling the cops on some black person, as if declining the option to use terrorism against a black person was some kind of proof of liberal good faith. Black people have tried, again and again, to end the horror of police brutality against us. We march, we protest, we educate, we vote. We teach our children a special set of rules. We produce art and literature and music documenting our pain. We start organizations and movements. And yet we can't achieve structural change in policing because a majority of white America always sets its will against us. White people in our own communities, our alleged friends and neighbors, consistently vote and act in ways that empower the police and ignore their brutality against us. White people could put their police dogs on a leash. But they won't. And more black and brown people will get mauled and killed until white people decide to do better. More black people will die like George Floyd, because most white people want to live like Amy Cooper.\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way. It is entirely within the scope of white power in America to rein in its police. White people could elect mayors and prosecutors who are committed to police reform. White judges and juries could hold the police accountable for their crimes. White Republicans could challenge and eventually break the power of police unions just as easily as they break teachers' unions or any labor union that stands in the way of rapacious capitalism. If a majority of white people decided, today, that racist policing should end, we'd start seeing changes to police forces by the middle of next week.

A majority of them clearly want the cops to behave this way. They want the viciousness. They want the horror. Why? It's not just that a majority of white America probably thinks Amy Cooper did the right thing in her specific situation; it's that they think they will one day be in a situation in which such actions are justified. One day they might be alone in a park around a strange black man, and what might happen then? Sure, Christian Cooper seems like a \"nice\" black person, but what if he weren't? What if he were a \"mean\" or \"aggressive\" black person, and you were just alone in the park, illegally walking your dog? Best to keep brutal, dangerous, and racist cops around, because, hey, you never know. White people think they might one day be Amy Cooper, and they want to have somebody to call, just in case. They know they'll never be Christian Cooper. Making a society that's safe for Christian Cooper to bird-watch while black just isn't the most important thing to a majority of white America. Oh, a bunch of white people will be performatively outraged and saddened by Amy Cooper's behavior. They'll gladly participate in her online dragging. But when it comes to neutering the police so that the Amy Coopers of the world don't have that kind of privilege and power over the Christian Coopers of the world, most of those white people will fall silent. By the same token, white people will participate in the outrage over specific murders, like George Floyd's and Breonna Taylor 's. They will join in calls to bring individual racists to account, like Amy Cooper and Gregory and Travis McMichael . But when it comes time to deal with institutional purveyors of racism, as opposed to individual bad actors, the outrage and support of the white community is not there. We see that disconnect on display now as police use the coronavirus to threaten and harass black and brown people. The Center for Constitutional Rights, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the Legal Aid Society have joined a motion asking courts to investigate the New York Police Department's enforcement of social distancing during the pandemic. The legal motion suggests that the NYPD is in violation of court orders imposed on the city because of its unconstitutional stop-and-frisk program.

More black people will die like George Floyd, because most white people want to live like Amy Cooper.\n\nAnybody could have seen this coming. In fact, I wrote about how this would happen once the NYPD was empowered to enforce social distancing. I don't have a crystal ball. I'm not a wizard. I just know that cops cannot be trusted with the power they already have-and should never be given any more. Putting the NYPD in charge of enforcing social distancing was a decision that was so obviously going to lead to racially biased enforcement of the orders that one has to assume it was intentional. Most black people know what happens when cops are given power, but we can't get 51 percent of white people to do anything about it. We can't get New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who centered his first mayoral campaign on his opposition to stop-and-frisk, to take a stand against the racist actions of his police force. We can't get the white people who are willing to gather in large crowds to enjoy a spring day to gather in a large crowd to protest at City Hall.

      "text": "How Violent Cops Stay in Law Enforcement\n\nIn September, 2009, a card dealer named Evie Oquendo arrived at her apartment, on the far east side of Las Vegas, with groceries for her fifteen-year-old son, Tanner Chamberlain. Tanner, who struggled with bipolar disorder, had stayed home from school that day, and Oquendo wanted to make beef stew, one of his favorite meals. But, before she could start cooking, Tanner became extremely agitated. Not long afterward, she discovered that he had swallowed a handful of her anti-anxiety pills. She wanted to take him to the hospital, but first she called her sister, a former New York City police officer. Her sister told her to call 911. \"I said, 'I'm not calling the police, because I'm afraid they're gonna shoot him,' \" Oquendo recalled. \"She told me, 'Evie, don't be ridiculous. They'll know how to handle it.' \"\n\nTanner calmed down enough to suggest going to a nearby 7-Eleven for an iced tea, and Oquendo decided against calling the police. But her sister had already asked a family friend in Nevada to call 911, and soon officers from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department pulled up to Oquendo's apartment building, a stucco complex with a pool and a playground. Among the group was a twenty-eight-year-old officer named Derek Colling, who had been with the department for four years. When Colling and the others approached, Tanner stood behind Oquendo, grasping his mother and holding a folding knife in one hand. Officers instructed him to drop the knife and release his mother, but he did not comply. One of the officers on the scene, who was trained in de-escalating crisis situations involving people with mental illnesses, tried to speak to Tanner. Colling trained his gun on Tanner. \"Don't shoot him!\" Oquendo pleaded. Colling shot him in the head.\n\nThis was Colling's second fatal shooting in three years: in 2006, he had been one of five officers to shoot and kill a man who pulled a gun at a gas station. In both cases, a coroner's inquest declared the killings justified. \"I did what had to be done,\" Colling said, during the second inquiry. One of Colling's childhood friends, Jedadiah Schultz, recalled meeting up with Colling shortly after Tanner's death, at a baseball game, and asking him about the incident. \"The way in which he was telling the story was like his heroic journey,\" Schultz said. \"I was deeply unsettled.\" (Colling did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nIn 2011, after Colling beat a videographer who was filming police activity in a suburban neighborhood, the footage went viral, and the department launched an investigation. In December, just weeks after the Las Vegas Review-Journal began publishing a series of articles on the use of lethal force by police, Colling was fired for policy violations. The city's police department, which had a long-standing reputation as one of the most violent in the country, announced that it would be undertaking extensive reforms, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, to improve transparency and accountability.\n\nNo criminal charges were brought against Colling, and the internal investigation that led to the department's decision was not made public. Still, Oquendo felt some sense of vindication: Colling wasn't going to jail, but at least he'd lost his badge and his gun. She decided to pursue a civil case against Colling and the department, including a wrongful-death claim, and, in 2013, two years after she'd filed it, a federal district-court judge allowed the case to go forward.\n\nBut, in 2015, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the suit, citing qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that protects law-enforcement officers from civil lawsuits. Shortly afterward, while Oquendo was searching for news stories about Colling on the Internet, she got a hit from a paper in Laramie, Wyoming. Colling hadn't left law enforcement-he'd just moved home. He was working as a patrol deputy for the Albany County sheriff's office, which covers a forty-three-hundred-square-mile region of southeastern Wyoming, including Laramie, Colling's home town. Oquendo was distraught. She started calling journalists and community leaders in Laramie. \"I didn't want him to kill again,\" she said.\n\nEventually, she reached Debra Hinkel. An athletic woman with white-blond hair and a direct manner, Hinkel had lived in Laramie most of her life. She ran a few businesses in town, including the Ranger, a motel, bar, and liquor store, which her parents had owned. She was well-connected, and she had contacts at all three of the law-enforcement agencies with jurisdiction in Laramie-the police department, the sheriff's office, and the University of Wyoming's police department. Her middle child, Robbie Ramirez, had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder in his early twenties, and, in the years since, Hinkel had come to dedicate much of her time to mental-health advocacy. Oquendo had found Hinkel's phone number through the Laramie chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, where Hinkel served as president. After explaining her story, Oquendo urged Hinkel to use her standing in the community to agitate for Colling's dismissal. \"She was trying to get ahold of anybody she could,\" Hinkel said. \"She told me, 'The guy's dangerous.' \"\n\nHinkel knew Derek Colling. His father was a highway patrolman, and his mother worked at a local school. Laramie is a college town of about thirty thousand that feels smaller. As boys, Colling and Robbie had played on the same baseball team, the Vigilantes. They had attended high school together; as members of the school choir, they travelled to Carnegie Hall. After graduating, Colling attended college in South Dakota, then explored a career in law enforcement. He got the job in Las Vegas in 2005. Robbie, meanwhile, had never left Wyoming.\n\nHinkel and Robbie lived a few blocks apart-she in a ranch house, he in a log-walled apartment owned by two of Hinkel's brothers. They had a close-knit family, with relatives spread throughout the region. Robbie's siblings, Randy and Robyn, lived about an hour away; their father, Jimmy Ramirez, lived in a small town across the Snowy Range mountains. Some months, Hinkel saw Robbie regularly. When he felt good, he coached hockey, made ceramic art, and worked at the Ranger. At other times, when he was feeling anxious or depressed, he kept to himself. A fun-loving skater in his younger days, Robbie had become exceedingly careful over the years, and police especially concerned him. After his diagnosis, he had been arrested a few times, and he wanted to avoid any similar encounters. He kept a detailed budget, and family members remember him painstakingly tracking his medications and meal plan. He spent hours tinkering with his Ford Ranger, but he was a tentative driver who rarely left Laramie. He said he needed to stay near home, where he was safe.\n\nHinkel decided not to tell her son about Colling, but he found out anyway. Not long after Oquendo's call, Robbie walked into the Ranger and found his mother standing by the pool table. The Boomerang , Laramie's daily, had just published an article about Oquendo's civil case. Robbie sounded matter-of-fact, Hinkel recalled later, when he told her that he'd read about Colling. \"He'll probably shoot me someday,\" Robbie said.\n\nThe sheriff of Albany County, David O'Malley, hired Colling in 2012, ten months after he was fired from his job in Las Vegas. Colling had applied to work for the town's police department, too, but his history disqualified him. \"We didn't even finish his background,\" Dale Stalder, the chief of the Laramie Police Department, said. A Laramie law-enforcement veteran told me that, when he heard that Colling was working for O'Malley, he was unsurprised. \"The sheriff's office is kind of a second-chance oasis for cops,\" he said.\n\nO'Malley is widely known for his role investigating the murder of Matthew Shepard , a gay student at the University of Wyoming who was beaten and left to die on the outskirts of Laramie, in 1998. O'Malley, who was then the head of investigations at the Laramie Police Department, worked with a detective from the sheriff's department to build the case that convicted two men of Shepard's murder. The story garnered international attention, helped to catalyze a reckoning with anti-gay violence, and inspired a play, \"The Laramie Project,\" that was produced as a touring show. O'Malley became an outspoken public figure, advocating for national hate-crime legislation and speaking openly about his former anti-gay bigotry. He marched at Pride events, attended drag-queen bingo, and spoke out against a book that cast aspersions on Shepard. He left the police department in 2004 and, in 2010, ran for sheriff as a Democrat, winning by nearly twenty points.\n\nThe American sheriff-especially the Western sheriff-has always occupied a role that is both functional and performative, and O'Malley seemed intuitively aware of the outward-facing aspects of the job. He wore a bushy mustache and snap shirts, and he projected warmth, relying on folksy lingo. He was widely liked, and he easily won reëlection twice. But among law enforcement his department's reputation was mixed, marred by a handful of cases of alleged misconduct. Stalder, Laramie's police chief, told me that the expertise of sheriff's departments varies widely. \"There's a huge disparity,\" he said. \"Some are very professional. Some are much less professional.\" When I asked where O'Malley's department fit within that spectrum, he said, \"I think I'll leave that one alone.\"\n\nStill, O'Malley's popularity seemed undimmed, and he appeared confident deflecting scrutiny. A few years after Colling was hired, when local journalists found out about Colling's history in Las Vegas, O'Malley defended him staunchly. In an interview with a local radio station and news site, he said, \"The fact that he was terminated didn't give me any real pause, because they didn't move to decertify him as a law enforcement officer.\" He added, \"If you don't believe that a person has any business in law enforcement, then you move for decertification. If they had done that, I couldn't have considered Derek.\"\n\nLike the disbarring of an attorney, or the revocation of a doctor's license, the decertification of a law-enforcement officer, which is handled by individual states, is meant to prevent bad actors from returning to the profession. (Wyoming, along with a few other states, recognizes decertification elsewhere as immediately disqualifying.) But standards for decertification vary widely. In a handful of states, like California, there is no process at all for removing an officer's certification; in others, like Nevada, decertification is rare. Even though Colling had been fired following allegations of police brutality, his dismissal did not meet the state threshold for decertification. Kelly McMahill, a deputy chief at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police, who oversaw the internal investigation that led to his firing, told me that, had the state initiated an inquiry, \"It wouldn't even have come close to pulling his certification.\"\n\nIn recent years, the very idea of problem officers has become a flashpoint in the public discourse on police violence: when politicians and police chiefs blame the failures of policing on a handful of officers, they seem to be ignoring the systemic issues that plague American law enforcement. But it is widely accepted in the field of decertification studies that a small number of officers account for a large number of civilian complaints; if implemented fairly and consistently, decertification can serve as a vital mechanism for removing the worst actors. \"Most professions have a way of getting rid of bad professionals,\" Roger Goldman, an emeritus professor at the Saint Louis University School of Law, who is an expert on decertification, told me. \"So why not police?\"\n\nIn 2014, after a Cleveland police officer named Timothy Loehmann shot and killed Tamir Rice , a twelve-year-old Black child who was holding a toy gun, an investigation revealed that Loehmann had previously been deemed unfit for duty at another Ohio police department. Ohio decertifies law-enforcement officers in the event of felony convictions, but a grand jury declined to indict Loehmann for Rice's killing. Although he was eventually fired from the Cleveland Police Department, on the grounds that he had falsified his employment history, he remained eligible to work in law enforcement.\n\nLast year, the legal scholars Ben Grunwald and John Rappaport published a report, \"The Wandering Officer,\" that provided the first wide-scale analysis of officers, like Loehmann and Colling, who have lost employment at one law-enforcement agency  and then found a new job at  another. Analyzing data from nearly five hundred Florida police agencies over a thirty-year period, they found that such officers were more likely than their peers \"to be fired from their next job or to receive a complaint for a 'moral character violation.' \"\n\nOfficers who have previously worked at large metropolitan agencies typically have extensive training, which can make them appealing as prospective hires for smaller departments with less funding, or rural departments with fewer applicants. When Colling attended Wyoming's law-enforcement academy for basic training-a requirement for most new detention officers-he graduated at the top of his class and was recognized for exemplary physical fitness and marksmanship. The Albany County Sheriff's Office is well funded-last year, it had $1.8 million in expenditures-but O'Malley said that he had struggled to recruit officers. \"In the seventies and early eighties, you had people knocking down the door,\" he told me. The last time he posted a job, he said, there were twenty applicants, but only eight showed up for the physical and psychological tests. Of those eight, he said, \"We had one that our panel said they would recommend to hire.\" Matthew Hickman, a professor of criminal justice at Seattle University, said, \"Police departments in rural jurisdictions are just desperate for officers. And that's where some of these guys end up.\"\n\nStill, O'Malley maintained that his agency had strict hiring procedures. He told me that Colling had been interviewed by a panel, which included representatives from the sheriff's office, the police department, and the University of Wyoming Police Department. (He declined to share the interviewers' names, citing the confidentiality of personnel records.) O'Malley also said that Colling had passed a background check: \"I had a list of probably sixty people that were supervisory and peers.\" He could not tell me exactly how many were interviewed, but he stood by comments he had made in the Boomerang , in 2014, in which he called Colling \"the best man for the job.\"\n\nMcMahill, a deputy chief in Las Vegas, was alarmed by the circumstances of Colling's hiring in Wyoming. \"I am shocked he got a job with another police agency,\" she said. She said that the details from the investigation into Colling that she led, in 2011, were confidential. But she did tell me that Colling was one of a handful of officers who were involved in incidents that prompted the agency to change the way it monitored and supported personnel following use-of-force incidents. \"What we realized is that so many of these officers, they're going to relive their officer-involved shootings time and time and time again,\" she told me. McMahill now sits on Nevada's Peace Officers Standards and Training ( POST ) commission, which certifies and decertifies officers. She told me that she hoped for reforms to the state's decertification statute, and for more consistency across the country. \"I think the answer to that is really, every state-state to state-is going to have to be much more lenient on what it takes to decertify someone.\" She added, \"We don't want people like Derek Colling to remain with his POST certificate.\"\n\nDebra Hinkel, like many Laramie residents, was unaware of Colling's presence on the force until well after he had been hired, when the press got the story and Oquendo made calls around town. But she was inclined to trust O'Malley. Her kids had gone to school with his kids. She had once switched parties to vote for him, and they sat together on a mental-health board. She had also seen Robbie's relationship with local law enforcement improve since he was first diagnosed. In the early years, Robbie and the rest of the family struggled to manage his condition. In 2004, Robbie punched an uncle at a family cabin, and was escorted to the hospital by sheriff's deputies, who later tackled him to the ground so that a nurse could inject him with an antipsychotic. Robbie resisted, injuring two officers. After the incident, Hinkel became interested in crisis-intervention-team (C.I.T.) programs, which encourage the development of mental-health infrastructure and teach de-escalation techniques to law-enforcement officers. After attending a C.I.T. panel in San Diego, she met with a commander at the Laramie Police Department and representatives from the local hospital. Laramie's C.I.T. program became among the first in the state.\n\nRobbie's final arrest for violent behavior was in 2010, when he punched a man outside of the Ranger. After that, he abided strictly by his court-ordered probation. He picked up skateboarding again, and, after buying a classical guitar while on vacation with his father, in Mazatlán, he started playing music with a local group. In 2016, the Wyoming legislature slashed funding for Medicaid, and Robbie became convinced that he needed to keep his income as low as possible in order to prevent his benefits from changing. He eventually stopped working, and his mental health declined. When Hinkel sold the Ranger, in 2018, he lost another anchor. But he tried to stay active, regularly visiting the Laramie skate park.\n\nAt this point, local law enforcement knew how to handle Robbie when he was in an anxious spell. Stalder, the police chief, told me that, during calls to Robbie's apartment, officers stood outside the door and talked in a gentle voice until he calmed down. The department had a be-on-the-lookout alert set up for Robbie's vehicles, so officers would know to respond with calm in the event of a traffic stop. \"Because of the officers' abilities to create that space and that time, things worked out,\" Stalder said.\n\nIn November, 2018, Robbie drove his Ranger west on Grand Avenue, a commercial area near the university. He was travelling significantly under the speed limit, and soon a patrol vehicle from the sheriff's office pulled in behind him. Robbie moved into the left lane, then turned across traffic, flipping on his signal a few seconds late. The patrol car followed. Robbie turned again, this time without a signal. The patrol car flashed its lights, and they both pulled over. Robbie was about a hundred yards from home.\n\nDerek Colling is trim and muscular, with a blond crew cut that was, that day, covered by a dark beanie. He strode toward Robbie's car. In college, Colling had been a two-hundred-and-fifteen-pound football player, and he still maintained an athletic build, training regularly in a form of martial arts called Krav Maga, developed for the Israeli military. When he reached the passenger's side of the car, he told Robbie to roll down the window. Robbie refused, and pointed to his apartment building, which was visible across the street. Colling demanded again, and Robbie's responses turned agitated. Then he started the car, and pulled away. (For someone fleeing the police, he drove slowly; before turning into his apartment's parking lot, he used his turn signal.) Colling ran to his cruiser and followed in pursuit, calling for backup. Robbie parked next to his apartment, at the end of the parking lot, and got out. Officers trained in responding to calls involving people experiencing mental-health crises are taught how to speak in a calm voice and maintain distance. Colling pulled up quickly, pinning in Robbie's truck and leaving him effectively cornered.\n\nColling pulled out his Taser and pistol and yelled, \"Get your hands up now!\" He approached, weapons drawn, closing the space between them. \"Get your hands up now,\" he repeated. He then deployed the Taser: its barbs stuck in Robbie's shirt but didn't appear to take effect. \"Don't shoot at me,\" Robbie said. Colling tried again. Robbie covered his head, cursed, and charged. As the men grappled, Colling fired his pistol, and Robbie fell. Colling called for medical assistance, and held Robbie's body to the ground. (He would later say that he still considered Robbie a potential threat.) With the assistance of a responding officer, he handcuffed Robbie, who lay bleeding. Another officer arrived and administered CPR. Colling had shot Robbie three times, including in the back. An ambulance transported him to a hospital. Hinkel arrived shortly afterward. In the lobby, she was informed that her son was dead.\n\nSix days later, a vigil for Robbie was held at the Laramie skate park. More than a hundred people came to light candles. Later, at the memorial service, a friend of Robbie's from the skate park delivered a eulogy, and Hinkel gave a short speech. She thought that more of Robbie's friends might speak. But, she said, \"They just couldn't. They were just so angry.\"\n\nHinkel walks quickly, and often wears a grin that conveys preparedness rather than joy. Following Robbie's death, his older brother, Randy, tried to avoid returning to Laramie. Hinkel left frequently, to escape, but always returned home. \"I don't know how my mom does it,\" Randy said. \"She can't go to the grocery store without someone wanting to talk about it.\"\n\nA deeply spiritual person, Hinkel felt that her son's death had happened for a reason, and that some change should come of it. But she also tended to be trusting of local authorities. In the press, she praised O'Malley and Peggy Trent, the county attorney, with whom she was friendly. She told the Boomerang that her son's death was the fault of \"one police officer and not the whole force.\" When the state announced that its Department of Criminal Investigations (D.C.I.) would conduct an inquiry into the shooting,  she trusted that the system would deliver justice.\n\nBut others had started to organize around the shooting. After hearing about Robbie's death, a graduate student named Karlee Provenza decided to start an advocacy group, which came to be called Albany County for Proper Policing ( ACoPP ). Twenty-four people showed up to the first meeting, which Provenza held at her house, a one-story home on Laramie's west side, with a porch decorated by deer skulls. She served deer chili. One of Robbie's uncles attended; Hinkel did not.\n\nThe week after Robbie's vigil, Trent arranged a private viewing of Colling's dash-camera and body-camera footage for Robbie's family, including Hinkel, Ramirez, and their children Randy and Robyn. O'Malley was there, too. He cried as the tape rolled. \"I felt bad for the family,\" he told me later. Robyn hugged him and told him that she did not blame him for Robbie's death. Randy felt different. \"You did this,\" he said to O'Malley. Hinkel left the room.\n\nTrent eventually decided to gather a grand jury to determine whether Colling should be charged with a felony. Grand juries almost always convene in the absence of a judge or defense counsel, giving the prosecutor great influence. According to Kate Levine, a law professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, prosecutors often present exculpatory information during cases involving law-enforcement officers. \"This is part of that careful, balanced presentation that is absolutely just never done for anyone but police officers,\" Levine told me. Prosecutors have an incentive to maintain a good relationship with the police department, since they depend on the coöperation of law enforcement to build other cases, and jurors tend to trust and sympathize with law enforcement. Courts grant officers significant leeway in use-of-force cases: if officers who claim self-defense can demonstrate that they feared for their life or someone else's, they can almost always avoid conviction. Rachel Harmon, a law professor at the University of Virginia, said that the legal standards \"are mostly vague. And so they give a lot of room for officers who perceive a threat to use force.\"\n\nShortly before the grand jury convened, Hinkel attended a community forum, where she finally met Provenza. They discussed the upcoming grand jury, which would convene under seal, concealing the proceedings from public scrutiny. Provenza was concerned that, if the grand jury declined to indict, it might create the impression that Robbie's killing had been justified. \"Debbie kind of brushed it aside,\" Provenza told me. \"Then, I think, she watched it happen.\"\n\nThe grand jury, which met in January, 2019, was tasked with determining whether to indict Colling on a charge of involuntary manslaughter. Trent presented jurors with evidence that had been gathered by the D.C.I. Prepared by multiple investigators, including Tina Trimble, who was also the president of the Wyoming Fraternal Order of Police, the D.C.I. report provided a menacing portrayal of Robbie, noting that his apartment was extremely dirty and suggesting that he had not been taking his medication. (The report wasn't released publicly until months later, under pressure from news outlets including the Boomerang and WyoFile, a nonprofit that has covered Robbie's case extensively. Through a supervisor, Trimble declined an interview request.) The report briefly covered Colling's two previous shootings, but it failed to mention his firing from the Las Vegas police department.\n\nIn an interview with Colling, which investigators waited to conduct until four days after the shooting, he claimed that he had not recognized Robbie during the encounter. But he also suggested that he had heard enough stories about Robbie's past to consider him dangerous, providing secondhand accounts of encounters between Robbie and law enforcement that took place years before he joined the sheriff's office. Only after Colling viewed body-camera footage did he come to the conclusion that Robbie might have been holding a key during their scuffle. \"Colling remarked that he never saw the keys,\" Trimble wrote, \"but that he felt like it was an 'edged weapon' after viewing the video.\"\n\nThe jurors listened to Colling's interview, and to testimony from Trimble and from a use-of-force expert who has defended police officers in misconduct cases. One of the members of the grand jury told me that the group was instructed not to consider Colling's history. (Later, in a press conference, Trent said that presenting the facts of Colling's prior shootings would have taken away \"the relevancy of the facts of the case.\") Much of the testimony, the juror said, \"was framed in a way to say that law-enforcement officers had this different standard applied to them because of the parameters of their occupation.\" The juror added that, for a charge to stick, \"I feel like they have to scream out, 'I'm going to kill you on purpose and I don't care.' And it has to be on camera.\" (Trent said that she could not discuss the details of the grand jury, beyond her public comments.)\n\nAfter three days of proceedings, the grand jury declined to indict Colling. O'Malley later moved Colling to an investigative role. Hinkel felt betrayed. \"The whole good-ol'-boy aspect of protecting somebody who's done something like that is totally confusing to me,\" she said.  She reconnected with Provenza, who was trying to get the county commissioners to establish a community oversight board for the sheriff's office. Hinkel was impressed by Provenza's persistence in a state where aggressive reform efforts are not the political norm. (In February, a former Albany County attorney wrote to Provenza, in an e-mail, \"You should exercise caution in your efforts. The people you are challenging have the power of the entire state government to bring against you.\") Hinkel and Provenza discussed policing issues and decided to start working together on advocacy. In May, Hinkel wrote an op-ed that criticized O'Malley and the law-enforcement system: \"Perhaps we need to look at de-certification of these officers so they do not continue to have opportunities to injure or kill citizens.\" Provenza soon started gathering signatures on a petition that called for Colling's decertification.\n\nIn Wyoming, as in many other states, decertification decisions are handled by the state's POST commission. (Most POST agencies were established following the civil unrest of the nineteen-sixties, when authorities in cities across the U.S. responded to civil-rights protesters with military tactics.) In January, 2020, Hinkel and Provenza drove seventy-five icy miles north to a diner in Wheatland, where they met Chris Walsh, the director of the state's POST commission. Provenza presented Walsh with a petition for Colling's decertification, which had nearly thirteen hundred signatures.\n\nTypically, decertification cases are brought by police chiefs or sheriffs themselves. \"The very people deciding whether to hire wandering officers are the people who need to decide whether to discipline them,\" Ben Grunwald, the legal scholar, told me. But in Wyoming, citizens can file a grievance directly to the POST commission. At the end of the meeting with Walsh, Hinkel filed a written complaint. Walsh began an investigation.\n\nIn April, Provenza announced that she was running as a Democrat for a seat in the legislature. Hinkel helped with the campaign, writing postcards to voters. A few weeks later, George Floyd was killed by Derek Chauvin, a white officer with eighteen prior complaints on his record. Protests erupted across the country, including in Laramie, where they attracted a diverse and durable crowd. Provenza attended, collecting more signatures for the decertification petition. Hinkel struggled to watch the video of Floyd's death, and the similarity of the officers' names-Derek Colling, Derek Chauvin-disturbed her. \"Too many synchronicities,\" she told me.\n\nShe left town to go rafting in Oregon. When she arrived home, in June, hundreds of people were marching in the streets, many of them chanting her son's name. The marches continued daily. (Laramie police officers later arrested protesters for disorderly conduct and, in one case, \"amplified noise,\" even as counter-protesters in trucks with modified exhaust systems blasted them with diesel smoke.)\n\nOne law-enforcement veteran in Laramie told me that the events of the summer had shaken his foundational beliefs about his profession. He had started to reëxamine the assumptions that he had been trained to believe. When he had first seen the footage of Robbie's death, he had thought Colling acted properly. \"Now, looking at it through the way society is changing,\" he told me, \"it makes me question if it was a valid shoot.\" For a long time, he had thought that the criminal-justice system was flawed but generally fair. \"Having to now look at everything,\" he said, \"I'm starting to realize that-no, it is not fair. It is very skewed.\" Another Laramie law-enforcement officer told me that Robbie's death had deeply saddened and demoralized many of his colleagues. \"With Robbie, it's deeply personal,\" he said. \"Because Robbie was us.\" He thought about Colling, and said, \"Why was he hired?\"\n\nWalsh declined to comment on the specifics of the case, but he outlined a scenario that could hypothetically support decertification: \"If a person were hired illegally, against Wyoming state statute, because, let's say, information from another state is pertinent to their employment here, and through an investigation I found out that something had been overlooked\"-that, he said, would be relevant. His investigation is ongoing. A hearing for Colling has not yet been scheduled.\n\nIn August, I met Sheriff O'Malley at the Albany County Courthouse, an impressive stone building on Grand Avenue. Inside, the receptionist greeted me from behind a gleaming one-way mirror. O'Malley came out and offered me a friendly handshake. He walked with his back slightly stooped. As he turned into his office, I could see Colling in a room across the way. O'Malley closed the door.\n\nHinkel had recently filed a twenty-million-dollar lawsuit on charges of wrongful death, listing the county, Colling, and O'Malley as defendants. O'Malley declined to discuss Hinkel's suit directly, but his comments suggested that the public had developed an unfair impression of his office. He offered a quotation from Mark Twain (apocryphal, as it turns out): \"No amount of evidence will ever convince an idiot.\" He was concerned that the protests in Laramie and around the country were damaging the reputation of law enforcement. \"The career, the profession, being associated with racism and excessive force and everything, that's just-it's not the case,\" he said. \"That happens, and there's people in this profession that need to be out of it.\" But Colling, he said, was not one of them. He stood by his decision to hire him. He said he planned to retire soon and move to Florida. \"I can fish twelve months a year without cutting a hole in the ice,\" he said, chuckling. He added, \"I don't know that I'll ever come back.\" He announced his resignation later that month.\n\nO'Malley's successor, Aaron Appelhans, was the first Black sheriff in Wyoming's history. Appelhans said that he was focussed on improving services for the mentally ill and recruiting from underserved communities. \"I'm not really sure law enforcement has put in enough work to really see the change,\" he told me. Colling was reassigned to a job at the county detention center. O'Malley moved away; Trent took a job in Kansas. In November, on the anniversary of Robbie's death, Karlee Provenza won her election by a hundred and sixty votes. Hinkel cried when she heard the news. \"It's not all about justice,\" she said. \"It's about a need for a change.\"\n\nStill, Hinkel found herself spending more and more time away from home. She went to Colorado, Santa Fe, Elko. \"There's a heaviness in my heart every time I drive into Laramie,\" she said. \"I still have to leave periodically to just regroup.\" One of her trips took her to Las Vegas, where she looked up Evie Oquendo. When they met, at a restaurant in a video poker lounge, they laughed at their similar statures-both women stand about five feet tall. Since losing the appeal for her case, Oquendo had been unable to work. At her apartment, she kept Tanner's room as it had been, with his clothes still in the closet. She struggled to sleep, and her dreams were bad. Still, she said, she saw in Hinkel's lawsuit a glimmer of hope. Maybe, she thought, it would yield a different result from her own.\n\nOquendo rarely left Las Vegas, and she was impressed by Hinkel's adventurous nature. They talked about taking a trip one day. \"Kind of a heck of a way to become kindred spirits,\" Hinkel said. They finished lunch, and Hinkel started the long drive through Utah and Colorado  and into the vast plains of Wyoming. After she arrived, her phone rang. It was Oquendo, calling to make sure she had got home safely.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "\"Incident\" Shows How Officers React When a Police Killing Is Caught on Tape\n\nWatch \"Incident.\"\n\nThe opening of Bill Morrison's short film \"Incident\" is silent. Security footage shows a section of a Chicago street on what looks to be an ordinary summer afternoon. A few people walk down the sidewalk, a seagull flies past the camera, a police cruiser idles on the corner. Suddenly the view changes and the sound comes on. The effect is jarring, and the new scene is one that has become all too familiar: police officers have shot and killed a Black civilian.\n\nHarith (Snoop) Augustus had left work at the barbershop down the street when he was shot by a Chicago police officer. Morrison's documentary captures the final moments of his life, and the actions and reactions of the police and neighbors who were there when it happened. Using police body-cam footage to create a multifaceted record of the shooting, along with simple onscreen text to place the shooting in its local political context, the film is a powerful record of one man's death and of the ongoing crisis of police violence.\n\nView the latest or submit your own film.\n\nThe shooting in \"Incident\" is closely tied to an earlier, more famous police shooting in Chicago. In 2014, Officer Jason Van Dyke killed seventeen-year-old Laquan McDonald. A journalist sued to get access to body-cam footage, which unravelled Van Dyke's claim that he had acted in self-defense. A striking, troubling element of \"Incident\" comes when we see the police officers immediately begin to describe the shooting to one another-in an account that contradicts what we see on tape. For Bill Morrison, this is at the crux of the film: \"With the public's access to this footage established, a shift in police behavior happens. The cops are all performing now. They know that they're on camera and that it's going to be reviewed, and they are creating a narrative to vindicate their actions.\"\n\nAfter the film was completed, in December, 2023, the City of Chicago reached a new collective-bargaining agreement with the Fraternal Order of Police. A provision of the contract, ratified by the Chicago City Council, allows officers to turn off body cameras during conversations that follow an incident, and to delete post-incident conversations that are recorded.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Cop\n\nDarren Wilson, the former police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, an eighteen-year-old African-American, in Ferguson, Missouri, has been living for several months on a nondescript dead-end street on the outskirts of St. Louis. Most of the nearby houses are clad in vinyl siding; there are no sidewalks, and few cars around. Wilson, who is twenty-nine, started receiving death threats not long after the incident, in which Brown was killed in the street shortly after robbing a convenience store. Although Wilson recently bought the house, his name is not on the deed, and only a few friends know where he lives. He and his wife, Barb, who is thirty-seven, and also a former Ferguson cop, rarely linger in the front yard. Because of such precautions, Wilson has been leading a very quiet life. During the past year, a series of police killings of African-Americans across the country has inspired grief, outrage, protest, and acrimonious debate. For many Americans, this discussion, though painful, has been essential. Wilson has tried, with some success, to block it out.\n\nThis March, I spent several days at his home. The first time I pulled up to the curb, Wilson, who is six feet four and weighs two hundred and fifteen pounds, immediately stepped outside, wearing a hat and sunglasses. He had seen me arriving on security cameras that are synched to his phone.\n\nWilson has twice been exonerated of criminal wrongdoing. In November, after a grand jury chose not to indict him, the prosecutor, Robert P. McCulloch, was widely accused of having been soft on him, in part because McCulloch's father was a police officer who had been killed in a shootout with a black suspect. In March, the U.S. Department of Justice issued two official reports on Ferguson. One was a painstaking analysis of the shooting that weighed physical, ballistic, forensic, and crime-scene evidence, and statements from purported eyewitnesses. The report cleared Wilson of willfully violating Brown's civil rights, and concluded that his use of force was defensible. It also contradicted many details that the media had reported about the incident, including that Brown had raised his hands in surrender and had been shot in the back. The evidence supported Wilson's contention that Brown had been advancing toward him.\n\nThe Justice Department also released a broader assessment of the police and the courts in Ferguson, and it was scathing. The town, it concluded, was characterized by deep-seated racism. Local authorities targeted black residents, arresting them disproportionately and fining them excessively. Together, the two reports frustrated attempts to arrive at a clean moral conclusion. Wilson had violated no protocol in his deadly interaction with Brown, yet he was part of a corrupt and racist system.\n\nThe federal government's findings did little to soothe the raw emotions stirred by Brown's death. Many Americans believe that Wilson need not have killed Brown in order to protect himself, and might not have resorted to lethal force had Brown been white. Ta-Nehisi Coates, in his new book, \"Between the World and Me,\" writing of the psychological impact of incidents like the Brown shooting, says, \"It does not matter if the destruction is the result of an unfortunate overreaction. It does not matter if it originates in a misunderstanding.\" Coates also notes, \"There is nothing uniquely evil in these destroyers or even in this moment. The destroyers are merely men enforcing the whims of our country.\"\n\nMany police officers have defended Wilson, pointing out that cops patrolling violent neighborhoods risk their lives. Some right-wing publications have lionized him. In The American Thinker, David Whitley wrote that Wilson \"should be thanked and treated as a hero!\" Supporters raised nearly half a million dollars on behalf of the Wilsons, allowing them to move, buy the new house, and pay their legal expenses. But, as Wilson knows, such support has only deepened the resentment of people who feel that he deserves punishment or, at the very least, reprimand.\n\nDuring our conversations, Wilson typically sat in a recliner, holding his baby daughter, who was born in March. He said that, after Brown's death, people \"had made threats about doing something to my unborn child.\" Wilson, a former Boy Scout with round cheeks and blue eyes, speaks with a muted drawl. When Barb went to the hospital to give birth, he said, \"I made her check in anonymously.\"\n\nWilson said that he had interviewed for a few police positions but had been told that he would be a liability. \"It's too hot an issue, so it makes me unemployable,\" he said. He tried not to brood about it: \"I bottle everything up.\"\n\nThe baby has helped Wilson, who also has two stepsons, accept the constrictions of his current situation. It has also allowed him to maintain a pointed distance from the furor that the shooting helped to unleash. He told me that he had not read the Justice Department's report on the systemic racism in Ferguson. \"I don't have any desire,\" he said. \"I'm not going to keep living in the past about what Ferguson did. It's out of my control.\"\n\nWilson, who is from Texas, is the son of a woman who repeatedly broke the law. His mother, Tonya Dean, stole money, largely by writing hot checks. After completing high school, she married Wilson's father, John, who had been her English teacher. They soon had two children to support-Darren and his younger sister, Kara-but Dean spent wildly. She left John Wilson for another man, Tyler Harris, who ran a Y.M.C.A. They had a child, Jared, and Darren and Kara lived with them. \"Tonya had me in debt-almost twenty thousand dollars-that first year,\" Harris told me. Dean, it seems, often repaid debts to one person by stealing money from someone else.\n\nThe family eventually moved to St. Peters, west of St. Louis. When Wilson was thirteen, he stopped trusting his mother altogether, because she stole funds that she had helped raise for his Boy Scout troop. He worried that she would steal what little money he made working summer jobs, so he opened two bank accounts. The first, which had almost no money in it, was a decoy. He put his real earnings in the second, secret account. Wilson also tried to preëmpt his mother's stealing. Once, he warned a friend's parents not to let her inside their house, because she would surely find a way to steal their identities and max out their credit cards.\n\nDean was loving, Wilson said. \"She never wanted to hurt us.\" He added, \"But when it came to money she was going to get it, one way or another.\" Dean, who had been told by a psychiatrist that she was bipolar, began engaging in elaborate cons, at one point posing as an heiress poised to inherit millions of dollars.\n\nDespite her compulsive thievery, Dean somehow avoided prison. Finally, a judge warned her that if she appeared in his court again she would be jailed. Shortly afterward, in 2002, she died unexpectedly. At the time, Wilson didn't understand what had triggered her death, but he now thinks that it might have been suicide. (Harris suspects that she drank antifreeze.)\n\nAt the time, Wilson refused to talk about the tragedy, but his family knew that he was struggling: he started skipping school and hanging out with troublemakers. He graduated, though, and began doing construction work in the St. Louis area. He seemed directionless and unhappy. In 2008, the real-estate market crashed, and he could no longer find jobs. He applied to the Eastern Missouri Police Academy and was accepted. Being a police officer, he reasoned, was a recession-proof career.\n\nWilson found the classwork fascinating, especially when he and other cadets role-played at handling stressful situations. If they made a mistake, Wilson said, the instructors pounced: \"They're- bam! -in your face. Done. 'You're wrong.' 'It's over.' 'That person just died.' \" He welcomed the pressure.\n\nLink copied\n\nWilson's relatives had worried about how Dean's tumultuous life and death might affect her kids. Wilson's grandmother Susan Durso recalls asking herself, \"Are they going to be completely scarred?\" Darren Wilson, at least, had found a sense of purpose.\n\nWhen Wilson applied for a police job, he focussed on the northern portion of St. Louis County. The towns in what is called North County tend to be poorer, and to have a higher percentage of black residents, than other towns in the St. Louis area-such as St. Peters, the broadly middle-class, white town where Wilson grew up. North County also has more crime. Wilson felt that working in a tough area would propel his career. \"If you go there and you do three to five years, get your experience, you can kind of write your own ticket,\" he said.\n\nThere are almost fifty municipalities in North County. The officers in some of the towns are not just fighting crime; they also issue countless traffic tickets and ordinance-violation citations. The local governments often rely on the fines generated by tickets and violations to balance their budgets. (In 2013, the town of Edmundson, which comprises less than a square mile, issued nearly five thousand traffic tickets.) Police officers, meanwhile, can be paid as little as ten dollars an hour, according to Kevin Ahlbrand, the president of the Missouri Fraternal Order of Police. Ahlbrand says that the low pay can create \"unprofessional police officers,\" adding, \"You get what you pay for.\"\n\nIn 2009, Wilson got a job in Jennings, a town on Ferguson's southeastern border, where ninety per cent of the residents are black and a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line. \"I'd never been in an area where there was that much poverty,\" Wilson said. Interacting with residents, he felt intimidated and unprepared.\n\nA field-training officer named Mike McCarthy, who had been a cop for ten years, displayed no such discomfort. McCarthy, a thirty-nine-year-old Irish-American with short brown hair and a square chin, is a third-generation policeman who grew up in North County. Most of his childhood friends were African-American. \"If you just talk to him on the phone, you'd think you're talking to a black guy,\" Wilson said. \"He was able to relate to everyone up there.\"\n\nWilson said that he approached McCarthy for help: \"Mike, I don't know what I'm doing. This is a culture shock. Would you help me? Because you obviously have that connection, and you can relate to them. You may be white, but they still respect you. So why can they respect you and not me?\"\n\nMcCarthy had never heard another officer make such an honest admission of his own limitations. At the same time, he sensed a fierce determination: \"Darren was probably the best officer that I've ever trained-just by his willingness to learn.\"\n\nMcCarthy wasn't surprised that Wilson had difficulty interacting with residents. Police officers are rigorously trained in firing weapons and apprehending suspects but not in establishing common ground with people who have had different experiences. \"If you go to an academy, how much is on that?\" he asked me. \"Basically, nothing.\" A recent survey by the Police Executive Research Forum revealed that cadets usually receive fifty-eight hours of training in firearms, forty-nine in defensive tactics, ten in communication skills, and eight in de-escalation tactics.\n\nFor several months, McCarthy taught Wilson how to walk the beat-coaching him to loosen up, joke, and curse occasionally. He should avoid \"sounding like a Webster's Dictionary,\" never condescend, and never expect people to rat. At first, Wilson says, residents laughed at him, but he followed McCarthy's advice to \"just keep going.\" By the end of the training, Wilson said, he \"was more comfortable\" on the streets. McCarthy told me, \"There is so much distrust in the African-American community toward the police.\" The only way to overcome it was by establishing bonds with people. McCarthy, who is gay, said that he understood what it meant to be marginalized. \"In the United States, where everybody is supposed to be equal, I'm not. So that's a major thing.\"\n\nMcCarthy helped Wilson, in part, by letting him make mistakes. One night, they were patrolling a neighborhood where burglary was common. Wilson saw a car idling on the side of the street, and McCarthy didn't object when Wilson pulled over and asked the driver to show I.D. Wilson ran a check on the man's name; nothing came up, so he let him go. Later, McCarthy asked, \"What would've happened if you'd found a gun?\" Wilson said that he would have arrested the man. McCarthy asked him what his case for probable cause would have been, and Wilson couldn't answer. \"You'd be screwed,\" McCarthy said.\n\nMcCarthy had spent two years working as a police officer at a predominantly black middle school in the city of Normandy. (Michael Brown attended the school, but not when McCarthy worked there.) McCarthy told me that police officers he knew often disliked working in North County schools, because many students had an \"us versus them\" attitude. But he loved talking with the kids and \"investing in the community.\" He recalled, \"I would do the adopted-student program-take them to basketball games and things of that nature.\" Many of the kids confided in him about the stress of having to be \"man of the house\" when a parent worked nights. McCarthy said that his openness made the students more respectful: \"I wasn't the police to them, because they knew me on a personal level, rather than what that badge stood for.\" He said, \"People are amazing, and you have no idea what's going on behind that façade until you stop and try to know.\" Too many cops, he went on, weren't interested in understanding the \"root causes\" of crime; they preferred to \"go on calls, handle the call, and leave.\"\n\nWhen Wilson became a police officer in Jennings, he was joining a department that had a reputation for racism. Wesley Bell, a newly elected member of the Ferguson City Council, told me that he used to avoid driving through Jennings \"like the plague.\" This feeling endures. The current mayor of Jennings, Yolonda Henderson, who is black, told me that African-Americans in nearby towns \"still say, 'No, no, no, I ain't going over there.' \"\n\nWilson recalls hearing \"old-timers\" talk about racism in Jennings's past, but their stories didn't make a vivid impression on him. McCarthy, however, said that in the seventies and eighties the Jennings police \"did not play.\" He added, \"Basically, they'd beat you.\" During that period, many blacks from St. Louis moved to North County. Numerous towns there went from being majority white to being majority black. The police forces remained almost completely white.\n\nMcCarthy showed me several police logs from those decades, and many entries documented bigotry on the part of Jennings authorities. In April, 1973, a lieutenant described a holdup that had occurred near the police station. The suspects were two black males. At the bottom of the entry, someone had written, \"Men, you better leave your wallets at home. Niggers are going to come in the police station next and rob us.\" An entry from December, 1979, described an eighteen-year-old black male who was believed to have been involved in the shooting of a police officer but was then released, \"due to his lack of mental capacity.\" Below this, someone had scrawled, \"Kill the Fucker.\"\n\nMcCarthy said that police officers resist discussing racism, past or present. \"If an officer speaks out, they are ostracized,\" he said. \"They don't want anything negative to be out there. But we're humans-there's gonna be negative. Be honest about it. If you acknowledge it, that's the first step.\"\n\nWilson strongly disagreed with McCarthy about this. He granted that, in North County, the overt racism of past decades affected \"elders\" who lived through that time. \"People who experienced that, and were mistreated, have a legitimate claim,\" he told me. \"Other people don't.\" I asked him if he thought that young people in North County and elsewhere used this legacy as an excuse. \"I think so,\" he replied.\n\nLink copied\n\n\"I am really simple in the way that I look at life,\" Wilson said. \"What happened to my great-grandfather is not happening to me. I can't base my actions off what happened to him.\" Wilson said that police officers didn't have the luxury of dwelling on the past. \"We can't fix in thirty minutes what happened thirty years ago,\" he said. \"We have to fix what's happening now. That's my job as a police officer. I'm not going to delve into people's life-long history and figure out why they're feeling a certain way, in a certain moment.\" He added, \"I'm not a psychologist.\"\n\nWilson said that, despite what he'd said about experiencing \"culture shock,\" race hadn't affected the way he did police work: \"I never looked at it like 'I'm the only white guy here.' I just looked at it as 'This isn't where I grew up.' \" He said, \"When a cop shows up, it's, like, 'The cops are here!' There's no 'Oh, shit, the white cops are here!' \" He added, \"If you live in a high-crime area, with a lot of poverty, there's going to be a large police presence. You're going to piss people off. If police show up, it's because it's something bad, and whoever's involved can't figure out the problem for themselves.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Everyone is so quick to jump on race. It's not a race issue.\" There were two opposing views about policing, he said: \"There are people who feel that police have too much power, and they don't like it. There are people who feel police don't have enough power, and they don't like it.\"\n\nDuring Wilson's tenure in Jennings, an angry debate arose about how much power the police should have. In January, 2011, a white officer stopped a vehicle with expired license plates. The driver got out, but a black woman who had been riding in the passenger seat drove off. There was a child in the back seat. The officer shot at the car's tires. Though the car didn't crash, the child could have been seriously hurt. (The officer resigned.) Not long afterward, it was discovered that a lieutenant in Jennings had stolen federal funds allocated for drunk-driving checks. In March, 2011, the Jennings City Council voted to shut down the police department and hire St. Louis County to take over. McCarthy secured a job at the local jail, which the town still ran, but most of the other officers were laid off, including Wilson.\n\n\"When I left Jennings, I didn't want to work in a white area,\" Wilson told me. \"I liked the black community,\" he went on. \"I had fun there. . . . There's people who will just crack you up.\" He also liked the fact that there was more work for the police in a town like Jennings-more calls to answer, more people to meet. \"I didn't want to just sit around all day,\" he said.\n\nWilson, who had recently married a college student named Ashley Brown, didn't have to look far to find a new job. That October, he began policing in neighboring Ferguson, which was slightly more prosperous and about two-thirds black. He was mentored by another field-training officer: Barb Spradling, his future wife. Barb had been working in Ferguson for seven years, as one of three women on a force of roughly fifty officers. \"I always thought it was easier to work with guys, because they're not as catty,\" she said.\n\nThe training went smoothly. \"I made it easy on her, because all she really had to show me was the city limits and the paperwork,\" Wilson told me. \"I already knew the job.\" They began confiding in each other, and Wilson revealed that his marriage was foundering. Wilson also told Barb stories about his mother. Barb was moved, and before long they became a couple. \"I was, like, 'Wow, this guy has been through a lot,' \" she told me. \"And it seemed like he handled it all pretty gracefully.\"\n\nIn July, 2014, Wilson visited the home of Scottie Randolph, a sixty-seven-year-old African-American man, after Randolph reported hearing gunfire. Randolph says that shootings often occur in his neighborhood when \"the teen-agers are out of school.\" The frequency \"depends on whether they've got a drug war or a gang war going on.\" His neighborhood had fallen into disarray because of \"the economic meltdown.\" He added, \"A lot of people lost what little they had.\" Young people who couldn't find work resorted to selling drugs. Randolph told me that he needs the police for protection, but-echoing the Justice Department's findings-feels that they target blacks for fines: \"I kind of resent the fact that they're using minorities as a cash cow.\"\n\nWilson said that he often handled calls like Randolph's, and that such work was tough, because he could do little to help. I asked him if he agreed with Randolph that the neighborhood's main problem was the absence of jobs. \"There's a lack of jobs everywhere,\" he replied, brusquely. \"But there's also lack of initiative to get a job. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.\" He acknowledged that the jobs available in Ferguson often paid poorly, but added, \"That's how I started. You've got to start somewhere.\"\n\nGood values, Wilson insisted, needed to be learned at home. He spoke of a black single mother, in Ferguson, who was physically disabled and blind. She had several teen-age children, who \"ran wild,\" shooting guns, dealing drugs, and breaking into cars.\n\nSeveral times, Wilson recalled, he responded to calls about gunfire in the woman's neighborhood and saw \"people running either from or to that house.\" Wilson would give chase. \"It's midnight, and you're running through back yards.\" If he caught the kids, he checked them for weapons, then questioned them. He recounted a typical exchange: \" 'Why you running?' 'Because I'm afraid of getting caught.' 'Well, what are you afraid of getting caught for?' 'I don't know.' 'Well, there's a reason you ran, and there's a reason you don't want to get caught. What's going on?' \" Wilson said that he rarely got answers-and that any contraband had already been thrown away. Once, he arrested some of the woman's kids, for damaging property, but usually he let them go. In his telling, there was no reaching the blind woman's kids: \"They ran all over the mom. They didn't respect her, so why would they respect me?\" He added, \"They're so wrapped up in a different culture than-what I'm trying to say is, the right culture, the better one to pick from.\"\n\nThis sounded like racial code language. I pressed him: what did he mean by \"a different culture\"? Wilson struggled to respond. He said that he meant \"pre-gang culture, where you are just running in the streets-not worried about working in the morning, just worried about your immediate gratification.\" He added, \"It is the same younger culture that is everywhere in the inner cities.\"\n\nMost of Wilson's calls were routine-traffic stops, house alarms-but some were deeply distressing. At one crime scene, he discovered the mangled bodies of two dead women. A two-year-old, \"covered in blood,\" was crawling between them. I asked him if such incidents made it hard to sleep. \"No,\" he replied. \"I've never brought my work home.\" This was partly a matter of disposition, but Wilson noted that, while he and Barb were on the force, they lived twenty miles outside Ferguson. They needed \"that buffer\"-a \"chance to get out of that element.\"\n\nWilson's home life wasn't entirely peaceful, however. In May, 2013, Barb's ex-boyfriend John-the father of her younger son, who was then four-assaulted her, and also attacked Wilson. According to court papers, Barb said that John drank, and had beaten her in the past. (Barb asked me to omit John's surname, to protect her son's identity.) Barb testified in court that John \"pulled my hair,\" \"choked me,\" and \"punched me in the face.\" The Wilsons declined to discuss the incident with me.\n\nLink copied\n\nWilson says that he liked working in Ferguson, but after a year or so he discerned problems within the department. One day, he received a call about a woman screaming in the street. When he arrived on the scene, a rookie officer had already forced her onto the ground, arrested her, and handcuffed her. But the woman, the rookie had realized, hadn't deserved this treatment: she was having some kind of anxiety attack. \"Now what?\" he asked Wilson.\n\n\"You don't even know why you arrested somebody?\" Wilson said. Then he recalled who the rookie's field-training officer had been. Wilson summed up that officer's approach as \"Arrest them and figure it out later.\"\n\nWilson blamed the rookie's meagre training for his mistake. \"He didn't learn how to talk,\" Wilson said. There isn't much in the way of a reliable record about Wilson's own mode of communicating, except for a fifteen-second video that shows him arresting a twenty-nine-year-old white man named Michael Arman. That day, in October, 2013, Wilson was visiting Arman's house to deliver a court summons. Arman had several broken-down vehicles parked on his property, in violation of city rules. In his police report, Wilson says that Arman refused to take the summons, and so he arrested him for \"failure to comply.\"\n\nIn the video, Wilson approaches the front porch of the house and notices that he is being videotaped. \"If you want to take a picture of me one more time, I'm going to lock your ass up,\" he says, in an almost bored tone.\n\n\"Sir, I'm not taking a picture, I'm recording this incident,\" Arman says. \"Do I not have the right-\"\n\n\"No, you don't,\" Wilson says, inaccurately. The video ends. The encounter apparently did not escalate, but it is hardly a testament to Wilson's communication skills.\n\nArman was fined for his violation. According to NBC News, in 2013 Ferguson filed more than twelve thousand cases charging ordinance violations-everything from loitering to petty larceny. And there were more than eleven thousand cases charging traffic violations.\n\nThe Justice Department report on the city of Ferguson notes that police officers were punished when they didn't write enough tickets, and often issued multiple citations for a single stop. Wilson told me that he knew of an officer who had once issued sixteen. \"What the hell is the point?\" he asked me. He believed that such fines could create a \"vicious cycle,\" in which people could not pay what they owed, then were fined further for missing payments. \"That's almost abusive of power,\" he told me. I asked Wilson if he had issued multiple tickets. He said that he \"usually\" never wrote more than three.\n\nThree tickets, of course, could have ruinous consequences for a resident who was poor. I met a man from St. Louis named Sean Bailey, who had been stopped by the Ferguson police in 2005. He had parked his mother's car outside a Chinese restaurant, left a friend in the car, and run in to get take-out food. The police issued three violations, charging Bailey a hundred and two dollars for parking in a fire lane, and citing him for failure to register his car and driving without a valid license. Bailey, who was unemployed, couldn't afford to pay, and when he missed deadlines he was charged additional fines. He has since been arrested half a dozen times for having outstanding fines, and has spent three weeks in jail. He says that, cumulatively, he has paid hundreds of dollars, but the city says that he still owes another hundred and fifty-eight. He has little hope of paying the debt, because he and his four-year-old daughter are homeless.\n\nThough Ferguson police officers routinely arrested people for \"failure to comply,\" Wilson's arrest of Arman was unusual in one respect: Arman is white. The Justice Department report concludes that Ferguson's officers disproportionately charged black citizens with such violations. Wilson insists that he didn't perceive this bias. But the inequity was extreme: between 2011 and 2013, the Justice Department reported, ninety-four per cent of the people arrested in Ferguson for \"failure to comply\" were black. The Justice Department also reported that the Ferguson police routinely performed \"pedestrian checks,\" in which residents were stopped on the street, often without proper legal justification.\n\nIn police records, I found four well-documented instances in which Wilson was involved in \"ped checks.\" On February 27, 2014, he stopped a twenty-three-year-old black man named Aaron Simmons, outside a minimart. In the police report, Wilson remarks that the minimart was known as a place where drugs were sold. He also mentions that it was cold outside, and that while patrolling he had seen Simmons four times \"in this area.\" Wilson reports that, for his own safety, he told Simmons to remove his hands from his pockets. Simmons objected: it was freezing, and his pockets were empty. Wilson forcibly removed Simmons's \"hands from his pants, during which Simmons actively resisted my control.\" Wilson then requested Simmons to place his hands against the police car, so that he could be searched for weapons. When Simmons refused, Wilson arrested him for failure to comply. The report does not say that Simmons possessed anything illegal. During the arrest process, Wilson notes, he and Simmons had several physical confrontations, including one, at the police station, in which \"Simmons was pushed against the wall.\"\n\nI showed the four reports to Erin Murphy, an N.Y.U. law professor who studies Fourth Amendment issues. Murphy said that, in the case of Simmons, there was no legitimate reason for detaining him. The other ped checks were less dramatic, but also reflected \"questionable constitutional behavior.\" These reports, she noted, painted \"a familiar picture of contemporary law enforcement.\" Police officers, she added, are not entirely to blame-often, they are trying to \"enforce vague standards for detaining people that they don't really understand.\" (Wilson conceded that the failure-to-comply ordinance was exploited as an \"easy way to arrest someone.\" True violations, he said, involved more resistance than \"you telling someone to come here, and them saying, 'No, screw you.' \" But when I asked him to explain the ordinance further, he said, \"I'd have to read it again.\")\n\nThe Justice Department found other examples of systemic racial bias in Ferguson. From 2012 to 2014, the Ferguson police issued four or more tickets to blacks on seventy-three occasions, and to whites only twice. Black drivers were more than twice as likely as others to be searched during vehicle stops, even though they were found to possess contraband twenty-six per cent less often. Some charges, like \"manner of walking in roadway,\" were brought against blacks almost exclusively.\n\nWilson told me that Ferguson's force had a few bigoted members, but he denied that racism was institutional. The Justice Department's numbers were \"skewed,\" he said. \"You can make those numbers fit whatever agenda you want.\"\n\nWithin the city government, however, there appears to have been a disturbing level of cynicism about race and crime. In 2011, an e-mail circulated by police supervisors and court staff joked that a black woman who had an abortion was practicing good crime control. While Justice Department officials were investigating Ferguson, city officials repeatedly told them that the arrest statistics simply reflected the fact that black residents lacked \"personal responsibility.\" Indeed, before August 9, 2014-the day of Brown's death-there seems to have been almost no sense that the city needed to change. When I asked Wilson if he felt that Ferguson might boil over, he said, \"There's always going to be a little bit simmering in a high-crime, poverty area. In that area, police usually aren't coming over to have dinner.\"\n\nMark Byrne, who has been a councilman in Ferguson since 2010, told me that there were things he had missed: \"I didn't know, on August 9th, that we only had four African-American police officers on a force of fifty-three.\" In 2014, the city spent four times as much money on police uniforms as it did on police training. Byrne said, \"I could have done a better job.\"\n\nJust before noon on August 9, 2014, Darren Wilson was heading for a lunch date with Barb when his radio announced that there was a \"stealing in progress\" at the nearby Ferguson Market and Liquor. The dispatcher offered a description of the two suspects. Wilson radioed back: \"Do you guys need me?\" The dispatcher replied that the suspects had \"disappeared.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nWilson, who had just assisted a mother whose infant was having difficulty breathing, decided that if the robbery trail was cold he would continue on to lunch. Moments later, he encountered Michael Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson, walking down the middle of Canfield Drive.\n\nBrown was at a precarious juncture in his life. When he was twelve, his parents had split up. At first, he had lived with his mother, Lesley McSpadden, but by the age of sixteen he had moved in with his father, Michael Brown, Sr. \"He wasn't doing so good over there,\" Brown, Sr., told me. \"She was working-wasn't nobody there to kind of help him out-so he came back my way, and he was staying back and forth with me and my mother.\" Last summer, Brown was living with his maternal grandmother.\n\nBrown had struggled academically, and had switched schools several times. He was six feet five and weighed nearly three hundred pounds, and, because of his size, people often thought he was older than he was. Brown, Sr., recalls worrying that his son's physical stature might make him a target for the police. \"We had a conversation about just following orders,\" he said. \"After you thought that you were being disrespected, get a name and a badge number, so your parent can reach out to the police department and file a complaint.\" Most important was a simple directive: \"Obey.\"\n\nBrown had just graduated from Normandy High School, where he had participated in an alternative-education program. He was planning to study heating and cooling at a technical school, but hadn't yet started. Now summer was ending, and he had decisions to make.\n\nEach spring, Duane Foster, a music teacher at Normandy, who knew Brown in passing, tells his seniors, \"Since you've been a child, you have known every year, from August to June, that you're going to go to school. . . . For the first time in your life, you won't have anything set in stone. And that should make you scared.\"\n\nFor many of the students at Normandy, Foster said, attending college is not a possibility. At home, these students are often told that, once school ends, they must earn their keep. Some of these young people have very few options, he said, then asked, \"How do I compete with somebody struggling with poverty? How do I come into a classroom and say that you don't need to be selling drugs or participating in gang-like activity?\"\n\nFoster grew up near Ferguson, in Velda Village Hills. When his family moved there, in 1969, it was among the first black families in town. By the mid-seventies, the neighborhood was almost entirely black. Back then, there were jobs and two-parent families, and this created stability. \"We had General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford,\" he told me. \"So many factories.\" Those jobs are now gone, as are many fathers, he says.\n\nAccording to a recent analysis by the Times of American communities with at least ten thousand black residents, the city with the largest proportion of black men who are \"missing\"-in jail or prematurely dead-is Ferguson. Foster said, \"There's no real design for a middle class, or even a lower-middle class, in this area.\"\n\nMichael Brown's father played an active role in his life, but this isn't always the case for Normandy students. A third of Foster's students have a father in jail. Many of them believe, rightly or wrongly, that their father is innocent, and this inevitably shapes how young people in Ferguson view the police. This context, Foster says, helps provide a clearer picture of where Brown came from, and who his peers were.\n\nThe image of Brown that many people have was shaped by the surveillance video from Ferguson Market and Liquor. In that footage, we see Brown take several packages of cigarillos, then head toward the door. A clerk tries to stop him, but Brown easily shoves him aside. Store employees later told federal investigators that Brown looked \"crazy,\" used profane language, and asked the clerk, menacingly, \"What are you gonna do about it?\"\n\nDorian Johnson told me that, before entering the market, he and Brown \"never talked about stealing things.\" Johnson claimed that they were instead immersed in a discussion \"about the Bible and God-how you're supposed to be as a human going through life.\" After Brown stole the cigarillos and they left the store, they resumed this conversation. Johnson also claimed that he didn't even acknowledge that the theft had taken place, because he didn't want to rub Brown \"the wrong way.\" He told me, \"I was being a real good friend and staying with him, even though I know he committed a crime,\" and added, \"It wasn't like he robbed the store-like he held it at gunpoint or anything-so I didn't think the guy was really gonna call the police.\"\n\nThe most thorough account of what happened next comes from the Justice Department's report on the incident, which is eighty-six pages long.\n\nWilson was heading west on Canfield Drive, his window open, in his department-issued Chevrolet Tahoe. He spotted Brown and Johnson, and called out to them to use the sidewalk. According to Wilson, Brown replied, \"Fuck what you have to say.\" (Johnson denies that Brown said this, and claims that Wilson told them, \"Get the fuck on the sidewalk.\") Wilson surmised that Brown and Johnson were the robbery suspects, based on the descriptions offered on the radio and the cigarillos in Brown's hands. After calling for backup, Wilson parked his vehicle at an angle, barricading the roadway.\n\nAccording to Kevin Ahlbrand, the president of the Missouri Fraternal Order of Police, parking a police car in this manner is a common maneuver-a car in the street offers a cop protection in the event of a gunfight.\n\nJonathan Fenderson, who is a professor of African-American studies at Washington University, in St. Louis, told me that young black men are inclined to see the police as an \"occupying force.\" Intentionally or not, Wilson's decision to blockade the street sent a message: You will defer to the power that I exhibit, or I am going to force you back into place.\n\nAfter stopping his car, Wilson tried to open his door, but Brown blocked his way. It is impossible to know what Brown and Wilson then said to each other-or why the situation escalated so quickly. I asked Wilson repeatedly to discuss this moment with me, but he declined, noting that Brown's parents are pursuing a civil lawsuit, and that he didn't need details \"in print that they're going to try and spin.\"\n\nAccording to Wilson and several witnesses deemed credible by the Justice Department, Brown reached into the Tahoe's open window, grabbed Wilson, and punched him. This narrative, the report says, is supported by bruising on Wilson's jaw and samples of Brown's DNA found on Wilson's collar, shirt, and pants. It's not known why Brown did this, and many have speculated that Wilson provoked Brown somehow.\n\nAt this point, Wilson told investigators, his training kicked in and he reviewed his options. He did not carry a Taser, so the weapons at his disposal were mace, a retractable baton, and his gun. The only one readily accessible, Wilson said, was the gun. When he unholstered it, he told investigators, Brown reached for it. He told the grand jury that Brown said to him, \"You are too much of a pussy to shoot me.\" In the ensuing struggle, Wilson shot Brown in the hand. This sequence of events has factual support. Brown's DNA was detected on the inside of the driver's-side door, and soot from the gun's muzzle was found in Brown's wound, indicating that his hand was within inches of the weapon when it fired. It was the first time that Wilson had used his gun in the line of duty.\n\nLink copied\n\nWilson told the grand jury that Brown, upon being shot, had \"the most intense, aggressive face,\" and looked \"like a demon.\" Brown retreated, running east. Wilson chased him. Brown ran at least a hundred and eighty feet down Canfield Drive-his blood was found in the roadway-and then headed back toward Wilson. According to the Justice Department, eyewitnesses claiming that Brown raised his hands in surrender proved unreliable. (One of these witnesses, Dorian Johnson, continues to insist that Brown's hands were raised.) Witnesses deemed credible offered varying accounts of Brown's movement-\"charging,\" \"slow motion,\" \"running\"-but concurred that he was approaching Wilson. According to Wilson, he repeatedly ordered Brown to stop and get on the ground. Brown, who was unarmed, kept moving. At one point, Wilson told investigators, Brown put his right hand into his waistband, as if reaching for a weapon.\n\nSometime after the chase began, Wilson shot ten bullets at Brown. A few missed him, but he was hit in the chest, the forehead, and the arm. Autopsy reports indicate that, contrary to initial media reports, no bullets hit Brown in the back. It is possible that Wilson fired some of the errant bullets before Brown turned around, and the Justice Department report says that \"the autopsy results alone do not indicate the direction Brown was facing when he received two wounds to his right arm.\" Yet the report repeatedly underscores that eyewitness accounts describing Brown being shot from behind were unreliable.\n\nAcademics have studied whether cops exhibit racial bias when deciding whether to pull the trigger. Joshua Correll, at the University of Colorado Boulder, has done more than twenty studies on this topic. In 2000, Correll created a video game in which participants view images of armed and unarmed men-some black, some white. Participants must make rapid decisions about whether to shoot. Initially, Correll tested civilians-college students, mainly-and found that they were quicker to shoot black suspects than white suspects. They also were more likely to shoot unarmed suspects when those suspects were black. When Correll had police officers do the test, the results were more ambiguous. Officers, like civilians, were significantly quicker to shoot black suspects than white suspects; but cops showed no bias when shooting unarmed suspects by mistake. Correll believes that this is a result of the training that cops receive.\n\nWilson told the grand jury that when Brown was hit by the bullets he \"looked like he was almost bulking up to run through the shots, like it was making him mad that I'm shooting at him.\" This testimony has inspired much debate. In November, Melissa Harris-Perry, the commentator on MSNBC, noted that Wilson's use of language-much like his use of the word \"demon\"-was dehumanizing, and conformed to the \"myth of the black brute incapable of pain himself bent on inflicting pain on others.\" She added, \"Americans long have had difficulty in understanding, acknowledging, and having empathy for the pain of black men.\"\n\nBrown collapsed after being shot. At 12:05 p.m. , an ambulance-carrying the infant Wilson had assisted-came across the scene, and a paramedic pronounced Brown dead. The body remained on the hot asphalt for four hours. Hundreds of angry residents gathered, some shouting, \"Let's kill the police!\" Ferguson officials say that this volatility slowed down the processing of Brown's body, but the delay struck many onlookers as deeply insulting. As one local told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, \"You'll never make anyone black believe that a white kid would have laid in the street for four hours.\"\n\nSabrina Webb, one of Brown's cousins, lived on Canfield Drive, across from the scene of the shooting. She was at work when the shooting occurred. Her roommate called to report that someone had just been shot dead. Webb rushed home. She couldn't get down Canfield Drive in her car, so she parked on a nearby street and ran the rest of the way. She pushed through onlookers and discovered that the victim was her cousin. Brown was three years younger than she was, and they had seen each other the previous week. \"We were just happy,\" she says. \"Like normal kids.\" Now his dead body was lying on the street. \"That's going to always stay on my mind,\" she told me. \"Always. It's nothing you can get rid of.\"\n\nAt the Ferguson police station, Barb Wilson wondered why her husband hadn't showed up for lunch. Then, she told me, \"he just walked in and was, like, 'I just killed somebody.' \" Barb noticed that Wilson's \"face was flushed and red-it didn't look right.\" She decided that he needed space and, not knowing what else to do, took care of some paperwork. Wilson went to the hospital with his superiors, and debriefed them while he was examined for injuries. He returned to the station, and he and Barb headed home.\n\n\"Neither one of us knew what the reaction was going to be the next day,\" Wilson said. \"You know, a typical police shooting is: you get about a week to a week and a half off, you see a shrink, you go through your Internal Affairs interviews. And then you come back.\" Barb told me, \"I didn't think it would be a big weight on his shoulders. This is kind of what we signed up for.\"\n\nLater that night, however, they turned on the television and watched live coverage of unrest in Ferguson. Barb recalled, \"We stayed up all night watching, like, 'Oh, my God-what's going on? What are they doing?' \"\n\nBarb's younger son, who was then six, asked why there were images on television of Ferguson burning. Wilson told me, \"I said, 'Well, I had to shoot somebody.' And he goes, 'Well, why did you shoot him? Was he a bad guy?' I said, 'Yeah, he was a bad guy.' \"\n\nSoon after the shooting, Wilson called Mike McCarthy and gave him an account of what had happened. \"I never questioned it,\" McCarthy told me. Around the same time, he was involved in a shootout with an armed suspect, and he knew that such experiences were chaotic. McCarthy, who was moonlighting as a policeman in a North County town, answered a call about a domestic disturbance. He showed me a video of the incident.\n\nWhen McCarthy arrived on the scene, a black man in his twenties opened fire on him and another officer. The other cop was hit. The shooter sped off in his car. McCarthy got back into his car, letting out a strange, adrenaline-filled whoop. \"After I got shot at, I had one thing on my mind, and that was getting that son of a bitch,\" McCarthy told me. He pursued the shooter. \"Then it hit me-'I have to go back.' \" He returned to his colleague. Fortunately, the officer was unhurt; the bullet had been stopped by the Taser on his utility belt.\n\nMcCarthy's story made clear that even a seasoned veteran could forget protocol while under duress. He said of Wilson's troubles, \"It just tore me up, because here you had a young kid who was doing nothing more than his job-and was doing a job that I encouraged him and taught him how to do.\" McCarthy sympathized with some of the underlying rage that fuelled the protests-and the riots-but he was adamant that the shooting had nothing to do with race.\n\nA few days after the shooting, the Wilsons, worried that their address was about to be leaked online, fled to the house of a relative: \"We ran through the house, grabbed all our guns, and put some bags together.\" Wilson contemplated leaving St. Louis for good, then reconsidered. He told me, \"At least here I'd know where I'm welcome and not welcome.\"\n\nOn August 9th, as events unfolded in Ferguson, Rasheen Aldridge was working at an Alamo rental-car office at the St. Louis Airport. From the parking lot, he had a clear view of Interstate 70. \"I saw, like, forty police cars heading toward Ferguson,\" he recalled. On the Internet, he found an image of Brown's body in the street.\n\nAldridge, who was twenty at the time, had grown up in the impoverished Fifth Ward of St. Louis, but he was a homebody and spent little time on the streets. In kindergarten, Aldridge had entered the county's desegregation program, and attended school in an affluent suburb. Many of his friends were white and Jewish. His childhood was quite different from Michael Brown's, and perhaps for this reason he was drawn to Ferguson. On August 11th, he drove there with a friend.\n\nLink copied\n\nAldridge talked with residents, gathering firsthand accounts of what had happened. A few days later, he returned and watched, horrified, as looters ransacked a store. He and several others formed a raggedy line of defense. Some looters walked away, Aldridge says; others didn't. \"Some called us house niggers,\" he said, his voice cracking.\n\nIn subsequent weeks, Aldridge returned often to Ferguson, participating in protests that he hoped would peacefully bring change. Initially, he gave the police the benefit of the doubt. Then officers started firing tear gas into the crowds and, occasionally, calling protesters \"niggers.\"\n\nAldridge heard the media reports that Brown's hands had been raised and that Wilson had shot him in the back. It was Dorian Johnson who had first made these allegations, and they helped inspire the now famous rallying cry \"Hands Up, Don't Shoot.\" Although Johnson's story proved to be at odds with the Justice Department's findings, the narrative had taken hold-and, for many Americans, it has endured. In part, this is because Johnson's story was eminently plausible. Within the past year alone, the media has highlighted many examples of police brutality in which the facts strongly resemble the type of story that Johnson told-from the fatal choking of Eric Garner, on Staten Island, to the fatal shootings of Walter Scott, in North Charleston, South Carolina, and Samuel Dubose, in Cincinnati.\n\nAldridge told me that, based on what he had heard and read, he believed that Brown was in \"surrender mode\" when Wilson shot him. When we spoke, he admitted that he had not yet read the Justice Department's report on the shooting. It was hard not to notice a parallel: both Aldridge and Wilson had turned to the report that buttressed their own world view. It was as if the two Justice Department reports had come to present opposing realities.\n\nLegitimate questions linger about the shooting. If Brown was unprovoked, why did he reach into the police car and punch Wilson in the face? Why did Wilson fire ten shots? A young activist in Ferguson, Clifton Kinnie, said, \"The story doesn't make sense. Black youth don't fight police-we run.\"\n\nKinnie recounted a story of walking toward a park, with his younger brother. A police officer pulled up in his car and told them to get on the ground. Kinnie complied and told his brother to do the same. The officer was apparently searching for some suspects. Kinnie still recalls how aggressive the officer was, \"coming at us as if we were grown men.\" This was in 2005, when Kinnie was eight years old.\n\nKinnie's cynical view of the police was bolstered by the Justice Department's conclusions about the city of Ferguson. If the police generally acted in a racist and abusive manner, why give Wilson the benefit of the doubt?\n\nIn May, I posed this question to Brittany Ferrell and Alexis Templeton-a charismatic black couple who are two of the most visible activists in Ferguson. Templeton said that the two Justice Department reports \"pretty much contradict one another,\" adding, \"You have to say, Damn, if the Ferguson Police Department is racist, and Wilson works in the Ferguson Police Department, that means he might be racist, too.\" She said, \"They need to open up and relook at this case.\" Ferrell said, \"The system is going to do whatever it has to do to protect itself. And if that means protecting Darren Wilson, the officer who represents that system, they're going to do that.\"\n\nOne afternoon this spring, Ferrell and Templeton joined a protest in Ferguson. At the time, people were marching in Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray, and the mood in Ferguson was tense. About a hundred protesters gathered outside a church, then proceeded onto the street. They chanted, \"Indict! Convict! Send that killer cop to jail! The whole damn system is guilty as hell!\"\n\nThe plan was to shut down the intersection of West Florissant and Chambers Road for four minutes, in symbolic homage to the four hours that Brown's body lay in the street. When the protesters reached the intersection, they marched in front of oncoming cars. Horns honked, and an irate motorist yelled, \"Get out of the street so people can get to work!\" One car drove onto the elevated median and made a reckless U-turn. Another driver tried to force his way through the protesters, at considerable speed, and nearly hit one of them.\n\nThe police never showed up. Several squad cars remained parked just down the street, in an empty lot. Some locals told me that the Ferguson police often decided not to engage these days. Weeks later, one white resident told me, bitterly, that the cops had their \"hands tied\" and couldn't police \"the way they should.\" On one occasion, he said, he called the police about a possible break-in at a neighbor's house, and an officer advised him to arm himself. Mike McCarthy also lamented the situation: \"I don't think the cops in Ferguson can do a whole lot of policing these days.\" The Justice Department's exposé may have had a constraining effect, but it's also true that the city's leadership is in flux. A week after the report came out, the police chief, the city manager, and the municipal judge all resigned. (The city recently named Andre Anderson, who is black, its interim police chief. His first goal, he announced, was \"simply to build trust.\")\n\nLate in the evening on April 28th, violence broke out in Ferguson, and a store was looted. That night, I met up with McCarthy, in Jennings. On his police scanner, there were multiple reports of gunshots. \"They are getting ready to switch over to Code 2000,\" McCarthy told me. \"A riot code.\" A voice on the scanner then announced, \"I have the air unit en route to your location.\"\n\nThe problems in Ferguson, McCarthy told me, were rooted in a vast historical legacy of injustice: \"No matter what we do, we cannot right our wrongs to the African-American community.\" But police had to do their job-and he, for one, couldn't see himself leaving North County. \"I don't think I'd be effective,\" he said. \"It's not what I know.\"\n\nI asked him if, by the same logic, a man with the background of Darren Wilson would be inherently less effective in North County. McCarthy bristled. \"Watch what you're using for the definition of 'effective,' \" he said. \"I can do my job down there, but you're not getting the maximum use of my resources.\" What would be lost? The ability to communicate easily, he replied.\n\nI reminded him that he considered communication to be the most important skill in law enforcement. Wasn't Wilson's confrontation with Brown, on some level, about communication? Would an encounter with Brown really have played out in the same manner for McCarthy?\n\nHe insisted that he would have acted just as Wilson had. I then asked him to consider the initial moment of contact, when Wilson and Brown were still talking. \"It might not have escalated to that point,\" McCarthy conceded, uneasily. Later, he added, \"There is likelihood that it could've avoided that confrontation-the escalation of that confrontation.\" But he felt that such speculation was pointless.\n\nLink copied\n\nReverend Starsky Wilson is the co-chair of the Ferguson Commission, whose members have been asked by Missouri's governor, Jay Nixon, to study what factors might have contributed to the rioting. In Reverend Wilson's view, the moment when Darren Wilson first spoke with Michael Brown was enormously consequential. \"It frames the engagement and it sets a tone for the relationship,\" he told me. But this moment couldn't be isolated from all the mistakes that came before it. In places like Ferguson, police officers needed to spend more time in the schools, getting to know disadvantaged students, and they had to treat more residents as allies. He urged me to consider what might have happened if Wilson had known Brown, or Brown's grandmother, and was able to say, \"Does Miss Jenny know you're out here?\" Such a question, Reverend Wilson said, has a more potent moral authority. One afternoon this spring, I accompanied Darren and Barb Wilson to a park near their house, where they watched Barb's younger son practice baseball. Darren wore shades and a baseball cap, and we stayed in the Wilsons' S.U.V.\n\nWilson says that, after the grand jury cleared him, he wanted to rejoin Ferguson's police force. But he was told that his presence would put other officers at risk. \"They put that on me,\" Wilson said. He worked for two weeks at a boot store, stocking inventory, but quit when reporters started calling the store. \"No matter what I do, they try to get a story off of it,\" he told me.\n\nAfter the shooting, Barb was reluctant to return to the streets of Ferguson, for fear of being identified as Wilson's wife. The department recently offered her a job as a dispatcher-with a substantial pay cut. Barb decided to retire early. In the car, she turned to Darren and said, \"I just want that lottery ticket we bought in Piedmont to be a winner.\"\n\nI asked Wilson what he would do if the Ferguson police force offered him his job back. He seemed startled. \"I would-um-\"\n\n\"I would not allow him,\" Barb said.\n\n\"I would want to do it for a day,\" Darren said, finally, to show people that he was not \"defeated.\"\n\nIn our many discussions, Wilson rarely spoke of Michael Brown. Twice, I asked him if he had reflected on what kind of person Brown was. The first time I asked, it was early May, and Brown's parents had just filed their civil lawsuit against him. \"You do realize that his parents are suing me?\" he said. \"So I have to think about him.\" He went on, \"Do I think about who he was as a person? Not really, because it doesn't matter at this point. Do I think he had the best upbringing? No. Not at all.\" His tone was striking, given Wilson's own turbulent childhood.\n\nSix weeks later, Wilson told me that he had never really had a chance to contemplate who Brown was, because he had been preoccupied by the maelstrom that followed the shooting. I asked him if he thought Brown was truly a \"bad guy,\" or just a kid who had got himself into a bad situation. \"I only knew him for those forty-five seconds in which he was trying to kill me, so I don't know,\" Wilson said.\n\nBarb also said that she rarely thought about Brown. But she thought about a woman named Stephanie Edwards, whom she knew well. Edwards was the mother of Louis Head, Brown's stepfather. Before becoming a cop, Barb had worked with Edwards at a grocery store. Barb says that they talked every day for roughly ten years, learning minute details of each other's lives, but they didn't keep in touch when Barb became a cop.\n\nAfter the shooting, Edwards joined the protests, appearing at a rally wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with Brown's face. \"We are tired of police brutality,\" she told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \"I came out for justice.\" Barb wonders what would happen if she and Edwards crossed paths again. Barb assumes that much of the world assumes that she is a racist, but clings to the idea that Edwards knows better: \"I know that she knows, in her heart, that I am not like that.\" (Edwards could not be reached for comment.)\n\nOne recent afternoon, I met with Sabrina Webb, Michael Brown's cousin, on Canfield Drive, at the spot where Brown was killed. A makeshift memorial was in place: a pile of wilted flowers and sun-scorched Teddy bears. She recalled that, when she left her apartment the day after the shooting, \"you could still see brain matter on the street.\" She moved out soon afterward.\n\nWebb was still angry that Wilson had offered condolences only after the grand jury gave its decision. Wilson was interviewed by George Stephanopoulos, of ABC, and he said of Brown's parents, \"I'm sorry that their son lost his life. It wasn't the intention of that day. It's what occurred that day, and there's nothing you can say that's going to make a parent feel better.\" Wilson also reaffirmed, \"I did my job that day.\" I asked Webb how she felt about Wilson. \"Anger and hatred,\" she said. \"There's no forgiveness.\"\n\nMichael Brown, Sr., also feels \"resentment\" toward Wilson, and feels that nothing, not even Wilson's going to jail, can rectify what happened. When we spoke of the day of the shooting, I asked him what he believed had happened at Ferguson Market and Liquor. \"That's just out of character,\" he said. He also insisted that the video didn't \"show all the facts,\" though he wouldn't elaborate. His son, he said, \"was an average kid that did teen-age things and had fun and tried to live his life.\" Brown, Sr., said that two images of his son never leave his consciousness. One is from the last time he saw him smiling. It was on August 1st, the day that Brown graduated. They went out to eat. \"He had on a nice tie,\" Brown, Sr., recalled, quietly. The other memory is of his son lying on the ground, dead.\n\nSince the shooting, gun sales in Ferguson have spiked, and there is little sense of reconciliation. The sixteen members of the Ferguson Commission have been charged with proposing policy reforms. Rasheen Aldridge, the activist, who is a member of the commission, told me that last August he believed that Wilson deserved the death penalty. Since then, his views have softened: \"I can't hold hatred in me for too long.\" He still can't decide what kind of punishment Wilson deserves. \"I want to be, like, 'He needs to go to jail.' But then there's also that other side of me that understands everything. He is probably in prison, in a way.\"\n\nAt one point, I asked Wilson if he missed walking outside and going to restaurants. He told me that he still ate out, but only at certain places. \"We try to go somewhere-how do I say this correctly?-with like-minded individuals,\" he said. \"You know. Where it's not a mixing pot.\"\n\nWilson has received several thousand letters from supporters, and he has written thank-you notes to almost all of his correspondents. Many of the letters are from police officers. Some are from kids. One card reads, \"Thanks for protecting us!\" Wilson proudly showed me a drawer, in his living room, which contained dozens of police-department patches from cops expressing their support. None of those cops, however, had offered him a job. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "How Police Let One of America's Most Prolific Predators Get Away\n\nIn the middle of November, 2020, Kat Dahl, a federal prosecutor in Johnson City, Tennessee, received an unusual assignment. Dahl had been appointed by the Department of Justice to work with the Johnson City police. Almost all her cases involved \"run-of-the-mill\" federal charges related to the possession of drugs or firearms, Dahl told me. She had little experience with the detectives in the Criminal Investigations Division who usually handled state charges related to crimes like robbery and assault.\n\nThat day, Investigator Toma Sparks summoned her into the four-desk bullpen of C.I.D. Sparks and another officer, David Hilton, told Dahl that they wanted her to look into the case of a local businessman named Sean Williams. Williams, who was forty-nine, owned Glass & Concrete Contracting, which specialized in restoring historical buildings; he and his workers rappelled down their façades, limiting the need for scaffolding and earning him the nickname Spider-Man. Williams was well known in Johnson City, a community of some seventy-five thousand people in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. On a busy street downtown, he had a glass-fronted garage that housed a red Ultima GTR sports car and a rope swing. On one wall was a neon-hued mural showing Williams surrounded by gigantic cartoon breasts. Johnson City is a college town, home to East Tennessee State University, and many locals told me that they knew Williams as the host of wild parties at his fifth-story, three-thousand-square-foot condo, a block from the garage. After nearby bars closed, people would head to Williams's apartment, where he kept such curiosities as drones and exotic reptiles, as well as a seemingly endless supply of alcohol and cocaine, which he served from a large pepper grinder.\n\nThe detectives told Dahl about an incident that had taken place at the apartment two months earlier. That night, a thirty-two-year-old woman named MiKayla Evans had gone with a friend of hers to Williams's garage, where Williams was drinking with several people, including his best friend and occasional roommate, Alvaro Diaz. At one point, Williams began pushing Evans on the swing. She later told me that, although she'd had only a few beers and a single shot earlier in the evening, she began to feel woozy, and her memories of the night abruptly ended. \"I don't remember walking back down the street,\" she said. \"I don't remember going up the elevator, or being in his apartment.\" In the end, Evans fell five stories from Williams's window. The impact was so loud that people in a restaurant around the corner thought it was a gunshot. Evans's next memory was of waking up from a coma in a hospital bed more than a week later. She had fractured more than a dozen bones, including in her skull and back, and had dislocated her elbow. Hours after the fall, police officers had searched Williams's apartment and seized more than two hundred rounds of ammunition. Williams had a felony conviction from the nineteen-nineties, for growing marijuana, and it was illegal for him to possess firearms or ammunition.\n\nDahl, who was twenty-nine and a Special Assistant U.S. Attorney, had been in her job for just over a year. She had found that federal authorities typically showed little interest in ammunition cases in which the suspect lacked a significant criminal record and no firearm was recovered. So she was surprised when the officers asked her to pursue an indictment. When she asked for more information, Sparks said, of Williams, \"We think he's a rapist.\" During the search, officers had photographed a long strip of paper with a handwritten list: twenty-two first names, one of which was accompanied by the word \"baby,\" along with an entry that read \"no name girl.\" At the top of the list was an underlined word: \"Raped.\" In a safe, according to photos the police took of its contents, they found a baby doll that appeared to have been turned into a makeshift sex toy. Sparks also told Dahl about two previous police reports filed by women who said that Williams had sexually assaulted them. The reports, he said, accorded with a reputation Williams had in Johnson City as a predatory \"dirtbag.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nDahl was \"gobsmacked,\" she told me. \"I just immediately had this gut feeling that this was big.\" Yet the officers didn't seem inclined to pursue the rape allegations. \"I remember asking things like 'Have you made contact with any other victims? Have you identified any of the women on the list?' \" Dahl said. \"There just seemed to be zero interest in that. They would answer no, and hem and haw when I suggested possible tactics.\" Nor did the officers exhibit much sympathy for the women involved. Hilton described the black tube dress Evans had been wearing when she fell from Williams's window, saying, \"She's dressed like a real-well, I won't say it.\" (A lawyer for Sparks declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation. Hilton did not respond to repeated inquiries.) Dahl told the officers that she would look into the case, as long as her investigation was not limited to the ammunition charge.\n\nDahl, who has platinum hair and large, gentle eyes, often breaks into nervous laughter at her own remarks. But when talking about legal matters she has a confidence that borders on intensity. By the end of her conversation with the detectives, she told me, the case had become her \"top priority.\" In the following weeks, she stayed up late in her two-bedroom rental house, twenty minutes' drive from Johnson City, scrutinizing Williams's social-media accounts and financial and property records. She combed through the names on the list, and identified several of the women. But when she urged the police to interview them they seemed to resist. \"It fell on deaf ears,\" she said. \"They just ignored me.\"\n\nDahl requested the police reports containing the two sexual-assault allegations against Williams, but received no reply. She asked for the reports three more times before Sparks finally provided them, weeks later. He told her that the allegations had not been followed up on because the women were unwilling to coöperate. When Dahl read the reports, however, she had a different impression.\n\nIn November, 2019, Briana Pack, who was twenty-two, was drinking at a bar near Williams's apartment when she and a friend ran into Diaz, Williams's close confidant, who brought them back to the apartment. After she accepted a beer from Williams, she began to feel groggy. She tried to leave, but Williams and Diaz blocked her exit. Her last memory was of sitting on a barstool. She told police that she woke up in Williams's bed the next morning, unsure of how she got there. A friend drove her to an urgent-care clinic to obtain a drug test; it came back positive for benzodiazepines, which she hadn't knowingly taken. Then she went to a hospital for a rape kit. (Williams has denied giving women date-rape drugs, and says that any encounters with his accusers were consensual. Diaz did not respond to repeated requests for comment and has not been charged with any crimes related to Williams.)\n\nWhen Pack contacted the Johnson City police, she recalled, an officer told her, \"Other women have reported similar things there. We know exactly who this guy is.\" A police report filed that day refers to prior calls about Williams and asks that the case be forwarded to C.I.D. Pack said that she was eager to coöperate with an investigation, but the police failed to follow up, or to respond to calls from her, for the next year and a half. After Dahl began investigating Williams, Sparks called Pack to tell her that her rape kit had tested positive for DNA that was not hers. (Rape-kit results are often subject to extreme delays.) Pack says that Sparks also asked her what she was wearing the night of the alleged assault. She was afraid that Williams might retaliate against her for going to the police, but when she asked if officers could provide her with protection Sparks refused, calling Williams \"untouchable.\" Pack nevertheless wanted to press charges, but Sparks stopped returning her calls. \"I felt like they related more with him than they did with me,\" she told me. \"I tried to do the right thing. I wanted to protect other girls. They didn't want to make any effort, in any way, shape, or form.\"\n\nThe second sexual-assault allegation had been made by another twenty-two-year-old. In June, 2020, she had been out drinking in Johnson City when she encountered Diaz, who was a friend, and went with him to Williams's apartment. According to the initial police report, at around three-thirty that morning she woke up with Williams on top of her. She jumped up and immediately called 911, screaming for help. When the police arrived, minutes later, she was running from the building, crying. (Williams denies having a sexual encounter with her.) Officers helped her get home and offered her a rape kit, which she declined.\n\nLater that month, she went to the police station and gave a statement. An officer's summary of the statement said that the incident had merely been an \"attempted\" rape, and that she was declining to pursue charges because she had \"learned her lesson.\" When Dahl read the file, she was puzzled by how meagre it was, and by how little detectives had done to investigate the allegations. \"A screaming, shoeless woman runs into the arms of a cop,\" Dahl said. \"They don't go up and interview Williams. They know it's him. They never follow up. On what planet does that make any sense?\" She called the woman. \"I had this increasing suspicion that sexual-assault victims were being either scared off or treated in a way that made it unlikely for them to pursue charges,\" Dahl told me. The woman sounded surprised to hear from law enforcement again, but she agreed to give an additional statement about the incident. Dahl accompanied her to her meeting with the police. After hearing the new details, she said, \"I just remember being stunned, because the context was more harrowing than the one brief paragraph in the report.\"\n\nDahl was born in Kansas, to an Army-veteran father and a devoutly Catholic homemaker mother, and she told me that her childhood observations of military and Church bureaucracy taught her that \"institutional rot can be really toxic.\" She studied musical theatre in high school, and felt drawn to stories of rebellion. (\"Les Misérables\" was a favorite.) In 2016, after attending college and law school in Tennessee, she moved to Washington, D.C., to work as a policy assistant for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Her first week on the job, she went for drinks with a friend, and emerged from being blackout drunk to find that he was assaulting her. She went to the police in nearby Arlington, Virginia, to report that she'd been raped. She says that an investigator assigned to her case was dismissive, at one point telling her, \"It's not rape if he's drunk, too.\" The interview was so caustic that a higher-ranking officer who reviewed footage of it invited Dahl back and apologized, telling her that he was \"appalled.\" Nevertheless, she was so discouraged that she decided not to try to press charges. The experience galvanized her desire to work in criminal justice, and, when she was offered the role in Johnson City, she leaped at it. The Williams case had a personal dimension. \"It was so deeply familiar to me, the way these victims were being questioned and dismissed,\" she told me. \"It brought back everything I went through when I reported my assault, and I couldn't stand to see it happening again.\"\n\nInaction, incompetence, and bias are hardly novel in such cases. The Department of Justice has conducted several recent investigations into systematic failures in the handling of sex crimes by police departments. In 2023, the D.O.J. published a report indicating that the Louisville Metro Police had neglected to adequately gather evidence in response to claims of sexual assault and often relied on \"sex-based assumptions\" and \"stereotyping.\" An investigation into gender bias in the New York Police Department's approach to sex crimes is ongoing. Criminologists say that police are often skeptical of women who report sexual assault if they were drinking, were at a party, or knew the assailant.\n\nBut the Johnson City Police Department's handling of the Williams case was hard to explain through these elements alone. Dahl was especially perplexed by the response to Evans's fall. Sparks and an officer named Justin Jenkins, who arrived at Williams's apartment soon after the incident, agreed to a demand from Williams that they leave and come back with a warrant, even though there is an exception to warrant requirements when evidence might be tampered with. The officers had photographed security cameras pointing at the window that Evans had fallen from, but did not secure them. They returned to the station with Williams, leaving the scene in the care of Diaz. They saw Williams accessing footage from the cameras on his phone, which they didn't confiscate until he left the station.\n\nThe police allowed Williams to return home for several hours unsupervised. During that time, Williams told me, he received a call from an employee with law-enforcement connections, who warned him that the officers were coming back. He and Diaz frantically cleaned up the apartment, hiding cameras in a closet and gathering drugs and firearms in a metal ammunition box that Williams threw out a window.\n\nSparks, Hilton, and Jenkins spent much of the day at the apartment. They didn't recover the ammo box or its contents. They and their colleagues never attempted to examine the contents of some of the devices they did seize, including computers, memory cards, and phones. When Dahl read the records of the search, she asked Sparks for a warrant to access the remaining devices. Two months later, Sparks submitted a draft warrant that Dahl found so vague and incomplete that she considered it \"not even usable\"-she believed that either a judge would reject it or any evidence gathered under it could be challenged in court. \"It felt like the definition of insanity, trying to get J.C.P.D. to do more on this,\" she told me. \"They didn't want to pursue the rape cases, because a slew of mistakes had already been made. And, if they were to fully dive in and investigate, I think some of those mistakes would have come to light. I think you would have had a whole bunch of people say, 'Well, why wasn't anything done sooner?' \"\n\nOther women continued to come forward with allegations against Williams. The month that Dahl took on the case, Kaleigh Murray, at the time a single mother of three, reported Williams to the F.B.I. In October, 2019, she had gone to a Halloween party at Williams's apartment, where she took a drink from him. Shortly afterward, she blacked out. Her next memory was of finding him passed out on top of her, naked. She later told me that the incident contributed to a mental-health crisis during which she surrendered custody of her children. In early 2020, during what Murray called \"the darkest period of my life,\" Williams contacted her, and they struck up a friendship. He expressed regret about his life style and told her that he wanted to reform. Their friendship ended that November, when, she says, she snorted a line of cocaine Williams offered her and blacked out. The next thing she remembered was him holding her down and trying to manually penetrate her, first vaginally and then, when she pushed him away, anally. She told me that she waited until she thought Williams had passed out, then fled.\n\nMurray contacted the F.B.I., rather than local police, \"because I did not trust the Johnson City Police Department,\" she told me. She said that she'd previously experienced sexist treatment from the department, including a frisking that she found humiliating and intrusive. Nevertheless, the F.B.I. referred the matter to a J.C.P.D. officer, who immediately informed Sparks. Though Sparks was off duty at the time, he went to the F.B.I. field office to assume control of the case. Later that day, when Sparks interviewed her, he said, inaccurately, that no other woman had wanted to pursue charges against Williams, because, as she remembered the remark, \"everyone else had been too fearful.\" Murray, who interpreted the comment as an effort to dissuade her, replied that she wanted to press charges. She didn't hear from the police again for five months, at which point she went to talk to Sparks. He told her not to expect further follow-up until her rape-kit results were returned. More than four years later, she still has not received the results.\n\nSparks and the other detectives seemed to have no plan for pursuing Williams. Dahl suggested avenues for investigation, to little avail. \"I was going home and researching and combing through social media until, like, one in the morning, and coming back to them, like, 'I found a possible lead,' or 'I think you should check this out.' I was always given the side-eye and told, 'Kat, we're tired of hearing about Williams,' \" she said. \"And meanwhile more victims were coming in.\" At least six assaults are now alleged to have taken place between October, 2020, and the following April, as Dahl struggled to advance the case.\n\nDahl had been investigating for almost a month when she decided that she was at an impasse. In December, she reached out to her supervisor at the D.O.J., Wayne Taylor, who scheduled a meeting between Dahl and officials with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, a state organization that Dahl hoped might provide oversight. When Karl Turner, the chief of the Johnson City Police Department, found out about the meeting, he called Taylor, furious that it had been planned without his consent. The meeting was cancelled, and Turner called Dahl into his office. Dahl recorded their meeting, in which Turner seemed indifferent to the case and rejected her suggestion that they contact women whose names matched those on the list that officers had seen at the apartment. \"I don't know if that's girls he's raped or girls he's had consensual sex with and he calls it whatever he calls it,\" Turner said. Instead, he proposed merely that they place cameras outside Williams's garage. Increasingly distressed, Dahl warned Turner that, based on the baby-doll sex toy, she believed that Williams might be preying on children. (Taylor and Turner, through representatives, declined to comment. Turner has denied any wrongdoing.)\n\nDahl's relationship with the police department was deteriorating. Turner contacted Taylor, Dahl's supervisor, and told him that she had exhibited poor communication skills. In the following months, Turner continued to complain to Taylor about Dahl. Her focus on the Williams case became a running joke in the department. Once, Dahl recalls, a colleague jokingly suggested that she serve as bait, telling her, \"If you're so obsessed with this case, why don't you go have a drink at Label\"-a bar where Williams was rumored to prey upon women-\"and let him take you up to his apartment, then give us a call?\"\n\nIt's not clear why officers told Dahl about the rape allegations while discouraging her from pursuing them. Dahl believes that they wanted to eliminate the increasingly visible problems Williams was creating while avoiding scrutiny of their errors in policing his more serious crimes. \"A simple weapons charge was the way to do that,\" she told me. Dahl was reluctant to pursue an indictment only on the ammunition case, which was not a particularly serious offense. \"I was very keen to avoid anything that I thought could fail and let him get away,\" she said. \"But the flip side of the coin is the longer I wait, the more opportunities he has to hurt people.\" She finally decided that she could wait no longer. Grand-jury hearings were limited, owing to COVID precautions, but eventually, in April, 2021, she secured an indictment on the ammunition charge.\n\nThe arrest warrant was placed under seal, to reduce the risk that Williams might flee. During the next three weeks, Dahl lodged more than thirty requests with Sparks and other Johnson City police officers, asking them to arrest him. She was offered various excuses-the officers were busy, or had conflicting training schedules, or, as one officer, Jeff Legault, told her, Williams simply wasn't a priority. (Through a lawyer, Legault said that he was aware only of the minor ammunition charge, which was not his primary responsibility.) At one point, an officer told Dahl that they couldn't execute the warrant because they lacked the code to the front door of Williams's building. Dahl recalled asking, \"Are you law enforcement?\"\n\nFinally, in mid-May, an officer was sent to knock on Williams's door. Williams, who was hosting a party, didn't answer. \"I could see through the peephole. It was one single cop by himself,\" Williams later told me. \"I called 911. I was, like, 'What the fuck is this cop outside of my door for?' \" During the call, an officer at the station disclosed the existence of the warrant. Williams fled the apartment, evading the officer by rappelling out of a window.\n\nAfter the botched arrest, Turner pressed Dahl to focus on other cases. In a meeting that month which Dahl recorded, Turner referred to Williams as a nuisance who had already been dealt with. \"He just needs to calm down,\" Turner said. \"He'll get over it.\" Captain Kevin Peters, who was also at the meeting, said, \"I think we've achieved our desired outcome.\" (A representative for Peters denied any wrongdoing.) But Dahl was convinced that Williams still posed a danger. \"I was obsessed with Williams,\" she told me. \"I was, like, I don't care. I am going to work on this as much as I want. What are they going to do? Fire me?\"\n\nA month later, Turner told Dahl that her contract would not be renewed, and that her job would be terminated in less than a week. It was an unusually blunt firing for a prosecutor in the midst of several cases, including one, unrelated to Williams, with a trial date two months away. The department later argued that Dahl had brought an insufficient number of indictments before grand juries. But Dahl's productivity appears to have been roughly on par with that of her colleagues. From the start of the pandemic until her firing, she secured nineteen indictments; in the same period, five colleagues working in the same courthouse brought between ten and twenty each. Dahl told me that her job performance was being judged by the uniquely harsh standards reserved for institutional whistle-blowers. \"Everything that I've done within this job is now under a microscope,\" she said.\n\nIn July, 2021, during her final days at the J.C.P.D., Dahl wrote to me using an encrypted e-mail account and a pseudonym. She told me that she was a federal prosecutor who was desperate to apprehend a serial rapist and encountering obstruction. \"Worst case scenario, I believe there is a possibility that this person is being protected by local law enforcement,\" she wrote. \"All I want is some accountability in this case.\"\n\nEven after Dahl was fired, the Williams case dominated her life. Living in a community where she was at odds with the police took a toll. \"I had joked with several friends, 'If I get mugged downtown, congratulations to the mugger, because I'm not calling the cops,' \" she said. She bought a .22-calibre mini-revolver, \"just in case.\" She supported herself with freelance legal-drafting work, and continued to investigate. Ultimately, she connected with several of the women on the list from Williams's apartment, all of whom told her similar stories of being drugged and assaulted; they recalled feeling discouraged when they went to the police.\n\nEven her social life was consumed by the case. Drinks and meals often became opportunities to gather leads. \"It was usually met with something along the lines of 'Oh, are you talking about the drug-dealing rapist?' \" she said. \"It became apparent pretty quickly that this was an open secret.\" The day after her firing, she went on a date with a man she had met on Hinge. She mentioned the garage, and the man instantly identified Williams. \" 'Oh, yeah, that guy is a creep,' \" she recalled him saying. \" 'There was a girl who got into an accident and died after she left the apartment.' \"\n\nThis was news to Dahl. She found an obituary for Laura Shea Trent, who had died in a car crash in November, 2020. Dahl reached out to Trent's sister Sarah, who told her that, on the night she died, Trent and her boyfriend, Noah Sedam, who was an acquaintance of Williams's, had briefly stopped by the garage after drinks at a brewery. After they left, Sedam realized that his phone was missing and returned to the brewery to look for it. When he came back, five minutes later, he told me, \"she was just gone, disappeared, vanished.\" The garage was closed. Trent's car was nearby.\n\nSedam told me that, when he left Trent, she was drunk but walking and talking competently. But soon afterward she began placing frantic calls to family members, sounding incoherent and inconsolable. \"She was just in such distress that she didn't even know who she had called,\" her sister Stacy told me. She drove around looking for Trent while she and Sarah tried to get their sister to describe where she was. Eventually, Trent stopped responding.\n\nMinutes after her last call to her sisters, Trent crashed her car into a concrete traffic island, dying at the scene. Sarah told me that both Diaz and Williams later told her that Trent had gone with them and had more to drink. When I spoke to Williams, he didn't deny that Trent may have been in his apartment. He asked, \"Didn't they do a toxicology report? Was there any sign of downers?\" (Trent's blood showed a high level of alcohol, but exhaustive testing for date-rape drugs was not carried out.)\n\nTwo days after Trent's death, Sarah called the Johnson City police, telling them that she believed Williams had been with her sister before she died. After she named Williams, an officer told her that Johnson City lacked jurisdiction in this case, and advised her to call law enforcement in nearby Elizabethton, where the crash had happened. Elizabethton sent her back to the Johnson City police, whom she eventually again asked to look into Williams, telling them that she feared Trent had been drugged. She never heard back. But Dahl realized that Sparks had assigned her the Williams case within a day of Sarah's first phone call. \"The fact that they gave me the case a day later, without mentioning any of this-it's not a coincidence,\" Dahl said.\n\nBy the time she learned about Laura Trent, Dahl had pieced together much of Williams's history. \"I had a picture in my head of what he was like,\" she said. Williams had been brought up in a modest suburban home in Largo, Florida, where a slab of concrete in the back yard still bears his child-size footprints. His sister Auburn Shapiro told me that their mother, who died in 2020, was \"a hustler\" who \"worked her ass off\" to support the family, taking jobs as a notary and at the reservations line at Delta, and eventually doing clerical work for Williams's business. When Williams was nine, his parents divorced. A few years later, his mother remarried and moved with Williams to what he described as \"redneck fucking hillbilly-town North Carolina,\" where his stepfather owned property. \"It was almost doomed from the start,\" Shapiro said. \"There was no house. We lived in trailers, on welfare.\" Williams's stepfather, a lawyer who was later disbarred for billing clients for work he didn't perform, was an alcoholic who also struggled with heroin addiction. He was, Shapiro told me, physically and emotionally abusive. \"He would make Sean sleep outside on an unheated porch in the cold, or punch him in the stomach,\" she said. \"Sean doesn't call what he went through 'abuse.' But I think it shaped how he sees boundaries and consent.\"\n\nAfter the move to North Carolina, Williams, still in his early teens, fathered a daughter. When he was fourteen, child-protective services took him into custody. For the rest of his teens, he was sent to a series of foster homes and juvenile-justice programs, often running away soon after he arrived. At one point, he fled a disciplinary camp with several other students he'd persuaded to join him. At one of his placements, a woman whom Williams described as his foster mother began a sexual relationship with him, leading to the end of her marriage.\n\nAt eighteen, Williams started a relationship with a thirty-five-year-old woman which lasted seven years. While they lived together, Williams grew marijuana and launched a business, first cleaning high-rise windows and then expanding into waterproofing, pressure washing, and historical-building restoration. The company grew as he netted contracts on large buildings in Greensboro and other cities in the area. In the mid-two-thousands, Williams got a contract to restore a building in Johnson City and began renting the first of several apartments he would ultimately own there, including the condo where much of his alleged criminal activity took place. Those years were also marked by increasingly heavy drug use-eventually, Williams was buying large quantities from out of state. \"I was a collector,\" he said. \"Any kinds of drugs that came in, I would buy it.\" Williams told me that he only occasionally sold drugs, preferring to give them to friends and acquaintances, but several of his associates said that they believed he had ties to traffickers.\n\nWhile Williams was evading arrest, Dahl tried to track him down herself. She drove past his garage and his apartment, to see if the lights were on. His attempts to stay out of sight were halfhearted. He continued to post on social media, sometimes revealing his location. Dahl followed information in one post to a construction site operated by his company in Asheville, North Carolina. At a nearby hotel, she spoke to a manager who told her that Williams had recently been kicked out for being too rowdy and for keeping drugs in his room. The manager also feared for the safety of a young woman Williams had with him. Dahl repeatedly called the U.S. Marshals with leads about where Williams might be. She told them to search the area surrounding a house she had visited in Cullowhee, North Carolina. His mother had once lived there, and Dahl believed that the location was significant to Williams-and that the surrounding woods might provide a hiding place. An official with the U.S. Marshals said that Dahl's tips were taken seriously. Nevertheless, Dahl told me, for nearly two years, \"it just never went anywhere.\"\n\nThe authorities need not have looked very far. For more than a year after the arrest attempt, Williams spent the majority of his time in Johnson City, often staying with a neighbor in the same building as his condo. He seemed to have little concern about the police. \"I mean, they fucking knew where I was,\" he later told me. \"They didn't want to find me at all.\" He continued to conduct business openly. In April, 2022, Johnson City's manager, Cathy Ball, who is responsible for overseeing the police department, even entered into a contract to buy his apartment. According to text messages later disclosed during a lawsuit, Ball's real-estate agent, Shannon Castillo, spoke with Williams on the phone, and at one point left documents at his condo for his signature. Ball told Castillo that she had chosen to withhold information about Williams from a home inspector, writing, \"I did not tell him the story behind Sean.\" Williams said that Ball was aware of his fugitive status: \"Everyone knew.\" (Before the texts were disclosed, Ball said that Williams's name \"did not mean anything\" to her, and Castillo, according to a person familiar with her thinking, claimed that she was never involved in the matter. Both declined requests for comment after the texts surfaced. A spokesperson for Johnson City said that Ball \"did not know Sean Williams, she never paid Sean Williams any money, and she did not purchase any property from Sean Williams.\") Williams eventually pulled out of the deal and sold the apartment to a company owned by a local businessman.\n\nBut Williams didn't think that his impunity could last. \"So I took off,\" he said. He stayed away from Johnson City, occasionally sleeping in his car, for nearly a year. At around 2 A.M. on April 29, 2023, a security guard for Western Carolina University, in Cullowhee, found Williams in his car. He was carrying twelve ounces of cocaine, fourteen ounces of methamphetamine, a hundred thousand dollars in cash, and a slew of hard drives. The drives contained thousands of videos and images that, federal prosecutors say, depict sex crimes against some sixty-seven victims, many of them drugged and unconscious, including multiple minors. Investigators later also found child pornography and evidence of sex crimes on the devices that the Johnson City police had failed to search. The number of allegations against Williams may make him one of the most prolific serial rapists in American history. Many of the photographs and videos on the drives had file names consistent with the names on the list that Dahl had sought to investigate. (Williams initially claimed that the files were fabricated with artificial intelligence. He recently acknowledged to me that he routinely had sex with women while they were unconscious or asleep, saying that he believed this to be permissible because of prior consensual sexual encounters.) After two years on the run, Williams had been found in the town that Dahl had told the U.S. Marshals to search.\n\nWilliams was charged with multiple counts related to child pornography, and with possession and intent to distribute methamphetamine and cocaine. More than twenty charges involving child sexual abuse would eventually follow. Dahl, who was alerted to the news by a text from MiKayla Evans, was taken aback by the scale of his predation. \"If he hadn't been caught at that moment in time, when he had those hard drives on him, I don't think we would be having this conversation,\" she said.\n\nBut Williams's prosecution was soon delayed by improbable difficulties in keeping him confined. In July, 2023, he was accused of attempting to dig out of his cell in a county jail in Jonesborough, Tennessee, where he was awaiting trial on some of the child-pornography charges. (It was later determined that Williams had been digging a hole to exchange items with a neighboring cell.) That October, while being transferred in a van to a court appearance, Williams lifted a loose portion of the vehicle's wall panelling and snapped off a narrow metal clip underneath. He used the clip to pick the locks on his belly chain and handcuffs, then kicked out a window, which was missing its metal security bars. He squeezed through the window and jumped onto the road, breaking his wrist but successfully escaping.\n\nA camera in the van was out of service. \"We had to initially wonder, Did some correctional officer help him, or were they negligent, or was he just really slick and got out without their notice? How did that happen?\" David Jolley, a U.S. marshal who worked on the case, asked. (Williams declined to answer my questions about whether he was helped, saying he didn't want to \"get anybody else in trouble.\")\n\nLocal outlets, including the television station WJHL and the Tennessean , began covering Williams's case and his Houdini-like escape, intensifying pressure on state and federal authorities. The marshals, working with the F.B.I. and the T.B.I., assigned more than a hundred people to search for him. As helicopters circled overhead and sniffer dogs patrolled, Williams sheltered in an abandoned house just a few blocks from the courthouse where he had been scheduled to appear. He constructed a pulley system to get himself in and out of the house's attic and scavenged for food, including walnuts from a nearby tree. He was able to siphon power from a neighboring house. \"I watched old VCR tapes of 'The Fugitive' and 'U.S. Marshals,' \" he told me.\n\nIn Williams's telling, he survived through an almost unbelievable ingenuity. He claims that he began collecting tools, including a serrated knife and sockets, and used them to work on an abandoned truck he found near the house. \"That truck was my ticket out,\" he told me. Williams said that he found a stash of thirty pounds of marijuana and saw an opportunity to sell it to sustain himself on the run-though a close associate of his cast doubt on that claim, saying that Williams had previously boasted about a buried cache of money.\n\nWilliams drove to North Carolina and visited his daughter, Kari Dills, who was in her thirties. Dills described her father as an alternately absent and abusive figure in her life. \"I was six when I found out who my dad was,\" she told me. \"I visited him a few times. I was then sexually abused by him.\" (Williams and Dills's maternal grandmother, who raised her, both denied these allegations, saying that he had no contact with her until her late teens.) When he arrived, wearing a mask, at the discount department store where Dills worked, she didn't recognize him. \"It's me,\" Williams recalled telling her, pulling down the mask. Panicked, Dills told him she would get a pen to write down his phone number, then told her manager, who called the police. \"I was crying and didn't know what to do,\" she told me. As he waited for her to return, Williams \"felt something wasn't right,\" he said, and left.\n\nWilliams followed I-75 to Florida. He says that he sold the marijuana for six hundred dollars in cash, and holed up for several days in Largo. He turned wistful. He knocked on the door of his childhood home, and its owners let him into the back yard, to see the concrete with his footprints in it. On November 20, 2023, Williams's truck was found by a local police officer. As a manhunt began, Williams hid under a canoe overnight.\n\nThe next evening, Williams walked barefoot into a 7-Eleven and bought a hot dog. He asked for ketchup, and to purchase masks. Tasha Bumgarner, a clerk at the store, recognized him from a police photo. \"I had goosebumps when I turned and looked at him,\" she said. She told a co-worker, \"I'm gonna go catch a criminal,\" and after Williams departed she called the police. Williams was walking on a trail nearby when a police S.U.V. swerved into his path. As he tried to hide under a tarp, a police dog named Voodoo sank its teeth into his leg, drawing blood, and an officer punched him in the face before subduing him. Williams was taken to Blount County Detention Facility, in Maryville, Tennessee, and prosecutors brought an additional charge against him for escaping federal custody.\n\nAs news that Williams had been apprehended spread, Dahl's phone started vibrating with texts from friends. She still felt confused about how Williams could have spent years evading arrest. As she said to me, \"How did this go on for so long?\"\n\nAfter Williams was recaptured, I contacted him in jail. \"I'm interested in talking with you,\" he wrote, through the detention facility's messaging system. \"There are some facts about my case that are being kept from public ears.\" In numerous video calls I had with him, Williams looked thin and older than his years, his curly hair graying, but he still had an agitated, even manic affect. He made a surprising claim: that his criminal activity had been made possible because, for years, he had been paying off Johnson City police officers through Alunda Rutherford, an ex-girlfriend who was involved in his businesses. He also accused the officers of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from his safe during their searches after Evans's fall. Many key elements of Williams's story remain impossible to confirm, but subsequent lawsuits and investigations have lent credence to the idea that one of the most prolific and notorious rapists in American history operated unchecked because of police corruption.\n\nThe J.C.P.D. and Rutherford both deny any wrongdoing, and Rutherford has not been charged with a crime. In a statement, a city spokesperson said, \"To claim that the Johnson City Police Department was complicit in any sex-trafficking venture or that its officers benefitted financially from such abhorrent activity is specious.\" Rutherford told me that the allegations about her were \"completely fabricated\" and that there were \"never any payments made.\" She also said that she had had minimal contact with Williams in recent years, and few financial interactions with his company, though these claims were contradicted by multiple people who knew them, as well as by financial records reviewed by The New Yorker . She initially told me she had never had any contact with police, but subsequently claimed that she had been told of Williams's flight by them, and had later contacted them to offer to entrap him.\n\nOne thing that is certain is that Williams dated Rutherford, who is thirty-nine, for the better part of a decade. During that time, he says, he granted her one-per-cent ownership in his construction company. \"She was the smoother-over-a problem solver,\" he told me. \"She'd smooth over I.R.S. problems and insurance audits and things like that.\"\n\nPeople who knew Williams and Rutherford during their relationship claim that both of them were selling cocaine. According to Williams, about eight years ago, as Rutherford was turning in to her driveway, a Johnson City officer pulled up behind her. The officer said that he knew she was carrying drugs and cash. He made her hand over five thousand dollars and the cocaine, and then left. (Williams says that Rutherford told him about the incident at the time, and that he saw security-camera footage of it.) \"No charges, no paperwork,\" Williams said. \"That was the beginning. After that, they knew they had her. They were holding charges over her head. They were extorting her.\" He says that Rutherford, at his direction and using money she was provided by his company, began periodically giving officers large sums of cash, starting at two thousand dollars and eventually climbing to as high as eight thousand dollars-though Williams claims he did not keep close track of the amounts or frequency. He said that he was making five hundred thousand dollars a year and considered it a modest business cost. \"This went on for years,\" he told me. \"It wasn't just once or twice.\"\n\nIn 2021, the police apprehended a ring of more than twenty-one local drug traffickers. According to Williams, Rutherford had been telling him that officers were threatening action against him. Now Rutherford warned him that officers were closing in on him. Allegations of assault against Williams were multiplying. \"She gave me the impression that they had a bunch of dirt on me,\" Williams recalled. \"She indicated that she was holding them at bay for my benefit.\" For a while, he believed the scheme to be successful. \"I felt protected,\" he told me. \"I figured it was because of the payments.\"\n\nWilliams says that he kept five hundred thousand dollars in his home safe, and that Rutherford was aware of this money. Johnson City police \"wanted my safe, because they knew about the cash in it,\" he told me. After Evans's fall, the police took the safe. When they eventually returned it, Williams alleges, only eighty-one thousand dollars remained, and the other four hundred and nineteen thousand dollars had been stolen. He said that the police department's apparent reluctance to pursue a full investigation stemmed from the theft. He also said that police had planted evidence, including the baby-doll sex toy photographed among the safe's contents. (Rutherford said, \"There wasn't cash.\" Other eyewitnesses told me that Williams's safe typically held stacks of hundred-dollar bills-potentially in line with an amount of hundreds of thousands of dollars.) Williams claims that the scheme involved several Johnson City police officers, including Sparks. \"Alunda and Sparks were, like, buddy-buddy,\" he told me. \"They teamed up to extort me.\" But several people close to Williams said that they believed he was trying to deflect focus from his role in any corruption. (Johnson City said in its statement, \"The city did not seize any money from Sean Williams.\")\n\nRutherford denied selling drugs, and told me that she did not believe officers were protecting Williams. \"I don't think that they were being too serious about things,\" she said. \"But, no, I don't believe anyone was paid off.\" She said, of the alleged encounter in her driveway and the ongoing bribery scheme, \"None of that is true.\" She also denied making withdrawals from Williams's company accounts while he was on the run, though numerous bank statements seem to contradict this claim. Rutherford, whose name appeared on the list from Williams's apartment, said that she had been part of his pattern of assault, but she declined to provide details. Williams's allegations about her, she said, were a continuation of his abuse. \"I am a victim of his,\" she said.\n\nA civil lawsuit was initially brought against the police department by a group of nine plaintiffs with accusations about Williams, and it eventually grew into a proposed class-action suit encompassing all of his accusers. The suit, which raised similar claims about police corruption, and forced Johnson City officers to produce private financial records, contended that the records show Jenkins and Sparks had access to funds that didn't accord with their incomes. The picture they present is not conclusive, however. Between 2018 and 2022-a period in which Rutherford was seemingly making regular withdrawals-the two officers' bank accounts show a pattern of cash deposits; in Jenkins's case, they were generally in increments of between a thousand and five thousand dollars. During that time, he paid off a portfolio of auto, construction, and home loans totalling more than four hundred thousand dollars, significantly more than his total police-department income. In a filing submitted as part of the lawsuit, though, Jenkins's attorney said that the deposits and loans highlighted in the suit came from vehicle trade-ins, refinancing, the sale of vehicles and property, and other innocuous sources, and provided a detailed accounting.\n\nThe suit also alleged that, early last year, a necklace that Williams claims was stolen from his safe was consigned by Rutherford, in what it described as a form of payment by Sparks to insure her silence as investigations mounted. Rutherford said that Williams gave her the necklace. In an early filing in the case, Sparks broadly denied any allegations.\n\nWhen Williams fled Johnson City, in 2022, he took seven boxes of financial records with him. He hoped that they might serve as an insurance policy, should he ever need to prove that the police were being paid off. He later gave the records to a friend, Shelby Moody, asking her to keep them safe. Moody, who was set up on a blind date with Williams in 2018, told me that they never became romantically involved but that she came to consider him a close friend.\n\nSoon after she accepted the files, Moody was contacted by officials at the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. She defended Williams against allegations of rape, she said, explaining that \"there were definitely girls that went up there to get fucked up, and, you know, shit happens when you're fucked up.\" They interrupted her. \"They were, like, 'Well, do you wanna see your pictures?' \" she told me. The investigators then showed her photos and videos of Williams raping her while she was incapacitated. She had no memory of the incident. In one file, she said, \"he was holding my eyes open, like I'm a dead body.\" Williams had arranged the files on his hard drives systematically, with folders named for individual women, often bearing head shots that he had taken from their social-media accounts. \"This was somebody I considered my friend,\" Moody said. \"And I was somebody he raped and then pretended like it didn't happen.\"\n\nMoody ultimately turned over the boxes of financial records to state authorities, but she now regrets her decision, because she believes that there has been little effort to pursue the corruption allegations. She was one of several people close to Williams who recalled seeing officers visit him without any official or social explanation. \"Sean is telling the truth about the police-accountability part, and how there is multilevel corruption,\" she told me. \"The police absolutely did allow him to continue what he was doing.\" She was one of several people who said that they had witnessed a rapport between Williams and Johnson City officers, which they believe may suggest that he was giving information to the police about drug activity.\n\nIn the nineteen-twenties, the era of Prohibition, locals started to refer to Johnson City as Little Chicago, owing to a thriving criminal underworld in the city and in a surrounding swath of Appalachia. Moody was one of numerous residents who said that they believed the Williams case was part of a wider phenomenon in which the police in the region turn a blind eye to, and at times protect, drug and human trafficking. \"This is like a spider web,\" she told me. The area is connected to multiple major highways, making for easy transportation, and its rugged, mountainous terrain has historically made law enforcement challenging and allowed criminal groups to flourish. In 1969, in nearby Cocke County, a series of news reports prompted the arrest of numerous law-enforcement officials on charges including extortion and bribery. Further probes in the following decades uncovered the involvement of law-enforcement officers in drug-related crimes, including cocaine distribution and smuggling drug money.\n\nAfter Kat Dahl was fired, the Johnson City police officers David Hilton and Jeff Legault were both promoted from sergeant to lieutenant. Keith Sexton, who served the search warrant after Evans's fall, is now the county sheriff. Captain Kevin Peters and Police Chief Karl Turner have both retired. Toma Sparks and Justin Jenkins are still employed by the Johnson City Police Department.\n\nIn June, 2022, while Williams was on the run, Dahl sued Turner and the Johnson City Police Department for retaliation and wrongful termination, alleging that she was punished because she reported their handling of sexual-assault cases and raised allegations of corruption, including to the F.B.I. Although friends and family had urged her to move on rather than endure a bruising legal battle, she told me she wanted to hold accountable a police department that she believed was endangering the community. \"To go through the rest of my life and be questioning, Well, should I have done something? Are more people being hurt because I didn't say something? I couldn't live with that,\" she told me. Though a trial date has not been set, the suit has already had significant repercussions. Soon after it was filed, Johnson City hired a law firm to investigate the police department's approach to sexual crimes. The resulting report identified systematic deficiencies, including \"practices that discourage female victims of sexual assault from collaborating with law enforcement,\" such as conducting interviews in a manner \"more appropriate for an interrogation of a suspect.\" Of a hundred and five recent reports of rape with an identified suspect, police had interviewed the suspect in only thirty-six cases. The department commonly closed sexual-violence cases quickly, sometimes because a victim expressed reservations about pressing charges; officers often cited uncoöperative victims as a reason for closing cases, even when they had in fact been unable to make contact with the victims.\n\nThe report raised other questions about Johnson City officers' handling of cases involving Williams. It made pointed reference to \"police corruption\" allegations, though the subject was beyond its formal purview. The report stated that \"the Department should have moved forward with an internal investigation to address the misconduct allegations.\"\n\nIn June, 2023, the group of Williams's accusers, inspired by Dahl's case, filed its federal suit. Among the accusers, who were labelled Jane Does in legal filings but who gave me permission to use their names, were Pack, Murray, and Laura Trent's parents. The suit says that Johnson City officers, including Sparks, took money from Rutherford and from the safe, \"with either the implied or explicit understanding that, in exchange, they would shield Williams.\" It argues that Williams-who had allegedly given money, drugs, and housing to Diaz and Rutherford, in exchange for their recruitment of women he raped-had been involved in sex trafficking, and that his payments to officers made them parties to a trafficking conspiracy. (Rutherford told me that she had not helped Williams recruit other women.)\n\nLast month, Johnson City agreed to a twenty-eight-million-dollar settlement with victims of sexual violence, an enormous sum for a small city. \"The amount will likely prompt skepticism about their denials,\" Kelly Puente, who has written about the case for the Tennessean , told me. A lawyer connected to the case told me that the sum \"is far more than the cost of defense-perhaps this victims' settlement will finally get the agencies' attention.\" The confidential settlement, a version of which was obtained by The New Yorker , includes strict provisions that the victim should \"not discuss this settlement or disparage the JCPD, its officers, or any investigation of her sexual assault.\" A statement from the plaintiffs' lawyers, released at the city's behest, cited a \"substantial risk of not meeting the applicable burdens of proof\" in their decision to dismiss their claims and settle. In response to questions about the allegations, a city spokesperson referred to the statement. People involved in the case told me they stood by its strength and feared that the city had paid its way out of accountability. One plaintiff told me, \"Unanswered questions remain, and the circumstances uncovered during discovery deserve to be acknowledged rather than buried.\"\n\nIf a deeper investigation is ever undertaken, Williams said, \"there's a big, wide trail of money that's gonna be easy to find.\" But federal and state officials have mostly refused to say whether the corruption allegations are still being pursued. The F.B.I. and the T.B.I. initiated investigations, but an official involved in the Williams case told me that he was aware of no ongoing inquiries by either agency. Dahl believes that a culture of mutual protection and deference among law-enforcement agencies may have contributed to the apparently limited efforts. \"The fact that the Johnson City community is no closer to transparency about what happened and who enabled Williams to operate as long as he did is a disgrace,\" she said. Vanessa Baehr-Jones, an attorney for Williams's accusers, told me that the F.B.I. interviews with officers accused of corruption were \"in some cases only three minutes long, and consisted of the F.B.I. and T.B.I. agents asking the officers whether or not they stole money. When the answer was no, they closed up the file and went on home. None of the officers were confronted with evidence, which suggests that the F.B.I. never bothered to subpoena important documents like bank records.\" A T.B.I. spokesperson said, \"As with every case, T.B.I. agents investigated this one fully and to the best of our ability.\" The F.B.I. declined to comment. The Department of Justice's Public Integrity Section, the office responsible for investigating police-corruption allegations like the ones in the Williams case, is being reduced by the Trump Administration to just a handful of employees.\n\nOn the morning of February 24th, Williams walked into a hearing room in a courthouse in Greeneville, Tennessee, with his hands cuffed and chained at his waist, to be sentenced for production of child pornography and for his escape. He wore a baggy brown T-shirt, and had a beard and wild hair. As he was transferred to court that morning, U.S. marshals had discovered him hiding razor blades in his shoe. A jury had found him guilty of escaping from the van, a conviction with a potential five-year sentence. In that case, after volatile relationships with four different attorneys, he had defended himself. At the sentencing, he was represented by his fifth lawyer, a court-appointed attorney named Mark Brown.\n\nDahl's warnings that Williams might be a pedophile had proved prescient. Two weeks after she brought the sex doll to Turner's attention, Williams had victimized a boy of less than a year old. At the hearing, Meghan Gomez, a prosecutor, described reams of evidence gathered from Williams's devices that showed he had assaulted mothers and gained access to their children, whom he then recorded in pornographic photos and videos. Among the victims were the infant boy, a four-year-old, and a seven-year-old girl. In court, the mother of the infant boy, Alexa Anderson, sat a few feet from Williams and quietly wept through the proceedings. \"I just needed to see him walk out of the room for the last time, and know he wouldn't come back,\" she told me. In 2020, Anderson, at the time a twenty-one-year-old new mother working at a restaurant and financially struggling, met Williams through a friend who knew Diaz. Williams struck her as charismatic and flashy, and at one point she saw the stacks of hundred-dollar bills that filled his safe. He told her that, because of his connections with law enforcement, \"the police aren't going to come up here.\" He offered her a job as his housekeeper, but within weeks he told her she was \"too pretty to clean,\" and asked her to be his informal personal assistant. She rebuffed frequent sexual advances. A few months after she started working for him, she looked at his phone and saw sexual images of children. She threw the phone down and fled, returning only to collect her belongings.\n\nIn July, 2022, during Williams's initial time on the run, Anderson told the Johnson City police about the images of children. She said that the detective she spoke to, Brady Higgins, adopted an accusing tone, asking about her history of substance abuse \"like he was speaking to a criminal, not a victim.\" (Higgins disputes using an accusatory tone.) In his report, Higgins did not make clear that the images of children were pornographic. Last year, federal and state officials showed Anderson images of Williams assaulting her, along with sexually explicit photographs of her then nine-month-old son. \"He was a baby,\" she told me. \"It's devastating. It's enough to kill somebody.\" (Williams said that the relationship with Anderson was consensual and denied the allegations about her son. \"I'm not into boys,\" he said.) Anderson, who was among the plaintiffs in the civil suit, was one of several women who told me they felt that police made an effort to intimidate them during proceedings. When Higgins was deposed, she said, a group of police officers lined up opposite her. \"He had all of his police friends on the back wall of the room,\" she said. \"They didn't break eye contact with me the whole time.\"\n\nJ. Ronnie Greer, the judge in the child-pornography case, called Williams a \"psychopath\" and a \"dangerous predator.\" Williams seemed to thumb his nose at the proceedings. He laughed, shook his head, and snorted derisively. When Greer said, of Williams's crimes, that \"with the exception possibly of a serial killer, these offenses are among the most serious offenses that can be committed,\" Williams blurted out that it was \"shocking\" that \"taking a picture of a young girl would be compared to murder.\" Greer alluded to Williams's history of abuse during his childhood. \"What abuse?\" Williams interjected, though his own attorney, seeking leniency, had cited research indicating that victims of abuse are predisposed to become abusers themselves. In our interviews, Williams at times seemed to have a distorted understanding of what constitutes abuse. \"I was fucking my foster mom. I woke up with this guy, a babysitter, touching me. That's not a big deal. Who gives a shit?\" he said. \"Maybe I'm just a monster.\" Greer sentenced Williams to ninety-five years in prison, the maximum allowable sentence. The judge appeared to refer to the unresolved questions of police corruption, saying, \"I do not know with any certainty how Mr. Williams was able, for nearly two decades, maybe more than that, to engage in the conduct he has engaged in without detection, without prosecution, but that's an issue for a different forum, a different day.\"\n\nWilliams has appealed, and has pleaded not guilty to the additional charges he faces related to child pornography and drugs. Steve Finney, a Tennessee district attorney, said that he plans to bring more charges related to Williams's alleged assaults. A further civil suit has been filed by Evans against Johnson City police. \"They cared more about money than the people they were supposed to serve and protect,\" she told me on her way out of the sentencing hearing. Williams claims that he fears for his safety, because he represents a loose end in the corruption case. \"I've been a liability ever since MiKayla's fall,\" he told me. \"It's starting to look like a possible Epstein ending.\"\n\nDahl was also at the sentencing, wearing a neat black suit that she'd purchased at Macy's. After her firing, she told me, she spent time \"grieving over the job that I thought would have maybe been my dream job.\" In early 2022, amid mounting financial strain, she had moved in with her parents in Alabama. Later, she moved to Atlanta, for better career prospects. She felt \"hollow\" after seeing Williams's sentencing, she said, despite her indispensable role in the case. \"I'm not done, and this story's not done,\" she added. \"Way back in 2021, I told some of the victims I was going to try and find them answers and find them accountability for what happened. I still intend to keep that promise.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Adventures of a Ukrainian Intelligence Officer\n\nOn September 26, 2022, seismic-monitoring stations in northern Europe picked up signals that resembled small earthquakes-rumblings below the surface of the Baltic Sea detected as far as a thousand miles away. Soon after, operators in charge of the Nord Stream pipelines, two seven-hundred-mile-long underwater conduits meant to bring Russian natural gas to Germany and onward to the rest of Europe, noticed a sudden drop in pressure. The Danish Air Force dispatched an F-16 interceptor, which captured images of what was unmistakably a huge gas leak: escaping methane had turned the water's surface into a bubbling froth.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, underwater drones captured images of wide gashes in the pipelines. Swedish authorities found blast residue at the scene, and called the rupture an act of \"gross sabotage.\" In Germany, which had imported more than half of its natural gas from Russia, investigators declared that the explosions represented \"an attack on the internal security of the state.\"\n\nNord Stream was destroyed less than a year into Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It seemed likely that the two events were linked, but it was not immediately apparent how. Speculation initially centered on Russia, which had experience with undersea operations. Weeks earlier, Gazprom, the state-owned Russian energy company, had shut down Nord Stream 1, claiming that Western sanctions had undermined its ability to maintain the pipeline. (Nord Stream 2, which was completed in 2021, had not yet become operational.) Officials in the U.S. and Europe had accused the Kremlin of using energy exports as an economic weapon, and Russian Navy vessels were spotted in nearby waters in the days before the attack. But Western intelligence agencies couldn't find any other evidence that the Kremlin was responsible. The Kremlin, for its part, blamed the United Kingdom and the United States. \"The sanctions were not enough for the Anglo-Saxons,\" President Vladimir Putin said. \"They moved on to sabotage.\"\n\nIn January, 2023, four months after the attack, German police showed up at the offices of a boat-chartering company in Dranske, on the German island of Rügen, in the Baltic Sea. They had a warrant to search the Andromeda, a fifty-foot sailing yacht described by Der Spiegel as \"not exactly elegant, but practical, a bit like a floating station wagon.\" The boat had been rented the previous fall by six people using forged passports, booked via a Polish travel agency with Ukrainian owners, and paid for by a Ukrainian businessman. Investigators suspected that a photograph in one of the passports, which ostensibly belonged to a Romanian citizen named Ştefan Marcu, was that of an active-duty Ukrainian soldier. On board the Andromeda, they found traces of HMX, a powerful explosive whose blast signature was consistent with the damage at the site.\n\nThat March, the Times reported that U.S. intelligence agencies had reviewed evidence indicating that \"a pro-Ukrainian group carried out the attack,\" while allowing for the possibility that \"the operation might have been conducted off the books by a proxy force with connections to the Ukrainian government.\"\n\nThe news came as a surprise. Many experts believed that whoever planted the explosives would have needed access to a mini-submarine or a decompression chamber-neither of which a proxy force, even one backed by Ukraine, was likely to possess. Another reason that Ukraine had been ruled out as a possible perpetrator was the unbelievable political risk: a country defending itself from invasion and desperately reliant on foreign military aid could hardly afford to blow up the energy infrastructure of one of its primary Western backers. Still, even as mounting intelligence pointed to Ukraine, it remained unclear who, exactly, had ordered or carried out the attack. \"A real brain-twister,\" a high-ranking German official said.\n\nIn November, 2023, a suspect emerged. A joint investigation by Der Spiegel and the Washington Post , citing sources in both \"Ukrainian and international security circles,\" identified Roman Chervinsky, a former Ukrainian intelligence officer, as the operation's alleged lead organizer. By then, Chervinsky, who had spent two decades directing secret operations for Ukraine's intelligence services, including assassinations and multiple acts of sabotage, was under house arrest in a suburb of Kyiv. He had been charged in two separate criminal investigations, for extortion and abuse of authority, both of which he denies. Neither case, at least formally, had anything to do with Nord Stream. When I visited him recently, at his apartment, he was unequivocal about his involvement in the Nord Stream attack. \"I didn't do it,\" he told me.\n\nChervinsky, who is fifty, with a slight frame and a head of thinning hair, wore a loose-fitting polo. An electronic monitor was affixed to his ankle. He made a pot of tea, and we sat at his kitchen table. \"You look at him and see this absolutely ordinary person you could imagine standing next to on the bus that morning,\" one person who has collaborated with him told me. \"Then you come to understand who he is and what he's capable of.\"\n\nRecently, the Trump Administration has begun negotiating with the Kremlin to end the war in Ukraine. Those talks have excluded Ukraine itself, prompting President Volodymyr Zelensky to warn against dealmaking \"behind the backs of the key subjects.\" The conditions that the Trump Administration envisions, which have been spelled out by top U.S. officials, have caused alarm in Ukraine and Europe: no relinquishment of all territory taken by Russia since 2014; no NATO membership for Ukraine; no U.S. peacekeepers to enforce a ceasefire. Instead, the emphasis has been on big-ticket deals, such as a proposal to grant the U.S. a fifty-per-cent stake in Ukraine's rare-earth minerals. (Zelensky turned down the deal.) After Zelensky suggested that President Trump was repeating Russian misinformation, Trump lashed out, calling Zelensky a \"dictator\" who wants the war to continue to keep the \" 'gravy train' going.\"\n\nChervinsky represents a less visible but no less decisive aspect of the conflict, in which a nation facing a superior enemy fought back from the shadows. \"If there is a ceasefire, this part of the war will only intensify,\" Roman Kostenko, a special-forces colonel who now serves in the Ukrainian parliament, told me. Chervinsky, for his part, wanted to correct the record, both about his past exploits and about what they've achieved for his country. \"I'm ready to speak about these things, even if it goes against the usual rules of intelligence work,\" he said. \"Ukraine is a full-fledged state-not some province of Russia-with the right to defend itself and to set its own course.\"\n\nChervinsky grew up in Kamyanets-Podilskyi, a medieval city in western Ukraine, where his father was a construction foreman and his mother worked at a grocery store. As a teen-ager, he competed in soccer and target shooting. He briefly considered enrolling in an I.T. program at a local technical college, but everyone there seemed to just sit around and smoke cigarettes. He was sixteen when Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union, in 1991. Not long after, recruiters from the S.B.U., the Ukrainian offshoot of the K.G.B., visited his school, and spoke of a new academy in Kyiv-the first in the country to train its own intelligence officers. Chervinsky's father, who had dark memories of the K.G.B., urged him not to apply. \"You should know this system will, sooner or later, make you fire on your own,\" he said. Chervinsky was accepted as a cadet on his second attempt.\n\nAs a junior officer, he was sent to Kamyanets-Podilskyi, his home town, where he unravelled a kickback scheme between the agriculture ministry and the chair of the village council. He spent the next decade in Kyiv and the surrounding region, launching stings to catch drug traffickers, criminal gangs, and corrupt politicians. In the northeastern city of Poltava, he planted listening devices in a banya and recorded a gang of police officers discussing under-the-table agreements with local mafiosi. \"People didn't always love Roman,\" a law-enforcement officer who regularly collaborated with Chervinsky told me. \"Not just because he had no tolerance for corruption but because he could be so set in his principles.\"\n\nAt the time, the S.B.U. resembled many other bloated Soviet-legacy bureaucracies. Corrupt dealings with local officials and organized crime were common. The agency was also thoroughly compromised by Russian intelligence. An assessment from the C.I.A. at the time concluded that in some regional bureaus, such as Kharkiv, in the northeast, as many as sixty per cent of the officers were either working directly for Moscow or otherwise carrying out its interests. Valerii Kondratiuk, who held top positions in several Ukrainian intelligence agencies, told me that many of the S.B.U.'s leadership appointments were made in consultation with the F.S.B., Russia's security service.\n\nLink copied\n\nIn December, 2014, Chervinsky was sent to the Donbas, where Ukraine was fighting Russian-backed militias in what the country then called an \"antiterrorist operation.\" Since the incursion, many of the S.B.U. officers who had been stationed in occupied territories had switched sides. Officers who had evacuated to areas controlled by Kyiv often didn't want to take part in operations against their former colleagues. But the front line was porous, with locals travelling back and forth to visit relatives, obtain medical care, and collect pensions. Chervinsky and his colleagues exploited the flow of people to recruit agents. \"Everyone has a certain hierarchy of values,\" he told me. \"For some, it might be as simple as money. Others want drugs and nothing else. And there are those who think in terms of justice and honesty. You can make your approach from any of those angles.\"\n\nThat year's Maidan Revolution, in Kyiv, followed by Russia's annexation of Crimea and its proxy war in the Donbas, had reoriented Ukraine's politics. The country was turning to the West for support-and, for the intelligence services, that meant the C.I.A. \"We provided information on Russia,\" Kondratiuk told me. \"When they realized it was often of better quality than what they were getting from their own officers and agents in Moscow, their interest in helping us spiked.\" A former U.S. intelligence officer estimated that the new partnership effectively doubled the amount of information that the U.S. was able to collect on Russia. In one case, the S.B.U. passed along the source code used in a Russian hacking attack, allowing U.S. agencies to build their own defenses. \"That's tens of millions of dollars in value right there,\" the former U.S. intelligence officer said.\n\nIn early 2015, the C.I.A. agreed to help fund a new spy outfit within the S.B.U. called the Fifth Directorate. \"The idea was to blend counterintelligence with special operations,\" a U.S. official said. The C.I.A. provided tactical gear and communications equipment, and ran training courses for the department's officers, most of whom had come of age after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The head of the Fifth Directorate reported to the deputy director of S.B.U., bypassing the usual layers of bureaucracy. \"If, before, the service was hostage to statistics and plans set from above,\" one Fifth Directorate officer said, \"now we were freed of all that, with full creative license.\"\n\nChervinsky joined the department shortly after its founding, and helped its officers build a network of informants and conduct surveillance of militia forces. A microphone hidden inside an extension cord in the office of the prosecutor for the so-called Donetsk People's Republic allowed the department to listen to interrogations of Ukrainian P.O.W.s. A female officer in a pro-Russian militia was duped into placing a bugged table lamp in the headquarters of a tank battalion. Another agent whom Chervinsky had recruited from that battalion hid improvised explosives, provided by the S.B.U., under the tracks of eight tanks parked on a training ground. After the tanks were destroyed, Chervinsky listened to the stunned reactions of commanders inside the headquarters.\n\nThe Fifth Directorate was also involved in assassinations of pro-Russian field commanders. There was no legal framework for targeted killings on internationally recognized Ukrainian territory. S.B.U. officers concluded that, because Ukraine was at war with terrorists backed by Russia, the usual rules didn't apply. \"When a state is at peace, it has one way of dealing with its enemies,\" Chervinsky said. \"But during wartime, when your territory is occupied, you have to be more forceful.\"\n\nU.S. policy prohibited C.I.A. officers from having any involvement in such operations. \"Officially, the Americans were opposed,\" Kondratiuk said. But behind the scenes, he went on, C.I.A. officers often expressed their appreciation: \"They would shake our hands and say, 'Good work.' \"\n\nOn December 12, 2015, Pavel Dremov, a thirty-nine-year-old bricklayer who became the commander of a self-proclaimed Cossack battalion in occupied Ukrainian territory, set off for the town of Pervomaisk in a Range Rover. He had got married a week earlier, and was still celebrating in his home town of Stakhanov, less than ten miles away, when he got a call to attend to some urgent business. On an empty stretch of road, Dremov's car exploded, killing him and his driver. Dremov had promoted the establishment of a Cossack-run republic within the Russian-occupied territories. It was widely assumed that he was offed by rivals within his own ranks, perhaps on the orders of Moscow, which had little tolerance for outspoken rebel leaders.\n\nIn reality, the blast had been orchestrated by the S.B.U. Some months earlier, a source on the ground, a local businessman in the Donbas, had told the Fifth Directorate about Dremov's interest in cars, especially Range Rovers. The department imported one from Europe, and, once it was in the separatist territories, agents placed hidden explosives inside the doorframe. The businessman brought it to the headquarters of Dremov's battalion in Stakhanov, where, as Chervinsky and his fellow-operatives had hoped, he asked to take it for a drive. The businessman handed him the keys. The next day, the S.B.U., which was remotely following the Range Rover's movements, triggered the explosion. A Fifth Directorate officer, who in the wake of such killings was responsible for writing false statements that blamed the pro-Russian factions, told me that, in this case, \"we didn't need any P.R.\"\n\nChervinsky's next target was Arsen Pavlov, a former car-wash employee who went by the nom de guerre Motorola. At the start of the war, Pavlov led a group of pro-Russian militants, whom he called the Sparta Battalion, in a siege of the Donetsk airport. He was later implicated in the torture and execution of Ukrainian P.O.W.s, including a captured machine gunner he shot twice in the head. \"I don't give a fuck,\" he told a reporter from the Kyiv Post . \"I kill if I want to. I don't if I don't.\"\n\nChervinsky oversaw a handful of failed attempts to assassinate Pavlov. The Fifth Directorate prepared a crate of poisoned vodka, which a middleman was supposed to give to Pavlov and his soldiers. But when the middleman couldn't find money that the S.B.U. had buried for him at a drop point, he called the soldiers and told them not to drink it. (\"That was stupid,\" Chervinsky said. \"They detained him and threw him in prison.\") Another time, a local agent hid an antipersonnel mine near the exit of a hospital where Pavlov regularly received treatment for an eye injury. The mine detonated, but the shrapnel missed Pavlov's car-a good thing, in the end, Chervinsky said, because Pavlov's wife was in the passenger seat. They were both unscathed.\n\nChervinsky had another idea. He had enlisted an agent to wear a pizza-delivery uniform and to sneak into Pavlov's building. The agent reported that Pavlov was usually accompanied by a security guard who stood watch outside Pavlov's apartment, which was on the seventh floor. But there was one place where the pair were confined and usually alone: the elevator. Chervinsky sent two other agents-a Donetsk local and a former special-forces soldier-to Chernobyl, where, in an abandoned apartment building, they practiced the basics of the operation: prying open the doors to the elevator shaft, jumping down to the compartment's roof, placing an explosive packet on top and a surveillance microphone in the ventilation slats, and making a quick exit. The whole sequence took about a minute. \"They were motivated,\" Chervinsky said. \"They knew what they were doing and why.\"\n\nBack in Donetsk, the pair took up a position down the street from Pavlov's entryway. When one of Pavlov's guards came outside for a smoke break, the local agent-\"He looked like the most peaceful guy, you'd never suspect him of anything,\" Chervinsky said-caught the door before it closed. He and his partner got into the elevator shaft and out of the building without being noticed. A week later, Pavlov arrived at his building and walked inside. The agent from Donetsk called Pavlov's cell phone and heard, via the hidden microphone, that it was ringing inside the elevator. Pavlov picked up. \"Is this Arsen Pavlov?\" the agent asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Pavlov replied.\n\n\"This is the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper-we'd like to interview you.\" The agent pressed a button, detonating the explosives. S.B.U. officers in Kyiv had tapped Pavlov's wife's phone, and listened in as she frantically called her husband, who didn't pick up.\n\nAfterward, some C.I.A. officers received a commemorative patch that read, simply, \"Elevator.\" But, even in private, Chervinsky never acknowledged his role in Pavlov's killing. \"Oftentimes, inside secret services, people are eager to claim credit,\" a former U.S. intelligence officer said. \"They want influence, attention, promotions-it's politics, basically.\" But Chervinsky, the former officer went on, \"didn't seem to care about any of that. If we heard about any of these operations, it certainly wasn't from him.\"\n\nChervinsky had learned that every target has a vice that lowers their defenses, even for a moment. For Mikhail Tolstykh, the commander of the pro-Russian Somali Battalion-so named for the ragtag appearance of its fighters-that vulnerability was women. Tolstykh regularly invited prostitutes to his headquarters in Donetsk, where he also kept a bedroom.\n\nThe S.B.U. maintained contact with several sex workers whom it used in its operations. Chervinsky dispatched one of them from Kyiv-I'll call her Katerina-to occupied Donetsk in early 2017. A local taxi-driver typically brought women to Tolstykh's place. The S.B.U. learned that the driver frequently used amphetamines; not coincidentally, so did Katerina. In Donetsk, she caught a series of rides with the taxi-driver, during which she unspooled her cover story: she was a university student whose parents had recently died, and she needed money, both for her studies and for a persistent drug habit. The driver made a proposal: he had a client who would pay well-was she interested? He brought her to Tolstykh's headquarters, where she spent the night. A week later, Tolstykh called Katerina and asked her to return.\n\nBefore their third meeting, S.B.U. agents passed her a package, which contained a cell phone and eight hundred grams of explosives wrapped in plastic. Early the next morning, when Tolstykh got out of bed, Katerina taped the case under the bed frame. Chervinsky was waiting for her at a makeshift operational base in Ukrainian-held territory. The next day, they drove to a spot near the front line, in range of Russian cell-phone towers, to conceal their location. The S.B.U. had tapped Tolstykh's bedroom; Chervinsky and Katerina listened for the sound of him turning over in bed. Chervinsky pressed a button. \"That's it?\" Katerina asked. \"So quiet.\"\n\nThat spring, Chervinsky was named the head of the Fifth Directorate. He had earned a reputation as an ambitious, even aggressive, operational chief. The S.B.U., meanwhile, was suffering its own losses. In the first half of 2017, a series of car bombs killed several Ukrainian intelligence officers, including one of Chervinsky's friends in the service. He assumed that the assassinations were the work of the F.S.B., in Moscow, which enlisted agents in the Donbas. \"Inside the occupied territories, we felt like we had a good sense of who they are and where to find them,\" Chervinsky said of Russian intelligence officers. \"But, as we should have known, they were watching us, too.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2018, Chervinsky received a list of people wanted in connection with the attack on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which had been shot out of the sky over the Donbas four years earlier, as it flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, killing all two hundred and ninety-eight people on board. A Dutch-led investigation determined that Russian-supplied rebel forces fired on the plane, with a Buk anti-aircraft missile system. Ukrainian investigators had been collaborating with the Dutch on a multiyear effort to locate and detain those responsible. To Chervinsky, one name looked especially promising: Vladimir Tsemakh, a Donbas native in his mid-fifties who had served as the head of air defense for Snizhne, a town near where the plane was shot down.\n\nLink copied\n\nAround that time, a man in a pro-Russian battalion in the Donbas, whom I'll call Stepan, got in touch with the S.B.U. Stepan had initially fled Ukrainian-held territory after getting into a hit-and-run accident. He then fought as a foot soldier in a pro-Russian militia but had begun to suspect that he was being prepared for a kamikaze mission. He decided to defect again, this time to the Ukrainian side. Chervinsky told him, \"We can guarantee your safety, but we have a job for you.\"\n\nThe following June, Stepan pulled up to Tsemakh's apartment building in Snizhne. By then, Tsemakh had left the ranks of rebel fighters and was, in the words of Chervinsky, \"an ordinary-looking older retiree.\" The S.B.U. had placed a transponder under his car and knew his schedule: every morning, he drove his wife to work at a local technical college, then returned home. Stepan was waiting for him, and forced his way into Tsemakh's apartment. \"Some people in Donetsk want to speak with you,\" he told him. When Tsemakh refused to leave, Stepan pistol-whipped him and stuck a syringe filled with a tranquillizer into Tsemakh's leg. \"Let's go,\" Stepan said, holding up Tsemakh, who fell into a groggy, weak-kneed trance.\n\nThe S.B.U. had procured a getaway car for Stepan, a clunky old Lada, with a folding wheelchair stored in the trunk. Fake medical records showed that Stepan's passenger suffered from a terminal illness. When they reached the rebel-controlled checkpoint, Stepan told the guards that Tsemakh had grown up in Marinka, a town on the front line, and wanted to see his childhood home one last time. The soldiers waved them through.\n\nFour Ukrainian special-forces operatives were waiting for them on the other side of a pedestrian bridge on the outskirts of Marinka. The bridge was crumbling and pockmarked by explosions, too difficult for a wheelchair to navigate. Stepan decided to walk Tsemakh down to a dry riverbank below. The lead Ukrainian operative on the other side, a recon officer, began to approach them, triggering a mine. The explosion blew dirt and smoke into the air and flipped him on his back. Lying on the ground, he triggered another. The second blast sent shrapnel up through a gap in his helmet, into his brain. Another special-forces soldier ran to his partner, detonating a third mine. Stepan turned back and dragged Tsemakh several hundred feet across the bridge. Within days, the lead officer was dead; doctors amputated the leg of the other soldier.\n\nThe remaining operatives took Tsemakh to Kyiv. That afternoon, Chervinsky was at the grave site of his friend who was killed in one of the car bombings two years earlier. He got a call from a subordinate at the Fifth Directorate. \"We have him,\" the voice on the line said.\n\nUkrainian prosecutors charged Tsemakh with terrorism for his role as a field commander in the pro-Russian militia. Dutch investigators were eager to question him about the Malaysia Airlines attack. \"A risky, bold action,\" a member of the Dutch-led investigative team told me of Tsemakh's arrest. \"The sort of thing we could never have done ourselves.\"\n\nAt the time, the Ukrainian and Russian governments were discussing a large-scale prisoner swap. Zelensky had been inaugurated as the President of Ukraine a month earlier, and one of his central campaign promises had been to find an end to the conflict. On September 7th, Tsemakh was among the prisoners included in the trade, a condition that Ivan Bakanov, S.B.U.'s director at the time, said had been set by Putin himself. Zelensky called the exchange \"the first step to end the war.\" The Dutch were disappointed. \"People were irritated, even astonished,\" the team member said. (Tsemakh has denied any involvement in the Malaysia Airlines attack.) Chervinsky thought that the Zelensky administration was overly credulous in its dealings with Russia. \"All this effort to locate and apprehend this one person,\" he said. \"And just like that we let him go.\"\n\nBy then, Chervinsky was watching from the sidelines: shortly after Tsemakh's detention, he was dismissed as the head of the Fifth Directorate and relieved of his duties by the S.B.U. Chervinsky said that he never received an official explanation for his dismissal, but Kondratiuk, the former spy chief, told me, \"His competencies suddenly felt out of vogue.\" The war in the Donbas had shifted to a less active phase; for better or for worse, the time of blowing people up in elevators seemed to have passed. \"These people are adventurists by nature,\" Kostenko, the special-forces officer in parliament, said. \"They get bored and frustrated by routine. They want more lively work.\"\n\nVasyl Burba, a former director of HUR , Ukraine's military intelligence agency, is a barrel-chested career officer who, like Chervinsky, started out in the S.B.U. and ran operations in the Donbas. In late 2019, he offered Chervinsky a job overseeing a unit that blended human intelligence with covert operations. \"They say that, for an assassin, his weapon should be an extension of his hand,\" a former HUR officer said. \"For Roman, that meant something else-his mind, and how he used it to recruit people, to bring them over to his side. These agents became an extension of him.\"\n\nChervinsky's new unit had launched an operation to gather intelligence on Russian mercenaries who had taken part in the Donbas war. A source in the Russian security services-\"He loved money,\" the former HUR officer said-had helped the team repurpose a defunct Russian private military company to recruit fighters. Applications poured in, including one from a militia commander named Artyom Milyaev, whose nom de guerre was Shaman.\n\nMilyaev soon got a call from a Syrian phone number. The man on the other end introduced himself as Sergei Petrovich, a \"curator\" from the Russian security services. He asked Milyaev if he could recruit fighters for a deployment to Syria, where, since 2015, Russia had been deploying mercenaries, mostly from Wagner, the private military company, in support of President Bashar al-Assad. \"We have a lot of tasks,\" Sergei Petrovich said. \"We need people who are ready to go.\" Milyaev soon gathered a group of nearly two hundred Russian mercenaries willing to join the mission.\n\nSergei Petrovich told Milyaev to send detailed résumés of his team members, with documentation showing their deployments to war zones, including Ukraine. Some mentioned Russian medals that they'd received for participating in the annexation of Crimea or the Battle of Debaltseve, a bloody fight in the winter of 2015. A handful boasted of guarding a Buk anti-aircraft missile system in the Donbas around the time that Flight 17 was shot down. \"We asked them, 'Do you have combat experience?' And they replied, 'You bet I do!' \" Chervinsky said. \"They were building the case file against themselves.\"\n\nWhat began as an intelligence-gathering operation grew into a plan, code-named Project Avenue, to interdict and arrest the fighters and charge them in Ukraine. Chervinsky brought the list of mercenaries to his contacts at the S.B.U. \"You can't just arrest someone and put them in jail for being a Wagner fighter,\" he said. \"There has to be particular criminal conduct, and some evidence proving it.\" Eventually, the list was whittled down to twenty-eight persons of interest-fighters who had taken part in pivotal episodes, such as an attack on a Ukrainian military helicopter, which killed a general, and the downing of a Ukrainian plane carrying forty paratroopers. But there was a problem: Russian mercenaries were flown directly to Syria on Russian military aircraft. The fictitious Syria mission would have to be, as Chervinsky put it, \"zeroed out.\"\n\nIn June, 2020, Milyaev received an e-mail with some tragic news: Sergei Petrovich had been killed in Syria. Soon after, a man who introduced himself as Artur Pavlovich called from a Venezuelan number to say that he had taken over the project. \"Don't worry,\" he told Milyaev. \"You and your men won't be left without work.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nArtur Pavlovich proposed a new mission. Milyaev and his men were needed to guard drilling sites in Venezuela for Rosneft, the Russian state oil company. It was a believable cover story. As Oleksandr Zholobetskyi, a former HUR officer who was among the leaders of the operation, told me, \"Is Rosneft a genuine, well-known company? Do they have documented interests abroad, and in Venezuela, in particular? And do they have the budget to pay for security contractors? Yes, yes, and yes.\"\n\nThe plan was to put the group of mercenaries on a commercial flight to Caracas, with a connection in Istanbul, and to force the plane to land as it crossed over Ukrainian airspace. Flights from Moscow to Istanbul passed over Ukraine for nearly an hour, but Russia, owing to the COVID pandemic, had cancelled flights to Turkey. Instead, the mercenaries would have to travel by bus to Minsk, in Belarus, where they could catch a direct flight to Istanbul. It would be a tighter window: the flight from Minsk passed over Ukrainian airspace for only twenty-eight minutes.\n\nChervinsky enlisted the help of a military official in Ukraine's air-traffic center to learn the rules laid out by the Convention on International Civil Aviation. For Chervinsky's purposes, there were two scenarios in which a commercial flight could be forced to land before reaching its destination: a medical emergency or a bomb threat. HUR officers found an agent willing to board the plane and take a substance that induced seizure-like symptoms, and ran a test under the supervision of doctors. \"He didn't know why he was supposed to do this or who else would be on the plane,\" Zholobetskyi said. \"We only told him it was for an important operation.\"\n\nBut, in cases of onboard medical emergencies, the pilot was in control of whether, and where, to land the plane. That left a bomb threat. Just after takeoff, an agent recruited by HUR would place a call from inside the Minsk airport to Ukraine's antiterrorism center, reporting that he had overheard two people discussing plans to carry out a terrorist attack on board the flight. In such cases, security agents would contact air-traffic control. Ukrainian dispatchers would then be in charge: if they ordered the pilot to land in Kyiv, the pilot was required to comply. Once the plane was on the ground, the passengers would be led off, and the mercenaries would be arrested.\n\nHUR officers used black-market payment networks to wire a tranche of funds to Milyaev-fifteen thousand rubles per person-and told him that he and his men would be meeting a Rosneft employee named Larisa in Istanbul. \"From then on, they were relaxed,\" Chervinsky said. \"They were certain their contracts had started.\"\n\nBurba, HUR 's director, has repeatedly told the story of what he claims happened next. He went to Bankova, the Presidential-administration building in Kyiv, to brief Zelensky on Project Avenue's next phase. Zelensky was unable to attend, but his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, told Burba that the operation would have to be delayed. Zelensky and Putin had agreed to a ceasefire in the Donbas that would take effect that Monday, two days after HUR planned to conduct the operation. Yermak didn't want anything to undermine one of Zelensky's key political initiatives. Burba agreed to delay the plan by five days, enough time for the ceasefire to take hold. The HUR team was nervous. \"These guys had prepared themselves to get to work and earn money,\" Zholobetskyi said. \"Telling them at the last minute to wait even longer risked losing them forever.\"\n\nThe officers used pandemic travel restrictions as an excuse for the delay. A Ukrainian travel agent working with HUR booked rooms for the group at a hotel in Minsk. Milyaev laid out the rules to his men: no drinking, no leaving the hotel without approval, and everyone had to eat meals at predesignated times. \"Over many months, we led him to think of himself as their commander,\" Chervinsky said. \"So it was him, not us, who was in charge of keeping them disciplined.\" Two days later, HUR relocated the men to a sanatorium in the woods outside Minsk. \"We needed to find a quiet, hidden place that could house a large number of people on short notice,\" Zholobetskyi explained.\n\nThen there was another hiccup. On July 29th, a day before the mercenaries were supposed to fly to Istanbul, Milyaev sent an urgent message to Larisa, his Rosneft contact: he and his men had been arrested in Belarus. That morning, a Ukrainian intelligence officer got a call from a contact in the Belarusian security services: \"Why the hell did we receive an order to arrest thirty-three mercenaries?\"\n\nKyiv and Moscow jockeyed over where the men would be sent. Ukrainian prosecutors, noting that the mercenaries had committed crimes in Ukraine, filed extradition requests. Zelensky called Aleksandr Lukashenko, the President of Belarus, to press the case. Russian authorities, meanwhile, were piecing together what had happened. A report in Komsomolskaya Pravda , citing the Russian secret services, noted that the phone numbers from Syria and Venezuela were fakes, and that the airline tickets purchased for the group had been booked by a travel agency in Kyiv. Ten days after the arrests, Lukashenko was reëlected to a sixth term as President. His victory, which much of the West condemned as illegitimate, led to wide-scale protests. Lukashenko turned to Putin for a guarantee of security. Belarus handed the men over to Russia.\n\nBurba was consumed by his suspicion that, before the arrests, an official in Zelensky's office had tipped off Lukashenko, perhaps thinking that Belarus could be persuaded to hand over the mercenaries to Ukraine-no complicated sting operation required. Burba wanted to launch an internal investigation, with polygraphs conducted on high-ranking officials, including Yermak, Zelensky's chief of staff. But he never got a chance: on August 5th, he was fired as HUR 's director.\n\nReports of the failed operation began to appear in the Ukrainian press, where it took on the moniker Wagnergate. At first, Yermak denied that such an operation had been attempted. \"A fictional detective story from beginning to end,\" he said. Zelensky eventually acknowledged its existence, but he said, \"It was the idea of other countries, not Ukraine.\" Opposition members of parliament, from the party of the former President Petro Poroshenko, accused Zelensky of treason. \"If the President was involved in falsifications and lies,\" one declared, \"this means impeachment.\"\n\nA special commission was formed in parliament to investigate the incident-the first in Ukrainian history to deal with such highly classified material. Its members worked inside a specially prepared room, where cell-phone reception was blocked. \"I hoped this commission could grow into a proper intelligence-oversight committee,\" Mariana Bezuhla, a thirty-six-year-old parliamentarian, who chaired the effort, told me. \"I now realize there was little hope of getting accurate or reliable information on what really happened.\" According to the commission's report, released in November, 2021, its members were \"unable to clearly establish by whom and at what level in Ukraine the decision to postpone was adopted.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nIn June, 2021, Chervinsky, who was then forty-six, left HUR . He was entitled to his state pension as a retired officer and considered joining an acquaintance's private law practice in Kyiv. Like Burba, he believed that Project Avenue had been undermined from within. That December, he appeared on a political talk show in Kyiv. It was the first time that Chervinsky had shown his face to the public; a man who spent his career in the shadows was now in the klieg lights of a television studio. He said that Project Avenue's failure was the result of a \"betrayal\" and alleged the President's office had a mole: \"I am ninety-nine per cent certain that this was an act of treason.\"\n\nA former U.S. intelligence officer said of Chervinsky and his allies, \"When these guys felt like they were being thrown under the bus, they decided to throw back.\" But a senior official in Ukraine's intelligence apparatus said that the fallout from Wagnergate amounted to \"total silliness.\" \"In this trade, you have to be able to admit your mistakes,\" the senior official said. \"If they did that, the operation would have ended in a normal, ordinary failure-the kind of thing that happens all the time. Instead, they kept pushing and pumped the story into a huge political scandal.\"\n\nWhatever the case, the battle lines surrounding Wagnergate were clear: those who favored a more hawkish policy toward Russia, including powerful figures in Poroshenko's camp, had used the incident as a cudgel against Zelensky and his team. Kondratiuk, the former spy chief, called Chervinsky \"an extremely talented operative and tactical thinker,\" but added, \"The tragedy is that he didn't figure out the moment when others began to use him.\" The officials he had upset were vindictive, Kondratiuk said. \"They are always sure to get their revenge.\"\n\nThe scandal, however, proved short-lived. Two months after Chervinsky's TV appearance, Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Bezuhla and I spoke about the legacy of Wagnergate in the context of the current war, during which the Ukrainian military and the secret services have undertaken far more ambitious operations. In October, 2022, for example, the S.B.U. hid explosives in rolls of cellophane and shipped the cargo from Russia to Crimea; a truck, packed with the explosives, detonated as it was driving over the Crimean Bridge, destroying a key overland route that Russia used to resupply its troops. Earlier this year, a HUR source told me, operatives rigged explosives in a batch of goggles used in drone operations, which middlemen passed to pro-Russian volunteers, who donated them to Russian military units. The goggles subsequently exploded in the faces of Russian drone pilots. Wagnergate, Bezuhla said, \"removed the taboo for carrying out crazy operations. Now we are very crazy.\"\n\nOn the morning of Russia's invasion, as armored columns bore down on Kyiv, Chervinsky's wife, Olha, and their three children fled to Kamyanets-Podilskyi, where Chervinsky's mother lived. That evening, Chervinsky met up with former colleagues from HUR , some of whom, like him, had been pushed out after Project Avenue. Their former colleagues in the service helped procure automatic rifles and antitank mines. \"At the lower levels,\" Chervinsky said, \"we never had any misunderstandings.\"\n\nThe group headed toward Makariv, a settlement thirty miles west of Kyiv, where a Russian armored column was trying to press toward the capital. The men went on scouting missions to plant mines on roads and highways where Russian tanks and other vehicles were passing. When a Russian convoy triggered the mines, the group opened fire. \"I had been at war,\" Chervinsky told me. \"But not like this.\"\n\nIn the Donbas, he had fought the enemy at a distance; now he and the others were operating in Russian-held territory, moving at night, sleeping in the woods or, when sympathetic locals allowed, in an empty storage shed or an abandoned house. They regularly came under fire. The former HUR officer, who was a member of the group, told me, \"Overnight, a bunch of guys who not long before had been commanders, running large-scale operations, became ordinary soldiers, not showering for weeks, eating canned meat out of metal tins.\"\n\nAfter a month, Chervinsky and a few of the others were invited to join the S.S.O., the special-operations branch of the Ukrainian military. They were put in charge of an effort to prepare populations in areas at risk of Russian occupation for partisan warfare. \"Let's say Ukrainian forces retreat from a certain territory,\" an officer in the S.S.O. said. \"Everything should be set up in advance-sources and agents on the ground, hidden weapons and explosives, a system for coördinating operations.\"\n\nIn early April, the group was assigned to the Zaporizhzhia front, in Ukraine's southeast. They searched for people in occupied zones who could help their cause, from pro-Ukrainian patriots to small-time criminals. \"It may sound pompous,\" the former HUR officer told me, \"but, after two decades of doing this work, we have a pretty good sense of who the strong-willed people are in any community and how to find them.\" They divided jobs among the residents. \"One person performs a rather meagre task, such as counting the order in which military supply trains pass through a certain crossing,\" the S.S.O. officer said. \"And another, who never met or saw the first, goes at night to lay an explosive on the tracks.\"\n\nChervinsky was in touch with colleagues throughout the secret services, sharing ideas for new operations. \"Roman can't sit still for long,\" the former HUR officer said. In the spring of 2022, one of Chervinsky's contacts at the S.B.U. told him about a civilian who, on his own initiative, had begun communicating with Russian fighter pilots, trying to persuade them to defect to Ukraine along with their aircraft. What they needed, the S.B.U. operative said, was money-did Chervinsky know where to find some?\n\nThat April, the Ukrainian parliament passed a law declaring that any Russian serviceman who provided Ukraine with one of Russia's more advanced military planes would receive a million dollars. An amateur pilot in Kyiv with a background in I.T. and cybersecurity, who asked to be called Bohdan, began thinking about how he might lure Russian airmen to take up the offer. \"One plane more or less wouldn't change the military picture for Ukraine,\" Bohdan told me. \"But if even one pilot, a member of Russia's military élite, defected in such a public way it would be a blow to morale, and a sign for others to consider the same. Not all of them want to bomb cities, after all-maybe they'd prefer a million bucks.\"\n\nBohdan found a publicly available list of Russian pilots who had received medals for flying combat missions in Syria. He ran the names through a dark-Web database, which generated about a hundred phone numbers and e-mail addresses. Most pilots didn't answer; others told Bohdan to get lost. But several seemed interested. He asked them to take photos of their aircraft while holding up a piece of paper with a number that he dictated to them-proof that they were really pilots and still flying combat missions.\n\nBohdan brought the idea to HUR . \"It's impossible,\" the senior Ukrainian intelligence source said, citing the difficulty of flying a plane low enough to evade Russian radar detection. \"You'd have to either be an idiot or incompetent to propose such a thing.\" An officer in the S.B.U. was more receptive. He helped Bohdan communicate with the pilots, who often demanded money for the photos and the videos they sent. The S.B.U. officer had previously worked with Chervinsky in the Donbas, and he asked his former colleague to join the effort. \"It seemed like a classic PsyOp,\" Chervinsky told me. (The S.B.U. has since said that it did not approve the operation.)\n\nChervinsky approached a Ukrainian businessman, who agreed to chip in a few thousand dollars to pay the Russian pilots. \"Roman is a brilliant saboteur, an assassin of the state,\" the businessman, who had worked with Chervinsky on some previous operations, told me. \"I felt obligated to help him do what he is capable of-no questions asked.\" Chervinsky also got assurances from his contacts in the military that Ukrainian air-defense units would not fire on the target aircraft as it made its approach.\n\nBohdan had identified three possible candidates. One of the pilots, who flew a long-range bomber on missions to Mariupol, said that he was worried about getting his wife and their three children out of the secure military town where they lived. \"I don't want to have the same story as Skripal,\" he told Bohdan, referring to the former Russian intelligence officer who, in 2018, was poisoned in the U.K. Another pilot wanted to defect not with his wife-\"It's a complicated relationship,\" he said-but with his mistress, a fitness trainer in her twenties. Chervinsky asked Christo Grozev, then a researcher at the open-source-intelligence outfit Bellingcat, to share a trove of Russian cell-phone billing records. Geolocation data showed that the pilot's mistress had visited F.S.B. facilities in Moscow. Soon, both candidates disappeared.\n\nThat left Roman Nosenko, a thirty-six-year-old who flew fighter jets from a Russian base in Morozovsk, near the southern city of Rostov. Over Signal, Bohdan told him that his wife should leave Russia through Belarus. Once she arrived in Minsk, Ukrainian agents would provide her with a European passport issued to a false identity. Nosenko, meanwhile, would slip a sedative into his co-pilot's coffee before takeoff, knocking him unconscious, and then report to his superiors that his jet was struck by Ukrainian anti-aircraft fire. At one point during the planning phase, according to Yahoo News, Nosenko told Bohdan, \"This is like a movie.\"\n\nBut, while Nosenko's wife was in transit, Chervinsky and the other operatives learned an unsettling fact. Phone records showed that she had made calls to an F.S.B. counterintelligence officer. \"Are you sure this is legit?\" Grozev asked Chervinsky. \"It looks like a setup.\" When Chervinsky asked Nosenko about his wife's calls to the F.S.B., Nosenko had a ready answer: she worked as a military psychologist at the same airbase where he was stationed-a fact that checked out-and she was in contact with F.S.B. counterintelligence as part of her normal duties. \"You could see that being true,\" Chervinsky said. But, he added, \"it was even more likely a double cross.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nThe operatives on the Ukrainian side instructed Nosenko's wife to return to Moscow and debated what to do next. \"Maybe he actually shows up,\" Chervinsky said. \"Even if he doesn't, we don't lose anything.\" Chervinsky relayed a new plan: Nosenko's wife would leave Russia for Kazakhstan, where a team of agents would be waiting for her. When they confirmed her arrival, the operation would commence. \"That would show he's for real,\" Chervinsky said. Nosenko was told a password-a string of numbers that he should say over a prearranged military frequency as he was approaching the front line-which would signal to Ukrainian anti-aircraft units to hold their fire. A pair of Ukrainian fighter jets would then escort Nosenko to the Kanatove airfield, in southeastern Ukraine. Nosenko's wife was supposed to get to Almaty at two in the morning; by six, Nosenko would take off in a Su-34 fighter toward Ukraine.\n\nOn July 22, 2022, Chervinsky and three other operatives set up a temporary command center at the Kanatove airfield. The soldiers at the base were told that the new arrivals were conducting a training mission to prepare for Russian sabotage. At midnight, Chervinsky spoke with Nosenko, who said that his wife had boarded a flight to Almaty. But a couple of hours later Chervinsky's contact there said that the wife had not landed. \"We knew it was over,\" Chervinsky said. At four-thirty, an air-raid siren went off. Chervinsky rushed to a nearby bomb shelter, where he could hear explosions ripple across the earth-six missile strikes in all. After half an hour, he resurfaced to see blown-out windows, a collapsed roof, and several burning aircraft. The base's commanding officer, a lieutenant colonel, was dead. Seventeen other soldiers were injured. \"Was Nosenko a double agent from the beginning?\" Chervinsky told me. \"Or did he turn at some point?\" (Nosenko, who remains in Russia, could not be reached for comment.)\n\nWithin days, the F.S.B. boasted of disrupting a Ukrainian operation to lure Russian Air Force pilots to defect. A video report released by the Russian agency featured images of the Ukrainian chats with the pilots and, in one instance, Chervinsky's own voice. \"Our goal is the plane,\" he says. \"We're ready to pay.\"\n\nThe following April, Chervinsky was arrested by investigators from the S.B.U. and charged with abuse of authority. According to a statement I received from the S.B.U., \"Chervinsky's unauthorized actions led to the enemy's missile attack on the Kanatove airfield.\" To many of Chervinsky's former colleagues, the criminal charges seemed flimsy. His superior in the S.S.O., a major general named Viktor Hanuschak, testified that the operation was carried out with the knowledge and approval of military leaders, the Air Force, and the S.B.U. When a prosecutor asked Hanuschak whether someone could gain access to the Kanatove airfield without an order from on high, he answered, \"Are you joking?\"\n\nKostenko, the former special-forces colonel in parliament, told me, \"Lots of operations don't work. To prosecute Chervinsky because he wanted to harm the enemy is like fining a Formula 1 driver for breaking the speed limit.\" But the case took on political overtones from the outset. Poroshenko, the former President, who still has political ambitions, paid Chervinsky's two-hundred-thousand-dollar bail. Chervinsky, for his part, believes that his arrest was less a legal matter than one of personal animosity, perhaps even payback for how he publicly broke ranks in the wake of Wagnergate. \"I'm a convenient target,\" he told me. \"The goal is to discredit me, to make me look uncontrollable, to find a reason to go after me.\"\n\nThat spring, when evidence began to emerge tying Ukraine to the Nord Stream attack, Zelensky issued blanket denials. \"I am President, and I give orders accordingly,\" he said in an interview with the media company Axel Springer. \"Nothing of the sort has been done by Ukraine. I would never act that way.\" Even in private, Yermak, Zelensky's chief of staff, told German officials that the Ukrainian government was not involved. \"It was so blurred,\" the German official said. \"It felt like no one knew the whole story start to finish.\"\n\nThe murkiness had its advantages. Last February, Denmark and Sweden closed their investigations into the explosions. A diplomat from one of those countries told me that there hadn't been enough evidence to mount a prosecution that would hold up in court, calling the outcome a \"matter of investigative luck.\" After all, the diplomat said, \"it could have put us in a position of having to point fingers at one of our allies for blowing up undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea.\"\n\nIn June, German prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for a suspect they identified as Volodymyr Z., a diving instructor in his mid-forties who, before the Nord Stream attack, lived in a small town outside Warsaw. Soon after, he crossed the Polish-Ukrainian border in a car reportedly used by the Ukrainian Embassy. As it became clear that the Zelensky administration could not simply disavow any Ukrainian connection, officials in Kyiv began to shift their behind-the-scenes messaging: Zelensky himself wasn't involved, but, if rogue elements inside the Ukrainian state were to blame, Ukrainian authorities would help track them down. At least one journalist told me of an S.B.U. briefing where Chervinsky was named as the organizer of the attack. (The S.B.U. said that this was \"completely untrue.\")\n\nLast August, the Wall Street Journal reported that Valerii Zaluzhnyi, then the chief military officer in Ukraine, had authorized and overseen the plot. Zaluzhnyi had \"enlisted some of Ukraine's top special-operations officers with experience in orchestrating high-risk clandestine missions against Russia to help coordinate the attack,\" the Journal said. Chervinsky was the only operative named in the story. One participant told the Journal that the operation, which was said to have cost three hundred thousand dollars, resembled a \"public-private partnership,\" in that it brought together wealthy businessmen, active military officers, former spies, and private citizens with useful skills.\n\nSome participants worked on preparations and logistics from Kyiv. According to a well-placed Ukrainian security source, this was likely Chervinsky's role-coördinating efforts among various stakeholders in the military and intelligence services. The crew, dispatched on the Andromeda, was composed of civilian divers and active-duty Ukrainian soldiers on leave from the front. They set off from Rostock, a German port city on the Baltic Sea, and made a stop in Sandhamn, in Sweden, before arriving at their target coördinates, a stretch of open water near the Danish island of Bornholm. A little more than two weeks later, they returned to shore, having finished their supposed pleasure-cruise holiday. The source involved in the initial planning told me that Zelensky might not have been informed of the operation. Nevertheless, the source insisted, it was carried out within the military's chain of command: \"We are not the types to act out of order.\"\n\nThe closest to an official comment on Nord Stream that I managed to secure came from Kostenko, who sits on the security committee in the Ukrainian parliament. \"Everyone who needs to know the answer to this question knows the answer, and this answer is enough for them,\" he said. \"Our Western partners understand everything perfectly well.\"\n\nA rough outline of a plan to blow up Nord Stream had been circulating in Ukrainian security circles for some time. \"Russia lives off of selling raw materials-oil and gas,\" the Ukrainian source familiar with the planning for the Nord Stream operation said. \"It's what finances Putin's aggression and helps him manipulate Europe.\" The source added that Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, is linked to two private military companies that have deployed fighters to Ukraine.\n\nIn the course of my reporting, I learned that, in early 2022, Chervinsky was part of a group of people who approached their C.I.A. contacts with the idea of blowing up Nord Stream. The C.I.A. officers strongly opposed the proposal, and urged the Ukrainians to abandon it. \"There was a constant flow of novel, creative ideas,\" a U.S. official who worked with Ukraine told me. \"Some were good, others not so much.\"\n\nAn officer in Ukraine's military told me that a group of operatives-the source wouldn't name any of them-had proposed the same plan to Zaluzhnyi: \"It was in the spirit of 'There's this idea, this possibility. Are we doing it or not?' \" The source said that Zaluzhnyi signed off. (Zaluzhnyi has denied any knowledge of the sabotage.)\n\nAccording to this source, Zaluzhnyi informed Zelensky of the operation. For a while, everything proceeded as planned until, at a certain point, the source said, Zelensky gave an order to cancel the mission. But it was too late. \"When you enter the zone of operations, you activate a regime of total silence,\" the source said. A single connection, a ping from a phone to a cell tower, can be enough to give away not only your location but whom you're talking to. As a result, the source said, \"going dark is textbook procedure for any special operation.\"\n\nDespite the initial speculation that the attack required highly specialized equipment, it was a rather simple affair. \"For a normal, professionally trained diver, placing an object on an underwater pipeline is no problem,\" the source said. Narrowly speaking, the mission was a success. The target was destroyed, and, \"most importantly, everyone involved left the field safe and whole.\" In private, a handful of participants, those who were active-duty soldiers, received awards from the military's general staff. \"On paper, it was for something vague, like 'For the defense of Ukraine,' \" the source familiar with the plans told me. \"We wanted to show them they are valued.\"\n\nThe problem, the military officer told me, is that \"if you judge them strictly according to the law, they're not heroes but criminals.\" Of course, that is the nature of espionage-every country, including the United States, technically breaks the laws of foreign nations to execute missions in its own interest. Zelensky, the source offered, could simply say, \"We will carry out whatever operations we have to, in any theatre in the world, in order to defend the country.\" Instead, the officer went on, \"it's as if the country has turned its back\" on its own operatives.\n\nIn Kyiv, when I asked Chervinsky again about Nord Stream, he said, \"Someone did a good thing. It must have been a difficult decision, but I'm convinced it benefitted Ukraine, and the West, too.\" I mentioned that I had learned he was among the Ukrainian intelligence operatives who first proposed to the C.I.A. the idea of blowing up the pipelines. He seemed surprised. \"I'm not going to talk about that,\" he said, before adding that he couldn't confirm that such a meeting had taken place. He insisted that his name had been falsely linked to the operation. \"Let them point fingers at me,\" he said. \"I'm no better or worse off from all the attention.\" He declined to comment further. \"I get why people are interested,\" he told me. \"The story of Nord Stream is a compelling mystery. Let people speculate. One day we'll find out what really happened.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Breonna Taylor Can't Tell Her Story of Police Abuse, but I'm Here to Tell Mine\n\nThe truth is, I didn't commit a crime, but I still feel as if I did. It was around 8 A.M. on April 25, 2018, and I was asleep-which was unusual for me, because I'm a very early riser. When the sun rises, I rise. Like Breonna Taylor on the date of her death, I had been up late-having suffered through a long day of teaching and then writing until after midnight, I decided to sleep late. Since then, I have wondered whether that decision is what saved my life. An act that my great-grandmother would call lazy is why my bedroom door was locked when an officer banged on it, yelling, \"This is the Dallas police. Open the door, or I'll kick it down.\"\n\nA friend had told me that Taylor was killed in her Louisville, Kentucky, apartment while she was dreaming. I can only wish that had been true, and that she hadn't been conscious enough to hear the shots that rang out as the bullets hit her body. She isn't here to tell her story, but I'm here to tell mine. I want to-need to-share it on behalf of all of the women whom the police have brutalized. There are no cell-phone videos of my encounter with them. No celebrity lawyer represents me. My story is all on me. And it isn't easy to tell.\n\nTwo things you should know: my doorbell was broken, and there was a ladder leaning against my townhome, from the ground to the roof, because I was having the roof replaced. (I hate that roof.) The morning when I heard the loud knocks on my bedroom door, I sat up in bed and tried to remember where I was, because, if I was home, something had gone seriously wrong.\n\n\"How do I know you're the police?\" I asked, as I reached across the bed for my pajamas, a robe-anything I could use to cover myself.\n\n\"This is the Dallas police. I will knock this door down,\" came the menacing reply.\n\nI thought about all of the things I had prepared in case there was a burglary or fire. There was the ladder-which promised to hold up to five hundred pounds-that I'd tested, and I could hang from the bedroom balcony and then climb down it. Had I forgotten to check the date on the fire extinguisher? Would it work after the expiration date? Should I dial 911 while climbing down the ladder?\n\n\"This is the Dallas police,\" a man shouted again.\n\nHere was 911, banging on my bedroom door and threatening me. Now what? I opened the door and looked up at what seemed like a ten-foot-tall man, who was as wide as my bedroom door. I had forgotten to put on a bra. I looked back to see whether I had left one lying on the bed, the floor, anywhere that was within arm's reach. My shirt was thin, almost see-through.\n\n\"Is anybody in there with you?\" the officer asked.\n\nI wish, I thought. Then again, maybe I didn't. \"Just me,\" I replied.\n\nI can't remember exactly how many seconds passed before I saw the other police officer, crouched on the stairway, with an assault rifle pointed directly at my chest. The weirdest things went through my mind. I thought, Granny warned me to always wear clean panties in case of an emergency-but now I was about to die without a bra. The coroner was going to pronounce me dead, braless.\n\n\"Is anybody in here with you?\" the first officer asked again.\n\n\"No, just me,\" I repeated.\n\nOur dialogue quickly grew very strange.\n\n\"Is there any place in here someone could hide?\" he asked me.\n\n\"Who?\" I asked.\n\n\"Is there any place in here someone could hide?\" Now he was not asking; he was demanding.\n\nSo this is how we're going to do it, I thought. I nodded my head. \"Yes, this is a four-story home.\" Were we going to play hide-and-seek?\n\n\"Wait here,\" he said.\n\nI can't remember whether the officer with the gun stayed and pointed it at me while the other one roamed through the corners and crannies of my home, but I do remember standing frozen in place. I heard the tall officer's footsteps as he stomped down the stairs. I heard doors open and close. I couldn't have moved if I'd wanted to. I believe that the roving one searched the rooms twice because he came up the stairs, looked at me, and headed back down. Did I look guilty? What crime did I commit before I awoke? Maybe I did something yesterday, last year, or five, ten, twenty years ago. What was the statute of limitations?\n\nI don't remember whether the officers left by way of the roof or through the front door, three stories down. I do know that I stood alone, in my bedroom doorway, for what seemed like a week before I moved. I walked to the window and saw several police cars in the driveway, a white van that appeared to be a C.S.I. truck, and some police officers with guns. An officer in a tan cap and a shirt that read H.S.I.-Homeland Security Investigations-stood next to a black vehicle. Other officers were covered in black, from head to toe, wearing ski masks. I could tell that one of the masked men was Black because I glimpsed his hand and, bizarrely, wondered whether he was good-looking.\n\nSuddenly, the men who were repairing my roof and women from a service who clean my house walked up to my front door. I moved, and the next thing I knew, I had flown down the stairs to let them inside.\n\n\"What's going on?\" one of them asked.\n\n\"I don't know. I'll find out,\" I assured them.\n\nThe women started cleaning while I told them, breathlessly, what had happened. Then one of the roofers asked me to follow him up to the rooftop patio.\n\n\"Ma'am, they knocked in your door,\" he said.\n\nThe police had knocked down the door leading from the patio into my home. So the ten-foot-tall officer wasn't kidding when he'd threatened to knock down my bedroom door. My head throbbed. The reality was more than my legs could handle. I sat on the floor until I realized that I was scaring the roofers. They wanted to know what to do about the door. I didn't know what to say. One of them said that they would get a new one at Home Depot. I nodded and walked down the stairs behind them. I smelled Pine-Sol. I remember thinking that it was too late to tell the cleaners that I had bought unscented, environmentally friendly products.\n\nI walked outside behind the men, who seemed happy to be leaving. Police officers were walking back and forth, going inside the townhouse next to mine and bringing items back to the van. I walked up to one of the officers and asked what had happened.\n\n\"Did you know your neighbor?\" he asked.\n\nWas this part of his training? \"No,\" I answered. He looked at me, as if to say, \"You mean your homes are attached and you don't know him?\"\n\n\"Maybe I've seen him a couple of times,\" I told him. I hadn't. I'd heard his loud music, but if I had seen him, I didn't know he lived next door.\n\n\"What did he do?\" I asked. The cop told me that my neighbor and his girlfriend were selling drugs on the dark Web. My voice raised, I asked him why it took so many officers to arrest him. He told me that they were accompanying undercover police from New York, who investigate crimes on the dark Web. I only knew about the TV show \"New York Undercover.\" (I had a crush on one of the stars, Malik Yoba.) What was the dark Web?\n\nI continued probing and asked whether they had caught the couple. The cop told me that they thought my neighbor was in San Antonio and that his girlfriend was still in Dallas, at work. They said that he was Mexican and she was Asian. Thank God the men repairing my roof didn't come in to work early that day. In my mind, the police would have killed them, for sure. Now the shock was starting to wear off, and I was getting angry. \"If he's in San Antonio,\" I asked, \"why did you come in my home?\" There was a long pause. Uncomfortable. The cop told me to ask the other officer and went inside to get him.\n\nWhen the officer who demanded to enter my bedroom came out, he stood in front of me, as if he were a bull ready to charge a bullfighter with a muleta. I trembled.\n\nI tried to steady myself. \"Why did you come in my home?\" I asked.\n\nHe told me that the police were looking for a suspect and came into my home because there were \"exigent circumstances.\"\n\n\"But you knocked down my door, and the other policeman said he was in San Antonio,\" I replied.\n\nAround us, the scene remained surreal. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see a police officer taking the neighbor's dog for a walk. I wondered whether the dog knew that the police were going to arrest its owners. The officer stared at me, and, remembering that I wasn't wearing a bra, I crossed my arms over my breasts.\n\n\"Why did y'all hold a gun on me?\" I asked. \"I thought you were going to kill me.\"\n\n\"Why would you think that?\" he responded, clearly not recognizing how upset I was.\n\n\"Have you been watching the news? It's rare that y'all hold a gun on us and we don't die,\" I said.\n\nHe looked perturbed. The officer with the dog returned, and the officer who had threatened to knock down my door went back inside the house. That was the last I saw of him. The police officer with the dog told me that my neighbor had lots of wine inside and, if I wanted, I could take it. That's pretty brazen and presumptuous, I thought.\n\nI went back inside my home and told the cleaning women what happened. They knew about the behavior of police officers because they had seen situations much worse than mine. People died in the stories that they told me. I felt small for burdening them with my encounter-guilty, even, because I wasn't dead, like Sandra Bland, Michelle Cusseaux, and Natasha McKenna. We will forever say their names, but we won't ever see Breonna Taylor's dreams come true.\n\nThe police officers left around 5 P.M. No one apologized. Later, I talked to lawyers, who told me that my case wasn't worth the time and effort. No media. No financial gain. I lived. I'd be all right. I filed a complaint with the Dallas police's internal-affairs division. A few months later, Botham Jean , who was twenty-six, was killed by a Dallas police officer while he sat eating ice cream in his own apartment. He lived less than two miles from me, less than a mile from the Dallas Police Headquarters, and less than half a mile from the SandersFit gym, where I worked out. I made a point of watching every second of Jean's trial. The officer, Amber Guyger, who was then thirty-one years old, was sentenced to ten years in prison for Jean's murder.\n\nThen it happened again. And again. A string of police killings of African-Americans such as George Floyd , in Minneapolis, and Rayshard Brooks , in Atlanta. The world responded in a way that I didn't know how to-or was afraid to-when the Dallas officer knocked on my bedroom door. Today, our voices are louder and stronger. Our demands are clear, necessary, and urgent. We are unafraid. Changes will be made. I know because, in every Zoom meeting I attend and Webex panel I sit on, participants want to hear what are the problems, what are the demands, and what can be done. One of these demands seems simple: justice for Breonna Taylor's death. With that achieved, could I then believe that it is possible for all African-Americans to finally benefit from their own efforts? That the voices of women who are violated and escape death will finally be heard?\n\nI'm fine, I tell myself, but I constantly feel as if I'm not doing enough. I did see a therapist after my incident with the police. Terms such as \"trauma\" and \"P.T.S.D.\" were used. On the morning that I had a gun pointed at me, I was working on my Ph.D. and had to teach the following day. (Today, I am a professor, helping Dallas transform into a literary city.) The police department's internal-affairs division found that the two officers damaged my property and that their search was improper. In response to a request for comment from The New Yorker , the department issued a statement saying that the officers believed the suspect was inside my building and, because of the rooftop construction, thought that my apartment was vacant. An \"administrative investigation\" by the department \"resulted in the officers being disciplined for their actions.\"\n\nWhat does discipline mean for police officers? Would they have to cut their own switches, like Granny used to make me do? After the internal-affairs investigation found the policemen were at fault, the department said it would reimburse me for the damage. I haven't filed the reports needed to receive the money. I haven't finished repairing the doorway entrance. I rarely go up to my rooftop patio anymore. I don't go to SandersFit gym. I sleep in flannel pajamas. I wish Breonna Taylor had been dreaming.\n\nA previous version of this post misstated the cause of death of Sandra Bland and Natasha McKenna.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Invention of the Police\n\nTo police is to maintain law and order, but the word derives from polis -the Greek for \"city,\" or \"polity\"-by way of politia , the Latin for \"citizenship,\" and it entered English from the Middle French police , which meant not constables but government. \"The police,\" as a civil force charged with deterring crime, came to the United States from England and is generally associated with monarchy-\"keeping the king's peace\"-which makes it surprising that, in the antimonarchical United States, it got so big, so fast. The reason is, mainly, slavery.\n\n\"Abolish the police,\" as a rallying cry, dates to 1988 (the year that N.W.A. recorded \"Fuck tha Police\"), but, long before anyone called for its abolition, someone had to invent the police: the ancient Greek polis had to become the modern police. \"To be political, to live in a polis , meant that everything was decided through words and persuasion and not through force and violence,\" Hannah Arendt wrote in \" The Human Condition .\" In the polis, men argued and debated, as equals, under a rule of law. Outside the polis, in households, men dominated women, children, servants, and slaves, under a rule of force. This division of government sailed down the river of time like a raft, getting battered, but also bigger, collecting sticks and mud. Kings asserted a rule of force over their subjects on the idea that their kingdom was their household. In 1769, William Blackstone, in his \" Commentaries on the Laws of England ,\" argued that the king, as \"pater-familias of the nation,\" directs \"the public police,\" exercising the means by which \"the individuals of the state, like members of a well-governed family, are bound to conform their general behavior to the rules of propriety, good neighbourhood, and good manners; and to be decent, industrious, and inoffensive in their respective stations.\" The police are the king's men.\n\nHistory begins with etymology, but it doesn't end there. The polis is not the police. The American Revolution toppled the power of the king over his people-in America, \"the law is king,\" Thomas Paine wrote-but not the power of a man over his family. The power of the police has its origins in that kind of power. Under the rule of law, people are equals; under the rule of police, as the legal theorist Markus Dubber has written, we are not. We are more like the women, children, servants, and slaves in a household in ancient Greece, the people who were not allowed to be a part of the polis. But for centuries, through struggles for independence, emancipation, enfranchisement, and equal rights, we've been fighting to enter the polis. One way to think about \"Abolish the police,\" then, is as an argument that, now that all of us have finally clawed our way into the polis, the police are obsolete.\n\nBut are they? The crisis in policing is the culmination of a thousand other failures-failures of education, social services, public health, gun regulation, criminal justice, and economic development. Police have a lot in common with firefighters, E.M.T.s, and paramedics: they're there to help, often at great sacrifice, and by placing themselves in harm's way. To say that this doesn't always work out, however, does not begin to cover the size of the problem. The killing of George Floyd , in Minneapolis, cannot be wished away as an outlier. In each of the past five years, police in the United States have killed roughly a thousand people. (During each of those same years, about a hundred police officers were killed in the line of duty.) One study suggests that, among American men between the ages of fifteen and thirty-four, the number who were treated in emergency rooms as a result of injuries inflicted by police and security guards was almost as great as the number who, as pedestrians, were injured by motor vehicles. Urban police forces are nearly always whiter than the communities they patrol. The victims of police brutality are disproportionately Black teen-age boys: children. To say that many good and admirable people are police officers, dedicated and brave public servants, which is, of course, true, is to fail to address both the nature and the scale of the crisis and the legacy of centuries of racial injustice. The best people, with the best of intentions, doing their utmost, cannot fix this system from within.\n\nThere are nearly seven hundred thousand police officers in the United States, about two for every thousand people, a rate that is lower than the European average. The difference is guns. Police in Finland fired six bullets in all of 2013; in an encounter on a single day in the year 2015, in Pasco, Washington, three policemen fired seventeen bullets when they shot and killed an unarmed thirty-five-year-old orchard worker from Mexico. Five years ago, when the Guardian counted police killings, it reported that, \"in the first 24 days of 2015, police in the US fatally shot more people than police did in England and Wales, combined, over the past 24 years.\" American police are armed to the teeth, with more than seven billion dollars' worth of surplus military equipment off-loaded by the Pentagon to eight thousand law-enforcement agencies since 1997. At the same time, they face the most heavily armed civilian population in the world: one in three Americans owns a gun, typically more than one. Gun violence undermines civilian life and debases everyone. A study found that, given the ravages of stress, white male police officers in Buffalo have a life expectancy twenty-two years shorter than that of the average American male. The debate about policing also has to do with all the money that's spent paying heavily armed agents of the state to do things that they aren't trained to do and that other institutions would do better. History haunts this debate like a bullet-riddled ghost.\n\nThat history begins in England, in the thirteenth century, when maintaining the king's peace became the duty of an officer of the court called a constable, aided by his watchmen: every male adult could be called on to take a turn walking a ward at night and, if trouble came, to raise a hue and cry. This practice lasted for centuries. (A version endures: George Zimmerman, when he shot and killed Trayvon Martin , in 2012, was serving on his neighborhood watch.) The watch didn't work especially well in England-\"The average constable is an ignoramus who knows little or nothing of the law,\" Blackstone wrote-and it didn't work especially well in England's colonies. Rich men paid poor men to take their turns on the watch, which meant that most watchmen were either very elderly or very poor, and very exhausted from working all day. Boston established a watch in 1631. New York tried paying watchmen in 1658. In Philadelphia, in 1705, the governor expressed the view that the militia could make the city safer than the watch, but militias weren't supposed to police the king's subjects; they were supposed to serve the common defense-waging wars against the French, fighting Native peoples who were trying to hold on to their lands, or suppressing slave rebellions.\n\nThe government of slavery was not a rule of law. It was a rule of police. In 1661, the English colony of Barbados passed its first slave law; revised in 1688, it decreed that \"Negroes and other Slaves\" were \"wholly unqualified to be governed by the Laws . . . of our Nations,\" and devised, instead, a special set of rules \"for the good Regulating and Ordering of them.\" Virginia adopted similar measures, known as slave codes, in 1680:\n\nIt shall not be lawfull for any negroe or other slave to carry or arme himselfe with any club, staffe, gunn, sword or any other weapon of defence or offence, nor to goe or depart from of his masters ground without a certificate from his master, mistris or overseer, and such permission not to be granted but upon perticuler and necessary occasions; and every negroe or slave soe offending not haveing a certificate as aforesaid shalbe sent to the next constable, who is hereby enjoyned and required to give the said negroe twenty lashes on his bare back well layd on, and soe sent home to his said master, mistris or overseer . . . that if any negroe or other slave shall absent himself from his masters service and lye hid and lurking in obscure places, comitting injuries to the inhabitants, and shall resist any person or persons that shalby any lawfull authority be imployed to apprehend and take the said negroe, that then in case of such resistance, it shalbe lawfull for such person or persons to kill the said negroe or slave soe lying out and resisting.\n\nIn eighteenth-century New York, a person held as a slave could not gather in a group of more than three; could not ride a horse; could not hold a funeral at night; could not be out an hour after sunset without a lantern; and could not sell \"Indian corn, peaches, or any other fruit\" in any street or market in the city. Stop and frisk, stop and whip, shoot to kill.\n\nLink copied\n\nThen there were the slave patrols. Armed Spanish bands called hermandades had hunted runaways in Cuba beginning in the fifteen-thirties, a practice that was adopted by the English in Barbados a century later. It had a lot in common with England's posse comitatus, a band of stout men that a county sheriff could summon to chase down an escaped criminal. South Carolina, founded by slaveowners from Barbados, authorized its first slave patrol in 1702; Virginia followed in 1726, North Carolina in 1753. Slave patrols married the watch to the militia: serving on patrol was required of all able-bodied men (often, the patrol was mustered from the militia), and patrollers used the hue and cry to call for anyone within hearing distance to join the chase. Neither the watch nor the militia nor the patrols were \"police,\" who were French, and considered despotic. In North America, the French city of New Orleans was distinctive in having la police: armed City Guards, who wore military-style uniforms and received wages, an urban slave patrol.\n\nIn 1779, Thomas Jefferson created a chair in \"law and police\" at the College of William & Mary. The meaning of the word began to change. In 1789, Jeremy Bentham, noting that \"police\" had recently entered the English language, in something like its modern sense, made this distinction: police keep the peace; justice punishes disorder. (\"No justice, no peace!\" Black Lives Matter protesters cry in the streets.) Then, in 1797, a London magistrate named Patrick Colquhoun published \"A Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis.\" He, too, distinguished peace kept in the streets from justice administered by the courts: police were responsible for the regulation and correction of behavior and \"the PREVENTION and DETECTION OF CRIMES .\"\n\nIt is often said that Britain created the police, and the United States copied it. One could argue that the reverse is true. Colquhoun spent his teens and early twenties in Colonial Virginia, had served as an agent for British cotton manufacturers, and owned shares in sugar plantations in Jamaica. He knew all about slave codes and slave patrols. But nothing came of Colquhoun's ideas about policing until 1829, when Home Secretary Robert Peel-in the wake of a great deal of labor unrest, and after years of suppressing Catholic rebellions in Ireland, in his capacity as Irish Secretary-persuaded Parliament to establish the Metropolitan Police, a force of some three thousand men, headed by two civilian justices (later called \"commissioners\"), and organized like an army, with each superintendent overseeing four inspectors, sixteen sergeants, and a hundred and sixty-five constables, who wore coats and pants of blue with black top hats, each assigned a numbered badge and a baton. Londoners came to call these men \"bobbies,\" for Bobby Peel.\n\nIt is also often said that modern American urban policing began in 1838, when the Massachusetts legislature authorized the hiring of police officers in Boston. This, too, ignores the role of slavery in the history of the police. In 1829, a Black abolitionist in Boston named David Walker published \" An Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World ,\" calling for violent rebellion: \"One good black man can put to death six white men.\" Walker was found dead within the year, and Boston thereafter had a series of mob attacks against abolitionists, including an attempt to lynch William Lloyd Garrison, the publisher of The Liberator, in 1835. Walker's words terrified Southern slaveowners. The governor of North Carolina wrote to his state's senators, \"I beg you will lay this matter before the police of your town and invite their prompt attention to the necessity of arresting the circulation of the book.\" By \"police,\" he meant slave patrols: in response to Walker's \"Appeal,\" North Carolina formed a statewide \"patrol committee.\"\n\nNew York established a police department in 1844; New Orleans and Cincinnati followed in 1852, then, later in the eighteen-fifties, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Baltimore. Population growth, the widening inequality brought about by the Industrial Revolution, and the rise in such crimes as prostitution and burglary all contributed to the emergence of urban policing. So did immigration, especially from Ireland and Germany, and the hostility to immigration: a new party, the Know-Nothings, sought to prevent immigrants from voting, holding office, and becoming citizens. In 1854, Boston disbanded its ancient watch and formally established a police department; that year, Know-Nothings swept the city's elections.\n\nAmerican police differed from their English counterparts: in the U.S., police commissioners, as political appointees, fell under local control, with limited supervision; and law enforcement was decentralized, resulting in a jurisdictional thicket. In 1857, in the Great Police Riot, the New York Municipal Police, run by the mayor's office, fought on the steps of city hall with the New York Metropolitan Police, run by the state. The Metropolitans were known as the New York Mets. That year, an amateur baseball team of the same name was founded.\n\nAlso, unlike their British counterparts, American police carried guns, initially their own. In the eighteen-sixties, the Colt Firearms Company began manufacturing a compact revolver called a Pocket Police Model, long before the New York Metropolitan Police began issuing service weapons. American police carried guns because Americans carried guns, including Americans who lived in parts of the country where they hunted for food and defended their livestock from wild animals, Americans who lived in parts of the country that had no police, and Americans who lived in parts of North America that were not in the United States. Outside big cities, law-enforcement officers were scarce. In territories that weren't yet states, there were U.S. marshals and their deputies, officers of the federal courts who could act as de-facto police, but only to enforce federal laws. If a territory became a state, its counties would elect sheriffs. Meanwhile, Americans became vigilantes, especially likely to kill indigenous peoples, and to lynch people of color. Between 1840 and the nineteen-twenties, mobs, vigilantes, and law officers, including the Texas Rangers, lynched some five hundred Mexicans and Mexican-Americans and killed thousands more, not only in Texas but also in territories that became the states of California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. A San Francisco vigilance committee established in 1851 arrested, tried, and hanged people; it boasted a membership in the thousands. An L.A. vigilance committee targeted and lynched Chinese immigrants.\n\nThe U.S. Army operated as a police force, too. After the Civil War, the militia was organized into seven new departments of permanent standing armies: the Department of Dakota, the Department of the Platte, the Department of the Missouri, the Department of Texas, the Department of Arizona, the Department of California, and the Department of the Columbian. In the eighteen-seventies and eighties, the U.S. Army engaged in more than a thousand combat operations against Native peoples. In 1890, at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, following an attempt to disarm a Lakota settlement, a regiment of cavalrymen massacred hundreds of Lakota men, women, and children. Nearly a century later, in 1973, F.B.I. agents, SWAT teams, and federal troops and state marshals laid siege to Wounded Knee during a protest over police brutality and the failure to properly punish the torture and murder of an Oglala Sioux man named Raymond Yellow Thunder. They fired more than half a million rounds of ammunition and arrested more than a thousand people. Today, according to the C.D.C., Native Americans are more likely to be killed by the police than any other racial or ethnic group.\n\nModern American policing began in 1909, when August Vollmer became the chief of the police department in Berkeley, California. Vollmer refashioned American police into an American military. He'd served with the Eighth Army Corps in the Philippines in 1898. \"For years, ever since Spanish-American War days, I've studied military tactics and used them to good effect in rounding up crooks,\" he later explained. \"After all we're conducting a war, a war against the enemies of society.\" Who were those enemies? Mobsters, bootleggers, socialist agitators, strikers, union organizers, immigrants, and Black people.\n\nTo domestic policing, Vollmer and his peers adapted the kinds of tactics and weapons that had been deployed against Native Americans in the West and against colonized peoples in other parts of the world, including Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, as the sociologist Julian Go has demonstrated. Vollmer instituted a training model imitated all over the country, by police departments that were often led and staffed by other veterans of the United States wars of conquest and occupation. A \"police captain or lieutenant should occupy exactly the same position in the public mind as that of a captain or lieutenant in the United States army,\" Detroit's commissioner of police said. (Today's police officers are disproportionately veterans of U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, many suffering from post-traumatic stress. The Marshall Project, analyzing data from the Albuquerque police, found that officers who are veterans are more likely than their non-veteran counterparts to be involved in fatal shootings. In general, they are more likely to use force, and more likely to fire their guns.)\n\nVollmer-era police enforced a new kind of slave code: Jim Crow laws, which had been passed in the South beginning in the late eighteen-seventies and upheld by the Supreme Court in 1896. William G. Austin became Savannah's chief of police in 1907. Earlier, he had earned a Medal of Honor for his service in the U.S. Cavalry at Wounded Knee; he had also fought in the Spanish-American War. By 1916, African-American churches in the city were complaining to Savannah newspapers about the \"whole scale arrests of negroes because they are negroes-arrests that would not be made if they were white under similar circumstances.\" African-Americans also confronted Jim Crow policing in the Northern cities to which they increasingly fled. James Robinson, Philadelphia's chief of police beginning in 1912, had served in the Infantry during the Spanish-American War and the Philippine-American War. He based his force's training on manuals used by the U.S. Army at Leavenworth. Go reports that, in 1911, about eleven per cent of people arrested were African-American; under Robinson, that number rose to 14.6 per cent in 1917. By the nineteen-twenties, a quarter of those arrested were African-Americans, who, at the time, represented just 7.4 per cent of the population.\n\nProgressive Era, Vollmer-style policing criminalized Blackness, as the historian Khalil Gibran Muhammad argued in his 2010 book, \" The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America .\" Police patrolled Black neighborhoods and arrested Black people disproportionately; prosecutors indicted Black people disproportionately; juries found Black people guilty disproportionately; judges gave Black people disproportionately long sentences; and, then, after all this, social scientists, observing the number of Black people in jail, decided that, as a matter of biology, Black people were disproportionately inclined to criminality.\n\nMore recently, between the New Jim Crow and the criminalization of immigration and the imprisonment of immigrants in detention centers, this reality has only grown worse. \"By population, by per capita incarceration rates, and by expenditures, the United States exceeds all other nations in how many of its citizens, asylum seekers, and undocumented immigrants are under some form of criminal justice supervision,\" Muhammad writes in a new preface to his book. \"The number of African American and Latinx people in American jails and prisons today exceeds the entire populations of some African, Eastern European, and Caribbean countries.\"\n\nPolicing grew harsher in the Progressive Era, and, with the emergence of state-police forces, the number of police grew, too. With the rise of the automobile, some, like California's, began as \"highway patrols.\" Others, including the state police in Nevada, Colorado, and Oregon, began as the private paramilitaries of industrialists which employed the newest American immigrants: Hungarians, Italians, and Jews. Industrialists in Pennsylvania established the Iron and Coal Police to end strikes and bust unions, including the United Mine Workers; in 1905, three years after an anthracite-coal strike, the Pennsylvania State Police started operations. \"One State Policeman should be able to handle one hundred foreigners,\" its new chief said.\n\nThe U.S. Border Patrol began in 1924, the year that Congress restricted immigration from southern Europe. At the insistence of Southern and Western agriculturalists, Congress exempted Mexicans from its new immigration quotas in order to allow migrant workers to enter the United States. The Border Patrol began as a relatively small outfit responsible for enforcing federal immigration law, and stopping smugglers, at all of the nation's borders. In the middle decades of the twentieth century, it grew to a national quasi-military focussed on policing the southern border in campaigns of mass arrest and forced deportation of Mexican immigrants, aided by local police like the notoriously brutal L.A.P.D., as the historian Kelly Lytle Hernández has chronicled. What became the Chicano movement began in Southern California, with Mexican immigrants' protests of the L.A.P.D. during the first half of the twentieth century, even as a growing film industry cranked out features about Klansmen hunting Black people, cowboys killing Indians, and police chasing Mexicans. More recently, you can find an updated version of this story in L.A. Noire, a video game set in 1947 and played from the perspective of a well-armed L.A.P.D. officer, who, driving along Sunset Boulevard, passes the crumbling, abandoned sets from D. W. Griffith's 1916 film \"Intolerance,\" imagined relics of an unforgiving age.\n\nTwo kinds of police appeared on mid-century American television. The good guys solved crime on prime-time police procedurals like \"Dragnet,\" starting in 1951, and \"Adam-12,\" beginning in 1968 (both featured the L.A.P.D.). The bad guys shocked America's conscience on the nightly news: Arkansas state troopers barring Black students from entering Little Rock Central High School, in 1957; Birmingham police clubbing and arresting some seven hundred Black children protesting segregation, in 1963; and Alabama state troopers beating voting-rights marchers at Selma, in 1965. These two faces of policing help explain how, in the nineteen-sixties, the more people protested police brutality, the more money governments gave to police departments.\n\nIn 1965, President Lyndon Johnson declared a \"war on crime,\" and asked Congress to pass the Law Enforcement Assistance Act, under which the federal government would supply local police with military-grade weapons, weapons that were being used in the war in Vietnam. During riots in Watts that summer, law enforcement killed thirty-one people and arrested more than four thousand; fighting the protesters, the head of the L.A.P.D. said, was \"very much like fighting the Viet Cong.\" Preparing for a Senate vote just days after the uprising ended, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee said, \"For some time, it has been my feeling that the task of law enforcement agencies is really not much different from military forces; namely, to deter crime before it occurs, just as our military objective is deterrence of aggression.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nAs Elizabeth Hinton reported in \" From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime: The Making of Mass Incarceration in America ,\" the \"frontline soldiers\" in Johnson's war on crime-Vollmer-era policing all over again-spent a disproportionate amount of time patrolling Black neighborhoods and arresting Black people. Policymakers concluded from those differential arrest rates that Black people were prone to criminality, with the result that police spent even more of their time patrolling Black neighborhoods, which led to a still higher arrest rate. \"If we wish to rid this country of crime, if we wish to stop hacking at its branches only, we must cut its roots and drain its swampy breeding ground, the slum,\" Johnson told an audience of police policymakers in 1966. The next year, riots broke out in Newark and Detroit. \"We ain't rioting agains' all you whites,\" one Newark man told a reporter not long before being shot dead by police. \"We're riotin' agains' police brutality.\" In Detroit, police arrested more than seven thousand people.\n\nJohnson's Great Society essentially ended when he asked Congress to pass the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, which had the effect of diverting money from social programs to policing. This magazine called it \"a piece of demagoguery devised out of malevolence and enacted in hysteria.\" James Baldwin attributed its \"irresponsible ferocity\" to \"some pale, compelling nightmare-an overwhelming collection of private nightmares.\" The truth was darker, as the sociologist Stuart Schrader chronicled in his 2019 book, \" Badges Without Borders: How Global Counterinsurgency Transformed American Policing .\" During the Cold War, the Office of Public Safety at the U.S.A.I.D. provided assistance to the police in at least fifty-two countries, and training to officers from nearly eighty, for the purpose of counter-insurgency-the suppression of an anticipated revolution, that collection of private nightmares; as the O.P.S. reported, it contributed \"the international dimension to the Administration's War on Crime.\" Counter-insurgency boomeranged, and came back to the United States, as policing.\n\nIn 1968, Johnson's new crime bill established the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, within the Department of Justice, which, in the next decade and a half, disbursed federal funds to more than eighty thousand crime-control projects. Even funds intended for social projects-youth employment, for instance, along with other health, education, housing, and welfare programs-were distributed to police operations. With Richard Nixon, any elements of the Great Society that had survived the disastrous end of Johnson's Presidency were drastically cut, with an increased emphasis on policing, and prison-building. More Americans went to prison between 1965 and 1982 than between 1865 and 1964, Hinton reports. Under Ronald Reagan, still more social services were closed, or starved of funding until they died: mental hospitals, health centers, jobs programs, early-childhood education. By 2016, eighteen states were spending more on prisons than on colleges and universities. Activists who today call for defunding the police argue that, for decades, Americans have been defunding not only social services but, in many states, public education itself. The more frayed the social fabric, the more police have been deployed to trim the dangling threads.\n\nThe blueprint for law enforcement from Nixon to Reagan came from the Harvard political scientist James Q. Wilson between 1968, in his book \" Varieties of Police Behavior ,\" and 1982, in an essay in The Atlantic titled \"Broken Windows.\" On the one hand, Wilson believed that the police should shift from enforcing the law to maintaining order, by patrolling on foot, and doing what came to be called \"community policing.\" (Some of his recommendations were ignored: Wilson called for other professionals to handle what he termed the \"service functions\" of the police-\"first aid, rescuing cats, helping ladies, and the like\"-which is a reform people are asking for today.) On the other hand, Wilson called for police to arrest people for petty crimes, on the theory that they contributed to more serious crimes. Wilson's work informed programs like Detroit's STRESS (Stop the Robberies, Enjoy Safe Streets), begun in 1971, in which Detroit police patrolled the city undercover, in disguises that included everything from a taxi-driver to a \"radical college professor,\" and killed so many young Black men that an organization of Black police officers demanded that the unit be disbanded. The campaign to end STRESS arguably marked the very beginnings of police abolitionism. STRESS defended its methods. \"We just don't walk up and shoot somebody,\" one commander said. \"We ask him to stop. If he doesn't, we shoot.\"\n\nFor decades, the war on crime was bipartisan, and had substantial support from the Congressional Black Caucus. \"Crime is a national-defense problem,\" Joe Biden said in the Senate, in 1982. \"You're in as much jeopardy in the streets as you are from a Soviet missile.\" Biden and other Democrats in the Senate introduced legislation that resulted in the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. A decade later, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden helped draft the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, whose provisions included mandatory sentencing. In May, 1991, two months after the Rodney King beating, Biden introduced the Police Officers' Bill of Rights, which provided protections for police under investigation. The N.R.A. first endorsed a Presidential candidate, Reagan, in 1980; the Fraternal Order of Police, the nation's largest police union, first endorsed a Presidential candidate, George H. W. Bush, in 1988. In 1996, it endorsed Bill Clinton.\n\nPartly because of Biden's record of championing law enforcement, the National Association of Police Organizations endorsed the Obama-Biden ticket in 2008 and 2012. In 2014, after police in Ferguson, Missouri, shot Michael Brown, the Obama Administration established a task force on policing in the twenty-first century. Its report argued that police had become warriors when what they really should be is guardians. Most of its recommendations were never implemented.\n\nIn 2016, the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump, saying that \"our members believe he will make America safe again.\" Police unions are lining up behind Trump again this year. \"We will never abolish our police or our great Second Amendment,\" Trump said at Mt. Rushmore , on the occasion of the Fourth of July. \"We will not be intimidated by bad, evil people.\"\n\nTrump is not the king; the law is king. The police are not the king's men; they are public servants. And, no matter how desperately Trump would like to make it so, policing really isn't a partisan issue. Out of the stillness of the shutdown, the voices of protest have roared like summer thunder. An overwhelming majority of Americans, of both parties, support major reforms in American policing. And a whole lot of police, defying their unions, also support those reforms.\n\nThose changes won't address plenty of bigger crises, not least because the problem of policing can't be solved without addressing the problem of guns. But this much is clear: the polis has changed, and the police will have to change, too. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this piece misrepresented the number of Americans between the ages of fifteen and thirty-four who were treated as a result of police-inflicted injuries in emergency rooms.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

See our ethics statement.\n\nDerek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer accused of killing George Floyd, is on trial right now. But Chauvin is a major outlier in a system that very rarely imposes serious criminal charges against cops for an on-duty shooting or killing.\n\nTake shootings, for which Chauvin is not accused of, but for which we have the best data: Since 2005, 139 police officers have been arrested for murder or manslaughter due to an on-duty shooting, according to data from Philip Matthew Stinson, a criminal justice expert at Bowling Green State University who has been tracking the data for years. That amounts to fewer than nine prosecutions a year.\n\nAbout 1,000 fatal police shootings are reported each year in the US - so the arrest rate is around 1 percent, never higher than 2 percent. Some, perhaps most, shootings are justified. But the number of police officers prosecuted \"seems extremely low to me,\" Stinson told me. \"In my opinion, it's got to be that more of the fatal shootings are unjustified.\"\n\nOf those 139 officers, just 44 were convicted (with 42 cases still pending). Many of those convictions came on lesser charges: Just seven officers have been convicted of murder in police shootings since 2005, with their prison sentences ranging from 81 months to life. The remaining 37 were convicted on charges ranging from manslaughter to official misconduct, in some cases serving no prison time.\n\nVox's German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration's burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday .\n\nAfter the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014, as the Black Lives Matter movement grew more prominent, there was an uptick in prosecutions: From 2005 to 2014, about five police officers were prosecuted a year. Starting with 2015, the average is up to roughly 13 a year - meaning cops are now prosecuted in less than 2 percent of fatal shootings, up from less than 1 percent. But convictions haven't increased much yet.\n\nStill, even the cases that result in charges are a tiny fraction of fatal police shootings. \"It's very low,\" Stinson said. As for the increase in prosecution numbers: \"I don't see systemic change.\"\n\nMany social and legal factors contribute to the low rates of charges and convictions. Cops, under cultural pressure , actively protect each other, making it more difficult at virtually every step to investigate a fatal police shooting as an illegal act. Prosecutors face conflicts of interest, as they risk aggravating police departments they work closely with by pursuing charges. The public is skeptical of second-guessing police in tense situations. And the law gives police wide latitude to use force.\n\nThere's a standard process for what happens after a murder. Police gather evidence of a crime, collecting physical materials as well as rounding up and talking to witnesses. Then prosecutors use that evidence to put together a case for court. A suspect can at that point make a deal and plead guilty, or take the case to trial.\n\nFor a police shooting, things work differently. That's in part because many police shootings are justified, dealing with a suspect who was a serious threat. But there's also a confluence of social and legal forces that protect cops at every step, from investigation to prosecution to trial, even if they actually were in the wrong.\n\n\"Everything is done different\" than in a standard murder, Stinson said. \"It makes it difficult for prosecutors to figure it out and to make a rational decision, an informed decision, in terms of charging.\"\n\nFor one, cops might resist treating a police killing as a crime and refuse to gather evidence. They could follow what's known as the \"blue wall of silence,\" essentially a code between officers that they won't snitch on each other or otherwise try to get each other in trouble. The most obvious effect of this is that cops, who are often the closest witnesses to a fatal shooting, won't give a full, truthful account if it puts their colleagues in danger. Right away, that eliminates the most likely witnesses - fellow officers - to treating a police killing as a potential crime.\n\nMeanwhile, prosecutors have incentives not to push too hard. They work very closely with police departments on a day-to-day basis - it's, again, how they get a lot of evidence for charges, trials, and convictions. If prosecutors go after the police, they risk damaging that relationship and, subsequently, making their day-to-day work a lot harder.\n\nThis isn't theoretical; prosecutors have repeatedly complained about this. Following the 2017 Minneapolis police killing of Justine Damond , Hennepin County prosecutor Mike Freeman brought murder charges against the shooting officer, Mohamed Noor. Though Noor was ultimately convicted and sentenced to prison , it wasn't easy.\n\n\"A number of the officers, for reasons we do not understand ... refused to come answer questions,\" Freeman said in 2018 . \"I've been privileged to have this job nearly 18 years, I've never had police officers who weren't suspects refuse to do their duty and come forward to talk to us.\"\n\nThat's an example of a prosecutor who actually tried pursuing the case. In many cases, prosecutors will use their discretion to not bring any charges at all. That may be because they genuinely find a police killing to be justified, or it may be because they find the case too challenging or politically risky. (In much of the US, prosecutors are elected into their positions .)\n\nIf a case does make it to trial, a major challenge is persuading judges and juries, made up of members of the public, that a cop should be convicted. Based on Stinson's data for officers charged with murder or manslaughter due to an on-duty shooting, just 46 percent of police with completed cases have been convicted since 2005.\n\n\"There is a tendency to believe an officer over a civilian, in terms of credibility,\" David Rudovsky , a civil rights lawyer who co-wrote Prosecuting Misconduct: Law and Litigation , previously told Vox . \"And when an officer is on trial, reasonable doubt has a lot of bite. A prosecutor needs a very strong case before a jury will say that somebody we generally trust to protect us has so seriously crossed the line as to be subject to a conviction.\"\n\nStinson put it another way: People are \"very reluctant to second-guess the split-second, life-or-death decisions of a police officer in a potentially violent street encounter. They just won't do it.\"\n\nThen there's the actual law, which gives police wide latitude to use force. Under the legal standards set by the Supreme Court , police officers can be legally justified in using force if they merely perceive a threat, even if a threat isn't there. State laws can vary, but in general the legal question comes down to whether the officer acted reasonably - in a way other officers would in similar situations, without the benefit of hindsight - which can easily be interpreted by prosecutors, judges, or juries to allow cops to use force in situations in which they didn't really need to.\n\nThis is part of the problem that the state's attorney for Baltimore, Marilyn Mosby, ran into when she prosecuted the police officers involved in the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray . The question in trial often came down to whether the officers were acting unreasonably, which was simply too hard for Mosby to prove. Coupled with all the other problems above, Mosby found it impossible to land a conviction. As she put it , after she decided to drop the cases in 2016:\n\nAfter much thought and prayer, it has become clear that without being able to work with an independent investigatory agency from the very start, without having a say in the election of whether cases proceed in front of a judge or jury, without communal oversight of police in this community, without substantive reforms to the current criminal justice system, we could try this case 100 times just like it and we would still end up with the same result.\n\nThat was true even for officers in a police department that the US Department of Justice found to be broken at practically every level - concluding in a damning report , \"Racially disparate impact is present at every stage of BPD's enforcement actions, from the initial decision to stop individuals on Baltimore streets to searches, arrests, and uses of force.\" And it's likely even more true for police departments that aren't as systemically broken.\n\nThe result: Police officers today get away without even an arrest for murder or manslaughter in more than 98 percent of fatal shootings.\n\nFixing police accountability will require more than changing policies.\n\nAccountability for officers needs to better ingrained within police departments and prosecutors' offices. If there's no culture of accountability in these places, it's going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the legal system to do more to hold cops accountable. No one has a great answer for how, exactly, to make this happen. Some of that work has started with the recent push to elect more progressive prosecutors , but so far that hasn't led to big changes across America, and it's too early to say if it will.\n\nFrom a broader cultural perspective, the public needs to be more willing to question cops' side of the story - a shift that would ultimately not just trickle down to juries but perhaps spark more systemic changes in how police departments and prosecutors' offices function and the kinds of policies lawmakers back to hold police accountable. Again, some of that work already appears to be underway, with support for Black Lives Matter up compared to recent years , but it's too early to say if that's enough so far.\n\nPolicy changes could help, too.\n\nOne potential step is repealing \"qualified immunity,\" which shields individual officers from lawsuits. But Stinson said it has to go further: \"It would be an inconvenience for officers if they had [civil] judgments against them, but it's not a deterrent. What would deter them is seeing many other officers go to prison. That's what it takes.\"\n\nOne common idea is to put independent prosecutors in charge of investigations of police use of force. This could help mitigate any conflict of interest between prosecutors and the police departments they work closely with on a daily basis. Some cities, counties, and states already do this, but it's far from nationwide.\n\nAnother is to change the laws and rules surrounding shootings and use of force. Police departments could change their own policies, establishing clearer standards for what's reasonable or not.\n\nLocal, state, and federal lawmakers get a say here, too. Last year, for example, California lawmakers required that deadly force not be just \"objectively reasonable\" but \"necessary.\" While there are major questions about what \"necessary\" really means, experts are watching the impact of the changes over time as the new law is tested by prosecutors in court, to see if there's a real shift in police accountability.\n\nSome experts also still pin some hope on the spread of cameras. While the research on whether police-worn cameras have an impact on use of force and accountability overall is very disappointing , it's hard to shake the sense that video of police shootings has at least moved the needle on how the public perceives the police. After all, it's video of the arrest of George Floyd in Minneapolis this year that led to thousands of Black Lives Matter protests, and greater support for those protests, this summer.\n\nBut as Stinson said: \"Even when you got good video, you don't necessarily get a conviction out of it,\" such as in the Minnesota police killing of Philando Castile .\n\nBeyond police accountability, there are broader changes that could be made to otherwise reduce the number of police shootings. Better police training and policies could encourage officers to get into fewer situations in which use of force might be necessary - essentially, remove the need for a split-second decision. More could be done to rebuild trust and police-community relations , which could allow police to not be as guarded, and potentially aggressive, in day-to-day scenarios. America could tighten restrictions on guns, given that research suggests that more guns lead to more police shootings as well, perhaps because police are more likely to use lethal force in situations in which they expect a gun to be present.\n\nAs all of these problems and solutions indicate, this won't be an easy issue to solve. It requires a truly systemic shift, from America's culture around policing to how the criminal justice system functions at every level. If the US wants fewer cases that result in no justice, all of that work and effort will be necessary.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K.

One of the women, Margot Borders, wrote in a Facebook post that Hankison offered her a ride home in 2018 after she had been drinking at a bar: \"He drove me home in uniform, in his unmarked car, invited himself into my apartment and sexually assaulted me while I was unconscious.\"\n\nThe other woman, Emily Terry, wrote that Hankison pulled up next to her in his vehicle as she walked home intoxicated. He offered her a ride home, she accepted, and in the car he \"began making sexual advances towards me; rubbing my thigh, kissing my forehead, and calling me 'baby.' Mortified, I did not move,\" she wrote.\n\nA spokesperson for LMPD told the Louisville Courier-Journal that the department is aware of the social media posts and is looking into the accusations.

It's a major problem in the broader institution of policing now under scrutiny for its violent history and reliance on excessive force .\n\nA Cato Institute review of police misconduct statistics found that sexual misconduct claims accounted for the second-highest category of complaints against law enforcement officers, after use of excessive force.\n\n\"In the protests, we often see signs reading, 'Who will police the police?'\" political scientist and UCLA health services researcher Miranda Yaver told Vox. \"Given the lack of accountability [in police departments], it is sadly unsurprising that an officer accused of sexual misconduct would be able to stay on the police force, ultimately playing a role in Taylor's tragic killing.\"\n\nVarious studies show that police sexual violence is widespread and that the incidents often begin with traffic stops. One 2014 report explains \"driving while female,\" a phenomenon that describes officers who use \"the pretext of alleged traffic violations to sexually harass or abuse female drivers.\"\n\nThe same report looked at nearly 550 cases across the country of officers arrested during a three-year period and found that there were cases of forcible or statutory rape, forcible sodomy, aggravated and simple assaults, and sexual assault with an object. The typical profile of the offending officers: male, patrol or street level, between the ages of 36 and 43, in the service for less than five years, and employed in southern metros in states like Florida, Louisiana, and Hankison's home of Kentucky. Officers tended to be on-duty when they committed sexual violence, but the off-duty officers were found to have wielded their law enforcement positions to coerce victims. The victims were typically girls under the age of 18.\n\nThe study did not account for the race of the officers or victims, but Yaver told Vox that because black people are more likely to be stopped by police in the context of traffic stops, this community is more likely to be vulnerable to this form of police abuse of power.\n\nAccording to Yaver, a lack of regulation to prohibit police sexual violence perpetuates the problem. \"In 32 states, police officers can claim that sexual contact with those they are arresting is consensual, despite the clear power dynamic precluding true sexual consent,\" she told Vox. \"Absent a law that explicitly prohibits sexual contact between police officers and those in their custody, there are opportunities for people to be violated due to these abuses of power.\" Consent is not defined under Kentucky law .\n\nYaver pointed out that it wasn't until 2017 that Texas formally prohibited roadside cavity searches. Before then, someone could be \"forced to undress and submit to an invasive search in public,\" she said. The bottom line, Yaver said, is consent: \"It is impossible to truly consent to sexual contact when there is such a power imbalance at play. Even if someone says 'okay,' it may well be out of fear of consequence by law enforcement. If there is a concern about being put in jail for refusing advances, it is not consensual, and the laws need to reflect that.\"\n\nThe lack of accountability has enabled recidivist officers, who sometimes averaged four victims in three years, with many still able to hold onto their badges as they shuffled across jurisdictions, according to one study . The former NYPD detectives who admitted to raping then-18-year-old Anna Chambers while she was in their custody in 2017 were sentenced to five years of probation, no prison time.\n\nEven with what the current scholarship on police sexual misconduct reveals, we still lack a comprehensive picture. Police sexual violence is underreported, as victims fear shame and repercussions. Victims \"believe that they will receive a greater penalty if they do not comply in giving sexual favors or if they complain about an invasive search, even if without probable cause,\" Yaver said. \"With any police brutality, there's a disinclination to report violence to the very institution from which one experienced abuse in the first place.\" The majority of sexual assaults are not reported to the police .\n\nBorders, one of Hankison's accusers, wrote, \"I never reported him out of fear of retaliation. I had no proof of what happened and he had the upper hand because he was a police officer. Who do you call when the person who assaulted you is a police officer?

In a 2008 case, he was accused of \"receiving oral sex in exchange for not arresting a woman with an outstanding warrant,\" and in a 2015 case, a parolee informed her parole officer that Hankison came onto her and would forgive a ticket if she had sex with him, according to the Courier-Journal.\n\nHankison is also being sued by Kendrick Wilson, who has accused him of \"harassing suspects with unnecessary arrests and planting drugs on them,\" according to USA Today .

I was once in her shoes.\n\nWhen I was just 4 months old, my father was killed by a white police officer. To protect my innocence, my family spared me the truth until I was around Gianna's age. I'll never forget how fast my breath escaped my body when I learned what really happened. I was confused and unable to decipher what it meant that the police, the people I'd grown up thinking were here to protect me, had taken my father's life. My views of safety were shattered. Beyond that, I couldn't bring my father back. I was left with a space that would remain unfilled.\n\nAs I grew older, this emptiness became fear, avoidance, anxiety, anger, and sometimes self-pity. Today, it fuels me. My father is unable to speak for himself, so I'll speak for both of us.\n\nSteven Deaton forever changed my life when he shot and killed my father 27 years ago on April 15, 1993. Deaton, who'd been an officer with the Austin police for two and a half years, was dispatched to the scene of an alleged armed robbery with two other officers. When they arrived at Quail Run Apartments, they suspected my 23-year-old father, Paul Monroe, was involved.\n\nAccording to an incident report my family obtained from the Austin Police Department, the officers approached my father as he walked toward them. They gave him directions to drop a duffle bag. He dropped the bag. After he was told to get on the ground, Deaton shot him in the abdomen.\n\nAnother officer handcuffed my father as he lay helpless in his own blood until the ambulance came. My father asked for water, but his request was denied. When EMS arrived, they had to request he be unhandcuffed so they could treat him. He was rushed to the hospital, and after losing too much blood, he died in the ICU the next morning. The medical examiner ruled his death as a homicide. Eleven days after Deaton fatally shot my father, a Travis County grand jury decided against indicting him, claiming the shooting was justified.\n\n\"Until the moment I pulled the trigger, it was another police call,\" Deaton said in a 1993 Austin American-Statesman article about killing my father. \"It's something I'm going to have to think about for the rest of my life.\"\n\nDeaton may have been stuck with the memory, but I've had to live with the actual consequences of his actions. I've lived my whole life without my dad. Twenty-seven birthdays, countless holidays, basketball games, father-daughter dances, and graduations - that's what Deaton took from me the day he fired the bullets that claimed my father's life.\n\nI've longed to say \"Dad\" and hear a reply from my father, to know the sound of his voice, embrace him, hear him laugh, or simply just see his face. But unfortunately, all I have to rely on is my imagination and frequent reminders from my family about the amazing father he would've been if he was here.\n\nMy only way of knowing him has been through the eyes of others. His friends and family say he was highly respected in his East Austin community, taking care of youth who didn't have families. He was a funny guy and a hustler who would give the shirt off his back at the drop of a dime. His proudest accomplishment was being my father. He called me his \"star.\" Knowing this gives me endless comfort and happiness I can't explain.\n\nYet when I think about him, I always find myself drifting back to the fear he must have felt in his final moments. His last recorded words - \"you shot me, I need water, I can't see, I can't feel my legs\" - show he was scared and confused.\n\nHis life was more than tragedy and death, but for me, the most unforgettable image of my father is of him lying in a casket.\n\nI stumbled upon this photo as a teen who spent hours occupied in storage closets, fumbling my way through boxes and boxes of family scrapbooks and photo albums, reflecting on happy family memories. One day, I found an album dedicated to my father, chronicling his life from birth to death. Scattered among his memorial photos were news clips: \"Man's death brings confusion\" and \"When police officers fire, lives are changed forever.\" I remember reading and rereading Deaton's chilling words - \"The thing about the shooting, it was instinct, it was what the police academy trained you for\" - over and over again before closing the album. I didn't visit the album again until years later.\n\nBut I had always had a desire to tell my father's story - in fact, I chose to become a journalist so I could. Working for my university's independent student-run newspaper in 2014, I'd given myself an assignment to cover the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown , who was fatally shot by white police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nI was motivated by the national anger over police brutality, hopeful that the movement could spur outrage about the way my father was executed too. However, I knew that to the mainstream media, nothing was newsworthy about a Black man who was killed by a white police officer decades ago. It's hard to convince an industry that is so heavily driven by, and consumed through, a white lens of the importance of telling stories like mine outside of fires, shattered glass, and national unrest.\n\nBut five years later, in August 2019, I received a text message from my mother with a link to an article with the headline \" Texas sheriff who stars on reality show fails to publicly address sexist images posted on Facebook by one of his top officers .\" \"Isn't this the cop who killed your father?\" her text read.\n\nI sped to the next red light and frantically scrolled up and down, past the graphic images throughout the story. It was as eerie as it was gut-wrenching. The article, from the Southern Poverty Law Center, reported that Deaton had shared racist photos in a Facebook post depicting a Black football player figurine lying in a pool of blood, his knees amputated by a white Santa elf doll with a chainsaw, while an American flag dangles above them. Deaton's post, a reference to Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality against Black people, was captioned: \"And here's the start......Our Patriotic elf grew angrier all season. He finally snapped and decided to show the NFL how he goes about taking knees for not standing during our national anthem. #thankavet.\"\n\nHere was my father's killer so boldly and fearlessly expressing his discontent with protests of police brutality. And that wasn't even the only sickening post he had shared. Other photos depicted elf dolls sexually assaulting Barbies . A survivor of sexual assault who lived in the city his department serves reported she was retraumatized by his posts.\n\nAs I looked at Deaton's grin in the photo at the top of another news article , I too was blanketed by a sense of anxiety. This familiar feeling surfaces at the sight or sound of anything involving law enforcement - a repercussion of losing a loved one to police violence. It comes up during the simplest of times, while driving or even walking past a police officer in public. I tell myself: Don't speak, don't make eye contact, don't make any sudden moves. An officer might \"fear for their life,\" and I'll be next.\n\nBut I couldn't help but notice that in the coverage of the Facebook posts, there was no reporting on the fact that he'd killed my father. If my father didn't make it into the news, what other countless stories might not have been reported?\n\nLike many officers who kill and get away with it, Deaton had a thriving career after he shot my father. He stayed with Austin police for 26 years, rising to the rank of assistant chief. Despite other widely publicized inappropriate behavior and departmental violations , he was able to move to the Williamson County Sheriff's Office, where he served until he resigned after the Facebook posts .\n\nSeeing my father's killer share imagery and rhetoric that encouraged violence against Black people confirmed my belief about his lack of remorse and concern for the life he took from me 27 years ago. It confirmed my belief about his complete removal from the pain and suffering of victims of police brutality and their families. It shows what likely was in his heart the moment he fired the bullets that killed my father, and it proved what my family and I have believed all along - he murdered my father.\n\nI've fought for so long to tell my father's story. Unfortunately, there are so many others like me who never will. There are countless children who were sat down and told their father, or their mother, was killed for reasons they couldn't quite comprehend, unaware that this truth would impact them throughout their entire lives.\n\nI'm not sure I have the right words to comfort them. But I know this much: Our stories matter. Every day when we wake up and look in the mirror, we see a reflection of the parents who were taken from us.

We have always believed that explanatory journalism is vital for a functioning democracy.

But unfortunately, all I have to rely on is my imagination and frequent reminders from my family about the amazing father he would've been if he was here.\n\nMy only way of knowing him has been through the eyes of others. His friends and family say he was highly respected in his East Austin community, taking care of youth who didn't have families. He was a funny guy and a hustler who would give the shirt off his back at the drop of a dime. His proudest accomplishment was being my father. He called me his \"star.\" Knowing this gives me endless comfort and happiness I can't explain.\n\nYet when I think about him, I always find myself drifting back to the fear he must have felt in his final moments. His last recorded words - \"you shot me, I need water, I can't see, I can't feel my legs\" - show he was scared and confused.\n\nHis life was more than tragedy and death, but for me, the most unforgettable image of my father is of him lying in a casket.\n\nI stumbled upon this photo as a teen who spent hours occupied in storage closets, fumbling my way through boxes and boxes of family scrapbooks and photo albums, reflecting on happy family memories. One day, I found an album dedicated to my father, chronicling his life from birth to death. Scattered among his memorial photos were news clips: \"Man's death brings confusion\" and \"When police officers fire, lives are changed forever.\" I remember reading and rereading Deaton's chilling words - \"The thing about the shooting, it was instinct, it was what the police academy trained you for\" - over and over again before closing the album. I didn't visit the album again until years later.\n\nBut I had always had a desire to tell my father's story - in fact, I chose to become a journalist so I could. Working for my university's independent student-run newspaper in 2014, I'd given myself an assignment to cover the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown , who was fatally shot by white police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nI was motivated by the national anger over police brutality, hopeful that the movement could spur outrage about the way my father was executed too. However, I knew that to the mainstream media, nothing was newsworthy about a Black man who was killed by a white police officer decades ago. It's hard to convince an industry that is so heavily driven by, and consumed through, a white lens of the importance of telling stories like mine outside of fires, shattered glass, and national unrest.\n\nBut five years later, in August 2019, I received a text message from my mother with a link to an article with the headline \" Texas sheriff who stars on reality show fails to publicly address sexist images posted on Facebook by one of his top officers .\" \"Isn't this the cop who killed your father?\" her text read.\n\nI sped to the next red light and frantically scrolled up and down, past the graphic images throughout the story. It was as eerie as it was gut-wrenching. The article, from the Southern Poverty Law Center, reported that Deaton had shared racist photos in a Facebook post depicting a Black football player figurine lying in a pool of blood, his knees amputated by a white Santa elf doll with a chainsaw, while an American flag dangles above them. Deaton's post, a reference to Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality against Black people, was captioned: \"And here's the start......Our Patriotic elf grew angrier all season. He finally snapped and decided to show the NFL how he goes about taking knees for not standing during our national anthem. #thankavet.\"\n\nHere was my father's killer so boldly and fearlessly expressing his discontent with protests of police brutality. And that wasn't even the only sickening post he had shared. Other photos depicted elf dolls sexually assaulting Barbies . A survivor of sexual assault who lived in the city his department serves reported she was retraumatized by his posts.\n\nAs I looked at Deaton's grin in the photo at the top of another news article , I too was blanketed by a sense of anxiety. This familiar feeling surfaces at the sight or sound of anything involving law enforcement - a repercussion of losing a loved one to police violence. It comes up during the simplest of times, while driving or even walking past a police officer in public. I tell myself: Don't speak, don't make eye contact, don't make any sudden moves. An officer might \"fear for their life,\" and I'll be next.\n\nBut I couldn't help but notice that in the coverage of the Facebook posts, there was no reporting on the fact that he'd killed my father. If my father didn't make it into the news, what other countless stories might not have been reported?\n\nLike many officers who kill and get away with it, Deaton had a thriving career after he shot my father. He stayed with Austin police for 26 years, rising to the rank of assistant chief. Despite other widely publicized inappropriate behavior and departmental violations , he was able to move to the Williamson County Sheriff's Office, where he served until he resigned after the Facebook posts .\n\nSeeing my father's killer share imagery and rhetoric that encouraged violence against Black people confirmed my belief about his lack of remorse and concern for the life he took from me 27 years ago. It confirmed my belief about his complete removal from the pain and suffering of victims of police brutality and their families. It shows what likely was in his heart the moment he fired the bullets that killed my father, and it proved what my family and I have believed all along - he murdered my father.\n\nI've fought for so long to tell my father's story. Unfortunately, there are so many others like me who never will. There are countless children who were sat down and told their father, or their mother, was killed for reasons they couldn't quite comprehend, unaware that this truth would impact them throughout their entire lives.\n\nI'm not sure I have the right words to comfort them. But I know this much: Our stories matter. Every day when we wake up and look in the mirror, we see a reflection of the parents who were taken from us. We are their legacies.\n\nMontinique Monroe is a photojournalist in Austin, Texas.\n\nWill you become our 20,000th supporter?

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIt all happened in a group foster home.\n\nby Alexia Fernández Campbell\n\nThere was screaming, cursing, and a head slammed against the wall. A public defender called it \"egregious.\" Another called it \"horrific.\"\n\nIn a video that aired Thursday on Tucson's KOLD news station, a white sheriff's deputy is seen tackling and wrestling a black teen in foster care. The teen - an amputee with no arms or legs - repeatedly screams at the police officer to get off of him.\n\nThe sheriff's deputy holds the boy in a headlock on the ground and curses in his face before arresting him for disorderly conduct. The deputy then screams at the teenager who was recording the scene, handcuffs him, and slams his head against the wall.\n\nIt was an extraordinary amount of violence against two defenseless youths - all in the span of eight minutes. The incident happened in September, but KOLD didn't get a hold of the footage until this week.\n\nAccording to KOLD, the Pima County sheriff's deputy was responding to a call at a Tucson group home about a disruptive teenager. Yet his angry and violent response was striking, especially because the teens seemed to be behaving like, well, teenagers.\n\nThe sheriff's office told KOLD that it is investigating the officer's conduct, and state prosecutors have since dropped charges against the two youths. The incident is all too similar to other videos that have gone viral, showing police officers use excessive force against black men. But there was something particularly disturbing about watching a deputy mistreat such vulnerable children. As if they hadn't been through enough.\n\nOne of the most remarkable things about the latest incident was where it happened: in a group home for boys in foster care. These residential facilities are supposed to be safe places for some of country's most troubled youths.\n\nMore than 23,000 children in the foster care system live in group homes like the one in Tucson. And they are far more likely to have experienced multiple forms of trauma in their short lives, according to research by the Casey Family Programs . For example, 55 percent have been physically abused, 40 percent have been sexually abused, 68 percent have been emotionally abused, and 62 percent have suffered a traumatic loss. A majority have mental health problems or physical disabilities.\n\nFew details about the Tucson teenager have been released to protect his privacy, but KOLD said he was in a group home because he was abandoned by his parents. Little is also known about the group home where the incident took place, and there is no reason to believe there was abuse or neglect by caregivers.\n\nHowever, reports of abuse and neglect of children in group homes are common. In Illinois, for example, a 2016 investigation by the Chicago Tribune described state taxpayer-funded group homes as \"a system where caregivers often failed to provide basic care while regulators cloaked harm and death with secrecy and silence.\"\n\nThe newspaper uncovered 1,311 cases of documented injuries, hundreds of which were not reported by the Illinois Department of Human Services. Residents were often deprived of food, forced to wear dirty clothing and restrained with duct tape.\n\nThe investigation prompted Congress to request and audit of group homes by the US Department of Health and Human Services. In 2018, the agency released its report , which found that children in these settings \"often experienced serious injuries and medical conditions that resulted in emergency room visits.\" The audits also revealed that 99 percent of those critical injuries were not reported to the appropriate law enforcement or state agencies, as required by law.\n\nFoster children who live in residential facilities are already traumatized and at high-risk of abuse. These are children that need police protection, not mistreatment. Black young people, in particular, are already overexposed to police violence.\n\nChildren of color, like the two teens in Tucson, often have traumatizing encounters with police officers from a young age.\n\nIn recent years, a number of media stories have called attention to the ways that black children in particular are exposed to police violence , whether they are directly confronted by police, live in communities where police violence has occurred, or witness excessive force from law enforcement.\n\nAnd research has shown that adults often see both black boys and girls as older, more deserving of suspicion , and less innocent than white children . This suggests that when it comes to policing incidents where black children are present, authority figures may not see these children as bystanders needing protection. In some cases, black children may instead be seen as suspects themselves, and are denied the presumption of innocence given to other children.\n\nWitnessing police violence also affects their ability to trust officers and very likely shifts how they perceive themselves in many cases.\n\nIn April, a Florida sheriff's deputy was been placed on restricted duty after a video showing him slamming a black teenager's head into the ground and punching him went viral, fueling calls for the officer to be fired. Deputy Christopher Krickovich and another officer had approached a large group of high school students in a shopping center in Tamarac, and one of the boys was arrested for trespassing, according to a report submitted by the officers . Video footage taken by students at the scene shows the boy in handcuffs and a nearby officer push another boy back. As the boy moves, he is pepper-sprayed in the face. When the teen begins to walk away, the officer pulls him to the ground.\n\nThis kind of police aggression is all too similar to the deputy's response in Tucson. Viral videos like these have done a lot to raise public awareness of the violence that black boys and men deal with on a regular basis. It's just not enough to stop it from happening again.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nApparently, we can't even trust these justices to follow their own very recent precedents.\n\nThe Court decided an identical case two years ago. But every voting rights case that reaches this Court is dangerous.\n\nAn expert on Black voting explains what's really happening with Black support for Donald Trump.\n\nThe acclaimed writer takes on another intractable problem.\n\nThe US has often singled out Haitian immigrants. GOP attacks are the latest example.\n\nPreliminary data shows a negative impact on Black enrollment at some universities.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC. All Rights Reserved"

He worked in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Jordan; met with kings and presidents; rose through the ranks. But he came to believe he was part of the problem, that the very premise of the work was flawed. So he came home, and joined the police force in Savannah, Georgia, where he grew up.\n\nI first learned about Skinner in a New Yorker profile . Then a friend mentioned his Twitter feed to me: There, Skinner reflects, in a thoughtful, continual stream, on the work of policing, the importance of treating your neighbors like neighbors, the daily work of deescalation, and the behavior of his menagerie of pets.\n\nSkinner has been particularly outspoken in the aftermath of George Floyd's death. \"We have to change our profession,\" he wrote. \"We aren't warriors. We aren't at war with our neighbors.\"\n\nI spoke with Skinner by phone on Sunday. He emphasized that his views are his own, and he wasn't speaking on behalf of his department or all police. But what he has to say is, I think, important. A transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.\n\nWhat did you see when you watched the video of George Floyd's death?\n\nA murder. No semantics. No justification. They just killed that guy. I drove home and in a six-minute commute, I was in tears. And it was that I saw the other cops in the video. One of them even looked like me. They were stopping the bystanders, telling them to get back. It's not just that this cop did this. The other cops stopped anyone from stopping him.\n\nWhat should they have done?\n\nThey should have arrested the cop! Ideally, you'd just push the cop off. Tell him to knock it off. That would've ended it. When people have handcuffs on, they are legally in your custody. You have to care for them. What happens to them is your fault. If someone is kicking the windows out of the car, which I've had done, you need to take them out of the car. You need to do something. But this wasn't that. And even if there had been, there was no justification. He just sat on his back. Floyd said he was dying, and he died.\n\nIf a police officer sees another police officer doing that, they are bound to stop him. I could see that cop, who was younger than me, he keeps looking back at what's happening. The people in the community are yelling. They're saying, \"You're killing him.\" You can see this cop - I want to be charitable, he was torn, but he wasn't torn enough to act. The crime had switched from counterfeit [Floyd was suspected of trying to pass a fake $20 bill] to an assault. And the assaulter was the cop. There is nothing to say to justify it. Nothing.\n\nOver the past couple of nights, as you've seen the collisions between police and protesters, what has that looked like to you?\n\nIt looks like what we designed. I'm a big believer that the police shouldn't act like the military. We shouldn't dress like the military. We shouldn't have military weapons. When you can't tell the difference between the police and the National Guard, that's a big problem. But police have been militarized. This is the result of that. And I'm sympathetic to the police. When a protest tips into a riot, when you have thousands of people who're screaming, and it's a visceral, pulsing thing, it's terrifying. But the whole point is you can defuse it. And the time for deescalation is years ahead of that. And a lot of places aren't doing that.\n\nSo the police are now in a terrible position. Ninety-nine percent of the people are protesting. And it's a protest, not a parade. For anything to change, there has to be annoyance and conflict. I get that. But the people who are throwing rocks and bricks and setting fires, that's a big deal. And then the focus will quickly be on how to handle people setting fires. It's sad. It's already happening. We're already talking about the response to the riots, not the cause of the protests.\n\nYou did counterinsurgency work overseas for a decade, as part of the CIA. How much of that thinking do you see here? How much are American communities treated like an internal insurgency that needs to be restrained?\n\nI see it 100 percent. It's the same thing. I got more hazard pay over there, I guess. We spent so much money to do so much damage. We kept saying we needed the community on our side, but everything we did made sure we wouldn't get the community on our side. We put all our efforts and money into whoever supported us. We go for the leader or alleged leader who agrees with us most. We're trying to say we're in a war zone, but they should like us. The answer overseas was to leave. If you don't want to be seen as an occupying army, don't occupy the country. But we live here. We can't leave.\n\nYou write often about policing with \"neighbor\" mindset and training others to do the same. What is neighbor mindset?\n\nIt's the exact opposite. I don't think of it as a mindset; I just think of it as a truth. The neighbor mindset sounds so cheesy, but it's so powerful: We all matter or none of us do. I live here. I can't know everybody in Savannah. But I call everyone my neighbor, because they literally are. And I can't put my knee on the neck of my neighbor. He might resist arrest. I get that. But you don't sit for eight minutes with your knee on the neck of your neighbor.\n\nI do a lot of recruit training and I say: This is not semantics. If they're your neighbors, you can't treat them this way. There's going to be a task force and recommendations, and they'll sound really good. But a friend told me once: Grand gestures are for assholes. You need to do the right thing every day. You need the kind of connection built off a thousand days of not being an asshole. That's what buys you time.\n\nBut this is not a training issue. People want it so badly to be an issue of training. Training is part of it. We train for our goals. Our goal is a war on crime. And we're getting a war. I saw the war on terror; it was horrible. Now I see the war on crime, and it's just as bad.\n\nA lot of the war-on-crime mindset and all of the worst instances of police violence are justified by fear: fear that police have that they'll be shot on a stop, that they need to act like soldiers because they are in a war even if the rest of us aren't. How do you think about that?\n\nLast year, my sergeant was murdered on the job. There is no lesson to be learned from that. What happened was a bad guy jumped out of the car and shot him in the stomach. But the lesson isn't to approach everyone with a gun out.\n\nI'm a training officer now. I always ask: If you didn't have a badge and a gun, how would you handle that situation? Because I guarantee you, if you walk into that situation with your gun and badge out, you'll use them. People kill cops, they do. But we are teaching ourselves to be afraid. In my experience, the closer I get to people, the safer I am. I reject the idea that everyone wants to kill us. And if I get killed, I'll be able to say, at least I didn't handle 99.9 percent of calls wrong.\n\nI've seen you talk about \"intentionality\" as a key to good policing. What intentions do you bring to a stop?\n\nOur job is not to bring more drama into the situation. We speed to an uncertainty and jump out and act with certainty; it's crazy. If someone is shooting at me, that's easy, I take cover. But when we get into these environments where people are screaming, we just need to slow down. The information in 911 calls is almost always wrong. And I hate when people say there's no time to think. We're the ones rushing into it. We're amped up on adrenaline. We show up and immediately [start] telling people to do stuff. I find it very beneficial to just ask, \"What's going on?\"\n\nYou wrote on Twitter that \"The time for de-escalation is long before the riot ... My job is to work with my neighbors every single day to reduce the fuel/dry tinder that catches fire from a spark.\" How do you do that?\n\nI remember I saw a bunch of people in a car. It was three other people. They saw me and really quickly put on their seatbelts. So I started laughing and made a big show of putting on my seatbelt. And we all giggled and no one got a ticket. You can't treat people like an ATM machine, and that's what other departments have done. They fine them for everything. But we have no idea, a lot of the time, what's going on. And unless you're shooting at me, I can take some time to figure it out.\n\nYou said earlier you're not optimistic a task force will change any of this. So how does it change? What needs to happen?\n\nPeople need to imagine the end of a war. That's what they need to accept. Our training is spot on: We're in a war on crime, and it's us versus them, and our neighbors are sheep we need to protect. You hear the term civilians. I thought we were all civilians! Our training fits the mindset.\n\nThe question we need to ask is: What's the point? What do we want to see happen? It's about what we expect the police to do. If I was commissioner of all police on the planet, I'd say there's a ceasefire in the war on crime. We're going to work for the 99 percent of people instead of against the 1 percent. Most 911 calls I go to are not crimes. They may become crimes, but our job is to stop it. We're taught that it's a war. It's not. But it's becoming a war.\n\nWe are the action arm for a fucked-up national mindset. This doesn't exist in isolation. America has the police force that it votes for, that it funds. This system is what we set up. We spent a lot of money and a lot of time over hundreds of years to have this police force. We are trained for what we're hired for, and what we're hired for is war.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

If they're your neighbors, you can't treat them this way. There's going to be a task force and recommendations, and they'll sound really good. But a friend told me once: Grand gestures are for assholes. You need to do the right thing every day. You need the kind of connection built off a thousand days of not being an asshole. That's what buys you time.\n\nBut this is not a training issue. People want it so badly to be an issue of training. Training is part of it. We train for our goals. Our goal is a war on crime. And we're getting a war. I saw the war on terror; it was horrible. Now I see the war on crime, and it's just as bad.\n\nA lot of the war-on-crime mindset and all of the worst instances of police violence are justified by fear: fear that police have that they'll be shot on a stop, that they need to act like soldiers because they are in a war even if the rest of us aren't. How do you think about that?\n\nLast year, my sergeant was murdered on the job. There is no lesson to be learned from that. What happened was a bad guy jumped out of the car and shot him in the stomach. But the lesson isn't to approach everyone with a gun out.\n\nI'm a training officer now. I always ask: If you didn't have a badge and a gun, how would you handle that situation? Because I guarantee you, if you walk into that situation with your gun and badge out, you'll use them. People kill cops, they do. But we are teaching ourselves to be afraid. In my experience, the closer I get to people, the safer I am. I reject the idea that everyone wants to kill us. And if I get killed, I'll be able to say, at least I didn't handle 99.9 percent of calls wrong.\n\nI've seen you talk about \"intentionality\" as a key to good policing. What intentions do you bring to a stop?\n\nOur job is not to bring more drama into the situation. We speed to an uncertainty and jump out and act with certainty; it's crazy. If someone is shooting at me, that's easy, I take cover. But when we get into these environments where people are screaming, we just need to slow down. The information in 911 calls is almost always wrong. And I hate when people say there's no time to think. We're the ones rushing into it. We're amped up on adrenaline. We show up and immediately [start] telling people to do stuff. I find it very beneficial to just ask, \"What's going on?\"\n\nYou wrote on Twitter that \"The time for de-escalation is long before the riot ... My job is to work with my neighbors every single day to reduce the fuel/dry tinder that catches fire from a spark.\" How do you do that?\n\nI remember I saw a bunch of people in a car. It was three other people. They saw me and really quickly put on their seatbelts. So I started laughing and made a big show of putting on my seatbelt. And we all giggled and no one got a ticket. You can't treat people like an ATM machine, and that's what other departments have done. They fine them for everything. But we have no idea, a lot of the time, what's going on. And unless you're shooting at me, I can take some time to figure it out.\n\nYou said earlier you're not optimistic a task force will change any of this. So how does it change? What needs to happen?\n\nPeople need to imagine the end of a war. That's what they need to accept. Our training is spot on: We're in a war on crime, and it's us versus them, and our neighbors are sheep we need to protect. You hear the term civilians. I thought we were all civilians! Our training fits the mindset.\n\nThe question we need to ask is: What's the point? What do we want to see happen? It's about what we expect the police to do. If I was commissioner of all police on the planet, I'd say there's a ceasefire in the war on crime. We're going to work for the 99 percent of people instead of against the 1 percent. Most 911 calls I go to are not crimes. They may become crimes, but our job is to stop it. We're taught that it's a war. It's not. But it's becoming a war.\n\nWe are the action arm for a fucked-up national mindset. This doesn't exist in isolation. America has the police force that it votes for, that it funds. This system is what we set up. We spent a lot of money and a lot of time over hundreds of years to have this police force. We are trained for what we're hired for, and what we're hired for is war.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Caron Nazario's lawsuit shows policing's systemic racial issues can't just be boiled down to a few bad apples.\n\nby Gregory Svirnovskiy\n\nA violent, threat-filled traffic stop of a Black and Latinx Army officer, 2nd Lt. Caron Nazario, has drawn new attention to the scope of police misconduct as the world watches the trial of Derek Chauvin , the former police officer who killed George Floyd.\n\nThe incident, which took place in in Windsor, Virginia, in December 2020, has come under new scrutiny following the release of body camera footage , and after Nazario filed a lawsuit in early April against the officers who made the stop. Saturday, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam announced an investigation into what he called a \"disturbing\" incident.\n\nNazario has said he was driving through eastern Virginia when he saw flashing police lights behind him. He did not stop immediately, but turned his hazard lights on and proceeded slowly to a well-lit gas station. His decision to do so - as well as the tinted windows and temporary license plate on his new SUV - apparently caused officers to decide they were about to conduct a \"high-risk traffic stop.\"\n\nVox's German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration's burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday .\n\nGiven this perceived risk level, officer Daniel Crocker stepped out of his police vehicle and immediately pointed his gun at Nazario's car, shouting at the lieutenant to \"get out of the car now.\"\n\n\"What's going on?\" Nazario asked . \"I'm honestly afraid to get out.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you should be, get out now!\" another officer, Joe Gutierrez, can be heard saying immediately after.\n\nDespite Nazario's questions, the officers didn't tell Nazario why he was being pulled over: It was because they couldn't see a license plate on his vehicle. The car was new; a temporary cardboard license plate had been taped to Nazario's rear window.\n\nInstead, they attempted to forcibly open Nazario's door, even as Nazario maintained he did not have to exit his vehicle for a traffic violation. Gutierrez then pepper-sprayed Nazario four times, yelling at him to get out of the car as Nazario asked for help unbuckling his seatbelt. Once he was able to unbuckle himself, the lieutenant was forcibly pushed onto the ground.\n\n\"Can you please talk to me about what's going on?\" Nazario asked. \"Why am I being treated like this, why?\"\n\n\"Cause you're not cooperating! Get on the ground! Lie down or you're gonna get tased,\" one of the officers can be heard saying; at one point, Gutierrez can be heard saying, \"You're fixin' to ride the lightning, son.\"\n\nUltimately, Nazario was not arrested; as paramedics arrived on the scene to treat Nazario for the pepper spray, Gutierrez said he'd spoken to the police chief, and the department planned to release the lieutenant without any charges.\n\n\"There's no need getting this on your record,\" Gutierrez is heard saying in the bodycam footage. \"I don't want this on your record. However, it's entirely up to you. If you want to fight it and argue ... if that's what you want, we'll charge you,\" Gutierrez said.\n\nThe offer, Nazario's lawsuit alleges, was an attempted quid pro quo. The lieutenant claims he was told if he didn't \"chill and let this go,\" officers would ensure his military record would be damaged. Nazario responded by telling the officers he would let his superiors know what happened.\n\nGutierrez said in the footage that would be understandable given \"the climate we're in, with the media spewing with the race relations against minorities,\" but that any legal action by Nazario \"doesn't change my life one way or the other.\"\n\nUltimately, the incident did change his life; he was fired following an investigation into the incident by the Windsor Police Department . His firing, however, raised the question of whether there are a few \"bad apples\" in policing, or if behavior like that he and Crocker displayed in December is part of a larger problem with policing.\n\nGutierrez's firing came because his department found that \"Windsor Police Department policy was not followed\" during the traffic stop.\n\n\"The Town of Windsor prides itself in its small-town charm and the community-wide respect of its Police Department,\" the department said in a Sunday press release . \"Due to this, we are saddened for events like this to cast our community in a negative light. Rather than deflect criticism, we have addressed these matters with our personnel administratively, we are reaching out to community stakeholders to engage in dialogue, and commit ourselves to additional discussions in the future.\"\n\nThe statement was markedly similar to a statement made by Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo about his former officer Derek Chauvin's behavior the day George Floyd died. Testifying during Chauvin's murder and manslaughter trial, Arradondo, and other law enforcement officials, were particularly impassioned in distancing his police department from Chauvin's actions.\n\n\"That in no way, shape, or form is anything that is by policy,\" he said on the stand. \"It is not part of our training. It is certainly not part of our ethics or our values.\"\n\nAs Vox's Fabiola Cineas writes, statements such as these are part of an effort by police to avoid greater scrutiny into their practices:\n\nWhile the officers' testimony can be interpreted as a changing tide in an opaque culture, it's likelier that the high-profile nature of the trial is forcing them to cast Chauvin as the bad apple - the one officer who doesn't represent the broader department and system of policing, the one they need to throw out - as a way to avoid greater examination of police.\n\nBut when excessive force by police is observed everywhere, not just in Minneapolis, or in St. Louis , in Louisville or Rochester - but in Windsor, Virginia, a town some 50 miles west of Virginia Beach and home to just under 3,000 people, it only adds to the narrative that racist police violence is systemic. The steps taken by the Windsor Police Department are similar to all those testimonies by Minneapolis officers. An immediate distancing from Gutierrez, an admonition. Things like that don't happen here.\n\nThe breadth of prominent incidents of bad policing makes it clear that there is something wrong throughout the US, and research has shown there is a national problem with traffic stops as well. The Stanford Open Policing Project found, after analyzing almost 100 million traffic stops in the US, that Black drivers are about 20 percent more likely to be pulled over by police for traffic violations. And once that happens, Black drivers are 1.5 to 2 times more likely to be searched than white drivers, even though white drivers are statistically more likely to have drugs, guns, or other contraband in their cars, according to the decade-long study , conducted by researchers at Stanford and New York University.\n\nAnd there are a number of bad outcomes for Black drivers at traffic stops that highlight exactly why Nazario told the officers he was \"honestly afraid to get out,\" from the arrest of Sandra Bland to the death of Philando Castile , to a more recent example.\n\nSunday, Daunte Wright , a 20-year-old Black man, was killed near Minneapolis during a traffic stop by a police officer who mistook her taser for a gun after he stepped back into his vehicle following a brief struggle.\n\nNazario was not killed, but incidents like these show why he may have had reason to fear he might be.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nMichael Rosfeld was new to the East Pittsburgh Police Department. A lawsuit suggests he shouldn't have been hired.\n\nby P.R. Lockhart\n\nEast Pittsburgh police officer Michael Rosfeld's past conduct has received intense scrutiny after he was charged with the shooting of 17-year-old Antwon Rose in June. Now, two men are accusing Rosfeld of \"willful police misconduct\" while on duty in a previous job, questioning how the officer \"was able to still be a cop.\"\n\nTimothy Riley and Jacob Schilling filed a lawsuit against Rosfeld on Monday, alleging that the officer violated their civil rights and detained them without cause last December after an incident at a bar. The lawsuit, which stems from Rosfeld's time as a police officer with the University of Pittsburgh, also argues that he had a \"financial, personal, and or business relationship\" with the bar's owner and that he fabricated a police complaint recounting the incident.\n\nThe suit, filed in the Allegheny County Common Pleas Court , alleges that the discrepancies in Rosfeld's account of the incident and footage captured by a surveillance camera led to the officer being suspended and later fired by the university police department earlier this year.\n\nRiley and Schilling's suit was filed days after Rosfeld was charged with criminal homicide in the shooting death of Rose, who was unarmed and fleeing from a car when he was shot from behind. Rosfeld had been on the job for a few weeks and was officially sworn in as a police officer just hours before Rose's death. In initial reports , Rosfeld said that the teen had turned toward him while holding \"something dark that he perceived as a gun.\" He later said he did not see Rose holding a gun. The shooting has led to days of protes t in the area.\n\nThe lawsuit against Rosfeld, and the questions it raises about his record as an officer, points to an issue in other police shootings. In several instances, officers have been accused of misconduct or excessive force prior to a fatal shooting, leading critics to argue that they should have been removed from their positions well before a shooting occurred.\n\nThe new lawsuit against Rosfeld dates back to a December 9, 2017, incident at a campus bar called the Garage Door Saloon. At that point Rosfeld had been an officer with the University of Pittsburgh Police Department for more than five years.\n\nThat night, Riley and Schilling, along with two others, were at the bar celebrating a birthday when the owner \"forcefully removed\" the four men, according to the lawsuit. The men then approached a nearby officer for assistance. Rosfeld also responded to the incident.\n\nWhen Rosfeld arrived, the lawsuit alleges, he immediately used force against three of the men and arrested them. In his reports of the incident, Rosfeld largely recounted the incident from the bar owner's perspective, saying that the men had picked a fight with another person at the bar, prompting their removal. The report also said that one of the men broke a glass door and assaulted an employee. The men denied these claims, arguing that surveillance footage showed otherwise. But Rosfeld - claiming that he watched the footage - said that the video backed the owner's account. The three arrested men then spent the night in jail.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit , the Allegheny County DA's Office dismissed the charges against the men after concluding that surveillance footage \"did not support\" and \"contradicted\" Rosfeld's reports.\n\nRosfeld left the University of Pittsburgh Police Department about a month after the incident; the suit argues that this was the result of him being fired. (The University of Pittsburgh has declined to comment on the matter, telling reporters that it does not comment on pending litigation.) He joined the East Pittsburgh police roughly four months later, and Rose's shooting occurred a few weeks after that.\n\nLee Merritt, an attorney representing Rose's family, argues Rosfeld should not have been hired by the East Pittsburgh Police Department in May of this year because of the December incident.\n\nMerritt said he became aware of the allegations in the new lawsuit while looking into the officer's background, Mother Jones reports . In June, Merritt told the New York Times that he believed Rosfeld's employment history would \"reveal significant history of abuse of authority.\"\n\n\"It makes me sick that he was able to still be a cop after how they treated us,\" Riley, one of the plaintiffs in the civil suit, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette .\n\nThis isn't the first time that an officer's prior behavior has raised questions about their continued employment in law enforcement. Police department policies and the ability for officers to move to other departments can exacerbate the issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nMichael Rosfeld was new to the East Pittsburgh Police Department. A lawsuit suggests he shouldn't have been hired.\n\nby P.R. Lockhart\n\nEast Pittsburgh police officer Michael Rosfeld's past conduct has received intense scrutiny after he was charged with the shooting of 17-year-old Antwon Rose in June. Now, two men are accusing Rosfeld of \"willful police misconduct\" while on duty in a previous job, questioning how the officer \"was able to still be a cop.\"\n\nTimothy Riley and Jacob Schilling filed a lawsuit against Rosfeld on Monday, alleging that the officer violated their civil rights and detained them without cause last December after an incident at a bar. The lawsuit, which stems from Rosfeld's time as a police officer with the University of Pittsburgh, also argues that he had a \"financial, personal, and or business relationship\" with the bar's owner and that he fabricated a police complaint recounting the incident.\n\nThe suit, filed in the Allegheny County Common Pleas Court , alleges that the discrepancies in Rosfeld's account of the incident and footage captured by a surveillance camera led to the officer being suspended and later fired by the university police department earlier this year.\n\nRiley and Schilling's suit was filed days after Rosfeld was charged with criminal homicide in the shooting death of Rose, who was unarmed and fleeing from a car when he was shot from behind. Rosfeld had been on the job for a few weeks and was officially sworn in as a police officer just hours before Rose's death. In initial reports , Rosfeld said that the teen had turned toward him while holding \"something dark that he perceived as a gun.\" He later said he did not see Rose holding a gun. The shooting has led to days of protes t in the area.\n\nThe lawsuit against Rosfeld, and the questions it raises about his record as an officer, points to an issue in other police shootings. In several instances, officers have been accused of misconduct or excessive force prior to a fatal shooting, leading critics to argue that they should have been removed from their positions well before a shooting occurred.\n\nThe new lawsuit against Rosfeld dates back to a December 9, 2017, incident at a campus bar called the Garage Door Saloon. At that point Rosfeld had been an officer with the University of Pittsburgh Police Department for more than five years.\n\nThat night, Riley and Schilling, along with two others, were at the bar celebrating a birthday when the owner \"forcefully removed\" the four men, according to the lawsuit. The men then approached a nearby officer for assistance. Rosfeld also responded to the incident.\n\nWhen Rosfeld arrived, the lawsuit alleges, he immediately used force against three of the men and arrested them. In his reports of the incident, Rosfeld largely recounted the incident from the bar owner's perspective, saying that the men had picked a fight with another person at the bar, prompting their removal. The report also said that one of the men broke a glass door and assaulted an employee. The men denied these claims, arguing that surveillance footage showed otherwise. But Rosfeld - claiming that he watched the footage - said that the video backed the owner's account. The three arrested men then spent the night in jail.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit , the Allegheny County DA's Office dismissed the charges against the men after concluding that surveillance footage \"did not support\" and \"contradicted\" Rosfeld's reports.\n\nRosfeld left the University of Pittsburgh Police Department about a month after the incident; the suit argues that this was the result of him being fired. (The University of Pittsburgh has declined to comment on the matter, telling reporters that it does not comment on pending litigation.) He joined the East Pittsburgh police roughly four months later, and Rose's shooting occurred a few weeks after that.\n\nLee Merritt, an attorney representing Rose's family, argues Rosfeld should not have been hired by the East Pittsburgh Police Department in May of this year because of the December incident.\n\nMerritt said he became aware of the allegations in the new lawsuit while looking into the officer's background, Mother Jones reports . In June, Merritt told the New York Times that he believed Rosfeld's employment history would \"reveal significant history of abuse of authority.\"\n\n\"It makes me sick that he was able to still be a cop after how they treated us,\" Riley, one of the plaintiffs in the civil suit, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette .\n\nThis isn't the first time that an officer's prior behavior has raised questions about their continued employment in law enforcement. Police department policies and the ability for officers to move to other departments can exacerbate the issue. A 2017 investigation from the Washington Post noted that many officers fired for misconduct are later reinstated by their agencies , often because police leadership didn't following protocol when terminating them. And officers who leave their departments after major scandals are often rehired by different departments.\n\nIn Rosfeld's case, others may soon come forward with allegations. According to Robert N. Peirce, the attorney representing Riley and Schilling, \"more than five\" people have come forward with misconduct claims against the officer.

That warrant was one of 20 that were served across Yuba, Sutter, Tehama and Butte counties on Wednesday as part of a years-long investigation into a transnational drug trafficking operation, Yuba County District Attorney Clint Curry said in a press conference .\n\nYuba County Sheriff Wendell Anderson said gunfire was exchanged upon entering the home during the operation on Kestral Court.\n\nOne of the members of the SWAT team was wounded and later died at Adventist Health and Rideout in Marysville. He has since been identified as Officer Osmar Rodarte, 27.\n\nMarysville Police Chief Christian Sachs said Rodarte was a U.S. Army veteran and a two-year veteran of the Marysville Police Department.\n\nThe sheriff's office said the suspect was shot in the exchange of gunfire. The Yuba County Sheriff's Office has since identified him as 61-year-old Rick David Oliver of Olivehurst. He was declared dead inside his residence.\n\nOne other person was detained at the scene and taken into questioning, but that person has been released, Anderson said.\n\nThe Yuba County Sheriff's Office said there is no ongoing threat to the public.\n\nThe identification of the suspect has not been released. Authorities said they should be able to release more information on Thursday.\n\n\"Our hearts and our prayers are with this young officer's family and our local law enforcement family,\" California Assemblymember James Gallagher said in a post on X.\n\nThe Yuba-Sutter Officer-Involved Shooting team will be conducting the investigation on Kestrel Court. Curry said he would release more information regarding the transnational drug trafficking investigation later in the week.\n\nThe Marysville Police Department said a process will be held at 9:30 a.m. Thursday from the Lakeside Chapel at 830 D St. to Placer County. The community is invited to line the sidewalks and pay their respects.\n\n\"Our department is hurting, and our community is mourning the loss of a dedicated officer who served with honor, integrity, and unwavering commitment to protecting the people of Marysville,\" Marysville police said in a statement. \"Officer Rodarte was more than a colleague. He was a friend, a father, an army veteran and a true hero.\"\n\nThe Sacramento Police Department shared on social media that Rodarte was a graduate of its police academy.\n\nThis marks the first Marysville police officer to die in the line of duty in more than 100 years.\n\n© 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

The officer was seriously injured and was taken to Northwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital for treatment.\n\nGeneva police notified neighboring police departments of the fleeing vehicle, and Aurora police later spotted a car matching the license plate and description of the Geneva incident driving south on Lake Street near Galena Boulevard around 1:40 a.m.\n\nAurora police said officers tried to stop the car, but the driver refused, resulting in a chase, which continued onto northbound Route 25 until police were able to deploy stop sticks as it approached the Ashland Avenue exit.\n\nWhen officers tried to speak to the driver after the vehicle came to a stop, police said the driver pulled out a gun and two Aurora officers opened fire.\n\nThe driver was struck and police rendered first aid until he could be taken to Rush Copley Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. The Kane County Coroner's Office identified the man as 19-year-old Christopher Lepe, of Aurora.\n\nAurora Police Chief Keith Cross said a weapon was recovered at the scene.\n\nAn investigation into the police shooting by the Kane County Major Crimes Task Force is ongoing. Both officers have been put on administrative leave during the investigation.\n\nKane County State's Attorney Jamie Mosser said her office will review the findings of that investigation to determine if the officers should face any criminal charges. She said the process could take several months.\n\nMosser said body camera footage of the shooting will not be released at least until after the officers involved are questioned about the shooting, so that they cannot review the video before making any official statements.\n\nAurora Mayor Richard Irvin said he's confident that the officers' actions were justified.\n\n\"Any loss of life is deeply concerning, and I recognize the impact this has on everyone in our community,\" he said. \"In my opinion, Aurora police officers are the most well-trained, prepared, and professional police officers in our state, and arguably this entire country.

Garland Police Chief Jeff Bryan said they did not have time to exit their vehicle and were unable to return fire. Still, they managed to escape the ambush, Bryan said.\n\nBryan said one police patrol was struck multiple times and a projectile shattered the windshield. The other Garland police vehicle was pierced by a round, which passed through an officer's leg and entered the officer's other leg, Bryan explained. The wounded officer was able to get to a supermarket a few minutes drive away to wait for help.\n\nOfficers applied tourniquets and the agent was quickly taken to a nearby hospital. Bryan said he is expected to recover.\n\nMeanwhile, the suspect, later identified as 23-year-old Bernardo Mares Jr, fled the scene in a white pickup truck, police said.\n\nAccording to police, one officer traveling west on Margarita was caught off guard by a second ambush by Mares. He had parked the truck he fled in and taken a concealed position behind a parked car. He opened fire and hit the officer's vehicle, Bryan said. The officer took cover, reinforcements arrived and the exchange of gunfire ensued.\n\nBryan said Mares fled between houses on foot and was tracked to a residence on West Wanda, where he had a family connection to the house. The chief said family members were inside  and all were safely evacuated.\n\nThe chief said as family members were being evacuated, Mares charged from the house while pointing an object at officers in a \"shooter stance,\" and multiple officers fired simultaneously, striking Mares. Bryan said the object pointed at officers may have been a magazine from one of the guns.\n\nMares was also taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\n\"We could be right now planning five officers' funerals. We had five squad cars hit. This could have gone completely different,\" Bryan said.\n\nBryan said they do not know what prompted Mares to engage in this behavior and attempt to kill multiple officers; however, witnesses told police Mares indicated would not go to jail and that he would force officers to kill him.\n\n\"It was a very terrifying night, I'll tell you that,\" said Lesli Zavala, who lives in the neighborhood. \"Our family couldn't sleep at all. We were scared. I heard the gunshots, and my heart started racing. I felt so, so afraid. My sister was sleeping and she said the moment she heard a bunch of gunshots, she crouched down under her bed.\"\n\nAll eight officers involved are on administrative leave with multiple investigations ongoing, including one by the District Attorney's Office.\n\nBryan said the injured officer has been with Garland PD for one year. He was previously a detention officer in New York.\n\nThe chief said he spoke to the officer early Monday morning and he is in good spirits.\n\nSteven Rosenbaum is a digital producer for CBS Texas.

Slupe told the outlet that the officer inspected the roof after an unnamed law enforcement agency requested identification of a \"suspicious individual\" at the rally, the Post reported.\n\nAfter the officer pulled himself up high enough to see onto the roof of a building near the rally, the shooter, now identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks , turned around and aimed his gun at the officer, prompting him to drop back to the ground, the outlet said.\n\nSlupe said the officer did not have a gun in his hand at the time because he was holding onto the roof's ledge.\n\n\"He lets go because he doesn't want to get killed,\" Slupe told the outlet.\n\nCrooks then shot at Trump. Secret Service agents quickly surrounded the president, who later confirmed in a Truth Social post that a bullet struck his ear .\n\nA Secret Service sniper fatally shot Crooks.\n\nThe Butler County Sheriff's Office did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nLaw enforcement officials and the Secret Service are facing criticism following the incident.\n\nA former intelligence officer at the Defense Intelligence Agency told BI said it's \"mind-boggling\" that Crooks managed to reach the rooftop and have a clear shot at Trump.\n\nAn AP analysis of the footage found that Crooks managed to get \"astonishingly close\" to the stage. According to the outlet, the roof was less than 164 yards from where Trump stood onstage.\n\nPresident Joe Biden ordered an independent probe of Trump's rally security on Sunday in the shooting's aftermath.\n\n\"I've directed an independent review of the national security of yesterday's rally, and we will share the results of that independent review as well,\" Biden said.\n\nGOP House Speaker Mike Johnson said the House would investigate events at the rally. On Saturday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced it assumed the lead role in the investigation in a post on X.\n\nTrump will speak at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week.\n\n\"In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win,\" he said in a Truth Social post.\n\nJump to"

Irizarry had been driving the wrong direction down a one-way street.\n\n\"The bail in this matter is revoked,\" Judge Lillian Ransom told a packed courtroom on Tuesday, causing some of Dial's supporters to begin crying; several placed their faces in their hands.\n\nBrian McMonagle, an attorney for the officer, had argued at the hearing that prosecutors had failed to show his client was either a danger to the public or proved that he was likely to be convicted of first-degree murder.\n\nBut the office of District Attorney Larry Krasner argued that they are not required to do that at this stage - and that the Pennsylvania constitution requires pre-trial detention of people charged with crimes that carry a potential life sentence.\n\nAfter Dial turned himself in earlier this month, the police union posted $50,000 to secure his release, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported , over prosecutors' objections. An attorney for Dial had argued that he should be eligible for bail, the outlet noted, because an affidavit of probable cause for his arrest had listed the lead offense as voluntary manslaughter, a charge that carries a sentence of up to 20 years behind bars.\n\nBut Judge Ransom sided with the state on Tuesday, ordering Dial to be immediately detained at the conclusion of hearing. He will be held, for now, at a jail in Philadelphia, she said.\n\nThe case against Dial has attracted national attention in part due to how rarely police officers face murder charges related to their actions on the job. Krasner, a self-styled progressive prosecutor, has filed charges against a number of officers for alleged on-duty wrongdoing since first being elected in 2017.\n\nIn this case, prosecutors said they were compelled to file a murder charge after video footage contradicted police claims. Released to the public last week, the video shows Dial - not Irizarry - getting out of his car.\n\n\"I will fucking shoot you,\" Dial says just after exiting his vehicle and before firing a half-dozen shots.\n\n\"The video speaks for itself,\" Assistant District Attorney Lyandra Retacco said at Tuesday's hearing, rejecting defense arguments that prosecutors needed more evidence to show Dial ought to be denied bail. Retacco said that, for prosecutors, a key factor in the charging decision was Dial's apparent eagerness to use deadly force.\n\n\"The one that moves [us] most is getting out of your car with your gun already drawn before anyone says anything,\" she said.\n\nIrizarry had moved to Philadelphia from Puerto Rico, according to his family, and was not proficient in English. An attorney for the family has said that he did have a knife on him, which he used for work, but did not pose a threat to police.\n\nAfter Dial was charged earlier this month, the Fraternal Order of Police said in a statement that it would be offering its \"full support\" to Dial, who was suspended from the police force after Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said he refused to cooperate with an internal investigation (\"The body-worn camera footage made it very clear that what we initially reported was not actually what happened,\" she said at a press conference last month).\n\nA preliminary hearing, where prosecutors will formally outline their case against Dial, is scheduled for September 26.\n\nHave a news tip?

Officer Anthony Luckey was called as the state's second witness; Wright's mom also testified on Wednesday.\n\nThe testimony came on the opening day of Potter's trial. The former Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, police officer is facing charges of first- and second-degree manslaughter for killing Wright, a Black man, after saying she mistakenly grabbed her gun instead of a Taser during a traffic stop. She resigned from the force after the shooting.\n\nIn April 2021, officers pulled Wright over and during the traffic stop discovered he had an outstanding arrest warrant for a weapons charge.

He was also on duty during President Trump's inauguration last month. He reflects on the pardons attackers received.\n\nAYESHA RASCOE, HOST: Daniel Hodges works in the civil disturbance unit of Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department. He was working on Inauguration Day. DANIEL HODGES: Inauguration is like the Super Bowl for law enforcement in D.C. I mean, people measure how long they have until retirement by how many more inaugurations they have to work. RASCOE: This was not Hodges' first inauguration on the job. But this year, when Donald Trump took the oath of office for a second time, Hodges says it felt different. HODGES: It was weird 'cause, you know, the last time I saw all those MAGA hats in D.C. was on January 6, 2021. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HODGES: (Screaming). RASCOE: Those are his screams as Hodges was crushed by pro-Trump rioters on January 6 and repeatedly assaulted. He spoke with NPR's Tom Dreisbach about the month since Trump returned to office and pardoned the men convicted of assaulting him, as well as the preemptive pardon that former President Biden granted him just before leaving office. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE: For Daniel Hodges, it was hard not to think of January 6 when he was working Inauguration Day. In his personal time - and we should say he talked to NPR in his personal capacity, not on behalf of the police department - Hodges has been outspoken in his opposition to Trump ever since the attack on the Capitol. And so there was a question on Inauguration Day. Would anyone in the crowd recognize him? No one did. HODGES: So I didn't have any issues in that regard, but it was - it is sad. DREISBACH: You know, there were people who were at January 6, convicted rioters, who were part of the inauguration festivities who are celebrating, and I'm just thinking about you on the streets protecting them. HODGES: Right. Yeah. It's quite the turnabout, isn't it? I don't know (laughter). I struggle to find something worthwhile to say about it. You know, it's - I hate the phrase because it's overused and so rendered meaningless, but it is what it is. DREISBACH: Were you surprised by the decision by Trump and the administration to pardon the people who assaulted you? HODGES: Not really. I mean, he campaigned on it. He made it very clear that he believed these people did no wrong. In fact, they did right by attacking the Capitol in his name. DREISBACH: I will say, I was personally surprised that he went as far as he did with the people who were really violent. Even JD Vance was saying, obviously... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE: If you committed violence on that day, obviously, you shouldn't be pardoned. HODGES: Yeah, did you really think Trump was going to sit there and go through 1,500 case files and be like, well, this guy did this X, Y and Z, so maybe not him? He's just going to pardon them all. DREISBACH: You know, on the same day, I guess it was that morning, maybe you got the news about Biden, President Biden, giving you a pardon preemptively, along with the other officers who testified to the January 6 committee. HODGES: Yeah. DREISBACH: What were your thoughts on that? HODGES: Oh, I mean, initially, surprise. I mean... DREISBACH: You hadn't been talking with him? HODGES: Oh, no, I received zero communication from the Biden administration on this. I found out about it when a journalist texted me that morning and asking my - asking me my thoughts on my own pardon. And I was, like, what (laughter)? So I looked in the news, and I found it. I was like, oh. So I received a presidential pardon for unknown crimes that I did not commit, which is a novel sensation. DREISBACH: Does it, like, come in the mail (laughter)? HODGES: I... DREISBACH: What happens? HODGES: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I'm glad that Biden thought to protect me from this Department of Justice. But God, I - yeah, I got a pardon for things that I haven't done. I don't know how to feel about that. DREISBACH: Were you genuinely worried about retaliation from this administration? HODGES: I thought it was a possibility. DREISBACH: The other thing that people who prosecuted these cases, other officers - people have been talking about harassment or threats that they've gotten from January 6 defendants. Have you thought about getting a protective order, a kind of restraining order, against anybody, people who assaulted you and who are now free? HODGES: I think that'd be great. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice has indicated that they're unable to give us - us being law enforcement officers - the information we would need to fill out those kind of protective orders because the convicted - the people who attacked us and attacked the Capitol, in the eyes of the Justice Department, are no longer criminals, are no longer subject to, you know, the conviction. So they're not able to give us that information. DREISBACH: How do you think, now that we're in this period where the January 6 defendants have been pardoned - Trump - I don't know if you saw this - recently said that they didn't assault, was his quote, they were assaulted by our government. And of course, you were assaulted. You know, how do you think about keeping the memory and the truth of January 6 from being whitewashed? HODGES: I - it should be easy, right? This is the most recorded crime in history. Everybody had their phones out, was tweeting, recording video, taking pictures. There's no shortage of evidence of the crime, but somehow people have gotten into this headspace where none of that matters, that everything's a lie, that we're all crisis actors or lizard people or whatever it is. So I mean, I just have to hope that people still believe - some people still believe the evidence that is out there, and I have to keep being a living witness to what occurred and trust that someone will hear me. DREISBACH: After Daniel Hodges and I talked, I contacted the Justice Department to ask about what he said - that they're not helping him get the information needed to file for a court order to prevent harassment by the men convicted of assaulting him. They did not respond. Tom Dreisbach, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF HERMANOS GUTIERREZ'S \"SONIDO COSMICO\") Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I found out about it when a journalist texted me that morning and asking my - asking me my thoughts on my own pardon. And I was, like, what (laughter)? So I looked in the news, and I found it. I was like, oh. So I received a presidential pardon for unknown crimes that I did not commit, which is a novel sensation. DREISBACH: Does it, like, come in the mail (laughter)? HODGES: I... DREISBACH: What happens? HODGES: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I'm glad that Biden thought to protect me from this Department of Justice. But God, I - yeah, I got a pardon for things that I haven't done. I don't know how to feel about that. DREISBACH: Were you genuinely worried about retaliation from this administration? HODGES: I thought it was a possibility. DREISBACH: The other thing that people who prosecuted these cases, other officers - people have been talking about harassment or threats that they've gotten from January 6 defendants. Have you thought about getting a protective order, a kind of restraining order, against anybody, people who assaulted you and who are now free? HODGES: I think that'd be great. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice has indicated that they're unable to give us - us being law enforcement officers - the information we would need to fill out those kind of protective orders because the convicted - the people who attacked us and attacked the Capitol, in the eyes of the Justice Department, are no longer criminals, are no longer subject to, you know, the conviction. So they're not able to give us that information. DREISBACH: How do you think, now that we're in this period where the January 6 defendants have been pardoned - Trump - I don't know if you saw this - recently said that they didn't assault, was his quote, they were assaulted by our government. And of course, you were assaulted. You know, how do you think about keeping the memory and the truth of January 6 from being whitewashed? HODGES: I - it should be easy, right? This is the most recorded crime in history. Everybody had their phones out, was tweeting, recording video, taking pictures. There's no shortage of evidence of the crime, but somehow people have gotten into this headspace where none of that matters, that everything's a lie, that we're all crisis actors or lizard people or whatever it is. So I mean, I just have to hope that people still believe - some people still believe the evidence that is out there, and I have to keep being a living witness to what occurred and trust that someone will hear me. DREISBACH: After Daniel Hodges and I talked, I contacted the Justice Department to ask about what he said - that they're not helping him get the information needed to file for a court order to prevent harassment by the men convicted of assaulting him. They did not respond. Tom Dreisbach, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF HERMANOS GUTIERREZ'S \"SONIDO COSMICO\") Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He was working on Inauguration Day. DANIEL HODGES: Inauguration is like the Super Bowl for law enforcement in D.C. I mean, people measure how long they have until retirement by how many more inaugurations they have to work. RASCOE: This was not Hodges' first inauguration on the job. But this year, when Donald Trump took the oath of office for a second time, Hodges says it felt different. HODGES: It was weird 'cause, you know, the last time I saw all those MAGA hats in D.C. was on January 6, 2021. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HODGES: (Screaming). RASCOE: Those are his screams as Hodges was crushed by pro-Trump rioters on January 6 and repeatedly assaulted. He spoke with NPR's Tom Dreisbach about the month since Trump returned to office and pardoned the men convicted of assaulting him, as well as the preemptive pardon that former President Biden granted him just before leaving office. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE: For Daniel Hodges, it was hard not to think of January 6 when he was working Inauguration Day. In his personal time - and we should say he talked to NPR in his personal capacity, not on behalf of the police department - Hodges has been outspoken in his opposition to Trump ever since the attack on the Capitol. And so there was a question on Inauguration Day. Would anyone in the crowd recognize him? No one did. HODGES: So I didn't have any issues in that regard, but it was - it is sad. DREISBACH: You know, there were people who were at January 6, convicted rioters, who were part of the inauguration festivities who are celebrating, and I'm just thinking about you on the streets protecting them. HODGES: Right. Yeah. It's quite the turnabout, isn't it? I don't know (laughter). I struggle to find something worthwhile to say about it. You know, it's - I hate the phrase because it's overused and so rendered meaningless, but it is what it is. DREISBACH: Were you surprised by the decision by Trump and the administration to pardon the people who assaulted you? HODGES: Not really. I mean, he campaigned on it. He made it very clear that he believed these people did no wrong. In fact, they did right by attacking the Capitol in his name. DREISBACH: I will say, I was personally surprised that he went as far as he did with the people who were really violent. Even JD Vance was saying, obviously... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE: If you committed violence on that day, obviously, you shouldn't be pardoned. HODGES: Yeah, did you really think Trump was going to sit there and go through 1,500 case files and be like, well, this guy did this X, Y and Z, so maybe not him? He's just going to pardon them all. DREISBACH: You know, on the same day, I guess it was that morning, maybe you got the news about Biden, President Biden, giving you a pardon preemptively, along with the other officers who testified to the January 6 committee. HODGES: Yeah. DREISBACH: What were your thoughts on that? HODGES: Oh, I mean, initially, surprise. I mean... DREISBACH: You hadn't been talking with him?

DREISBACH: How do you think, now that we're in this period where the January 6 defendants have been pardoned - Trump - I don't know if you saw this - recently said that they didn't assault, was his quote, they were assaulted by our government. And of course, you were assaulted. You know, how do you think about keeping the memory and the truth of January 6 from being whitewashed? HODGES: I - it should be easy, right? This is the most recorded crime in history. Everybody had their phones out, was tweeting, recording video, taking pictures. There's no shortage of evidence of the crime, but somehow people have gotten into this headspace where none of that matters, that everything's a lie, that we're all crisis actors or lizard people or whatever it is. So I mean, I just have to hope that people still believe - some people still believe the evidence that is out there, and I have to keep being a living witness to what occurred and trust that someone will hear me. DREISBACH: After Daniel Hodges and I talked, I contacted the Justice Department to ask about what he said - that they're not helping him get the information needed to file for a court order to prevent harassment by the men convicted of assaulting him. They did not respond. Tom Dreisbach, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF HERMANOS GUTIERREZ'S \"SONIDO COSMICO\") Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HODGES: (Screaming). RASCOE: Those are his screams as Hodges was crushed by pro-Trump rioters on January 6 and repeatedly assaulted. He spoke with NPR's Tom Dreisbach about the month since Trump returned to office and pardoned the men convicted of assaulting him, as well as the preemptive pardon that former President Biden granted him just before leaving office. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE: For Daniel Hodges, it was hard not to think of January 6 when he was working Inauguration Day. In his personal time - and we should say he talked to NPR in his personal capacity, not on behalf of the police department - Hodges has been outspoken in his opposition to Trump ever since the attack on the Capitol. And so there was a question on Inauguration Day. Would anyone in the crowd recognize him? No one did. HODGES: So I didn't have any issues in that regard, but it was - it is sad. DREISBACH: You know, there were people who were at January 6, convicted rioters, who were part of the inauguration festivities who are celebrating, and I'm just thinking about you on the streets protecting them. HODGES: Right. Yeah. It's quite the turnabout, isn't it? I don't know (laughter). I struggle to find something worthwhile to say about it. You know, it's - I hate the phrase because it's overused and so rendered meaningless, but it is what it is. DREISBACH: Were you surprised by the decision by Trump and the administration to pardon the people who assaulted you? HODGES: Not really. I mean, he campaigned on it. He made it very clear that he believed these people did no wrong. In fact, they did right by attacking the Capitol in his name. DREISBACH: I will say, I was personally surprised that he went as far as he did with the people who were really violent. Even JD Vance was saying, obviously... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE: If you committed violence on that day, obviously, you shouldn't be pardoned. HODGES: Yeah, did you really think Trump was going to sit there and go through 1,500 case files and be like, well, this guy did this X, Y and Z, so maybe not him? He's just going to pardon them all. DREISBACH: You know, on the same day, I guess it was that morning, maybe you got the news about Biden, President Biden, giving you a pardon preemptively, along with the other officers who testified to the January 6 committee. HODGES: Yeah. DREISBACH: What were your thoughts on that? HODGES: Oh, I mean, initially, surprise. I mean... DREISBACH: You hadn't been talking with him? HODGES: Oh, no, I received zero communication from the Biden administration on this. I found out about it when a journalist texted me that morning and asking my - asking me my thoughts on my own pardon. And I was, like, what (laughter)? So I looked in the news, and I found it. I was like, oh. So I received a presidential pardon for unknown crimes that I did not commit, which is a novel sensation. DREISBACH: Does it, like, come in the mail (laughter)? HODGES: I... DREISBACH: What happens? HODGES: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I'm glad that Biden thought to protect me from this Department of Justice. But God, I - yeah, I got a pardon for things that I haven't done. I don't know how to feel about that. DREISBACH: Were you genuinely worried about retaliation from this administration? HODGES: I thought it was a possibility. DREISBACH: The other thing that people who prosecuted these cases, other officers - people have been talking about harassment or threats that they've gotten from January 6 defendants. Have you thought about getting a protective order, a kind of restraining order, against anybody, people who assaulted you and who are now free? HODGES: I think that'd be great. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice has indicated that they're unable to give us - us being law enforcement officers - the information we would need to fill out those kind of protective orders because the convicted - the people who attacked us and attacked the Capitol, in the eyes of the Justice Department, are no longer criminals, are no longer subject to, you know, the conviction.

HODGES: Yeah, did you really think Trump was going to sit there and go through 1,500 case files and be like, well, this guy did this X, Y and Z, so maybe not him? He's just going to pardon them all. DREISBACH: You know, on the same day, I guess it was that morning, maybe you got the news about Biden, President Biden, giving you a pardon preemptively, along with the other officers who testified to the January 6 committee. HODGES: Yeah. DREISBACH: What were your thoughts on that? HODGES: Oh, I mean, initially, surprise. I mean... DREISBACH: You hadn't been talking with him? HODGES: Oh, no, I received zero communication from the Biden administration on this. I found out about it when a journalist texted me that morning and asking my - asking me my thoughts on my own pardon. And I was, like, what (laughter)? So I looked in the news, and I found it. I was like, oh. So I received a presidential pardon for unknown crimes that I did not commit, which is a novel sensation. DREISBACH: Does it, like, come in the mail (laughter)? HODGES: I... DREISBACH: What happens? HODGES: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I'm glad that Biden thought to protect me from this Department of Justice. But God, I - yeah, I got a pardon for things that I haven't done. I don't know how to feel about that. DREISBACH: Were you genuinely worried about retaliation from this administration? HODGES: I thought it was a possibility. DREISBACH: The other thing that people who prosecuted these cases, other officers - people have been talking about harassment or threats that they've gotten from January 6 defendants. Have you thought about getting a protective order, a kind of restraining order, against anybody, people who assaulted you and who are now free? HODGES: I think that'd be great. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice has indicated that they're unable to give us - us being law enforcement officers - the information we would need to fill out those kind of protective orders because the convicted - the people who attacked us and attacked the Capitol, in the eyes of the Justice Department, are no longer criminals, are no longer subject to, you know, the conviction. So they're not able to give us that information. DREISBACH: How do you think, now that we're in this period where the January 6 defendants have been pardoned - Trump - I don't know if you saw this - recently said that they didn't assault, was his quote, they were assaulted by our government. And of course, you were assaulted. You know, how do you think about keeping the memory and the truth of January 6 from being whitewashed? HODGES: I - it should be easy, right? This is the most recorded crime in history. Everybody had their phones out, was tweeting, recording video, taking pictures. There's no shortage of evidence of the crime, but somehow people have gotten into this headspace where none of that matters, that everything's a lie, that we're all crisis actors or lizard people or whatever it is. So I mean, I just have to hope that people still believe - some people still believe the evidence that is out there, and I have to keep being a living witness to what occurred and trust that someone will hear me. DREISBACH: After Daniel Hodges and I talked, I contacted the Justice Department to ask about what he said - that they're not helping him get the information needed to file for a court order to prevent harassment by the men convicted of assaulting him. They did not respond. Tom Dreisbach, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF HERMANOS GUTIERREZ'S \"SONIDO COSMICO\") Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He spoke with NPR's Tom Dreisbach about the month since Trump returned to office and pardoned the men convicted of assaulting him, as well as the preemptive pardon that former President Biden granted him just before leaving office. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE: For Daniel Hodges, it was hard not to think of January 6 when he was working Inauguration Day. In his personal time - and we should say he talked to NPR in his personal capacity, not on behalf of the police department - Hodges has been outspoken in his opposition to Trump ever since the attack on the Capitol. And so there was a question on Inauguration Day. Would anyone in the crowd recognize him? No one did. HODGES: So I didn't have any issues in that regard, but it was - it is sad. DREISBACH: You know, there were people who were at January 6, convicted rioters, who were part of the inauguration festivities who are celebrating, and I'm just thinking about you on the streets protecting them. HODGES: Right. Yeah. It's quite the turnabout, isn't it? I don't know (laughter). I struggle to find something worthwhile to say about it. You know, it's - I hate the phrase because it's overused and so rendered meaningless, but it is what it is. DREISBACH: Were you surprised by the decision by Trump and the administration to pardon the people who assaulted you? HODGES: Not really. I mean, he campaigned on it. He made it very clear that he believed these people did no wrong. In fact, they did right by attacking the Capitol in his name. DREISBACH: I will say, I was personally surprised that he went as far as he did with the people who were really violent. Even JD Vance was saying, obviously...

HODGES: Yeah. DREISBACH: What were your thoughts on that? HODGES: Oh, I mean, initially, surprise. I mean... DREISBACH: You hadn't been talking with him? HODGES: Oh, no, I received zero communication from the Biden administration on this. I found out about it when a journalist texted me that morning and asking my - asking me my thoughts on my own pardon. And I was, like, what (laughter)? So I looked in the news, and I found it. I was like, oh. So I received a presidential pardon for unknown crimes that I did not commit, which is a novel sensation. DREISBACH: Does it, like, come in the mail (laughter)? HODGES: I... DREISBACH: What happens? HODGES: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I'm glad that Biden thought to protect me from this Department of Justice. But God, I - yeah, I got a pardon for things that I haven't done. I don't know how to feel about that. DREISBACH: Were you genuinely worried about retaliation from this administration? HODGES: I thought it was a possibility. DREISBACH: The other thing that people who prosecuted these cases, other officers - people have been talking about harassment or threats that they've gotten from January 6 defendants. Have you thought about getting a protective order, a kind of restraining order, against anybody, people who assaulted you and who are now free? HODGES: I think that'd be great. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice has indicated that they're unable to give us - us being law enforcement officers - the information we would need to fill out those kind of protective orders because the convicted - the people who attacked us and attacked the Capitol, in the eyes of the Justice Department, are no longer criminals, are no longer subject to, you know, the conviction. So they're not able to give us that information. DREISBACH: How do you think, now that we're in this period where the January 6 defendants have been pardoned - Trump - I don't know if you saw this - recently said that they didn't assault, was his quote, they were assaulted by our government. And of course, you were assaulted. You know, how do you think about keeping the memory and the truth of January 6 from being whitewashed? HODGES: I - it should be easy, right? This is the most recorded crime in history. Everybody had their phones out, was tweeting, recording video, taking pictures. There's no shortage of evidence of the crime, but somehow people have gotten into this headspace where none of that matters, that everything's a lie, that we're all crisis actors or lizard people or whatever it is. So I mean, I just have to hope that people still believe - some people still believe the evidence that is out there, and I have to keep being a living witness to what occurred and trust that someone will hear me. DREISBACH: After Daniel Hodges and I talked, I contacted the Justice Department to ask about what he said - that they're not helping him get the information needed to file for a court order to prevent harassment by the men convicted of assaulting him. They did not respond. Tom Dreisbach, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF HERMANOS GUTIERREZ'S \"SONIDO COSMICO\") Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

DREISBACH: Were you surprised by the decision by Trump and the administration to pardon the people who assaulted you? HODGES: Not really. I mean, he campaigned on it. He made it very clear that he believed these people did no wrong. In fact, they did right by attacking the Capitol in his name. DREISBACH: I will say, I was personally surprised that he went as far as he did with the people who were really violent. Even JD Vance was saying, obviously...

HODGES: Oh, no, I received zero communication from the Biden administration on this. I found out about it when a journalist texted me that morning and asking my - asking me my thoughts on my own pardon. And I was, like, what (laughter)? So I looked in the news, and I found it. I was like, oh. So I received a presidential pardon for unknown crimes that I did not commit, which is a novel sensation. DREISBACH: Does it, like, come in the mail (laughter)? HODGES: I... DREISBACH: What happens? HODGES: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I'm glad that Biden thought to protect me from this Department of Justice. But God, I - yeah, I got a pardon for things that I haven't done. I don't know how to feel about that. DREISBACH: Were you genuinely worried about retaliation from this administration? HODGES: I thought it was a possibility. DREISBACH: The other thing that people who prosecuted these cases, other officers - people have been talking about harassment or threats that they've gotten from January 6 defendants. Have you thought about getting a protective order, a kind of restraining order, against anybody, people who assaulted you and who are now free? HODGES: I think that'd be great. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice has indicated that they're unable to give us - us being law enforcement officers - the information we would need to fill out those kind of protective orders because the convicted - the people who attacked us and attacked the Capitol, in the eyes of the Justice Department, are no longer criminals, are no longer subject to, you know, the conviction. So they're not able to give us that information. DREISBACH: How do you think, now that we're in this period where the January 6 defendants have been pardoned - Trump - I don't know if you saw this - recently said that they didn't assault, was his quote, they were assaulted by our government. And of course, you were assaulted. You know, how do you think about keeping the memory and the truth of January 6 from being whitewashed? HODGES: I - it should be easy, right? This is the most recorded crime in history. Everybody had their phones out, was tweeting, recording video, taking pictures. There's no shortage of evidence of the crime, but somehow people have gotten into this headspace where none of that matters, that everything's a lie, that we're all crisis actors or lizard people or whatever it is. So I mean, I just have to hope that people still believe - some people still believe the evidence that is out there, and I have to keep being a living witness to what occurred and trust that someone will hear me. DREISBACH: After Daniel Hodges and I talked, I contacted the Justice Department to ask about what he said - that they're not helping him get the information needed to file for a court order to prevent harassment by the men convicted of assaulting him. They did not respond. Tom Dreisbach, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF HERMANOS GUTIERREZ'S \"SONIDO COSMICO\") Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I was like, oh. So I received a presidential pardon for unknown crimes that I did not commit, which is a novel sensation. DREISBACH: Does it, like, come in the mail (laughter)? HODGES: I... DREISBACH: What happens? HODGES: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I'm glad that Biden thought to protect me from this Department of Justice. But God, I - yeah, I got a pardon for things that I haven't done. I don't know how to feel about that. DREISBACH: Were you genuinely worried about retaliation from this administration? HODGES: I thought it was a possibility. DREISBACH: The other thing that people who prosecuted these cases, other officers - people have been talking about harassment or threats that they've gotten from January 6 defendants. Have you thought about getting a protective order, a kind of restraining order, against anybody, people who assaulted you and who are now free? HODGES: I think that'd be great. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice has indicated that they're unable to give us - us being law enforcement officers - the information we would need to fill out those kind of protective orders because the convicted - the people who attacked us and attacked the Capitol, in the eyes of the Justice Department, are no longer criminals, are no longer subject to, you know, the conviction. So they're not able to give us that information. DREISBACH: How do you think, now that we're in this period where the January 6 defendants have been pardoned - Trump - I don't know if you saw this - recently said that they didn't assault, was his quote, they were assaulted by our government. And of course, you were assaulted. You know, how do you think about keeping the memory and the truth of January 6 from being whitewashed? HODGES: I - it should be easy, right? This is the most recorded crime in history. Everybody had their phones out, was tweeting, recording video, taking pictures. There's no shortage of evidence of the crime, but somehow people have gotten into this headspace where none of that matters, that everything's a lie, that we're all crisis actors or lizard people or whatever it is. So I mean, I just have to hope that people still believe - some people still believe the evidence that is out there, and I have to keep being a living witness to what occurred and trust that someone will hear me. DREISBACH: After Daniel Hodges and I talked, I contacted the Justice Department to ask about what he said - that they're not helping him get the information needed to file for a court order to prevent harassment by the men convicted of assaulting him. They did not respond. Tom Dreisbach, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF HERMANOS GUTIERREZ'S \"SONIDO COSMICO\") Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He's just going to pardon them all. DREISBACH: You know, on the same day, I guess it was that morning, maybe you got the news about Biden, President Biden, giving you a pardon preemptively, along with the other officers who testified to the January 6 committee.

DREISBACH: How do you think, now that we're in this period where the January 6 defendants have been pardoned - Trump - I don't know if you saw this - recently said that they didn't assault, was his quote, they were assaulted by our government. And of course, you were assaulted. You know, how do you think about keeping the memory and the truth of January 6 from being whitewashed? HODGES: I - it should be easy, right? This is the most recorded crime in history. Everybody had their phones out, was tweeting, recording video, taking pictures. There's no shortage of evidence of the crime, but somehow people have gotten into this headspace where none of that matters, that everything's a lie, that we're all crisis actors or lizard people or whatever it is. So I mean, I just have to hope that people still believe - some people still believe the evidence that is out there, and I have to keep being a living witness to what occurred and trust that someone will hear me. DREISBACH: After Daniel Hodges and I talked, I contacted the Justice Department to ask about what he said - that they're not helping him get the information needed to file for a court order to prevent harassment by the men convicted of assaulting him. They did not respond. Tom Dreisbach, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF HERMANOS GUTIERREZ'S \"SONIDO COSMICO\") Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I was like, oh. So I received a presidential pardon for unknown crimes that I did not commit, which is a novel sensation. DREISBACH: Does it, like, come in the mail (laughter)? HODGES: I...

And of course, you were assaulted. You know, how do you think about keeping the memory and the truth of January 6 from being whitewashed? HODGES: I - it should be easy, right? This is the most recorded crime in history. Everybody had their phones out, was tweeting, recording video, taking pictures. There's no shortage of evidence of the crime, but somehow people have gotten into this headspace where none of that matters, that everything's a lie, that we're all crisis actors or lizard people or whatever it is. So I mean, I just have to hope that people still believe - some people still believe the evidence that is out there, and I have to keep being a living witness to what occurred and trust that someone will hear me. DREISBACH: After Daniel Hodges and I talked, I contacted the Justice Department to ask about what he said - that they're not helping him get the information needed to file for a court order to prevent harassment by the men convicted of assaulting him. They did not respond. Tom Dreisbach, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF HERMANOS GUTIERREZ'S \"SONIDO COSMICO\") Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But God, I - yeah, I got a pardon for things that I haven't done. I don't know how to feel about that. DREISBACH: Were you genuinely worried about retaliation from this administration? HODGES: I thought it was a possibility. DREISBACH: The other thing that people who prosecuted these cases, other officers - people have been talking about harassment or threats that they've gotten from January 6 defendants. Have you thought about getting a protective order, a kind of restraining order, against anybody, people who assaulted you and who are now free? HODGES: I think that'd be great. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice has indicated that they're unable to give us - us being law enforcement officers - the information we would need to fill out those kind of protective orders because the convicted - the people who attacked us and attacked the Capitol, in the eyes of the Justice Department, are no longer criminals, are no longer subject to, you know, the conviction.

Since Donald Trump's reelection, he says he feels \"betrayed.\"\n\nA MARTÍNEZ, HOST: Four years ago today, a mob of then President Donald Trump's supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol. Members of Congress were forced to flee or barricade themselves inside offices. Around 140 police officers were injured. The FBI calls the attacks an act of domestic terrorism. Trump has called January 6, they quote, \"day of love.\" He says he'll pardon people convicted for their role in the attack. NPR's Tom Dreisbach has a story of one officer assaulted that day. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE: If you've ever watched the presidential inauguration, you'd probably recognize the part of the Capitol known as the Lower West Terrace Tunnel. The incoming president walks through that tunnel and outside just before taking the oath of office. On January 6, 2021, that tunnel was a crime scene. (SOUNDBITE OF CROWDS RIOTING) DREISBACH: A police commander told his officers in riot gear to hold the line there. Do not let the rioters breach that tunnel. And what followed was a bloody, hours long scrum, claustrophobic, hand to hand combat for inches. AQUILINO GONELL: My fellow officers and I were punch, kick, shove, spray with chemical irritants, by a violent mob. DREISBACH: Aquilino Gonell was a sergeant in the Capitol police. He had served in Iraq with the army, faced roadside bombs and mortar attacks. He later testified that the tunnel brought back memories of war. GONELL: I could feel myself losing oxygen and recall thinking to myself, this is how I'm going to die, defending this entrance. DREISBACH: The police eventually cleared the tunnel and the Capitol. And Gonell survived, his hands bloodied, his shoulders and feet smashed, his eyes stinging from pepper spray. He would later need two surgeries on his shoulder and foot because of the injuries he got on January 6 and the riot-inflamed PTSD for him and many of his fellow officers. GONELL: That day continued to be a constant trauma for us literally every day, whether because our physical or emotional injuries or both. DREISBACH: Gonell's injuries from January 6 ultimately forced him to retire from the Capitol police. But he took his experience and channeled it into speaking out as a witness in court and in Congress and in the presidential race. And so after the election, when Trump won on the promise to pardon the rioters, I called him and asked how he's feeling. GONELL: Honestly, like, betrayed. It feels like sometimes, like, what did I risk my life for? DREISBACH: Some of that betrayal is personal. He defended members of Congress on January 6 as they fled the violence. Then he watched as some Republican lawmakers downplayed January 6 or even supported the rioters. GONELL: The only reason why they made it out was because of actions like - that we, the police officers, took. We did our job and gave them the time to escape, to evacuate, and they seemed to forgotten the fear that Donald Trump's mob made them feel. DREISBACH: It almost sounds like you blame the Republicans in Congress almost more than Trump himself. Is that right? GONELL: Well, if you look at it, I mean, he did what he did and Republican elect officials, they were OK with it. They're all willing to carry water for the former president. DREISBACH: Now that Trump has gone from former president to future president, Gonell is thinking about whether Trump might retaliate against him as both an immigrant and a political opponent. In 2023, Trump reposted a message on social media that, quote, \"the cops should be charged and the protesters should be freed.\" GONELL: I seen people suggesting that my name is on the list of potential retribution, you know, and what they going to get me on? By doing my job? Attesting to what happened to me? DREISBACH: The Trump transition team did not answer my questions about whether they would investigate or prosecute police who protected the Capitol. A spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that, quote, \"the American people did not fall for the left's fearmongering over January 6,\" and went on to say that the administration would pardon people who they claim were denied due process and unfairly prosecuted. Gonell says his feeling of betrayal also runs deeper. He immigrated to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic when he was a kid. He joined the military, became a citizen, deployed in war, protected the Capitol and then spoke out in the election. GONELL: It made me think, was it worth it? Was it worth it for me and my colleagues to do what we did? DREISBACH: Defending the Capitol or speaking out? GONELL: Both. DREISBACH: It sounds like this experience since the election has shaken your belief in this country. GONELL: I mean, yeah. It's hard not to see it that way. I mean, I had done everything that was asked of me. I love this country and it feels like the country doesn't love me back. You know, I remember when I was in Iraq, I came back for my two weeks' R&R, rest and recuperation. And when I came back, I saw people move on. And that's how I feel now. People move on from that day. Officers like myself, we had not been able to. DREISBACH: That particular kind of American amnesia bothers Gonell. And it's been bothering some of the judges who are still hearing the more than 1,500 criminal cases stemming from the January 6 attack. One judge said the idea of pardoning the leader of the Oath Keepers, the militia group that attacked the Capitol, was, quote, \"frightening.\" Another called out attempts to rewrite history as disturbing. And that's been on Gonell's mind, too. GONELL: It was a horrible day for - not only for myself, but for my colleagues, and no matter what or how much the other side want to erase it, it won't change that. DREISBACH: Inauguration day is in two weeks. And the tunnel that Aquilino Gonell and other officers defended on January 6, Donald Trump will walk through it to take the oath of office.

DREISBACH: Now that Trump has gone from former president to future president, Gonell is thinking about whether Trump might retaliate against him as both an immigrant and a political opponent. In 2023, Trump reposted a message on social media that, quote, \"the cops should be charged and the protesters should be freed.\" GONELL: I seen people suggesting that my name is on the list of potential retribution, you know, and what they going to get me on? By doing my job? Attesting to what happened to me? DREISBACH: The Trump transition team did not answer my questions about whether they would investigate or prosecute police who protected the Capitol. A spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that, quote, \"the American people did not fall for the left's fearmongering over January 6,\" and went on to say that the administration would pardon people who they claim were denied due process and unfairly prosecuted. Gonell says his feeling of betrayal also runs deeper. He immigrated to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic when he was a kid. He joined the military, became a citizen, deployed in war, protected the Capitol and then spoke out in the election. GONELL: It made me think, was it worth it? Was it worth it for me and my colleagues to do what we did? DREISBACH: Defending the Capitol or speaking out? GONELL: Both. DREISBACH: It sounds like this experience since the election has shaken your belief in this country. GONELL: I mean, yeah. It's hard not to see it that way. I mean, I had done everything that was asked of me. I love this country and it feels like the country doesn't love me back. You know, I remember when I was in Iraq, I came back for my two weeks' R&R, rest and recuperation. And when I came back, I saw people move on. And that's how I feel now. People move on from that day. Officers like myself, we had not been able to. DREISBACH: That particular kind of American amnesia bothers Gonell. And it's been bothering some of the judges who are still hearing the more than 1,500 criminal cases stemming from the January 6 attack. One judge said the idea of pardoning the leader of the Oath Keepers, the militia group that attacked the Capitol, was, quote, \"frightening.\" Another called out attempts to rewrite history as disturbing. And that's been on Gonell's mind, too. GONELL: It was a horrible day for - not only for myself, but for my colleagues, and no matter what or how much the other side want to erase it, it won't change that. DREISBACH: Inauguration day is in two weeks. And the tunnel that Aquilino Gonell and other officers defended on January 6, Donald Trump will walk through it to take the oath of office.

Do not let the rioters breach that tunnel. And what followed was a bloody, hours long scrum, claustrophobic, hand to hand combat for inches. AQUILINO GONELL: My fellow officers and I were punch, kick, shove, spray with chemical irritants, by a violent mob. DREISBACH: Aquilino Gonell was a sergeant in the Capitol police. He had served in Iraq with the army, faced roadside bombs and mortar attacks. He later testified that the tunnel brought back memories of war. GONELL: I could feel myself losing oxygen and recall thinking to myself, this is how I'm going to die, defending this entrance. DREISBACH: The police eventually cleared the tunnel and the Capitol. And Gonell survived, his hands bloodied, his shoulders and feet smashed, his eyes stinging from pepper spray. He would later need two surgeries on his shoulder and foot because of the injuries he got on January 6 and the riot-inflamed PTSD for him and many of his fellow officers. GONELL: That day continued to be a constant trauma for us literally every day, whether because our physical or emotional injuries or both. DREISBACH: Gonell's injuries from January 6 ultimately forced him to retire from the Capitol police. But he took his experience and channeled it into speaking out as a witness in court and in Congress and in the presidential race. And so after the election, when Trump won on the promise to pardon the rioters, I called him and asked how he's feeling. GONELL: Honestly, like, betrayed. It feels like sometimes, like, what did I risk my life for? DREISBACH: Some of that betrayal is personal. He defended members of Congress on January 6 as they fled the violence. Then he watched as some Republican lawmakers downplayed January 6 or even supported the rioters. GONELL: The only reason why they made it out was because of actions like - that we, the police officers, took. We did our job and gave them the time to escape, to evacuate, and they seemed to forgotten the fear that Donald Trump's mob made them feel. DREISBACH: It almost sounds like you blame the Republicans in Congress almost more than Trump himself. Is that right?

I mean, I had done everything that was asked of me. I love this country and it feels like the country doesn't love me back. You know, I remember when I was in Iraq, I came back for my two weeks' R&R, rest and recuperation. And when I came back, I saw people move on. And that's how I feel now. People move on from that day. Officers like myself, we had not been able to. DREISBACH: That particular kind of American amnesia bothers Gonell. And it's been bothering some of the judges who are still hearing the more than 1,500 criminal cases stemming from the January 6 attack. One judge said the idea of pardoning the leader of the Oath Keepers, the militia group that attacked the Capitol, was, quote, \"frightening.\" Another called out attempts to rewrite history as disturbing. And that's been on Gonell's mind, too. GONELL: It was a horrible day for - not only for myself, but for my colleagues, and no matter what or how much the other side want to erase it, it won't change that. DREISBACH: Inauguration day is in two weeks. And the tunnel that Aquilino Gonell and other officers defended on January 6, Donald Trump will walk through it to take the oath of office.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nDREISBACH: Aquilino Gonell was a sergeant in the Capitol police. He had served in Iraq with the army, faced roadside bombs and mortar attacks. He later testified that the tunnel brought back memories of war. GONELL: I could feel myself losing oxygen and recall thinking to myself, this is how I'm going to die, defending this entrance. DREISBACH: The police eventually cleared the tunnel and the Capitol. And Gonell survived, his hands bloodied, his shoulders and feet smashed, his eyes stinging from pepper spray. He would later need two surgeries on his shoulder and foot because of the injuries he got on January 6 and the riot-inflamed PTSD for him and many of his fellow officers. GONELL: That day continued to be a constant trauma for us literally every day, whether because our physical or emotional injuries or both. DREISBACH: Gonell's injuries from January 6 ultimately forced him to retire from the Capitol police. But he took his experience and channeled it into speaking out as a witness in court and in Congress and in the presidential race. And so after the election, when Trump won on the promise to pardon the rioters, I called him and asked how he's feeling. GONELL: Honestly, like, betrayed. It feels like sometimes, like, what did I risk my life for? DREISBACH: Some of that betrayal is personal. He defended members of Congress on January 6 as they fled the violence. Then he watched as some Republican lawmakers downplayed January 6 or even supported the rioters. GONELL: The only reason why they made it out was because of actions like - that we, the police officers, took. We did our job and gave them the time to escape, to evacuate, and they seemed to forgotten the fear that Donald Trump's mob made them feel. DREISBACH: It almost sounds like you blame the Republicans in Congress almost more than Trump himself. Is that right? GONELL: Well, if you look at it, I mean, he did what he did and Republican elect officials, they were OK with it. They're all willing to carry water for the former president. DREISBACH: Now that Trump has gone from former president to future president, Gonell is thinking about whether Trump might retaliate against him as both an immigrant and a political opponent. In 2023, Trump reposted a message on social media that, quote, \"the cops should be charged and the protesters should be freed.\" GONELL: I seen people suggesting that my name is on the list of potential retribution, you know, and what they going to get me on? By doing my job? Attesting to what happened to me? DREISBACH: The Trump transition team did not answer my questions about whether they would investigate or prosecute police who protected the Capitol. A spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that, quote, \"the American people did not fall for the left's fearmongering over January 6,\" and went on to say that the administration would pardon people who they claim were denied due process and unfairly prosecuted. Gonell says his feeling of betrayal also runs deeper. He immigrated to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic when he was a kid. He joined the military, became a citizen, deployed in war, protected the Capitol and then spoke out in the election. GONELL: It made me think, was it worth it?

Was it worth it for me and my colleagues to do what we did? DREISBACH: Defending the Capitol or speaking out? GONELL: Both. DREISBACH: It sounds like this experience since the election has shaken your belief in this country. GONELL: I mean, yeah. It's hard not to see it that way. I mean, I had done everything that was asked of me. I love this country and it feels like the country doesn't love me back. You know, I remember when I was in Iraq, I came back for my two weeks' R&R, rest and recuperation. And when I came back, I saw people move on. And that's how I feel now. People move on from that day. Officers like myself, we had not been able to. DREISBACH: That particular kind of American amnesia bothers Gonell. And it's been bothering some of the judges who are still hearing the more than 1,500 criminal cases stemming from the January 6 attack. One judge said the idea of pardoning the leader of the Oath Keepers, the militia group that attacked the Capitol, was, quote, \"frightening.\" Another called out attempts to rewrite history as disturbing. And that's been on Gonell's mind, too.

DREISBACH: Gonell's injuries from January 6 ultimately forced him to retire from the Capitol police. But he took his experience and channeled it into speaking out as a witness in court and in Congress and in the presidential race. And so after the election, when Trump won on the promise to pardon the rioters, I called him and asked how he's feeling. GONELL: Honestly, like, betrayed. It feels like sometimes, like, what did I risk my life for? DREISBACH: Some of that betrayal is personal. He defended members of Congress on January 6 as they fled the violence. Then he watched as some Republican lawmakers downplayed January 6 or even supported the rioters. GONELL: The only reason why they made it out was because of actions like - that we, the police officers, took. We did our job and gave them the time to escape, to evacuate, and they seemed to forgotten the fear that Donald Trump's mob made them feel. DREISBACH: It almost sounds like you blame the Republicans in Congress almost more than Trump himself. Is that right? GONELL: Well, if you look at it, I mean, he did what he did and Republican elect officials, they were OK with it. They're all willing to carry water for the former president. DREISBACH: Now that Trump has gone from former president to future president, Gonell is thinking about whether Trump might retaliate against him as both an immigrant and a political opponent. In 2023, Trump reposted a message on social media that, quote, \"the cops should be charged and the protesters should be freed.\" GONELL: I seen people suggesting that my name is on the list of potential retribution, you know, and what they going to get me on? By doing my job? Attesting to what happened to me? DREISBACH: The Trump transition team did not answer my questions about whether they would investigate or prosecute police who protected the Capitol. A spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that, quote, \"the American people did not fall for the left's fearmongering over January 6,\" and went on to say that the administration would pardon people who they claim were denied due process and unfairly prosecuted. Gonell says his feeling of betrayal also runs deeper. He immigrated to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic when he was a kid.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nGONELL: The only reason why they made it out was because of actions like - that we, the police officers, took. We did our job and gave them the time to escape, to evacuate, and they seemed to forgotten the fear that Donald Trump's mob made them feel. DREISBACH: It almost sounds like you blame the Republicans in Congress almost more than Trump himself. Is that right? GONELL: Well, if you look at it, I mean, he did what he did and Republican elect officials, they were OK with it. They're all willing to carry water for the former president. DREISBACH: Now that Trump has gone from former president to future president, Gonell is thinking about whether Trump might retaliate against him as both an immigrant and a political opponent. In 2023, Trump reposted a message on social media that, quote, \"the cops should be charged and the protesters should be freed.\" GONELL: I seen people suggesting that my name is on the list of potential retribution, you know, and what they going to get me on? By doing my job? Attesting to what happened to me? DREISBACH: The Trump transition team did not answer my questions about whether they would investigate or prosecute police who protected the Capitol. A spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that, quote, \"the American people did not fall for the left's fearmongering over January 6,\" and went on to say that the administration would pardon people who they claim were denied due process and unfairly prosecuted. Gonell says his feeling of betrayal also runs deeper. He immigrated to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic when he was a kid. He joined the military, became a citizen, deployed in war, protected the Capitol and then spoke out in the election. GONELL: It made me think, was it worth it? Was it worth it for me and my colleagues to do what we did? DREISBACH: Defending the Capitol or speaking out? GONELL: Both. DREISBACH: It sounds like this experience since the election has shaken your belief in this country. GONELL: I mean, yeah. It's hard not to see it that way. I mean, I had done everything that was asked of me. I love this country and it feels like the country doesn't love me back. You know, I remember when I was in Iraq, I came back for my two weeks' R&R, rest and recuperation. And when I came back, I saw people move on. And that's how I feel now. People move on from that day. Officers like myself, we had not been able to. DREISBACH: That particular kind of American amnesia bothers Gonell. And it's been bothering some of the judges who are still hearing the more than 1,500 criminal cases stemming from the January 6 attack. One judge said the idea of pardoning the leader of the Oath Keepers, the militia group that attacked the Capitol, was, quote, \"frightening.\" Another called out attempts to rewrite history as disturbing.

      "text": "For Black drivers, a police officer's first 45 words are a portent of what's to come\n\nNell Greenfieldboyce\n\nScientists are studying police camera footage to understand why some car stops of Black men escalate and others don't. Hill Street Studios/Getty Images hide caption\n\nScientists are studying police camera footage to understand why some car stops of Black men escalate and others don't.\n\nWhen a police officer stops a Black driver, the first 45 words said by that officer hold important clues about how their encounter is likely to go.\n\nCar stops that result in a search, handcuffing, or arrest are nearly three times more likely to begin with the police officer issuing a command, such as \"Keep your hands on the wheel\" or \"Turn the car off.\"\n\nThat's according to a new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that examined police body-camera footage of 577 routine car stops involving Black drivers.\n\nEighty-one of these stops ultimately involved searches, handcuffings, or arrests. That kind of outcome was less likely when a police officer's first words provided a reason for the stop.\n\n\"The first 45 words, which is less than 30 seconds on average, spoken by a law enforcement officer during a car stop to a Black driver can be quite telling about how the stop will end,\" says Eugenia Rho , a researcher at Virginia Tech.\n\nAmid the recent high-profile killing of Tyre Nichols and other Black motorists after traffic stops, the findings offer a grim sketch of how police stops can escalate and how Black men recognize the warning signs.\n\nRho and her colleagues focused on Black drivers because this group is stopped by the police at higher rates and are more likely to be handcuffed, searched, and arrested than any other racial group.\n\n\"The car stop is by far the most common way people come into contact with the police,\" says Jennifer Eberhardt , a social psychologist at Stanford University. \"With the spread of body-worn cameras, we now have access to how these interactions unfold in real time.\"\n\nAll of the stops in this study occurred in a racially diverse, medium-sized U.S. city over the course of one month; the researchers won't identify the city for privacy reasons.\n\n\"The vast majority of the stops that we're looking at are stops for routine traffic violations, not for other things that are more serious,\" says Eberhardt.\n\nThe scientists controlled for factors such as the officer's gender and race, as well as the neighborhood crime rate. About 200 officers were involved in these stops.\n\n\"It's not really a function of a few officers driving this pattern,\" says Rho.\n\nThe words or actions of the person behind the wheel of the car didn't seem to contribute to escalation.\n\n\"The drivers are just answering the officers' questions and explaining what's going on,\" says Eberhardt. \"They're cooperative.\"\n\nTo understand how Black men perceive the initial language used by police officers during a car stop, the researchers asked 188 Black men to listen to recordings of the opening moments of car stops.\n\nIt turns out, perhaps not surprisingly, those Black men were highly attuned to the implications of a police officer starting an interaction with a command.\n\n\"When officers began with orders without reasons, Black male participants predicted that the stop would escalate in over 84% of those cases,\" says Rho.\n\nAnd even though none of the stops in this study involved the use of force, Black men worried about the possibility of force 80% of the time when they heard a recording of a law enforcement officer issuing a command without offering a reason.\n\n\"In this country, we know much more about fearing Black people than the fears of Black people,\" says Eberhardt. \"Many Black people fear the police, even in routine car stops. That fear is a fear that could be stoked or set at ease with the first words that an officer speaks.\"\n\nEberhardt notes that millions of people know about the killing of George Floyd in May of 2020 after police officers pulled him from his car, but far fewer people know what happened in the first moments when he was approached by an officer.\n\n\"We analyzed the first 27 seconds of Floyd's encounter with police on that day. And we found that Floyd apologizes to the officers who stand outside his car window, Floyd requests the reason for the stop, he pleads, he explains, he follows orders, he expresses fear,\" she says. \"Yet every response to Floyd is an order.\"\n\nFrom the very beginning, police officers issued commands without giving Floyd an explanation - the same linguistic signature associated with escalation in this study.\n\nTracey Meares , a Yale Law professor and a founding director of the Justice Collaboratory at Yale Law School, reviewed this study and says she found it gratifying to see this kind of social dynamic measured with such precision.\n\n\"It's hard to deny then,\" she says, noting that some communities are rethinking whether they want armed law enforcement to be involved in traffic violations.\n\n\"There are stark racial differences in who is stopped and who's not,\" says Meares, who points out that in the one-month period covered by this study, the city's police officers did 588 stops of Black drivers and only 262 stops of white drivers.\n\nOver 15% of Black drivers experienced an escalated outcome such as a search, handcuffing, or arrest, while less than 1% of white drivers experienced one of those outcomes.\n\n\"They're not drawing any conclusions from that, but these are things we should just be paying attention to,\" says Meares. \"It strains credulity that there are that many more traffic violations.\"\n\nRho says in planning this study, they had initially set out to look at patterns related to traffic stop escalation for white drivers too, but realized that it happened so infrequently for white drivers that there just weren't sufficient numbers to even include them in the analysis.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Justin Garcia/Pool Las Cruces Bulletin hide caption\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. - A former police officer was found guilty Wednesday of voluntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a Black man during a 2022 confrontation at a New Mexico gas station.\n\nLas Cruces police Officer Brad Lunsford's verdict in a jury trial is the latest outcome in cases that prosecutors have linked to systematic brutality against Black people by members of law enforcement, nearly five years after the May 2020 killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis.\n\nLunsford, who is white, had pleaded not guilty. His attorney, Jose Coronado, said he will ask the judge to review the verdict for its legal sufficiency.\n\n\"While I respect the jury's verdict, I am extremely disappointed in it. I don't believe the state met its burden,\" he said in an email to The Associated Press.\n\nProsecutors said he shot Presley Eze at point-blank range in a scuffle after police responded to a 911 call from a gas station attendant who reported that Eze stole beer. Eze allegedly placed his hand on a second officer's stun gun before being shot.\n\nAttorney General Raúl Torrez said the use of deadly force was not reasonable, noting that Lunsford immediately drew his service weapon and shot Eze in the back of the head.\n\n\"Today's verdict reaffirms a fundamental principle: no one is above the law - not even those sworn to uphold it. Officer Lunsford's actions were not just a tragic lapse in judgment; they were an egregious abuse of power that cost Presley Eze his life,\" Torrez said in a statement after the verdict was announced.\n\nThe charge of voluntary manslaughter with a firearms enhancement carries a possible sentence of up to nine years in prison. Evidence at trial included police body camera video of the confrontation, in which police pulled Eze from a vehicle and the struggle ensued.\n\nPhilip Stinson, a professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, said most fatal shootings by on-duty officers are determined to be legally justified under precedent stemming from two 1980s-era U.S. Supreme Court rulings.\n\n\"It is incredibly difficult for a prosecutor to obtain a conviction in a jury trial in one of these cases, and that's because jurors are very reluctant to second guess the split-second, often life-or-death decisions of an on-duty police officer in a potentially violent street encounter,\" Stinson said. \"Anything can happen, but it's only in the most egregious cases.\"\n\nRecords compiled by Stinson, university colleagues and students through the Police Integrity Research Group show that 205 nonfederal law enforcement officers have been arrested on criminal charges of homicide or manslaughter over the past 20 years, resulting in 66 convictions, 27 convictions of them for manslaughter or homicide.\n\n\"If you do get a conviction, it's often for the lesser offense,\" Stinson said.\n\nMore than 900 fatal shootings by on-duty state and local law enforcement officers typically take place each year in the U.S., he said\n\nIn pursuing a criminal charge against Lunsford, Torrez described the killing of Eze as a tragedy and \"yet another example of poor police tactics resulting in an unjustifiable use of force to subdue an individual resisting arrest for the commission of a minor crime.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Tipping at the beginning of his memorial service on Wednesday, June 22, in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department officer who was killed during a training exercise, in what officials called a \"tragic accident,\" was allegedly targeted for investigating a gang rape by fellow officers, according to his family.\n\nLAPD officer Houston Tipping's mother has filed a wrongful death claim against the city. Lawyer Bradley Gage told NPR that the 32-year-old was deliberately assaulted after submitting reports concerning a female victim who claims she was raped by four LAPD officers, including one who was part of the training during which Tipping was killed.\n\n\"They used that training as a cover to kill him in retaliation for his whistleblowing activity,\" Gage said.\n\nGage said Tipping became aware of the alleged assault when a female victim told him about the attack, identifying the accused rapists by the names on their name tags. Tipping immediately began looking into the woman's reports, moving it \"on up the chain, \" Gage said.\n\nTipping, a five-year veteran and bike instructor with the department, suffered a spinal injury during a practice drill covering self-defense tactics at a May 26 LAPD training academy. Tipping was role-playing the part of an uncooperative \"suspect\" and charged an unnamed officer in the scenario. The two tussled for a short time before the unnamed officer allegedly dropped Tipping on his head, causing a catastrophic injury to his spine, according to the department. The incident caused Tipping to go into cardiac arrest, and he died three days later, having never regained consciousness.\n\nAn investigation states that 18 officers and one sergeant witnessed the deadly tussle. LAPD officials have repeatedly stated that there was no video or audio recording of the training.\n\nThe department did not respond to NPR's request for comment regarding Gage's claims about the incident or the alleged sexual assault.\n\nGage disputes the official account, arguing that Tipping was beaten by several officers who \"repeatedly struck [him] in the head and body severely enough that he bled, required stitches, suffered a lacerated liver and three broken ribs.\" He said UCLA medical experts who have reviewed Tipping's autopsy report concluded that the officer's injuries do not square with the department's version of events.\n\n\"If it happened the way they say it happened, how did he end up with six staples in his head and a lacerated liver?\" Gage asked.\n\nThe LAPD has said many of Tipping's injuries were the result of attempts to revive him at the academy. Again, Gage claims that is untrue. He said medical records obtained by his legal team show that a LUCAS device, which works as an automatic CPR machine and that was in the training room at the time, was not turned on.\n\n\"Had they used the device, it could explain the broken ribs, but we know it was never used,\" Gage said.\n\nHe added: \"The LAPD also tried to claim that the broken ribs could be a cause of the perforated liver. But as I understand it, the ribs were on the opposite side of the liver.\"\n\nAnd regardless of the differing accounts given by the officers who were present, Gage said LAPD training guidelines state that a person is not supposed to be lifted off the ground.\n\n\"When you look at all these horrific injuries, the truth is something went seriously wrong here,\" he said. \"This raises a number of questions that the family would like to have answered.\"\n\nOn Tuesday the LAPD presented a report on Tipping's death to the Los Angeles Police Commission. It is the first detailed public accounting the LAPD has offered of the fatal incident.\n\n\"This was not a mob attack, as has been alleged, rather (a one-on-one scenario in) which was Officer Tipping playing the role as a suspect in order to help officers learn how to deal with that one individual,\" Lizabeth Rhodes, director of the Office of Constitutional Policing and Policy, told the city Police Commission.\n\nThe same scenario had been run about 10 times before Tipping took a turn, she explained.\n\nRhodes told the commission that Tipping was instructed to aggressively attack a trainee officer, pretending to be a suspect. According to witness reports, the trainee struck Tipping in a leg with a foam baton and he reacted \"as he was supposed to in this scenario, by going down on one knee to simulate a successful baton strike.\"\n\nTipping did not stay down, according to Rhodes.\n\n\"Officer Tipping then lifted the officer, the student officer, from the ground and the student officer's arm went around Officer Tipping's neck, wrapping toward the front of Officer Tipping's cheek and throat. As the two fell to the floor, Officer Tipping's neck remained in that grasp,\" Rhodes said.\n\nShe said it was immediately clear that Tipping, who was \"struggling to speak,\" was injured, prompting the officers in the training session to begin first-aid efforts.\n\n\"The coroner's office determined that this was an accident, as did the department,\" Rhodes said. \"It was a tragic accident and again we express our condolences.\"\n\nThe department has made recommendations to improve the bicycle patrol school, including training safety.

Pool Court TV/AP hide caption\n\nMINNEAPOLIS - Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of killing George Floyd, was transferred to a federal prison in Texas almost nine months after he was stabbed in a different facility, the federal Bureau of Prisons told The Associated Press on Tuesday.\n\nChauvin, 47, is now housed at the Federal Correctional Institution in Big Spring, a low-security prison. He was previously held in Arizona at FCI Tucson in August 2022 to simultaneously serve a 21-year federal sentence for violating Floyd's civil rights and a 22 1/2-year state sentence for second-degree murder.\n\nThe transfer comes nearly nine months after Chauvin was stabbed 22 times in prison by a former gang leader and one-time FBI informant.\n\nAnother former Minneapolis officer, Thomas Lane, who held down Floyd's legs as the man struggled to breathe, was released from federal prison in Colorado on Tuesday, the Bureau of Prisons said. Lane, 41, was serving a three year sentence for aiding and abetting manslaughter.\n\nWhen Lane pleaded guilty, he admitted that he intentionally helped restrain Floyd in a way that he knew created an unreasonable risk and caused his death. He admitted that he heard Floyd say he couldn't breathe, knew Floyd fell silent, had no pulse and appeared to have lost consciousness.\n\nFloyd, 46, died in May 2020 after Chauvin, who is white, pinned him to the ground with a knee on Floyd's neck as the Black man repeatedly said he couldn't breathe. Lane, who is white, held down Floyd's legs. J. Alexander Kueng, who is Black, knelt on Floyd's back, and Tou Thao, who is Hmong American, kept bystanders from intervening during the 9 1/2-minute restraint.\n\nKueng and Thao are both set to be released in 2025. Kueng is detained at a federal prison in Ohio and Thao at a facility in Kentucky, according to Bureau of Prisons records.\n\nThe killing, captured on bystander video, sparked protests in 2020 as part of a worldwide reckoning over racial injustice .\n\nLane is the first of the four officers convicted of crimes related to Floyd's killing to be released from prison. He served time for a federal sentence alongside his state sentence after being convicted of violating Floyd's civil rights.\n\nChauvin is making a longshot bid to overturn his federal guilty plea, claiming new evidence shows he didn't cause Floyd's death. If he is unsuccessful, he would not be released until 2038.\n\nJohn Turscak, who is serving a 30-year sentence for crimes committed while a member of the Mexican Mafia prison gang, attacked Chauvin on Nov. 24, 2023. He told investigators he targeted the ex-Minneapolis police officer because of his notoriety for killing Floyd.\n\nFCI Tucson, a medium-security prison, has been plagued by security lapses and staffing shortages. Chauvin's lawyer at the time, Eric Nelson, had advocated for keeping him out of the general population and away from other inmates, anticipating he would be a target.\n\nTurscak, who was charged with attempted murder, told correctional officers he would have killed Chauvin had they not responded so quickly.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "An officer who was attacked on January 6 says he still lives with the aftermath\n\nTom Dreisbach\n\nThe crowd at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, attacked police officer Daniel Hodges. Now he lives with the aftermath, which includes online threats and harassment.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST: Thank you for joining us on what's become a somber date in U.S. history. Three years ago today, a violent mob supporting then-President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C. Rioters forced the vice president and members of Congress into hiding, temporarily halted the peaceful transfer of power and injured 140 police officers. Even today, the FBI continues to seek dozens of people who assaulted police with pepper spray, bats, stolen police batons and other weapons. NPR investigative correspondent Tom Dreisbach spoke to one officer who was there that day, who was attacked, and who still suffers the effects of that violence along with so many of his fellow officers. And just to caution - some of the audio here is tough to listen to. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE: The January 6 attack was one of the most recorded events in American history - recorded by surveillance footage, news cameras and the rioters themselves. And of all those images, one has stuck out. (CROSSTALK) DREISBACH: You see an officer at the front of a police line. One rioter rips his helmet and gas mask off, another blasts pepper spray, and the crowd appears to crush the officer with a stolen police shield. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DANIEL HODGES: (Screaming). DREISBACH: The officer screaming is named Daniel Hodges. HODGES: I was assaulted many times throughout the day. I was beaten, punched, kicked, pushed, beaten with my own riot baton in the head, crushed with a police shield. Someone tried to gouge out one of my eyes. DREISBACH: Hodges is an officer with D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department. He told me he could not speak for his department - just for himself. But in seven years of policing, he said he's never seen anything like January 6. And since that day, he's testified in criminal trials against the men who assaulted him, and he's also testified in Colorado as part of the legal effort to keep Trump off the ballot for allegedly engaging in insurrection. HODGES: I'm a living primary source of what occurred on one of the most important days in American history - in recent American history - so I feel like I have a moral obligation to continue fighting the disinformation and the lies that are coming out because of the profound impacts misinformation can have. People ask me, you know how I am. And I tell them that I've been very fortunate, both physically and mentally, which is true. I didn't suffer any permanent injuries that I know of, and, you know, 90% of the time, I'm fine talking about it. But in court, it becomes very real. It's a very intense experience when you're testifying about it, and it all sort of comes rushing back. So it can catch you off-guard mentally that way. DREISBACH: How does that manifest when you're - you know, you're kind of brought back to the moment? HODGES: You look at video of that day as they play it in court because it's an important exhibit, and, you know, you're there again. It lessens as time goes on, but it still definitely makes an impact on you. You know, if you sort of detach yourself from it and look down and compartmentalize, then you can address each individual thing as it happened. But if you think about the totality of the circumstances and how, you know, so many Americans were trying to essentially overthrow the United States government, whether they admit it or not, it's overwhelming. And then there's the leadership - the political figures, the media figures - who know better, who know the truth, but still insist today that there was no insurrection, that it was hugs and kisses, that they were antifa dressed up as Trump supporters, that I'm a lizard person, that - you know, whatever conspiracy theory you want. It's maddening, and it's crazy. And it shouldn't be this way, but it is. DREISBACH: Has that - any of that talk escalated to threats against you? HODGES: Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, yeah. After I testified in Colorado, I started getting a lot of threats online. There was people sending me, like, explicit snuff of suicides and telling me to kill myself. DREISBACH: Like, videos of people killing themselves... HODGES: Yeah. DREISBACH: ...They sent to you. HODGES: Yeah, yeah - and, like, pictures of me - my head pasted on top of instructions for how to strangle yourself. Just - nobody said the words, I am going to kill you, but everything but, you know? DREISBACH: Do you have to take any extra steps in your life to protect yourself in the face of that? HODGES: No, no. DREISBACH: No. HODGES: I mean, I wear a gun to work. I wear a bulletproof vest. DREISBACH: That's right, yeah. HODGES: What am I going to do that I don't do already, right? DREISBACH: So I want to talk about what Trump has said about January 6. He has promised repeatedly, since the beginning of 2022, to pardon January 6 defendants. Have you thought about the possibility that, you know, the men who were convicted of assaulting you might be let free and how that would feel? HODGES: Yeah, yeah. I mean, what can I say? It's - they were tried and found guilty, or they pled guilty. They know what they're guilty of. I think some of them are remorseful, and many of them are not. Unless you have, you know, reason to believe that they're not, you have to try to hope that they're being honest when they say that they have remorse. Otherwise, you know, what's the point? Why do we hold out hope that we can ever unify the country again if we don't believe that people can change? DREISBACH: I think I've heard you talk about the notion of finding and getting justice for what happened on January 6, and I wonder what that means to you. Like, what is getting justice for what happened? HODGES: I mean, it's such a big word, a big concept. DREISBACH: Yeah. HODGES: And it stretches across all different striations of those involved, whether it be, you know, the foot soldiers on the ground, the people in Congress who tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power with their votes, and Trump himself. So how do we achieve justice for all those different kinds of people in every sense of the word? Well, there's the criminal aspect. There's the legal system. There's the justice system that - as an outsider looking in, it appears to be doing the best it can. They're still making arrests today, even years on. It lets everybody know that, you know, we're still coming. It doesn't matter how many people there were - that we're still investigating, and we will find you and make sure that you have your day in court. DREISBACH: Well, Officer Hodges, thank you so much for making this time. HODGES: Thank you for having me out.

And then there's the leadership - the political figures, the media figures - who know better, who know the truth, but still insist today that there was no insurrection, that it was hugs and kisses, that they were antifa dressed up as Trump supporters, that I'm a lizard person, that - you know, whatever conspiracy theory you want. It's maddening, and it's crazy. And it shouldn't be this way, but it is. DREISBACH: Has that - any of that talk escalated to threats against you? HODGES: Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, yeah. After I testified in Colorado, I started getting a lot of threats online. There was people sending me, like, explicit snuff of suicides and telling me to kill myself. DREISBACH: Like, videos of people killing themselves... HODGES: Yeah. DREISBACH: ...They sent to you. HODGES: Yeah, yeah - and, like, pictures of me - my head pasted on top of instructions for how to strangle yourself. Just - nobody said the words, I am going to kill you, but everything but, you know? DREISBACH: Do you have to take any extra steps in your life to protect yourself in the face of that? HODGES: No, no. DREISBACH: No. HODGES: I mean, I wear a gun to work. I wear a bulletproof vest. DREISBACH: That's right, yeah. HODGES: What am I going to do that I don't do already, right? DREISBACH: So I want to talk about what Trump has said about January 6. He has promised repeatedly, since the beginning of 2022, to pardon January 6 defendants. Have you thought about the possibility that, you know, the men who were convicted of assaulting you might be let free and how that would feel? HODGES: Yeah, yeah. I mean, what can I say? It's - they were tried and found guilty, or they pled guilty. They know what they're guilty of. I think some of them are remorseful, and many of them are not. Unless you have, you know, reason to believe that they're not, you have to try to hope that they're being honest when they say that they have remorse. Otherwise, you know, what's the point? Why do we hold out hope that we can ever unify the country again if we don't believe that people can change? DREISBACH: I think I've heard you talk about the notion of finding and getting justice for what happened on January 6, and I wonder what that means to you. Like, what is getting justice for what happened? HODGES: I mean, it's such a big word, a big concept. DREISBACH: Yeah. HODGES: And it stretches across all different striations of those involved, whether it be, you know, the foot soldiers on the ground, the people in Congress who tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power with their votes, and Trump himself. So how do we achieve justice for all those different kinds of people in every sense of the word? Well, there's the criminal aspect. There's the legal system. There's the justice system that - as an outsider looking in, it appears to be doing the best it can. They're still making arrests today, even years on. It lets everybody know that, you know, we're still coming. It doesn't matter how many people there were - that we're still investigating, and we will find you and make sure that you have your day in court. DREISBACH: Well, Officer Hodges, thank you so much for making this time. HODGES: Thank you for having me out.

And of all those images, one has stuck out. (CROSSTALK) DREISBACH: You see an officer at the front of a police line. One rioter rips his helmet and gas mask off, another blasts pepper spray, and the crowd appears to crush the officer with a stolen police shield. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DANIEL HODGES: (Screaming). DREISBACH: The officer screaming is named Daniel Hodges. HODGES: I was assaulted many times throughout the day. I was beaten, punched, kicked, pushed, beaten with my own riot baton in the head, crushed with a police shield. Someone tried to gouge out one of my eyes. DREISBACH: Hodges is an officer with D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department. He told me he could not speak for his department - just for himself. But in seven years of policing, he said he's never seen anything like January 6. And since that day, he's testified in criminal trials against the men who assaulted him, and he's also testified in Colorado as part of the legal effort to keep Trump off the ballot for allegedly engaging in insurrection. HODGES: I'm a living primary source of what occurred on one of the most important days in American history - in recent American history - so I feel like I have a moral obligation to continue fighting the disinformation and the lies that are coming out because of the profound impacts misinformation can have. People ask me, you know how I am. And I tell them that I've been very fortunate, both physically and mentally, which is true. I didn't suffer any permanent injuries that I know of, and, you know, 90% of the time, I'm fine talking about it. But in court, it becomes very real. It's a very intense experience when you're testifying about it, and it all sort of comes rushing back. So it can catch you off-guard mentally that way. DREISBACH: How does that manifest when you're - you know, you're kind of brought back to the moment? HODGES: You look at video of that day as they play it in court because it's an important exhibit, and, you know, you're there again. It lessens as time goes on, but it still definitely makes an impact on you. You know, if you sort of detach yourself from it and look down and compartmentalize, then you can address each individual thing as it happened. But if you think about the totality of the circumstances and how, you know, so many Americans were trying to essentially overthrow the United States government, whether they admit it or not, it's overwhelming.

DREISBACH: So I want to talk about what Trump has said about January 6. He has promised repeatedly, since the beginning of 2022, to pardon January 6 defendants. Have you thought about the possibility that, you know, the men who were convicted of assaulting you might be let free and how that would feel? HODGES: Yeah, yeah. I mean, what can I say? It's - they were tried and found guilty, or they pled guilty. They know what they're guilty of. I think some of them are remorseful, and many of them are not. Unless you have, you know, reason to believe that they're not, you have to try to hope that they're being honest when they say that they have remorse. Otherwise, you know, what's the point? Why do we hold out hope that we can ever unify the country again if we don't believe that people can change? DREISBACH: I think I've heard you talk about the notion of finding and getting justice for what happened on January 6, and I wonder what that means to you. Like, what is getting justice for what happened? HODGES: I mean, it's such a big word, a big concept. DREISBACH: Yeah. HODGES: And it stretches across all different striations of those involved, whether it be, you know, the foot soldiers on the ground, the people in Congress who tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power with their votes, and Trump himself. So how do we achieve justice for all those different kinds of people in every sense of the word? Well, there's the criminal aspect. There's the legal system. There's the justice system that - as an outsider looking in, it appears to be doing the best it can. They're still making arrests today, even years on. It lets everybody know that, you know, we're still coming. It doesn't matter how many people there were - that we're still investigating, and we will find you and make sure that you have your day in court. DREISBACH: Well, Officer Hodges, thank you so much for making this time. HODGES: Thank you for having me out.

One rioter rips his helmet and gas mask off, another blasts pepper spray, and the crowd appears to crush the officer with a stolen police shield. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DANIEL HODGES: (Screaming). DREISBACH: The officer screaming is named Daniel Hodges. HODGES: I was assaulted many times throughout the day. I was beaten, punched, kicked, pushed, beaten with my own riot baton in the head, crushed with a police shield. Someone tried to gouge out one of my eyes. DREISBACH: Hodges is an officer with D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department. He told me he could not speak for his department - just for himself. But in seven years of policing, he said he's never seen anything like January 6. And since that day, he's testified in criminal trials against the men who assaulted him, and he's also testified in Colorado as part of the legal effort to keep Trump off the ballot for allegedly engaging in insurrection. HODGES: I'm a living primary source of what occurred on one of the most important days in American history - in recent American history - so I feel like I have a moral obligation to continue fighting the disinformation and the lies that are coming out because of the profound impacts misinformation can have. People ask me, you know how I am. And I tell them that I've been very fortunate, both physically and mentally, which is true. I didn't suffer any permanent injuries that I know of, and, you know, 90% of the time, I'm fine talking about it. But in court, it becomes very real. It's a very intense experience when you're testifying about it, and it all sort of comes rushing back. So it can catch you off-guard mentally that way. DREISBACH: How does that manifest when you're - you know, you're kind of brought back to the moment? HODGES: You look at video of that day as they play it in court because it's an important exhibit, and, you know, you're there again. It lessens as time goes on, but it still definitely makes an impact on you. You know, if you sort of detach yourself from it and look down and compartmentalize, then you can address each individual thing as it happened. But if you think about the totality of the circumstances and how, you know, so many Americans were trying to essentially overthrow the United States government, whether they admit it or not, it's overwhelming. And then there's the leadership - the political figures, the media figures - who know better, who know the truth, but still insist today that there was no insurrection, that it was hugs and kisses, that they were antifa dressed up as Trump supporters, that I'm a lizard person, that - you know, whatever conspiracy theory you want. It's maddening, and it's crazy. And it shouldn't be this way, but it is. DREISBACH: Has that - any of that talk escalated to threats against you? HODGES: Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, yeah. After I testified in Colorado, I started getting a lot of threats online. There was people sending me, like, explicit snuff of suicides and telling me to kill myself. DREISBACH: Like, videos of people killing themselves... HODGES: Yeah. DREISBACH: ...They sent to you. HODGES: Yeah, yeah - and, like, pictures of me - my head pasted on top of instructions for how to strangle yourself. Just - nobody said the words, I am going to kill you, but everything but, you know? DREISBACH: Do you have to take any extra steps in your life to protect yourself in the face of that? HODGES: No, no. DREISBACH: No. HODGES: I mean, I wear a gun to work. I wear a bulletproof vest. DREISBACH: That's right, yeah. HODGES: What am I going to do that I don't do already, right?

I was beaten, punched, kicked, pushed, beaten with my own riot baton in the head, crushed with a police shield. Someone tried to gouge out one of my eyes. DREISBACH: Hodges is an officer with D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department. He told me he could not speak for his department - just for himself. But in seven years of policing, he said he's never seen anything like January 6. And since that day, he's testified in criminal trials against the men who assaulted him, and he's also testified in Colorado as part of the legal effort to keep Trump off the ballot for allegedly engaging in insurrection. HODGES: I'm a living primary source of what occurred on one of the most important days in American history - in recent American history - so I feel like I have a moral obligation to continue fighting the disinformation and the lies that are coming out because of the profound impacts misinformation can have. People ask me, you know how I am. And I tell them that I've been very fortunate, both physically and mentally, which is true. I didn't suffer any permanent injuries that I know of, and, you know, 90% of the time, I'm fine talking about it. But in court, it becomes very real. It's a very intense experience when you're testifying about it, and it all sort of comes rushing back. So it can catch you off-guard mentally that way. DREISBACH: How does that manifest when you're - you know, you're kind of brought back to the moment? HODGES: You look at video of that day as they play it in court because it's an important exhibit, and, you know, you're there again. It lessens as time goes on, but it still definitely makes an impact on you. You know, if you sort of detach yourself from it and look down and compartmentalize, then you can address each individual thing as it happened. But if you think about the totality of the circumstances and how, you know, so many Americans were trying to essentially overthrow the United States government, whether they admit it or not, it's overwhelming. And then there's the leadership - the political figures, the media figures - who know better, who know the truth, but still insist today that there was no insurrection, that it was hugs and kisses, that they were antifa dressed up as Trump supporters, that I'm a lizard person, that - you know, whatever conspiracy theory you want. It's maddening, and it's crazy. And it shouldn't be this way, but it is. DREISBACH: Has that - any of that talk escalated to threats against you? HODGES: Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, yeah. After I testified in Colorado, I started getting a lot of threats online. There was people sending me, like, explicit snuff of suicides and telling me to kill myself. DREISBACH: Like, videos of people killing themselves... HODGES: Yeah. DREISBACH: ...They sent to you. HODGES: Yeah, yeah - and, like, pictures of me - my head pasted on top of instructions for how to strangle yourself. Just - nobody said the words, I am going to kill you, but everything but, you know? DREISBACH: Do you have to take any extra steps in your life to protect yourself in the face of that? HODGES: No, no. DREISBACH: No. HODGES: I mean, I wear a gun to work. I wear a bulletproof vest. DREISBACH: That's right, yeah. HODGES: What am I going to do that I don't do already, right? DREISBACH: So I want to talk about what Trump has said about January 6. He has promised repeatedly, since the beginning of 2022, to pardon January 6 defendants. Have you thought about the possibility that, you know, the men who were convicted of assaulting you might be let free and how that would feel? HODGES: Yeah, yeah. I mean, what can I say? It's - they were tried and found guilty, or they pled guilty. They know what they're guilty of. I think some of them are remorseful, and many of them are not. Unless you have, you know, reason to believe that they're not, you have to try to hope that they're being honest when they say that they have remorse. Otherwise, you know, what's the point? Why do we hold out hope that we can ever unify the country again if we don't believe that people can change? DREISBACH: I think I've heard you talk about the notion of finding and getting justice for what happened on January 6, and I wonder what that means to you. Like, what is getting justice for what happened? HODGES: I mean, it's such a big word, a big concept. DREISBACH: Yeah. HODGES: And it stretches across all different striations of those involved, whether it be, you know, the foot soldiers on the ground, the people in Congress who tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power with their votes, and Trump himself. So how do we achieve justice for all those different kinds of people in every sense of the word? Well, there's the criminal aspect. There's the legal system. There's the justice system that - as an outsider looking in, it appears to be doing the best it can. They're still making arrests today, even years on. It lets everybody know that, you know, we're still coming. It doesn't matter how many people there were - that we're still investigating, and we will find you and make sure that you have your day in court. DREISBACH: Well, Officer Hodges, thank you so much for making this time. HODGES: Thank you for having me out.

Unless you have, you know, reason to believe that they're not, you have to try to hope that they're being honest when they say that they have remorse. Otherwise, you know, what's the point? Why do we hold out hope that we can ever unify the country again if we don't believe that people can change? DREISBACH: I think I've heard you talk about the notion of finding and getting justice for what happened on January 6, and I wonder what that means to you. Like, what is getting justice for what happened? HODGES: I mean, it's such a big word, a big concept. DREISBACH: Yeah. HODGES: And it stretches across all different striations of those involved, whether it be, you know, the foot soldiers on the ground, the people in Congress who tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power with their votes, and Trump himself. So how do we achieve justice for all those different kinds of people in every sense of the word? Well, there's the criminal aspect. There's the legal system. There's the justice system that - as an outsider looking in, it appears to be doing the best it can. They're still making arrests today, even years on. It lets everybody know that, you know, we're still coming. It doesn't matter how many people there were - that we're still investigating, and we will find you and make sure that you have your day in court. DREISBACH: Well, Officer Hodges, thank you so much for making this time. HODGES: Thank you for having me out.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nHODGES: I'm a living primary source of what occurred on one of the most important days in American history - in recent American history - so I feel like I have a moral obligation to continue fighting the disinformation and the lies that are coming out because of the profound impacts misinformation can have. People ask me, you know how I am. And I tell them that I've been very fortunate, both physically and mentally, which is true. I didn't suffer any permanent injuries that I know of, and, you know, 90% of the time, I'm fine talking about it. But in court, it becomes very real. It's a very intense experience when you're testifying about it, and it all sort of comes rushing back. So it can catch you off-guard mentally that way. DREISBACH: How does that manifest when you're - you know, you're kind of brought back to the moment? HODGES: You look at video of that day as they play it in court because it's an important exhibit, and, you know, you're there again. It lessens as time goes on, but it still definitely makes an impact on you. You know, if you sort of detach yourself from it and look down and compartmentalize, then you can address each individual thing as it happened. But if you think about the totality of the circumstances and how, you know, so many Americans were trying to essentially overthrow the United States government, whether they admit it or not, it's overwhelming. And then there's the leadership - the political figures, the media figures - who know better, who know the truth, but still insist today that there was no insurrection, that it was hugs and kisses, that they were antifa dressed up as Trump supporters, that I'm a lizard person, that - you know, whatever conspiracy theory you want. It's maddening, and it's crazy. And it shouldn't be this way, but it is. DREISBACH: Has that - any of that talk escalated to threats against you? HODGES: Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, yeah. After I testified in Colorado, I started getting a lot of threats online. There was people sending me, like, explicit snuff of suicides and telling me to kill myself. DREISBACH: Like, videos of people killing themselves... HODGES: Yeah. DREISBACH: ...They sent to you. HODGES: Yeah, yeah - and, like, pictures of me - my head pasted on top of instructions for how to strangle yourself. Just - nobody said the words, I am going to kill you, but everything but, you know? DREISBACH: Do you have to take any extra steps in your life to protect yourself in the face of that? HODGES: No, no. DREISBACH: No. HODGES: I mean, I wear a gun to work. I wear a bulletproof vest. DREISBACH: That's right, yeah. HODGES: What am I going to do that I don't do already, right? DREISBACH: So I want to talk about what Trump has said about January 6. He has promised repeatedly, since the beginning of 2022, to pardon January 6 defendants. Have you thought about the possibility that, you know, the men who were convicted of assaulting you might be let free and how that would feel? HODGES: Yeah, yeah. I mean, what can I say? It's - they were tried and found guilty, or they pled guilty. They know what they're guilty of. I think some of them are remorseful, and many of them are not.

HODGES: And it stretches across all different striations of those involved, whether it be, you know, the foot soldiers on the ground, the people in Congress who tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power with their votes, and Trump himself. So how do we achieve justice for all those different kinds of people in every sense of the word? Well, there's the criminal aspect. There's the legal system. There's the justice system that - as an outsider looking in, it appears to be doing the best it can. They're still making arrests today, even years on. It lets everybody know that, you know, we're still coming. It doesn't matter how many people there were - that we're still investigating, and we will find you and make sure that you have your day in court. DREISBACH: Well, Officer Hodges, thank you so much for making this time. HODGES: Thank you for having me out.

It's maddening, and it's crazy. And it shouldn't be this way, but it is. DREISBACH: Has that - any of that talk escalated to threats against you? HODGES: Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, yeah. After I testified in Colorado, I started getting a lot of threats online. There was people sending me, like, explicit snuff of suicides and telling me to kill myself. DREISBACH: Like, videos of people killing themselves... HODGES: Yeah. DREISBACH: ...They sent to you. HODGES: Yeah, yeah - and, like, pictures of me - my head pasted on top of instructions for how to strangle yourself. Just - nobody said the words, I am going to kill you, but everything but, you know? DREISBACH: Do you have to take any extra steps in your life to protect yourself in the face of that? HODGES: No, no. DREISBACH: No. HODGES: I mean, I wear a gun to work. I wear a bulletproof vest. DREISBACH: That's right, yeah. HODGES: What am I going to do that I don't do already, right? DREISBACH: So I want to talk about what Trump has said about January 6. He has promised repeatedly, since the beginning of 2022, to pardon January 6 defendants. Have you thought about the possibility that, you know, the men who were convicted of assaulting you might be let free and how that would feel? HODGES: Yeah, yeah. I mean, what can I say? It's - they were tried and found guilty, or they pled guilty. They know what they're guilty of. I think some of them are remorseful, and many of them are not. Unless you have, you know, reason to believe that they're not, you have to try to hope that they're being honest when they say that they have remorse. Otherwise, you know, what's the point? Why do we hold out hope that we can ever unify the country again if we don't believe that people can change? DREISBACH: I think I've heard you talk about the notion of finding and getting justice for what happened on January 6, and I wonder what that means to you.

Why do we hold out hope that we can ever unify the country again if we don't believe that people can change? DREISBACH: I think I've heard you talk about the notion of finding and getting justice for what happened on January 6, and I wonder what that means to you. Like, what is getting justice for what happened? HODGES: I mean, it's such a big word, a big concept. DREISBACH: Yeah. HODGES: And it stretches across all different striations of those involved, whether it be, you know, the foot soldiers on the ground, the people in Congress who tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power with their votes, and Trump himself. So how do we achieve justice for all those different kinds of people in every sense of the word? Well, there's the criminal aspect. There's the legal system. There's the justice system that - as an outsider looking in, it appears to be doing the best it can. They're still making arrests today, even years on. It lets everybody know that, you know, we're still coming. It doesn't matter how many people there were - that we're still investigating, and we will find you and make sure that you have your day in court. DREISBACH: Well, Officer Hodges, thank you so much for making this time. HODGES: Thank you for having me out.

HODGES: Yeah, yeah - and, like, pictures of me - my head pasted on top of instructions for how to strangle yourself. Just - nobody said the words, I am going to kill you, but everything but, you know? DREISBACH: Do you have to take any extra steps in your life to protect yourself in the face of that? HODGES: No, no. DREISBACH: No. HODGES: I mean, I wear a gun to work. I wear a bulletproof vest. DREISBACH: That's right, yeah. HODGES: What am I going to do that I don't do already, right? DREISBACH: So I want to talk about what Trump has said about January 6. He has promised repeatedly, since the beginning of 2022, to pardon January 6 defendants. Have you thought about the possibility that, you know, the men who were convicted of assaulting you might be let free and how that would feel? HODGES: Yeah, yeah. I mean, what can I say? It's - they were tried and found guilty, or they pled guilty. They know what they're guilty of. I think some of them are remorseful, and many of them are not.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nDREISBACH: That's right, yeah. HODGES: What am I going to do that I don't do already, right? DREISBACH: So I want to talk about what Trump has said about January 6. He has promised repeatedly, since the beginning of 2022, to pardon January 6 defendants. Have you thought about the possibility that, you know, the men who were convicted of assaulting you might be let free and how that would feel? HODGES: Yeah, yeah. I mean, what can I say? It's - they were tried and found guilty, or they pled guilty. They know what they're guilty of. I think some of them are remorseful, and many of them are not. Unless you have, you know, reason to believe that they're not, you have to try to hope that they're being honest when they say that they have remorse. Otherwise, you know, what's the point? Why do we hold out hope that we can ever unify the country again if we don't believe that people can change? DREISBACH: I think I've heard you talk about the notion of finding and getting justice for what happened on January 6, and I wonder what that means to you. Like, what is getting justice for what happened? HODGES: I mean, it's such a big word, a big concept. DREISBACH: Yeah. HODGES: And it stretches across all different striations of those involved, whether it be, you know, the foot soldiers on the ground, the people in Congress who tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power with their votes, and Trump himself. So how do we achieve justice for all those different kinds of people in every sense of the word? Well, there's the criminal aspect. There's the legal system. There's the justice system that - as an outsider looking in, it appears to be doing the best it can. They're still making arrests today, even years on. It lets everybody know that, you know, we're still coming. It doesn't matter how many people there were - that we're still investigating, and we will find you and make sure that you have your day in court.

      "text": "Former officer testifies he beat a 'helpless' Tyre Nichols then lied about it\n\nBy\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nEmmitt Martin III, a former Memphis police officer (second from left) walks into federal court on Aug. 23 in Memphis, Tenn. Martin testified Tuesday that he punched a \"helpless\" Tyre Nichols. George Walker IV/AP hide caption\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. - A former Memphis police officer testified Tuesday that he punched a \"helpless\" Tyre Nichols at least five times while two colleagues held his arms and said \"hit him,\" then lied to his supervisor about their use of force in a beating that proved fatal .\n\nEmmitt Martin III testified that he was at the traffic stop on Jan, 7, 2023, when Nichols was pulled over and yanked from his car. Nichols fled, and Martin said Tadarrius Bean and Justin Smith gave chase and were punching the 29-year-old man without their handcuffs out when Martin caught up with them.\n\n\"They were assaulting him,\" Martin said Tuesday.\n\nBean, Smith and Demetrius Haley have pleaded not guilty to charges that they deprived Nichols of his civil rights through excessive force and failure to intervene, and obstructed justice through witness tampering.\n\nThe four men, along with Desmond Mills Jr., were fired by the police department after Nichols' death. The beating was caught on police video, which was released to the public . The officers were later indicted by a federal grand jury. Martin and Mills have taken plea deals and are testifying against their former colleagues.\n\nJurors watched video clips as Nichols' mother and stepfather, RowVaughn and Rodney Wells, sat outside the courtroom. RowVaughn Wells has never seen the video. Nichols' brother watched the video inside.\n\nMartin said he was angry that Nichols had run from the traffic stop, and that the team had not yet made any arrests that night.\n\n\"I figured that's what he should get,\" Martin said.\n\nProsecutor Kathryn Gilbert asked Martin whether officers were allowed to use force because they are angry.\n\n\"No ma'am,\" he said, adding that he should have intervened.\n\nMartin said he threw his body camera on the ground.\n\n\"I didn't want to show what we were doing,\" he said. \"We were assaulting Mr. Nichols.\"\n\nMartin said he kicked Nichols, while Mills hit him with a baton. Then Martin said he punched Nichols at least five times while Bean and Smith held his arms and urged Martin on. Officers were holding his arms while also giving him commands to give them his hands.\n\n\"He was helpless,\" Martin said of Nichols.\n\nMartin said he did not tell Lt. Dewayne Smith, his supervisor, about their use of force. Martin said he told Lt. Smith that Nichols was high, without evidence, and that officers lied about Nichols driving into oncoming traffic and taking a swing at them during the traffic stop.\n\nMartin testified that while he felt pressure on his gun belt at the scene of the traffic stop, he never saw Nichols put his hands on his gun. Yet, Martin said, he told his supervisor that Nichols had his hands on his weapon.\n\n\"I exaggerated his actions to justify mine,\" Martin said.\n\nHe said colleagues understood that, \"they weren't going to tell on me, and I wasn't going to tell on them.\"\n\nMartin said they violated department policy with their use of force and lying about it.\n\nMartin acknowledged his plea deal and he said he hoped the judge would show leniency at sentencing.\n\n\"I can't sit here and live with a lie. The truth needs to come out,\" Martin told Gilbert. \"It was eating me up inside.\"\n\nUnder cross examination by Bean's lawyer, John Keith Perry, Martin said he had been injured in November 2022 when he was hit by a car, and he had only returned to work a few days before the Nichols arrest. While he was away from work, Justin Smith called and Martin told him that he was having homicidal thoughts, Martin testified.\n\nNichols, who was Black, was pepper sprayed and hit with a stun gun during the traffic stop, but ran away, police video shows. The five officers, who also are Black, caught up with Nichols and beat him about a block from his home, as he called out for his mother.\n\nVideo shows the officers milling about and talking as Nichols struggles with his injuries. Nichols died Jan. 10, 2023, three days after the beating.\n\nAn autopsy report shows Nichols - the father of a boy who is now 7 - died from blows to the head. The report describes brain injuries, and cuts and bruises on his head and elsewhere on his body.\n\nThe five officers also have been charged with second-degree murder in state court, where they pleaded not guilty, although Mills and Martin are expected to change their pleas. A trial date in state court has not been set.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

AP hide caption\n\nIn this image taken from video, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin addresses the court at the Hennepin County Courthouse, June 25, 2021, in Minneapolis.\n\nDerek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who was convicted of George Floyd's murder, was seriously injured on Friday after another inmate stabbed him inside a federal prison in Arizona.\n\nThe attack took place around 12:30 p.m. local time at the Federal Correction Institution, Tucson, according to The Associated Press , which was the first to report the incident. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison also confirmed to The Star Tribune that Chauvin, 47, was stabbed but remains in stable condition.\n\n\"I am sad to hear that Derek Chauvin was the target of violence,\" Ellison said. \"He was duly convicted of his crimes and, like any incarcerated individual, he should be able to serve his sentence without fear of retaliation or violence.\"\n\nBoth the Bureau of Prisons and an FBI spokesperson based in Arizona confirmed to NPR that an inmate was assaulted at the federal prison on Friday, but neither agency would confirm it was Chauvin.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons added that \"life-saving measures\" were performed on the inmate. The inmate was later taken to a hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\n\nFCI Tucson, which oversees about 380 inmates, suspended visitations until further notice.\n\nIt is not clear what prompted the altercation. Chauvin's attorney did not immediately respond to NPR's requests for comment.\n\nIn 2021, Chauvin was sentenced to 22 1⁄2 years in state prison for Floyd's murder. He also received a 21-year-federal sentence for violating Floyd's civil rights. Chauvin was ordered to serve those sentences concurrently.\n\nThe ex-officer appealed the murder convictions in hopes of overturning the jury's verdict or reducing his sentencing. Earlier this week, that appeal was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court. Chauvin has also been seeking to overturn his federal civil rights conviction. Earlier this month, he filed a motion arguing there was new evidence to suggest he did not cause Floyd's death.\n\nFloyd, who was Black, was killed on May 25, 2020, during an attempted arrest. Chauvin, who is white, pinned Floyd to the ground and held his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes. Floyd's death and the horrific way he died, which was captured on video, sparked massive protests across the country over racial injustice and police brutality.\n\nThree other Minneapolis officers who helped with restraining Floyd were convicted of depriving Floyd of his right to medical care. J. Alexander Kueng was sentenced to three years, Tou Thao to 3 1/2 years and Thomas Lane to 2 1/2  years.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "NYPD \"Friendly Fire\" Killed an Officer. Investigators Seemed to Ignore Video of Police Being Commanded to \"Stop Shooting.\"\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nIn December 2019, the New York Police Department released video of a fatal police shooting in the Edenwald Houses, a sprawling public housing complex in the Bronx. Similar videos - recorded by officers' body-worn cameras - had been made public after other shootings. But this one differed in one key way: In addition to killing a suspect, police had killed one of their own, Officer Brian Mulkeen.\n\nMulkeen and his fellow officers had been patrolling the area as part of an initiative to get illegal guns off the street. Shortly after midnight, they came upon a man named Antonio Williams, who ran when they identified themselves as police. The video, shaky footage compiled from five body cameras, showed Mulkeen and other officers chasing Williams through the darkness and then tackling him. Williams, it turned out, had a revolver in his waistband.\n\n\"He's reaching,\" one officer yelled, as Mulkeen wrestled with the suspect. \"Mulk! Mulk!\"\n\nMulkeen fired five bullets into Williams, killing him. But just seconds later, as three other officers ran to the scene to provide backup, they fired their guns toward the two men and struck Mulkeen in the head.\n\nDeputy Chief Kevin Maloney, the head of the NYPD's Force Investigation Division, explained in the video that the release of the \"relevant\" footage would help the public \"gain a better understanding of the events that led up to the incident.\" The footage, he added, would also be a critical component of his team's \"thorough\" investigation, which ultimately cleared the officers involved in the shooting that night.\n\nThe finding of no wrongdoing aligned with the view of then-Commissioner James O'Neill, who had rendered his own verdict months earlier in Mulkeen's eulogy. \"As every cop knows, one person is responsible for Brian's death. And that's the person carrying a loaded, illegal gun and decided to run from the police,\" he said. \"Every cop knows that, and every New Yorker should know that.\"\n\nNew Yorkers, however, only saw a small portion of the video footage from that night - and only got a piece of the full story. The complete footage makes clearer just how far the shooters were when they fired and just how poor the visibility was that night as Mulkeen and Williams wrestled in the dark, according to a ProPublica review of the video, which was obtained by the news organization.\n\nIn fact, the NYPD's crime scene measurements show the three officers who shot from the sidewalk were positioned 60 to 70 feet away, a fact that was not publicly disclosed by the department. At that distance, according to their training, the officers had just a coin-flip's expectation of accuracy. The full video shows two of the officers with Mulkeen dodging the incoming bullets and yelling at their colleagues to \"stop shooting.\" The unpublished footage also reveals the immediate aftermath. Notably, one of the shooters runs from the sidewalk to the scene - which takes him a full five seconds, underscoring his distance from his target - and starts shouting expletives as he realizes Mulkeen has been hit.\n\nSeven months later, when the FID interviewed the officers who shot their weapons, investigators did not ask about these key exchanges or challenge the officers when their accounts differed from what was captured on video, according to audio of the interviews, which was also obtained by ProPublica. In fact, two of the shooters misstated their distance, giving the impression they were much closer to the action when they fired their guns. Investigators allowed those misstatements - and others - to stand, despite having nearly a half-hour's worth of body camera footage that disproved them. Detectives conducted relatively short interviews with the officers, ranging between 16 and 28 minutes each, and spent less than half their sessions discussing the actual shooting.\n\nProPublica requested an interview with Maloney for this story, but he did not respond. The news organization also sent a list of detailed questions to the NYPD and the union representing the officers involved in the case who are still on the force. None of the parties responded, despite multiple attempts to reach them. ProPublica also made several attempts to reach Daniel Beddows, a detective who is now retired but was also involved in the case, and sent questions via email to his former union, the Detectives' Endowment Association, which said it \"will bring it to the attention of the appropriate parties.\" There was no further response. Mulkeen's family, through its lawyer, declined to comment. The office of Mayor Eric Adams, who has championed the kind of anti-crime unit in which the officers served, also declined to comment, referring our questions to the NYPD.\n\nThe incident is the latest in a string of cases where the FID seemed to ignore evidence that was potentially damaging to officers who killed people in the line of duty. This year, ProPublica reported that in the FID's investigation of the killing of Kawaski Trawick , the division never questioned officers about body-worn camera footage showing one of them trying to stop his partner from shooting Trawick, who was in the grips of a mental health crisis. Investigators also failed to challenge officers when their statements contradicted the available video.\n\nTogether, the shortcomings raise serious questions about how the NYPD is using body-worn camera video - especially when it implicates one of its own - both in its investigations of fatal shootings and in its messaging to the public, to which it releases edited and redacted cuts, if footage is released at all. In the Mulkeen case, time and again, investigators stopped short in their questioning of officers, even when the conduct at issue, which led to the death of a colleague, was on tape.\n\nFormer NYPD Detective John Baeza, who now serves as an expert witness on police misconduct and use of force in civil and criminal cases, said the FID failed in its mission to carefully examine every detail of what happened in this case.\n\n\"They don't do a reconstruction,\" said Baeza, who reviewed the FID report obtained by ProPublica. \"You don't see any police reports about anyone going out there, and having a couple guys on the ground, and then having somebody 60 feet away - photos of what it actually looks like when you're 60 feet away from three guys on the ground.\"\n\nSuch exercises could inform future training and potentially save lives, he said.\n\n\"Those are the things that first of all prevent police officers from being shot,\" Baeza said, adding, \"And the same thing goes for perpetrators.\"\n\nIndeed, Mulkeen's father, who initially thanked the department for its response, is now suing the NYPD and the city. In his lawsuit, he accused the city of failing to properly train and supervise the officers in Mulkeen's former unit. The shooters' actions, Mulkeen's father says in court filings, \"were of such a wanton, willful, and reckless nature as to evince a callous disregard for human life.\"\n\nFor the parents of the other man killed in the chaotic shootout, the FID's clearing of the officers is part of what they call an NYPD \"cover-up\" of their son's \"murder.\"\n\n\"This level of brutality and misconduct deserves far more than a twenty minute interview after waiting over half a year for the officers to get their stories straight so they can protect themselves,\" Shawn and Gladys Williams said in a statement to ProPublica. The couple is also suing the NYPD and the city, alleging that officers illegally stopped their son that night in the Edenwald Houses.\n\nThe city denies the allegations in both cases, which are ongoing. The city's Law Department, which is also representing the officers, declined to comment for this story.\n\nWhen former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton created the FID in 2015, he told the public this new unit of \"top investigators\" would take advantage of the latest technology to produce detailed probes of police shootings. \"I will get a better investigation, a speedy investigation, a more comprehensive investigation,\" he said.\n\nThree years later, Maloney, the head of the FID, told NBC New York that advancements like body-worn cameras were helping the division \"to be transparent.\" By using video, he said, the public will \"know that when an incident happens, they're going to get the truth of why it happened.\"\n\nIn the Mulkeen case, the division had access to more than 28 minutes of body-worn camera footage from the five officers working with Mulkeen, each of whom belonged to the NYPD's controversial \"anti-crime\" unit. Tasked with getting illegal guns off the streets and dressed in plainclothes, its members were responsible for a disproportionate number of police shootings at the time. (An investigation by The Intercept found that between 2000 and 2018, anti-crime officers committed about a third of NYPD killings , despite accounting for just 6% of the force.)\n\nSeveral members of Mulkeen's team also had disciplinary and legal histories. By the time they entered the Edenwald Houses in September 2019, four of the six members - Detective Daniel Beddows, Sgt. Jason Valentino, and Officers Brian Mahon and Keith Figueroa - had racked up a total of 17 departmental violations, including conducting illegal stop and frisks, restricting a person's breathing and abusing their authority by drawing a gun. Each of the same officers, plus Mulkeen, were also named in at least one lawsuit alleging civil rights violations. (The officers denied the charges, and the cases were settled for a combined $280,000.)\n\nThat night at the Edenwald Houses, Mulkeen rode with two colleagues, Mahon and Officer Robert Wichers. As their unmarked police car approached, Williams grew \"wide eyed\" and \"nervous,\" Mahon later told investigators.\n\nWilliams took off running, and Mulkeen and Wichers went after him on foot. Mahon, who thought Williams was a potential decoy, stayed with another man on the scene. He radioed to officers in the area that his partners were in pursuit of a suspect, who he said he had seen reaching into his pants.\n\nMulkeen and Wichers soon caught up to Williams in a dark path and wrestled him to the pavement. Stuck at the bottom of the pile, Mulkeen managed to pull his gun and shot Williams five times just as Wichers jumped off the two men. Wichers and another officer, Beddows, then each fired one round at Williams.\n\nAs the shots rang out, Valentino and Figueroa, who had responded to the radio call, got out of their cruiser. The two officers, along with Mahon, ran toward the gunfire. When the three officers got to the sidewalk, about 60 to 70 feet away, they fired into the scene. Mulkeen's body instantly tensed as one of the bullets entered his skull. Beddows jumped back. \"Stop shooting!\" he yelled to his colleagues. Wichers echoed Beddows: \"Stop shooting! Stop shooting!\" Video shows Mahon then ran toward the men, taking five seconds to close the distance between the sidewalk and the scene. As he gets closer, he shouts expletives.\n\nMultiple former NYPD officers who reviewed the footage told ProPublica they took issue with the officers' decision to fire toward the struggle from that far away.\n\nDaniel Modell, a former NYPD lieutenant who ran the department's Tactical Training Unit, said if the officers believed they needed to shoot to protect Mulkeen, \"I would think that calculus might be made by someone close to the struggle - not at a distance of 20 yards.\"\n\nBaeza, the former NYPD detective, agreed. \"At 60 feet, these guys didn't have time to set up and aim,\" he said. \"Plus, what are you aiming at? The first thing is: Know your target. Well, you've got three men involved in a scuffle, and how do you know what your target is? They're moving around.\"\n\nFormer NYPD Sgt. Joe Giacalone, who worked in the Edenwald Houses, said the emotional rush of such situations introduces more potential for error. \"If you are in a situation where people are thinking your life's in danger, your accuracy gets even worse,\" he said. \"Was it a good decision? Maybe not. But, that still doesn't make it justified or unjustified.\"\n\nSeven months passed before the FID interviewed the five officers who fired their guns that night. But investigators raised few questions about the \"friendly fire\" part of the incident, according to the division's full report, which included audio interviews with the officers - even when two of the shooters misrepresented how far away they were from the scuffle.\n\nMahon, for example, estimated that he observed Williams and the muzzle flash from 25 to 30 feet away, though he added that he was \"not exactly sure\" of his position. Body-camera evidence and crime scene measurements showed he was much farther than that. In fact, Mahon was more than twice that distance - about 70 feet away - when he fired, according to the Bronx District Attorney's Office, which also looked into the incident. The office cited measurements taken by the NYPD Crime Scene Unit, in coordination with the FID. Figueroa, who was standing next to Mahon, also told investigators he was about 20 feet away, though he was \"not sure.\" Despite having the correct information, the FID detectives did not follow up.\n\nThat kind of deference is notable, given that making false, misleading or inaccurate statements is punishable under the NYPD's disciplinary system , depending on the circumstances.\n\nInvestigators did ask the three officers who fired from the sidewalk whether they could tell who was shooting in the scuffle, Mulkeen or Williams. But when each said they could not make that distinction, detectives did not press any further.\n\nInvestigators also failed to question officers about other key details captured on their body-worn cameras. Most notably, the FID did not ask Wichers and Beddows - the two officers closest to Mulkeen and the struggle - about the \"stop shooting\" commands they shouted just after their colleagues fired from the sidewalk. For their part, neither officer mentioned the exchange, which would have underscored just how much the shooters had endangered everyone on the scene, including police.\n\nBeddows told investigators that after he fired at Williams he \"gave all his attention to Police Officer Mulkeen.\" Maloney asked Beddows if he made any statements after he heard the gunshots from the officers on the sidewalk. He said no. Investigators did not press him any further.\n\nWichers also left out the exchange in his telling of the shooting. \"After all the gunshots have stopped,\" he told investigators, \"I immediately go and try to render aid to Mulkeen.\" Investigators did not challenge him. Instead, they asked Wichers if Mulkeen or Wiliams were still in possession of their firearms, who recovered the guns from the scene and if Wichers had any prior dealings with Williams.\n\nOmissions of material facts are also punishable under the NYPD's disciplinary system, but they must be found to be intentional.\n\nA review of the audio interviews shows that the FID spent between seven and nine minutes questioning each of the officers about why they decided to fire their guns. In each interview, investigators spent almost as much time asking about logistical details, such as whether they were carrying a taser, if they were wearing a windbreaker or not and where their badge was positioned on their clothes.\n\nBy contrast, the FID spent considerably more time investigating Williams, the other victim in the shooting. Records show the division searched the Bronx apartment of Williams' godmother, whom he was visiting the night he was killed. Investigators also spoke to his parole officer, the manager of a restaurant he worked at in Binghamton, New York, and his girlfriend, who also lived upstate. Additionally, the investigators probed the alleged gang ties of Williams and the other man standing with him on the sidewalk when they were stopped by the NYPD. The FID's report included both men's complete criminal records and a review of Williams' and his girlfriend's social media profiles.\n\nTwo years after the shooting, the FID presented its report to the NYPD's Use of Force review board, which makes recommendations on discipline to the police commissioner. The FID said it found no violations of department policy by the officers, and the board agreed. According to the FID file, in January 2022, the commissioner signed off on this recommendation and the officers were cleared of all wrongdoing. Like prior FID reports, it was not released publicly.\n\nThe FID, however, was not the only law enforcement entity to review the shooting. The Bronx District Attorney's Office did its own investigation, drawing heavily from the body-worn camera footage. In all, its report makes 17 references to the videos, compared with just nine mentions in the FID probe. And although the DA's office said it did not have enough evidence to support criminal charges against the officers who shot Mulkeen, it did find that they had misstated key details in their recollections of the shooting and made some critical mistakes that night.\n\nNotably, the DA's office said that Mahon \"mistook\" Mulkeen for the suspect, Williams, when he claimed he saw a person on the ground holding a gun. The DA said \"it is doubtful that Officer Mahon actually observed the weapon at that point\" because it was underneath Williams, who was lying face down after being shot by Mulkeen.\n\nThe DA also challenged the account of Figueroa, who said he believed Williams was attempting to stand up and shoot at Beddows.\n\n\"Officer Figueroa was mistaken,\" the DA wrote. \"At the time of Officer Figueroa's discharge, Mr. Williams had already been separated from Officer Mulkeen and was on the ground facing away from Officer Figueroa.\"\n\nLikewise, the DA concluded Valentino's recollection that he could \"clearly\" see Williams at the time he fired was \"controverted by the body worn camera evidence.\"\n\n\"In fact, by the time that Sergeant Valentino began firing, Mr. Williams had already rolled off of Officer Mulkeen, was motionless on the ground, and Officer Mulkeen was no longer in danger,\" the report said.\n\nWhile no charges were filed by the DA and no discipline administered by the NYPD, the matter is not completely closed. Today, the city's NYPD watchdog, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, is investigating a misconduct claim over the officers' actions that night inside the Edenwald Houses. The CCRB confirmed the probe is ongoing but declined to make further comment for this story.\n\nMeanwhile, Mulkeen's father's lawsuit against the NYPD and the city is on hold, pending the outcome of the CCRB investigation. So is the separate lawsuit by Williams' family.\n\nRead More\n\nIn the years since the Mulkeen shooting, the city disbanded the anti-crime unit, which department officials at the time said was a \"seismic shift\" away from the \"brute force\" tactics of the past. The officers involved in the case have gone in various directions. In October 2020, Beddows retired after he reached the 20-year mark with the NYPD, according to New York City employment records. Valentino and Wichers were each promoted and reassigned to nonpatrol units.\n\nMahon and Figueroa are still in the field, reassigned to another specialized NYPD unit. Its task: recovering illegal guns.\n\nLast year, Adams announced that he would reinstate the anti-crime unit his predecessor had disbanded. \"In doing this, we will avoid mistakes of the past,\" he said. To assure New Yorkers, he noted officers would be identifiable as NYPD, receive enhanced training and be equipped with body cameras.\n\nVideo editing by Chris Morran and Kassie Navarro.\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "NYPD \"Friendly Fire\" Killed an Officer. Investigators Seemed to Ignore Video of Police Being Commanded to \"Stop Shooting.\"\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nIn December 2019, the New York Police Department released video of a fatal police shooting in the Edenwald Houses, a sprawling public housing complex in the Bronx. Similar videos - recorded by officers' body-worn cameras - had been made public after other shootings. But this one differed in one key way: In addition to killing a suspect, police had killed one of their own, Officer Brian Mulkeen.\n\nMulkeen and his fellow officers had been patrolling the area as part of an initiative to get illegal guns off the street. Shortly after midnight, they came upon a man named Antonio Williams, who ran when they identified themselves as police. The video, shaky footage compiled from five body cameras, showed Mulkeen and other officers chasing Williams through the darkness and then tackling him. Williams, it turned out, had a revolver in his waistband.\n\n\"He's reaching,\" one officer yelled, as Mulkeen wrestled with the suspect. \"Mulk! Mulk!\"\n\nMulkeen fired five bullets into Williams, killing him. But just seconds later, as three other officers ran to the scene to provide backup, they fired their guns toward the two men and struck Mulkeen in the head.\n\nDeputy Chief Kevin Maloney, the head of the NYPD's Force Investigation Division, explained in the video that the release of the \"relevant\" footage would help the public \"gain a better understanding of the events that led up to the incident.\" The footage, he added, would also be a critical component of his team's \"thorough\" investigation, which ultimately cleared the officers involved in the shooting that night.\n\nThe finding of no wrongdoing aligned with the view of then-Commissioner James O'Neill, who had rendered his own verdict months earlier in Mulkeen's eulogy. \"As every cop knows, one person is responsible for Brian's death. And that's the person carrying a loaded, illegal gun and decided to run from the police,\" he said. \"Every cop knows that, and every New Yorker should know that.\"\n\nNew Yorkers, however, only saw a small portion of the video footage from that night - and only got a piece of the full story. The complete footage makes clearer just how far the shooters were when they fired and just how poor the visibility was that night as Mulkeen and Williams wrestled in the dark, according to a ProPublica review of the video, which was obtained by the news organization.\n\nIn fact, the NYPD's crime scene measurements show the three officers who shot from the sidewalk were positioned 60 to 70 feet away, a fact that was not publicly disclosed by the department. At that distance, according to their training, the officers had just a coin-flip's expectation of accuracy. The full video shows two of the officers with Mulkeen dodging the incoming bullets and yelling at their colleagues to \"stop shooting.\" The unpublished footage also reveals the immediate aftermath. Notably, one of the shooters runs from the sidewalk to the scene - which takes him a full five seconds, underscoring his distance from his target - and starts shouting expletives as he realizes Mulkeen has been hit.\n\nSeven months later, when the FID interviewed the officers who shot their weapons, investigators did not ask about these key exchanges or challenge the officers when their accounts differed from what was captured on video, according to audio of the interviews, which was also obtained by ProPublica. In fact, two of the shooters misstated their distance, giving the impression they were much closer to the action when they fired their guns. Investigators allowed those misstatements - and others - to stand, despite having nearly a half-hour's worth of body camera footage that disproved them. Detectives conducted relatively short interviews with the officers, ranging between 16 and 28 minutes each, and spent less than half their sessions discussing the actual shooting.\n\nProPublica requested an interview with Maloney for this story, but he did not respond. The news organization also sent a list of detailed questions to the NYPD and the union representing the officers involved in the case who are still on the force. None of the parties responded, despite multiple attempts to reach them. ProPublica also made several attempts to reach Daniel Beddows, a detective who is now retired but was also involved in the case, and sent questions via email to his former union, the Detectives' Endowment Association, which said it \"will bring it to the attention of the appropriate parties.\" There was no further response. Mulkeen's family, through its lawyer, declined to comment. The office of Mayor Eric Adams, who has championed the kind of anti-crime unit in which the officers served, also declined to comment, referring our questions to the NYPD.\n\nThe incident is the latest in a string of cases where the FID seemed to ignore evidence that was potentially damaging to officers who killed people in the line of duty. This year, ProPublica reported that in the FID's investigation of the killing of Kawaski Trawick , the division never questioned officers about body-worn camera footage showing one of them trying to stop his partner from shooting Trawick, who was in the grips of a mental health crisis. Investigators also failed to challenge officers when their statements contradicted the available video.\n\nTogether, the shortcomings raise serious questions about how the NYPD is using body-worn camera video - especially when it implicates one of its own - both in its investigations of fatal shootings and in its messaging to the public, to which it releases edited and redacted cuts, if footage is released at all. In the Mulkeen case, time and again, investigators stopped short in their questioning of officers, even when the conduct at issue, which led to the death of a colleague, was on tape.\n\nFormer NYPD Detective John Baeza, who now serves as an expert witness on police misconduct and use of force in civil and criminal cases, said the FID failed in its mission to carefully examine every detail of what happened in this case.\n\n\"They don't do a reconstruction,\" said Baeza, who reviewed the FID report obtained by ProPublica. \"You don't see any police reports about anyone going out there, and having a couple guys on the ground, and then having somebody 60 feet away - photos of what it actually looks like when you're 60 feet away from three guys on the ground.\"\n\nSuch exercises could inform future training and potentially save lives, he said.\n\n\"Those are the things that first of all prevent police officers from being shot,\" Baeza said, adding, \"And the same thing goes for perpetrators.\"\n\nIndeed, Mulkeen's father, who initially thanked the department for its response, is now suing the NYPD and the city. In his lawsuit, he accused the city of failing to properly train and supervise the officers in Mulkeen's former unit. The shooters' actions, Mulkeen's father says in court filings, \"were of such a wanton, willful, and reckless nature as to evince a callous disregard for human life.\"\n\nFor the parents of the other man killed in the chaotic shootout, the FID's clearing of the officers is part of what they call an NYPD \"cover-up\" of their son's \"murder.\"\n\n\"This level of brutality and misconduct deserves far more than a twenty minute interview after waiting over half a year for the officers to get their stories straight so they can protect themselves,\" Shawn and Gladys Williams said in a statement to ProPublica. The couple is also suing the NYPD and the city, alleging that officers illegally stopped their son that night in the Edenwald Houses.\n\nThe city denies the allegations in both cases, which are ongoing. The city's Law Department, which is also representing the officers, declined to comment for this story.\n\nWhen former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton created the FID in 2015, he told the public this new unit of \"top investigators\" would take advantage of the latest technology to produce detailed probes of police shootings. \"I will get a better investigation, a speedy investigation, a more comprehensive investigation,\" he said.\n\nThree years later, Maloney, the head of the FID, told NBC New York that advancements like body-worn cameras were helping the division \"to be transparent.\" By using video, he said, the public will \"know that when an incident happens, they're going to get the truth of why it happened.\"\n\nIn the Mulkeen case, the division had access to more than 28 minutes of body-worn camera footage from the five officers working with Mulkeen, each of whom belonged to the NYPD's controversial \"anti-crime\" unit. Tasked with getting illegal guns off the streets and dressed in plainclothes, its members were responsible for a disproportionate number of police shootings at the time. (An investigation by The Intercept found that between 2000 and 2018, anti-crime officers committed about a third of NYPD killings , despite accounting for just 6% of the force.)\n\nSeveral members of Mulkeen's team also had disciplinary and legal histories. By the time they entered the Edenwald Houses in September 2019, four of the six members - Detective Daniel Beddows, Sgt. Jason Valentino, and Officers Brian Mahon and Keith Figueroa - had racked up a total of 17 departmental violations, including conducting illegal stop and frisks, restricting a person's breathing and abusing their authority by drawing a gun. Each of the same officers, plus Mulkeen, were also named in at least one lawsuit alleging civil rights violations. (The officers denied the charges, and the cases were settled for a combined $280,000.)\n\nThat night at the Edenwald Houses, Mulkeen rode with two colleagues, Mahon and Officer Robert Wichers. As their unmarked police car approached, Williams grew \"wide eyed\" and \"nervous,\" Mahon later told investigators.\n\nWilliams took off running, and Mulkeen and Wichers went after him on foot. Mahon, who thought Williams was a potential decoy, stayed with another man on the scene. He radioed to officers in the area that his partners were in pursuit of a suspect, who he said he had seen reaching into his pants.\n\nMulkeen and Wichers soon caught up to Williams in a dark path and wrestled him to the pavement. Stuck at the bottom of the pile, Mulkeen managed to pull his gun and shot Williams five times just as Wichers jumped off the two men. Wichers and another officer, Beddows, then each fired one round at Williams.\n\nAs the shots rang out, Valentino and Figueroa, who had responded to the radio call, got out of their cruiser. The two officers, along with Mahon, ran toward the gunfire. When the three officers got to the sidewalk, about 60 to 70 feet away, they fired into the scene. Mulkeen's body instantly tensed as one of the bullets entered his skull. Beddows jumped back. \"Stop shooting!\" he yelled to his colleagues. Wichers echoed Beddows: \"Stop shooting! Stop shooting!\" Video shows Mahon then ran toward the men, taking five seconds to close the distance between the sidewalk and the scene. As he gets closer, he shouts expletives.\n\nMultiple former NYPD officers who reviewed the footage told ProPublica they took issue with the officers' decision to fire toward the struggle from that far away.\n\nDaniel Modell, a former NYPD lieutenant who ran the department's Tactical Training Unit, said if the officers believed they needed to shoot to protect Mulkeen, \"I would think that calculus might be made by someone close to the struggle - not at a distance of 20 yards.\"\n\nBaeza, the former NYPD detective, agreed. \"At 60 feet, these guys didn't have time to set up and aim,\" he said. \"Plus, what are you aiming at? The first thing is: Know your target. Well, you've got three men involved in a scuffle, and how do you know what your target is? They're moving around.\"\n\nFormer NYPD Sgt. Joe Giacalone, who worked in the Edenwald Houses, said the emotional rush of such situations introduces more potential for error. \"If you are in a situation where people are thinking your life's in danger, your accuracy gets even worse,\" he said. \"Was it a good decision? Maybe not. But, that still doesn't make it justified or unjustified.\"\n\nSeven months passed before the FID interviewed the five officers who fired their guns that night. But investigators raised few questions about the \"friendly fire\" part of the incident, according to the division's full report, which included audio interviews with the officers - even when two of the shooters misrepresented how far away they were from the scuffle.\n\nMahon, for example, estimated that he observed Williams and the muzzle flash from 25 to 30 feet away, though he added that he was \"not exactly sure\" of his position. Body-camera evidence and crime scene measurements showed he was much farther than that. In fact, Mahon was more than twice that distance - about 70 feet away - when he fired, according to the Bronx District Attorney's Office, which also looked into the incident. The office cited measurements taken by the NYPD Crime Scene Unit, in coordination with the FID. Figueroa, who was standing next to Mahon, also told investigators he was about 20 feet away, though he was \"not sure.\" Despite having the correct information, the FID detectives did not follow up.\n\nThat kind of deference is notable, given that making false, misleading or inaccurate statements is punishable under the NYPD's disciplinary system , depending on the circumstances.\n\nInvestigators did ask the three officers who fired from the sidewalk whether they could tell who was shooting in the scuffle, Mulkeen or Williams. But when each said they could not make that distinction, detectives did not press any further.\n\nInvestigators also failed to question officers about other key details captured on their body-worn cameras. Most notably, the FID did not ask Wichers and Beddows - the two officers closest to Mulkeen and the struggle - about the \"stop shooting\" commands they shouted just after their colleagues fired from the sidewalk. For their part, neither officer mentioned the exchange, which would have underscored just how much the shooters had endangered everyone on the scene, including police.\n\nBeddows told investigators that after he fired at Williams he \"gave all his attention to Police Officer Mulkeen.\" Maloney asked Beddows if he made any statements after he heard the gunshots from the officers on the sidewalk. He said no. Investigators did not press him any further.\n\nWichers also left out the exchange in his telling of the shooting. \"After all the gunshots have stopped,\" he told investigators, \"I immediately go and try to render aid to Mulkeen.\" Investigators did not challenge him. Instead, they asked Wichers if Mulkeen or Wiliams were still in possession of their firearms, who recovered the guns from the scene and if Wichers had any prior dealings with Williams.\n\nOmissions of material facts are also punishable under the NYPD's disciplinary system, but they must be found to be intentional.\n\nA review of the audio interviews shows that the FID spent between seven and nine minutes questioning each of the officers about why they decided to fire their guns. In each interview, investigators spent almost as much time asking about logistical details, such as whether they were carrying a taser, if they were wearing a windbreaker or not and where their badge was positioned on their clothes.\n\nBy contrast, the FID spent considerably more time investigating Williams, the other victim in the shooting. Records show the division searched the Bronx apartment of Williams' godmother, whom he was visiting the night he was killed. Investigators also spoke to his parole officer, the manager of a restaurant he worked at in Binghamton, New York, and his girlfriend, who also lived upstate. Additionally, the investigators probed the alleged gang ties of Williams and the other man standing with him on the sidewalk when they were stopped by the NYPD. The FID's report included both men's complete criminal records and a review of Williams' and his girlfriend's social media profiles.\n\nTwo years after the shooting, the FID presented its report to the NYPD's Use of Force review board, which makes recommendations on discipline to the police commissioner. The FID said it found no violations of department policy by the officers, and the board agreed. According to the FID file, in January 2022, the commissioner signed off on this recommendation and the officers were cleared of all wrongdoing. Like prior FID reports, it was not released publicly.\n\nThe FID, however, was not the only law enforcement entity to review the shooting. The Bronx District Attorney's Office did its own investigation, drawing heavily from the body-worn camera footage. In all, its report makes 17 references to the videos, compared with just nine mentions in the FID probe. And although the DA's office said it did not have enough evidence to support criminal charges against the officers who shot Mulkeen, it did find that they had misstated key details in their recollections of the shooting and made some critical mistakes that night.\n\nNotably, the DA's office said that Mahon \"mistook\" Mulkeen for the suspect, Williams, when he claimed he saw a person on the ground holding a gun. The DA said \"it is doubtful that Officer Mahon actually observed the weapon at that point\" because it was underneath Williams, who was lying face down after being shot by Mulkeen.\n\nThe DA also challenged the account of Figueroa, who said he believed Williams was attempting to stand up and shoot at Beddows.\n\n\"Officer Figueroa was mistaken,\" the DA wrote. \"At the time of Officer Figueroa's discharge, Mr. Williams had already been separated from Officer Mulkeen and was on the ground facing away from Officer Figueroa.\"\n\nLikewise, the DA concluded Valentino's recollection that he could \"clearly\" see Williams at the time he fired was \"controverted by the body worn camera evidence.\"\n\n\"In fact, by the time that Sergeant Valentino began firing, Mr. Williams had already rolled off of Officer Mulkeen, was motionless on the ground, and Officer Mulkeen was no longer in danger,\" the report said.\n\nWhile no charges were filed by the DA and no discipline administered by the NYPD, the matter is not completely closed. Today, the city's NYPD watchdog, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, is investigating a misconduct claim over the officers' actions that night inside the Edenwald Houses. The CCRB confirmed the probe is ongoing but declined to make further comment for this story.\n\nMeanwhile, Mulkeen's father's lawsuit against the NYPD and the city is on hold, pending the outcome of the CCRB investigation. So is the separate lawsuit by Williams' family.\n\nRead More\n\nIn the years since the Mulkeen shooting, the city disbanded the anti-crime unit, which department officials at the time said was a \"seismic shift\" away from the \"brute force\" tactics of the past. The officers involved in the case have gone in various directions. In October 2020, Beddows retired after he reached the 20-year mark with the NYPD, according to New York City employment records. Valentino and Wichers were each promoted and reassigned to nonpatrol units.\n\nMahon and Figueroa are still in the field, reassigned to another specialized NYPD unit. Its task: recovering illegal guns.\n\nLast year, Adams announced that he would reinstate the anti-crime unit his predecessor had disbanded. \"In doing this, we will avoid mistakes of the past,\" he said. To assure New Yorkers, he noted officers would be identifiable as NYPD, receive enhanced training and be equipped with body cameras.\n\nVideo editing by Chris Morran and Kassie Navarro.\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

Family members say they don't want his death politicized. But they do want to understand what happened.\n\nby J. David McSwane\n\nThe Effort to Overturn the Election\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThe grieving family of a slain Capitol Police officer says he was a private man whose death shouldn't be politicized. But now it is forced to make sense of the reality that he is a victim of political violence, his legacy forever linked to an insurrection in the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"He spent his life trying to help other people,\" the officer's eldest brother told ProPublica. \"This political climate got my brother killed.\"\n\nBrian David Sicknick, 42, died Thursday of injuries he sustained while trying to protect the Capitol from a mob of violent rioters supporting President Donald Trump who rushed the building to disrupt the certification of the presidential election.\n\nBefore the officer's death had officially been announced late Thursday, the Sicknick family was rushing from its home in New Jersey to see him in a Washington-area hospital as word circulated on social media that a Capitol Police officer had succumbed to grave injuries.\n\nLast they had heard, Sicknick was in critical condition on a ventilator, according to family members who spoke to ProPublica. While some news reports had said an unnamed officer was in critical condition after being bludgeoned with a fire extinguisher, family members did not have details of his injuries. They say Sicknick had texted them Wednesday night to say that while he had been pepper-sprayed, he was in good spirits. The text arrived hours after a mob's assault on the Capitol had left more than 50 officers injured and five people dead.\n\n\"He texted me last night and said, 'I got pepper-sprayed twice,' and he was in good shape,\" said Ken Sicknick, his brother, as the family drove toward Washington. \"Apparently he collapsed in the Capitol and they resuscitated him using CPR.\"\n\nBut the day after that text exchange, the family got word that Brian Sicknick had a blood clot and had had a stroke; a ventilator was keeping him alive.\n\n\"We weren't expecting it,\" his brother said.\n\nAs apparently premature news of Sicknick's death spread in law enforcement circles, the U.S. Capitol Police Department remained silent, including no response to an early request for confirmation from ProPublica on Thursday evening. The family learned from reporter phone calls that something was wrong.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\n\"We have not gotten any calls,\" Ken Sicknick said when first contacted. Brian Sicknick was the youngest of three siblings, all boys. \"We're kind of overwhelmed right now. You guys are getting reports of his death before I even got anything.\"\n\nNearly an hour later, the department issued a statement rebutting news reports that an officer had died. The department finally reported that Sicknick had died at 9:30 p.m. Thursday, adding that this was the result of injuries sustained during the attack the previous day.\n\nBy the time family members reached the hospital, they say, Sicknick was dead.\n\nIn separate interviews with ProPublica, family members say they are still waiting to learn exactly what happened. They described Sicknick as the kindest of the three siblings. They said he went to a technical school to study electronics but ditched it to follow his dream of becoming a police officer. They couldn't confirm the time of death.\n\nThe family's grief and confusion comes amid serious questions about how a secretive police department that is well-funded and highly trained at quelling violent protests and protecting members of Congress had failed to protect one of its own from an attack that had been planned out in plain sight .\n\nIn a press release, the department said: \"The entire USCP Department expresses its deepest sympathies to Officer Sicknick's family and friends on their loss, and mourns the loss of a friend and colleague.\"\n\nThe Sicknick family issued its own press release Friday, urging the public and reporters to not politicize Sicknick's death.\n\n\"Please honor Brian's life and service and respect our privacy while we move forward in doing the same. Brian is a hero and that is what we would like people to remember,\" the statement said.\n\nStill in shock, one family member, who agreed to talk but asked not to be named, said Sicknick had sometimes expressed frustrations with his job.\n\n\"Occasionally he would mention that they were very understaffed and they worked a lot of hours,\" the family member said. \"And morale could be low.\"\n\nLarry Schaefer, who spent 34 years on the force before retiring last year and knew Sicknick, said Wednesday's breach of the Capitol was unfathomable until he saw it on his TV screen.\n\nAuthorities dissuaded some extremists from traveling to Washington, and shared intelligence with Capitol Police, but could not stop the mob that stormed the Capitol, a senior FBI official says.\n\n\"We handle demonstrations on a regular basis,\" Schaefer said. \"We're prepared for this kind of stuff. We hold people back in a perimeter. We're set up for mass arrests, to load buses of people away.\"\n\nHe said he blames department leaders for the tragedy. Under pressure from congressional leaders, Chief Steven Sund of the Capitol Police and two other security officials have resigned.\n\nAfter Sicknick struggled to find a policing job early on, his family said, in 1997 he joined the New Jersey National Guard \"as a means to that end.\" He was deployed to Saudi Arabia and Kyrgyzstan during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and was honorably discharged in 2003, according to a Guard spokesman.\n\nHe subsequently trained to be a Capitol Police officer, graduating in 2008. The family came down to see the graduation ceremony, in \"one of those big fancy buildings,\" one family member said.\n\nOne of his first assignments was working the inauguration of former President Barack Obama, a moment that filled Sicknick and the family with pride.\n\nTwelve years later, Sicknick was a member of the department's First Responder Unit when Trump, in the final days of a presidency that fomented anger and division, held a rally that precipitated the Capitol attack.\n\nIn a press release Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said, \"The violent and deadly act of insurrection targeting the Capitol, our temple of American Democracy, and its workers was a profound tragedy and stain on our nation's history.\"\n\n\"I send our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Officer Brian Sicknick,\" Pelosi said. \"The perpetrators of Officer Sicknick's death must be brought to justice.\"\n\nAfter a forced hiatus from Twitter, Trump returned to his favorite platform on Friday to honor his supporters, whom he called \"patriots,\" and to announce he will not attend the inauguration of Joe Biden.\n\nIn a statement, Trump's deputy press secretary Judd Deere said: \"Anytime a member of law enforcement dies in the line of duty it is a solemn reminder to us all that they run toward danger to maintain peace.

      "text": "He Was Filming on His Phone. Then a Deputy Attacked Him and Charged Him With Resisting Arrest.\n\nThis article was produced for ProPublica's Local Reporting Network in partnership with WRKF and WWNO, and it was also co-published with The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate. Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.\n\nThousands packed the sidewalks along Veterans Memorial Boulevard in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, watching the Krewe of Centurions Mardi Gras parade in March of 2019 when a brawl broke out at a nearby parking garage. More than two dozen men traded blows in a bloody melee that forced the parade's 20-plus floats to grind to a halt.\n\nSheriff's deputies quickly broke up the fight, arresting at least one man. As officers attempted to calm the crowd and shepherd them back to the parade route, Sgt. Keith Dowling claimed he saw someone hurling obscenities at his officers.\n\nAn \"argumentative black male [was] agitating elements within the crowd by repeatedly yelling 'Fuck You' while gesturing with both middle fingers at responding deputies,\" Dowling wrote in his incident report.\n\nHe identified the person in question as Jacobi Cage.\n\nCage's presence at the parade is the only thing about that night that he and the officers agree on. Dowling, an eight-year veteran of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, said he tried to de-escalate the situation by quietly removing Cage from the scene, but the then-20-year-old became violent and swung \"wildly\" at him, hitting him in the chest. The sergeant stated in his report he had no choice at that point but to use force to take Cage to the ground, after which he booked Cage for battery of an officer and resisting arrest.\n\nAfter spending several hours in the parish jail, Cage was released with a summons to appear in court. He returned to his home that night feeling angry and helpless. Cage, who'd been a football standout at Destrehan High School in neighboring St. Charles Parish until his graduation two years earlier, had never been in legal trouble before, but now he was facing up to six months in jail and a criminal record.\n\nA weekly newsletter about wrongdoing in America\n\nThanks for signing up.

But it was his word against that of the Sheriff's Office, and for a young Black man in Jefferson Parish, a majority-white, conservative community just outside of New Orleans, that was a losing hand.\n\nAs Cage lay in bed that night, unable to sleep, he scrolled through his Twitter feed and noticed a video that had been taken at the parade . The tweet said: \"man just recording got assaulted and arrested for nothing.\"\n\nCage hit play and said he began to cry, in both relief and shock, as he watched the 38-second clip, which has now been viewed more than 284,000 times.\n\nThe footage shows Cage standing on one side of an orange mesh barricade while two deputies are on the other, a few inches away, staring directly at him. Cage is holding his phone in his right hand, recording their interaction.\n\nAn unidentified deputy points at Cage, motioning for him to move away. Cage takes a few steps back. That's when Detective Nicholas Broussard reaches across the mesh, smacks Cage's phone out of his hand, then gives Cage the middle finger and walks away. In response, Cage holds up both middle fingers. Dowling responds by lunging at Cage, dragging him over the mesh barricade and slamming him headfirst into the ground.\n\nSomeone can be heard yelling repeatedly at the deputies, \"That shit not right! That shit not right!\"\n\n\"The police just grabbed me and started punching me,\" Cage said. \"I had a busted lip. My nose was crooked. I had a torn rotator cuff from football and they reinjured that. I felt like they were about to pull my arm off.\"\n\nAt no point in the video does Cage become violent or swing at the deputies, though Dowling claimed in his report that the only reason he used force was that Cage had turned aggressive. Nor did the sergeant report that Broussard smacked Cage's phone out of his hand. In fact, Broussard's name is never mentioned in Dowling's report at all.\n\n\"You always have your good cops, your bad cops,\" Cage said. \"I have no problem with the police. Even to this day. But what I seen that day was just wrong. Them charging me was just insane. It can happen anywhere, to anybody.\"\n\nThe charges Cage faced are known by police critics, defense attorneys and some federal investigators as \"cover charges.\" Deputies can use these offenses - typically resisting arrest, battery of an officer and flight from an officer - to arrest people they have assaulted, experts say. The charges, which are sometimes used in combination with other offenses, allow officers to cover up their use of excessive force and help shield the department from civil liability, according to civil rights attorneys. Because there is often no other evidence save for the word of the officer, and because the resisting arrest statute is written so broadly that it can be applied to almost any situation, convictions are relatively easy to secure. And once someone is convicted or enters a guilty plea, they often lose the right to sue for any alleged police brutality.\n\nAn investigation by WWNO/WRKF and ProPublica found that Black people are arrested in Jefferson Parish at a disproportionate rate overall - and arrested for cover charges at a still higher rate. The Black community accounts for 26% of the parish's population and 57% of all arrests. But in cases where the arrest is based exclusively on cover charges, 73% of the time, the person is Black.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office did not respond to a detailed list of questions and a request for comment. Attorney Danny Martiny, who represents the Sheriff's Office and the deputies named in Cage's lawsuit, declined to comment.\n\nBut Jefferson Parish Councilman Byron Lee, when presented with the findings, said, \"It's very disappointing, to say the least, that the Black community is targeted in the way the numbers suggest. And numbers don't lie. It's problematic in every way.\"\n\nThe parish council doesn't have any power over the sheriff, the way city councils often do over metropolitan police departments, so it is up to the voters to push for reform, said Lee, who believes the Sheriff's Office \"absolutely\" needs to be reformed.\n\n\"There's nobody I know who supports wanton discrimination,\" he said.\n\nU.S. Rep. Troy Carter, D-La., called the findings \"concerning\" and said that \"criminal charges should never be used as tools for cover-ups.\"\n\n\"Previous information alleging misconduct and missing accountability measures was disturbing,\" Carter said of the news organizations' earlier reports . \"I am hopeful that the Sheriff's Office will use all resources available to thoroughly and transparently seek out the truth, wherever it may lead. Ignoring a problem is never the answer.\"\n\nThe cover charge tactic is not unique to Jefferson Parish. Over the past decade, the U.S. Department of Justice has noted the use of these charges in its investigations into law enforcement agencies accused of systemic misconduct and corruption in Chicago; Ferguson, Missouri; and New Orleans, among other places. These offenses are not only used to justify excessive force, but also as a threat to silence the alleged victims and potential witnesses, and to punish people who officers feel have disrespected them, according to DOJ investigators .\n\nDetermining whether an officer falsely arrested someone on cover charges can be difficult, but there are red flags, said Sam Walker, emeritus professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska Omaha. One is when an arrest involves only cover charges, with no other type of charge that would suggest what caused the police to try to detain someone in the first place. That is a \"telltale sign of officer escalation and a strong indicator that the use of force was avoidable,\" according to the Department of Justice's 2015 report on the Ferguson Police Department.\n\nCover charges were also found to be used predominantly against Black people in the departments investigated by the DOJ, and the data shows that the same holds true in Jefferson Parish.\n\nPrior to entering into a court-enforced reform agreement known as a federal consent decree, the Ferguson Police Department arrested Black people in cases where only cover charges were brought at a rate 1.4 times their share of the population. The New Orleans Police Department arrested Black people in cases where only cover charges were brought at a rate 1.6 times their share of the population. In Jefferson Parish, the rate was 2.8.\n\nNeda Khoshkhoo and Caitlin Glass, law and policy fellows with the Boston University Center for Antiracist Research, said \"the disproportionate pursuit of cover charges, and especially stand-alone cover charges, against Black people in Jefferson Parish raises red flags and calls for serious scrutiny.\"\n\n\"Historically, these types of charges have been closely associated with racialized police violence,\" they said in an emailed statement. \"Concerns about potential fabrication of cover charges are so prevalent that some police departments and prosecutors' offices in other parts of the country internally review 'resisting arrest' charges to screen for misconduct.\"\n\nThis dynamic is all the more meaningful in Jefferson Parish, where for decades, members of the Black community have accused the Sheriff's Office of using excessive force against them, making false arrests and failing to rein in abusive deputies. A previous investigation by WWNO/WRKF and ProPublica found that more than 70% of the people deputies shot at during the past eight years were Black, more than double the parish's Black population. In addition, 12 of the 16 people who died after being shot or restrained by deputies during that time were Black men.\n\nCage's attorney, Stephen Haedicke, said this pattern of discriminatory and abusive policing played out in his client's case, which was also a textbook example of how departments hide officers' wrongdoing.\n\n\"It's just preposterous,\" Haedicke said. \"When you have supervisors apparently covering up for the misconduct of lower-ranking officers, it teaches a really bad lesson. It shows people how it's done. And you got some bad apples who take those lessons to heart.\"\n\nIn December 2015, a 14-year-old boy and his friend were playfully wrestling in a parking lot along Veterans Memorial Boulevard when a woman told them to leave or she would call the police. Moments later, an unmarked white Ford Explorer pulled up and Jefferson Parish Sgt. Julio Alvarado jumped out, gun drawn, and ordered the boys to drop their bikes, according to a lawsuit filed by the 14-year-old's family. Alvarado then grabbed the child by the neck and slammed his head onto the concrete.\n\n\"Please don't do this, my face hurts,\" the boy pleaded as blood poured from his forehead, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAfterward, the teenager was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for a neck injury, a black eye that had swollen shut, and abrasions to his forehead, cheek and nose, injuries the boy claimed were caused by the sergeant. Alvarado appeared in the boy's hospital room, according to the lawsuit, and told him, \"Use this as an example of what can happen.\" Then the deputy booked him into the juvenile detention center for resisting an officer and battery on an officer, along with disturbing the peace and obstruction of a highway.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office, which initially denied the allegations in court filings, settled the case for $15,000.\n\n(ProPublica recently identified Alvarado as a deputy caught on video in September slamming a Black woman's head repeatedly into the pavement with such force that several of her braids were ripped from her scalp. The Sheriff's Office said it was investigating the incident, but as of Dec. 22, it has yet to announce its findings and Alvarado appears to remain employed with the department.)\n\nExperts say there is a typical pattern of cases involving cover charges: Officers use excessive force, injure a person and then fabricate a report claiming it was the victim's fault because they resisted arrest, committed battery of an officer or fled from an officer. This practice is likely to have an undue impact on Black people, who are most likely to be victims of or witnesses to police abuse. According to a 2017 report by the National Registry of Exonerations at the University of Michigan Law School, the officers know those defendants likely won't have the resources to \"defend themselves successfully, even if innocent.\"\n\nOverall, our analysis of data covering January 2018 to March 2021 found 511 incidents of a person in Jefferson Parish being charged with one or more cover charges but no other offenses. In addition:\n\nAround the country, cover charges regularly show up in cases where officers have used force during an arrest. In Ferguson, DOJ investigators cited the case of an officer who attempted to illegally detain and frisk a man for no discernible reason. When the man crossed his arms, insisted he hadn't done anything wrong and refused to cooperate, the officer tased him once, causing the man to collapse. The officer then tased him a second time for 20 continuous seconds, after which he booked the man for resisting arrest and no other charge.\n\nA 2009 report from The Mercury News found that of 206 cases in San Jose, California, in which the most serious charge was resisting arrest or obstructing a police officer, 70% involved use of force by an officer. The Chicago Reporter in 2018 reported similar findings: \"Two out of every three times a [Chicago Police Department] officer reported using force since 2004, they arrested\" the person on charges of resisting arrest, aggravated battery of an officer or aggravated assault of an officer.\n\nBut in Jefferson Parish, it's impossible to put numbers on the interplay between police violence and cover charges. That's because, WWNO/WRKF and ProPublica have found, the Sheriff's Office does not appear to track any incidents where the police use force on civilians unless they involve a shooting. In response to requests for records involving non-shooting use-of-force incidents, the Sheriff's Office provided none, instead sending along files on a suicide and murders committed by civilians. The Police Scorecard Project, a research organization, made a similar request for data on use-of-force incidents; the Sheriff's Office responded by saying those records don't exist. And when asked specifically if the department was tracking deputies' use of force when no shootings were involved, the Sheriff's Office did not respond.\n\nChristy Lopez, who served as deputy chief in the Civil Rights Division at the DOJ under President Barack Obama, said that failing to track when officers use force is not the hallmark of an agency with a rigorous accountability system. Lopez led the DOJ's investigation into the New Orleans Police Department that resulted in a 2013 federal consent decree.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said Lopez, who is now a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C. \"We have so much work to do in policing, and then you realize there are still agencies like this out there. [The Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office is] so bad it's hard to speak about them.\"\n\nAny arrest can cause irreparable damage to a person, especially to people of color in working-class or low-income communities. Black people are more likely to be denied bail, so they might sit in jail for months, sometimes more than a year, while awaiting trial, according to a June amicus brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court by the Boston University Center for Antiracist Research. This puts their jobs, families, housing and health in jeopardy.\n\nThe hardship is worse, said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, when the arrest is based on false charges designed to help conceal police misconduct.\n\n\"People are coerced into pleading no contest or guilty, and then barred from ever obtaining accountability for charges that should have never been stuck on them in the first place,\" Ahmed said. \"There's no way to win, especially if you're poor or marginalized.\"\n\nBut the harm of cover charges goes well beyond just the impact of the arrest. These charges also give officers and their departments immunity from civil lawsuits thanks to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that officers can't be sued for a wrongful conviction or imprisonment unless the sentence has been overturned or invalidated. An alleged victim can't file a civil rights lawsuit, the 1994 Heck v. Humphrey case determined, unless there's a \"favorable termination\" to the case.\n\nThe news organizations identified 138 cover-charge-only cases that were resolved with at least one guilty finding or guilty plea. That means that under the Heck ruling, defendants in nearly 1 of every 4 cover-charge-only cases lost the ability to sue the department for wrongful arrest, had they wanted to.\n\nAttorney Gary Bizal has been litigating cases against the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office for nearly four decades. He said the use of cover charges to kill civil lawsuits is a well-known and successful tactic. In resisting arrest cases, for example, there is typically no evidence other than the officer's testimony, making convictions relatively easy to secure, he said.\n\n\"There isn't a judge in Jefferson Parish who's going to find in favor of a defendant that says, 'I wasn't resisting,' if the cop says he was resisting,\" Bizal said. \"And the judges know that if they convict the guy, it kills the civil case. The system's stacked against you every way you turn.\"\n\nIn many cases, defendants themselves ensure this outcome by striking a plea deal to avoid significant prison time.\n\nIn February 2019, New Orleans resident Orlin Lewis led deputies on a high-speed chase in a stolen car. When his vehicle crashed, Lewis jumped out and attempted to run. The official police report states that when Detective Broussard chased him down and tackled him, Lewis punched the detective several times. Broussard used \"several closed fist strikes\" to subdue him, then arrested him for resisting police by force or violence, among other offenses, according to the report.\n\nLewis ended up in the hospital to be treated for multiple facial fractures. Broussard and other deputies on the scene said medical staff told them it was possible the injuries occurred when his vehicle crashed and his head hit the steering wheel. In his lawsuit, Lewis acknowledged he had tried to run away but insisted that the rest of the deputies' story was pure fiction. After a brief foot chase, Lewis said he realized escape was impossible, so he stopped, lay facedown on the street and surrendered. But instead of simply arresting him, Lewis said Broussard - the same detective who less than a month later would be caught on video slapping Cage's phone out of his hand and giving him the finger - lifted Lewis to his knees, unholstered a gun and pistol-whipped him, striking him in the face. That's what caused his injuries, Lewis said.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office denied these allegations in court filings and said the actions were \"reasonable under the circumstances.\"\n\nBizal also claimed in the suit that Broussard and his fellow deputies falsified a police report in which they painted Lewis as the aggressor. Their \"goal was to cover up their excessive use of force on Lewis and to justify his bodily injuries thereby denying him his right to recover damages for violation of his civil rights.\"\n\nWhether or not that was their goal, that's exactly what happened.\n\nProsecutors agreed to reduce an armed robbery charge to simple robbery if Lewis pleaded guilty. Under Heck, he still could have filed suit, since his allegations of excessive force hinged on whether he resisted the police. However, as part of the deal, he also pleaded guilty to the resisting arrest charge, which meant he could no longer sue.\n\n\"Even if a police report is a total lie, it doesn't matter, because so long as there's a conviction, it erases the sins of those lies,\" said Ahmed, the legal director at the ACLU of Louisiana.\n\nIn Louisiana, protections for the police don't end there. The state is one of just three - the others being Kentucky and Tennessee - that impose a one-year deadline on filing federal civil rights lawsuits. The national average for these limits is just under three years, with states such as Maine and North Dakota going as high as six.\n\nDefense attorneys typically caution their clients against suing the police until their criminal case is resolved, which often takes more than a year. So, even if a police department can't secure a conviction, they can do their best to run out the clock to avoid civil liability another way.\n\nIn their analysis, the news organizations identified 372 cover-charge-only cases - about 3 out of every 4 - that did not resolve within a year of the offense.\n\nThe ACLU of Louisiana is currently challenging the statute of limitations in court, using an incident in which a man tried to sue after deputies in a jail allegedly broke his nose and eye socket, leaving him barely conscious. A DeSoto Parish deputy nodded yes when asked by a state trooper if the man, Jarius Brown, had resisted, according to the trooper's body camera footage. Brown, traumatized, injured and struggling with court fines and fees, didn't bring his suit until after a year had passed.\n\n\"We're talking about atrocious beatings that are happening in Louisiana and [victims] have nowhere to go because they miss that deadline,\" said Ahmed. \"Providing a window of just 12 short months to file a federal civil rights suit before locking the courthouse doors denies people the opportunity to seek justice and has the effect of shielding police officers from being held accountable for their actions.\"\n\nThese policies that protect the police are particularly meaningful in Jefferson Parish, where the Sheriff's Office is answerable to no authority except the voters. One former sheriff described the position as \"the closest thing there is to being a king in the U.S.\"\n\nCritics contend that the other levers of accountability - complaints to the Louisiana Board of Ethics and internal affairs divisions, and criminal prosecutions - have proven to be all but worthless.\n\nAs a result, lawsuits matter and are seen by many members of the Black community as the last available means by which to hold the Sheriff's Office accountable.\n\nSince 2013, nearly twice as many lawsuits alleging wrongdoing by deputies have been filed against the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office as against the larger New Orleans Police Department. And yet, of the 198 lawsuits filed against the Sheriff's Office, only 23 resulted in settlements, the largest of which was $88,350. Three-fourths of the plaintiffs in the Jefferson Parish lawsuits were Black, and more than half of those settlements included allegations of cover charges.\n\nIn one of those, from 2012, an 18-year-old woman tried to call her grandmother as officers searched her and a friend for marijuana; a deputy allegedly slammed her into the ground, breaking three vertebrae. Another settlement resulted from an incident two years later, when a deputy allegedly slammed a pregnant woman into a patrol car as she tried to call 911 after an accident; she ended up giving birth to her stillborn fetus in jail later that night. Both women were charged with resisting arrest.\n\nBefore his election, Sheriff Joseph Lopinto worked as a private attorney and represented the Sheriff's Office in both cases. He described the deputies' actions in court filings as \"reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances.\"\n\nYears later, in response to another cover charge incident, Lopinto made a rare concession and publicly criticized his deputies, who were caught on video attacking Cage at the Mardi Gras parade. \"There is no way to justify that,\" he told reporters. \"It was unprofessional.\"\n\nEven then, his office didn't back down. Despite the video exonerating Cage, the Sheriff's Office forwarded the resisting arrest and battery of an officer charges to the district attorney's office for prosecution. Then, after Cage sued, the Sheriff's Office attempted to use the false charges to push him to accept a lower settlement, Haedicke, Cage's lawyer, said.\n\nRead More\n\n\"I'm sure they have used that tactic in many situations,\" said Haedicke, who rejected the offer.\n\nThe sheriff also promised disciplinary action, but only Broussard was punished, receiving a three-day suspension, said Haedicke. There is no indication that Dowling - who was previously fired from a nearby sheriff's office for \"violating policies and procedures\" - faced any repercussions.\n\nTwenty-one months after Cage was arrested, the district attorney dropped all charges, and 10 months after that, this October, the Sheriff's Office settled Cage's lawsuit for $40,000, according to records provided by the Sheriff's Office.\n\nDid he feel like justice had been served? \"No,\" Cage said, \"because you can't really take away that trauma.\"\n\nThrough a public records request, WWNO/WRKF and ProPublica obtained data on all charges filed in Jefferson Parish's three courts: the First and Second parish courts and the 24th Judicial Court.The courts were helpful in providing the records but charged the news organizations $1,428.04 for the information. The data includes charges filed between Jan. 1, 2018, and March 31, 2021. The records include information about the charge statute, the date of the offense, the status or outcome of the case, and the race of the defendant. The data includes arrests made by Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office as well as other local law enforcement agencies. Because information on the arresting agency was very incomplete, the analysis could not disaggregate cover charges by law enforcement agency.\n\nWWNO/WRKF and ProPublica defined cover charges as \"resisting an officer,\" \"battery of a police officer,\" \"flight from a police officer\" and \"resisting an officer by force/violence.\" Any arrest in which one of these charges appears alone or in combination exclusively with other cover charges is considered a cover-charge-only arrest.\n\nMultiple charges were grouped together into a single arrest if the charges shared the same first name, last name and offense date. Arrests that include multiple charges usually share a case number, but we found many instances of charges for the same person from the same date filed under different case numbers. Less than 6% of charges in the data were missing the date of the offense. These were not included in our analysis. We noticed other small inconsistencies, such as a missing initial or a race recorded differently for the same person on two charges. We checked that such scenarios were not causing us to label an arrest as \"cover charge only\" when that was not the case. We also excluded arrests from our cover-charge-only group if there were any non-cover charges that shared the same case number, even if they were for someone with a different name.\n\nSome cover charges appeared in the data with the case type marked as \"driving while intoxicated.\" In order to arrive at a conservative undercount of cover charges, those were not considered cover charges in our analysis. If a cover charge appeared in conjunction with any charges stemming from DWIs, accidents or traffic violations, it was not considered a cover-charge-only incident. Police interactions that consisted only of traffic, accident or DWI charges were excluded from the analysis.\n\nAny cover-charge-only arrest that ended in a guilty plea or finding was included in our analysis of guilty outcomes, regardless of when the offense occurred or how long it took for the case to resolve. Case statuses and outcomes were current as of early November 2021, when the data was exported from the court records system. Therefore, when looking at cover-charge-only arrests that took longer than a year to resolve, we only considered charges with an offense date a year or more prior - so before November 2020. Some charges took over a year to resolve and then ended with a guilty plea or finding. Those cases are included both in our count of arrests with a guilty plea or finding and in our count of arrests that took more than a year to resolve, since both the guilty outcome and slow resolution impacted defendants' ability to bring a lawsuit, had they wanted to.\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "This Cop Got Out of 44 Tickets by Saying Over and Over That His Girlfriend Stole His Car\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week. This story was co-published with the Chicago Tribune .\n\nEach time he stood before a Chicago traffic court judge and told his story, the judge asked his name.\n\n\"Jeffrey Kriv,\" he'd say. That was true.\n\nThen he'd raise his right hand and get sworn in. What came next was also consistent.\n\n\"Well, that morning, I broke up with my girlfriend and she stole my car,\" Kriv, who had been ticketed for running a red light, testified in January 2021.\n\n\"Yeah, I broke up with my girlfriend earlier that morning, had a knock-down, drag-out fight, verbally, of course. She took my car without my knowledge,\" he told a different judge when fighting a speeding ticket in August 2021.\n\n\"I broke up with my girlfriend that day and she took my car without my knowledge. ... I didn't get my car back for like three days. But it was her driving the car,\" he said while contesting a speeding ticket, once again under oath, in May 2022.\n\nThe excuse worked, just as it had many times before.\n\nAt the ticket hearings, Kriv often provided what he said were legitimate police incident reports as evidence of the car thefts; they had officer names and badge numbers, and he explained that he got the reports at police headquarters.\n\nBut Kriv did not let on that he, himself, was a Chicago cop.\n\nAs bold as he was when fighting his tickets, he was equally brazen in his professional life. He attracted a remarkable number of complaints from citizens he encountered - and even from other officers. And just as he did in his personal life, he defended himself vigorously against the allegations.\n\nKriv doesn't register as one of Chicago's most notorious corrupt cops - those who tortured suspects for confessions or shook down drug dealers. But his on-duty conduct regularly flouted rules and disrupted lives. Once, he punched a handcuffed man in the back of his patrol car, records show.\n\nBut given Chicago's long-standing and dramatic shortcomings in police discipline, none of his on-duty misconduct cost him his badge and gun.\n\nIt took a tip to an outside agency and questions about Kriv's testimony as a private citizen in traffic court to unravel his career.\n\nA spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department would not comment for this story or answer any questions.\n\nA lawyer for Kriv, informed of the reporting by ProPublica and the Chicago Tribune, said \"many of the facts you compose are incomplete or not true,\" though he did not say what was inaccurate. The lawyer, Tim Grace, said that Kriv had received nearly 150 commendations and recognitions and had earned two awards for saving lives.\n\n\"Officer Kriv has served his city with honor for over 25-plus years,\" Grace said.\n\nListen to Former Chicago Police Officer Jeffrey Kriv Try to Avoid Traffic Fines by Repeatedly Claiming His Ex-Girlfriend Stole His Car\n\nKriv used the alibi to get out of paying for 44 traffic tickets since 2013, Cook County prosecutors allege.\n\nIn 1996, Kriv was sworn in as a Chicago police officer. The first complaint about him came about eight months later, while Kriv was still a probationary hire. A man said Kriv broke his car window with a flashlight while directing traffic; Kriv was not disciplined in that incident.\n\nSupervisors reprimanded him a few months later, however, after Kriv failed to notice there was a marijuana cigarette on the back seat of his squad car.\n\nBut there was more to come, records show: being rude, offensive or physically abusive; flipping someone off; and writing in a police report that one woman was \"white trash\" and a \"raving lunatic.\"\n\nHe was held in contempt of court and arrested after he flung papers into the air and called the judge's ruling \"a joke.\" He apologized in court the next day, and the contempt charge was vacated. An assistant deputy superintendent recommended against removing his police powers after the incident, records show. In another case, a different judge ordered him removed from a courtroom after he wouldn't stop talking.\n\nMost officers face only a handful of complaints over the course of their careers. But at least 92 misconduct complaints were filed against Kriv, according to city and police disciplinary records compiled and analyzed by the Chicago Tribune and ProPublica. Even more exceptional: About 28% of complaints against Kriv were found to have merit, compared with about 4% of complaints against all Chicago police officers going back decades.\n\nIn 2005, after a city Streets and Sanitation Department employee towed his illegally parked personal car, Kriv sent a letter via the city's interoffice mail system threatening to ticket the cars of Streets and Sanitation workers in retaliation. He was suspended for 20 days. In 2006, he left the scene of a vehicle fire he had responded to, removed the numbers that identified his squad car and went into a strip club to visit a waitress, according to internal police investigation records. He was issued a 90-day suspension that was later knocked down to 45 days.\n\nIn 2009, Kriv was accused of punching a woman whom he'd arrested after seeing her arguing with her husband on the street. The woman was found not guilty at trial on charges of domestic battery and resisting arrest.\n\n\"I had to have surgery. I had to have plastic implanted under my eye because of this,\" said Jessie Wangeman, who lives in Indianapolis. \"My face is not symmetrical anymore. He really messed me up on the outside. And inside it was a really traumatic experience.\"\n\nWangeman sued Kriv and the city of Chicago over the encounter; the city paid her $100,000 to settle in 2011. Wangeman declined to talk with investigators looking into Kriv's alleged misconduct, and Kriv wasn't disciplined.\n\nMeanwhile, Kriv's personal vehicles - a BMW sedan and a Harley-Davidson motorcycle - were ticketed 22 times between 2008 and 2013. He paid some of those tickets, records show.\n\nAt a traffic court hearing in December 2013, Kriv used the girlfriend alibi for the first time, authorities now allege.\n\n\"May I ask you why you're contesting this ticket, Mr. Kriv?\" the judge asked.\n\n\"Yes, my ex-girlfriend, well, took my car two days prior after I broke up with her. I filed a police report that it was stolen and they recovered it approximately a week after the fact,\" he testified. \"Here's the police report that was done. I did have her arrested approximately three weeks ago and I got a court date coming up in January.\"\n\nThe judge reviewed the report and dismissed the ticket.\n\nKriv was investigated at least 26 times over allegations of dishonesty as a police officer. That included accusations of falsifying records, writing unwarranted tickets, performing improper searches, making false arrests.\n\nOne man accused Kriv of writing him false parking citations. A woman complained that Kriv issued her eight baseless citations in two weeks while her vehicle was parked in an assigned space on private property. And another man made two other complaints accusing Kriv of repeatedly writing tickets to him at his business as a way to harass him. Department investigators concluded that Kriv wrote unwarranted tickets to that man; investigations into the other allegations could not be pursued because the accusers did not sign formal complaints.\n\nAs a cop, Kriv's specialty was DUI enforcement. He made more DUI arrests in Chicago than any other officer in 2021, and he topped the list statewide the same year, according to one anti-drunken-driving group.\n\nBut one woman sued him over her 2015 drunken driving arrest after she was acquitted at trial. The lawsuit alleged that Kriv falsely arrested her and made false statements against her. Kriv denied the allegations.\n\n\"He would lie under oath for a piece of bubble gum,\" the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from Kriv, told a reporter.\n\nThe woman later dropped the lawsuit because she said Kriv was disparaging and intimidating her.\n\nEven outside of his job and his chutzpah in traffic court, Kriv's history is notable.\n\nWhile Kriv was growing up in Highland Park, his father, an attorney, funded a messy fraud scheme, survived an assassination attempt meant to silence him about it, and was sent to federal prison for a second fraud racket that involved sending falsified accident claims through the mail, according to court records at the National Archives. Kriv's father testified at trial in the first fraud case and did not face charges for his role in that scheme.\n\nKriv then attended the University of Iowa for six years. A university spokesperson said he never graduated - though he claimed that he had in an application for another city job in 2013 . Kriv's attorney did not respond to a question about his educational history.\n\nWhen Kriv was in his late 20s, the unemployment insurance division of the Illinois attorney general's office sued him to recoup about $3,800 in benefits for which the government claimed he wasn't eligible, records show. Details about what led to the attorney general's claim are missing from court files, and there's no public record of how it was resolved.\n\nNeither the Police Department nor the city's human resources division could locate Kriv's initial application to the Police Department, so it's unclear how much hiring officials knew about his background.\n\nIt's also unclear whether the department knew how often Kriv was being ticketed for traffic violations - nine times in 2014 alone, records show. He got all of those tickets dismissed, including a speeding ticket issued in the fall for going 21 miles an hour over the speed limit near a school.\n\n\"My ex-girlfriend stole my car,\" Kriv told the judge. \"There is this police report over here that was done and, a matter of fact, I had another ticket I contested last week ... another speed camera.\n\n\"They only charged her with trespassing because it was my girlfriend. She stole my key and racked up all these tickets here.\"\n\nThe judge reviewed the report and dismissed the ticket.\n\nKriv's conduct as a cop stands out in yet another way: Even other cops complained about him.\n\nInternal affairs records show that a police lieutenant filed a complaint against Kriv in 2016 accusing Kriv of failing to arrest an off-duty sergeant who was involved in a crash, even though the sergeant was unsteady, was slurring his speech and had urinated in his pants - \"wasted,\" according to a police report. Kriv was suspended for 15 days for violating five department rules in that incident.\n\nHis police partner once reported that he made her get out of their squad car after an argument, forcing her to walk more than a half-mile back to their station. Investigators concluded there wasn't enough evidence in that case to discipline Kriv.\n\nIn 2014, supervisors - including the head of the DUI task force that Kriv was on - filed a complaint against Kriv alleging that he disobeyed commands from a higher-ranking officer and impounded a car without justification after a traffic crash.\n\nOver the other officers' objections, Kriv declared that the driver of the car involved in the crash was drunk, handcuffed him, and put him in the back of his squad car, according to accounts from the driver, Jaime Garcia, and other officers. He also ordered Garcia's Nissan Altima towed and impounded.\n\n\"He kept telling me, 'I know you're drunk, I know you're drunk.' I didn't know what to do, I was in shock, I was scared,\" Garcia said in an interview.\n\nThe officers on the scene filed the complaint against Kriv.\n\n\"For some reason, he was trying to put a false arrest on this guy. I apologized to him, said, 'Sorry you had to go through this.' I told him about filing a complaint,\" said retired Lt. David Blanco, the supervisor that night. After its investigation, the department acknowledged Kriv was wrong to have impounded Garcia's car, knowing there would be no DUI charges against him.\n\nKriv ultimately wasn't disciplined for his behavior that night, once again benefiting from the Police Department's feeble accountability system , which has long been marked by delays, red tape and lax punishment .\n\nThough he regularly escaped punishment altogether for alleged misconduct on the job, in some cases, he was reprimanded or received suspensions of between one and 45 days. The department suspended Kriv at least 20 times for 170 days total, according to a Tribune-ProPublica analysis of his disciplinary records.\n\nOne citizen told the investigating agency that Kriv was unconcerned when he threatened to file a complaint. Kriv, the man said, told him that complaints \"are not going to go anywhere,\" no matter how many an officer was facing. The man's complaint was closed after he declined to participate in the investigation.\n\nKriv appealed disciplinary decisions at least eight times over his career, including through the department's grievance system. A 2017 investigation by the Chicago Tribune and ProPublica found that 85% of disciplinary cases handled through the department's grievance process since 2010 had led to officers receiving shorter suspensions or, in many cases, having their punishments overturned entirely.\n\n\"It doesn't hurt to grieve it. Why wouldn't I?\" Kriv told the Chicago Tribune and ProPublica for that story.\n\nKriv got a five-day suspension reduced to a reprimand, another five-day suspension reduced to two days, and a 90-day suspension - for going to the strip club while on duty - cut in half.\n\n\"It sounds to me like several of these cases - each of them standing on its own, independently - should have triggered a discharge case,\" said Mark Iris, who until 2004 was the executive director of the Chicago Police Board, the civilian body that decides disciplinary cases involving Chicago officers. He also studied the use of mathematical analysis to prevent police misconduct and taught at Northwestern University.\n\n\"The unit commanders had to have known this guy was a headache,\" Iris said in an interview.\n\nRecords show the department never tried to fire Kriv.\n\nBlanco, like many of the people Kriv encountered, said he doesn't get how Kriv remained on the force.\n\n\"That's what I couldn't understand - with all the suspensions, why they didn't get rid of this guy. There's obviously a red light flashing over this guy's head,\" Blanco told ProPublica and the Tribune.\n\nDuring Kriv's career, the Chicago Police Department had eight superintendents, three iterations of an independent police investigation body and at least two versions of an internal affairs division. The Police Department has stalled on at least two attempts to implement an early-warning system to spot problem behavior.\n\nIn its 2019 consent decree with the Justice Department, the Police Department agreed to develop a system to identify officers at risk of misconduct, alert their supervisors and provide training. That system still has not been implemented , according to the latest consent decree update.\n\nIn addition, for most of Kriv's career, the police union's contract with the department allowed investigators to consider only the most recent five years of an officer's disciplinary history. (The current union contract eliminates that requirement). That meant that even officers with extensive histories of misconduct could have looked problem-free when department leaders weighed discipline options.\n\nAs a result, when investigators in 2013 looked into a complaint against Kriv, his recent disciplinary history was clean, so they proceeded as if he'd never been disciplined. The truth was that, by then, he had been suspended or reprimanded for at least 15 different incidents, but the most recent complaints were more than five years old or didn't appear on his record yet because they were still under investigation.\n\nAs Kriv successfully appealed Police Department discipline, he also was successfully beating more and more traffic tickets.\n\nFrom 2015 through mid-2022, Kriv got 51 tickets but paid only two.\n\nOther tickets - issued for reasons including exceeding the speed limit by at least 11 miles an hour, running red lights, blocking an area and parking where he shouldn't - were dismissed.\n\nHe got some tickets dismissed by making technical arguments - claiming a ticket wasn't filled out properly, for example - but most were dismissed after he blamed his girlfriend, records show.\n\nKriv contested tickets using that defense before at least 23 different judges. Sometimes he went before the same judge with the same story, but those appearances were typically years apart.\n\nAt a hearing in 2018, he tried to get out of a speeding ticket issued in a school zone.\n\n\"My girlfriend and I got in an argument that morning,\" he told the judge. \"We broke up. She took my fob and she took my car and I do have a police report.\"\n\n\"I didn't get it back until later that night around 9 o'clock. And I did have her arrested about a week later. We went to her workplace, but here's a copy of the police report.\"\n\nThe judge reviewed the report and dismissed the ticket.\n\nCitywide, it's rare for people to succeed in getting their tickets dismissed. In a typical year, the city issues about 1 million automated-camera tickets for speeding and red-light violations. People contest about 4% of those tickets, and about 1 in 10 win, according to an analysis of city ticket data.\n\nThere's no indication the Police Department knew how often Kriv was contesting his tickets in court. There's also no indication in records that the girlfriend he used as his alibi was real.\n\nLast year, the city's Office of Inspector General received a tip to look at Kriv - not for his work in uniform, but for a potentially fraudulent defense of a parking ticket he had received, records show.\n\nThe OIG followed that tip and concluded that Kriv had provided false testimony and fraudulent documentation related to parking and traffic violations since 2009, according to prosecutors. Since 2013, he had contested 44 tickets by saying his girlfriend had stolen his car. All 44 had been dismissed.\n\nThe office notified the Police Department that it was investigating Kriv.\n\nThe Cook County state's attorney's office in October barred Kriv from testifying in court as a witness, placing him on a list of police officers whose truthfulness is in question . Nonetheless, the police department kept him on the streets and he continued to write tickets and make DUI arrests.\n\nThe final time Kriv took an oath to tell the truth and then blamed his girlfriend for a speeding ticket was in September of 2022, records show. Once again, the story worked.\n\n\"Well, I had her arrested,\" Kriv said when the judge asked what happened to the woman. \"They charged her with a misdemeanor trespassing to a vehicle. That pretty much went nowhere.\n\n\"She got, like, three months' supervision or something like that. It's kind of a, I don't want to say the system's like a joke, but it didn't really do anything.\"\n\nAs Kriv, who is 56, was defending himself in traffic court last year, he also was eyeing retirement, going back and forth with the Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago to sort out his pension benefits. He was told he'd gain another year of seniority - and a larger pension - if he stayed on the force until Jan. 15.\n\nOn Jan. 12, the department collected his badge and stripped him of police powers.\n\nOn Jan. 14, Kriv got another speeding ticket.\n\nOn Jan. 17, Kriv retired.\n\nThe next day, Kriv's car was ticketed again for speeding.\n\nOn Jan. 31, Cook County prosecutors charged Kriv with four counts of perjury and five counts of forgery, all of them felonies, for allegedly lying to judges under oath and providing fictitious police reports in four traffic ticket cases.\n\nThe girlfriend story, prosecutors allege, was fake. Prosecutors calculated that, by getting out of 44 tickets, Kriv saved himself $3,665.\n\nThe state's attorney's office declined to comment about its case against Kriv.\n\nKriv emailed the pension board the day after he was charged and released on $10,000 bond, writing: \"When do I start getting my pension checks and does it come bi-weekly or once a month?\" His pension started at about $6,000 a month, according to the board.\n\nDeborah Witzburg, the inspector general whose office helped build the case against Kriv, declined to comment for this story. In a news release about the charges, she said: \"The truthfulness and credibility of police officers is foundational to the fair administration of justice, and to CPD's effectiveness as a law enforcement agency.\"\n\nRead More\n\nGrace, Kriv's attorney, noted that the criminal charges are not related to his duties as a police officer. \"He understands the importance of accountability by all citizens when it comes to paying his outstanding tickets and looks forward to resolving this matter by making good on any oversights he may have,\" Grace said.\n\nIn late March, a Cook County judge called out, \"Jeffrey Kriv,\" and the former officer stepped forward to be arraigned. He pleaded not guilty. Each offense is punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nWhen reached by phone, Kriv said he didn't want to talk because \"nobody gets a fair shake with the media\" and his attorney had advised him not to say anything.\n\n\"When it is all said and done, this will be dismissed,\" he said. \"There is nothing to it.\"\n\nKriv got three more speeding tickets soon after he retired in mid-January. He didn't contest any of them, and he paid the fines.\n\nThen he got three more speeding tickets.\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica? Help Us Do Journalism.\n\nGot a story we should hear?

The lawyer, Tim Grace, said that Kriv had received nearly 150 commendations and recognitions and had earned two awards for saving lives.\n\n\"Officer Kriv has served his city with honor for over 25-plus years,\" Grace said.\n\nListen to Former Chicago Police Officer Jeffrey Kriv Try to Avoid Traffic Fines by Repeatedly Claiming His Ex-Girlfriend Stole His Car\n\nKriv used the alibi to get out of paying for 44 traffic tickets since 2013, Cook County prosecutors allege.\n\nIn 1996, Kriv was sworn in as a Chicago police officer. The first complaint about him came about eight months later, while Kriv was still a probationary hire. A man said Kriv broke his car window with a flashlight while directing traffic; Kriv was not disciplined in that incident.\n\nSupervisors reprimanded him a few months later, however, after Kriv failed to notice there was a marijuana cigarette on the back seat of his squad car.\n\nBut there was more to come, records show: being rude, offensive or physically abusive; flipping someone off; and writing in a police report that one woman was \"white trash\" and a \"raving lunatic.\"\n\nHe was held in contempt of court and arrested after he flung papers into the air and called the judge's ruling \"a joke.\" He apologized in court the next day, and the contempt charge was vacated. An assistant deputy superintendent recommended against removing his police powers after the incident, records show. In another case, a different judge ordered him removed from a courtroom after he wouldn't stop talking.\n\nMost officers face only a handful of complaints over the course of their careers. But at least 92 misconduct complaints were filed against Kriv, according to city and police disciplinary records compiled and analyzed by the Chicago Tribune and ProPublica. Even more exceptional: About 28% of complaints against Kriv were found to have merit, compared with about 4% of complaints against all Chicago police officers going back decades.\n\nIn 2005, after a city Streets and Sanitation Department employee towed his illegally parked personal car, Kriv sent a letter via the city's interoffice mail system threatening to ticket the cars of Streets and Sanitation workers in retaliation. He was suspended for 20 days. In 2006, he left the scene of a vehicle fire he had responded to, removed the numbers that identified his squad car and went into a strip club to visit a waitress, according to internal police investigation records. He was issued a 90-day suspension that was later knocked down to 45 days.\n\nIn 2009, Kriv was accused of punching a woman whom he'd arrested after seeing her arguing with her husband on the street. The woman was found not guilty at trial on charges of domestic battery and resisting arrest.\n\n\"I had to have surgery. I had to have plastic implanted under my eye because of this,\" said Jessie Wangeman, who lives in Indianapolis. \"My face is not symmetrical anymore. He really messed me up on the outside. And inside it was a really traumatic experience.\"\n\nWangeman sued Kriv and the city of Chicago over the encounter; the city paid her $100,000 to settle in 2011. Wangeman declined to talk with investigators looking into Kriv's alleged misconduct, and Kriv wasn't disciplined.\n\nMeanwhile, Kriv's personal vehicles - a BMW sedan and a Harley-Davidson motorcycle - were ticketed 22 times between 2008 and 2013. He paid some of those tickets, records show.\n\nAt a traffic court hearing in December 2013, Kriv used the girlfriend alibi for the first time, authorities now allege.\n\n\"May I ask you why you're contesting this ticket, Mr. Kriv?\" the judge asked.\n\n\"Yes, my ex-girlfriend, well, took my car two days prior after I broke up with her. I filed a police report that it was stolen and they recovered it approximately a week after the fact,\" he testified. \"Here's the police report that was done. I did have her arrested approximately three weeks ago and I got a court date coming up in January.\"\n\nThe judge reviewed the report and dismissed the ticket.\n\nKriv was investigated at least 26 times over allegations of dishonesty as a police officer. That included accusations of falsifying records, writing unwarranted tickets, performing improper searches, making false arrests.\n\nOne man accused Kriv of writing him false parking citations. A woman complained that Kriv issued her eight baseless citations in two weeks while her vehicle was parked in an assigned space on private property. And another man made two other complaints accusing Kriv of repeatedly writing tickets to him at his business as a way to harass him. Department investigators concluded that Kriv wrote unwarranted tickets to that man; investigations into the other allegations could not be pursued because the accusers did not sign formal complaints.\n\nAs a cop, Kriv's specialty was DUI enforcement. He made more DUI arrests in Chicago than any other officer in 2021, and he topped the list statewide the same year, according to one anti-drunken-driving group.\n\nBut one woman sued him over her 2015 drunken driving arrest after she was acquitted at trial. The lawsuit alleged that Kriv falsely arrested her and made false statements against her. Kriv denied the allegations.\n\n\"He would lie under oath for a piece of bubble gum,\" the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from Kriv, told a reporter.\n\nThe woman later dropped the lawsuit because she said Kriv was disparaging and intimidating her.\n\nEven outside of his job and his chutzpah in traffic court, Kriv's history is notable.\n\nWhile Kriv was growing up in Highland Park, his father, an attorney, funded a messy fraud scheme, survived an assassination attempt meant to silence him about it, and was sent to federal prison for a second fraud racket that involved sending falsified accident claims through the mail, according to court records at the National Archives. Kriv's father testified at trial in the first fraud case and did not face charges for his role in that scheme.\n\nKriv then attended the University of Iowa for six years. A university spokesperson said he never graduated - though he claimed that he had in an application for another city job in 2013 . Kriv's attorney did not respond to a question about his educational history.\n\nWhen Kriv was in his late 20s, the unemployment insurance division of the Illinois attorney general's office sued him to recoup about $3,800 in benefits for which the government claimed he wasn't eligible, records show. Details about what led to the attorney general's claim are missing from court files, and there's no public record of how it was resolved.\n\nNeither the Police Department nor the city's human resources division could locate Kriv's initial application to the Police Department, so it's unclear how much hiring officials knew about his background.\n\nIt's also unclear whether the department knew how often Kriv was being ticketed for traffic violations - nine times in 2014 alone, records show. He got all of those tickets dismissed, including a speeding ticket issued in the fall for going 21 miles an hour over the speed limit near a school.\n\n\"My ex-girlfriend stole my car,\" Kriv told the judge. \"There is this police report over here that was done and, a matter of fact, I had another ticket I contested last week ... another speed camera.\n\n\"They only charged her with trespassing because it was my girlfriend. She stole my key and racked up all these tickets here.\"\n\nThe judge reviewed the report and dismissed the ticket.\n\nKriv's conduct as a cop stands out in yet another way: Even other cops complained about him.\n\nInternal affairs records show that a police lieutenant filed a complaint against Kriv in 2016 accusing Kriv of failing to arrest an off-duty sergeant who was involved in a crash, even though the sergeant was unsteady, was slurring his speech and had urinated in his pants - \"wasted,\" according to a police report. Kriv was suspended for 15 days for violating five department rules in that incident.\n\nHis police partner once reported that he made her get out of their squad car after an argument, forcing her to walk more than a half-mile back to their station. Investigators concluded there wasn't enough evidence in that case to discipline Kriv.\n\nIn 2014, supervisors - including the head of the DUI task force that Kriv was on - filed a complaint against Kriv alleging that he disobeyed commands from a higher-ranking officer and impounded a car without justification after a traffic crash.\n\nOver the other officers' objections, Kriv declared that the driver of the car involved in the crash was drunk, handcuffed him, and put him in the back of his squad car, according to accounts from the driver, Jaime Garcia, and other officers. He also ordered Garcia's Nissan Altima towed and impounded.\n\n\"He kept telling me, 'I know you're drunk, I know you're drunk.' I didn't know what to do, I was in shock, I was scared,\" Garcia said in an interview.\n\nThe officers on the scene filed the complaint against Kriv.\n\n\"For some reason, he was trying to put a false arrest on this guy. I apologized to him, said, 'Sorry you had to go through this.' I told him about filing a complaint,\" said retired Lt. David Blanco, the supervisor that night. After its investigation, the department acknowledged Kriv was wrong to have impounded Garcia's car, knowing there would be no DUI charges against him.\n\nKriv ultimately wasn't disciplined for his behavior that night, once again benefiting from the Police Department's feeble accountability system , which has long been marked by delays, red tape and lax punishment .\n\nThough he regularly escaped punishment altogether for alleged misconduct on the job, in some cases, he was reprimanded or received suspensions of between one and 45 days. The department suspended Kriv at least 20 times for 170 days total, according to a Tribune-ProPublica analysis of his disciplinary records.\n\nOne citizen told the investigating agency that Kriv was unconcerned when he threatened to file a complaint. Kriv, the man said, told him that complaints \"are not going to go anywhere,\" no matter how many an officer was facing. The man's complaint was closed after he declined to participate in the investigation.\n\nKriv appealed disciplinary decisions at least eight times over his career, including through the department's grievance system. A 2017 investigation by the Chicago Tribune and ProPublica found that 85% of disciplinary cases handled through the department's grievance process since 2010 had led to officers receiving shorter suspensions or, in many cases, having their punishments overturned entirely.\n\n\"It doesn't hurt to grieve it. Why wouldn't I?\" Kriv told the Chicago Tribune and ProPublica for that story.\n\nKriv got a five-day suspension reduced to a reprimand, another five-day suspension reduced to two days, and a 90-day suspension - for going to the strip club while on duty - cut in half.\n\n\"It sounds to me like several of these cases - each of them standing on its own, independently - should have triggered a discharge case,\" said Mark Iris, who until 2004 was the executive director of the Chicago Police Board, the civilian body that decides disciplinary cases involving Chicago officers. He also studied the use of mathematical analysis to prevent police misconduct and taught at Northwestern University.\n\n\"The unit commanders had to have known this guy was a headache,\" Iris said in an interview.\n\nRecords show the department never tried to fire Kriv.\n\nBlanco, like many of the people Kriv encountered, said he doesn't get how Kriv remained on the force.\n\n\"That's what I couldn't understand - with all the suspensions, why they didn't get rid of this guy. There's obviously a red light flashing over this guy's head,\" Blanco told ProPublica and the Tribune.\n\nDuring Kriv's career, the Chicago Police Department had eight superintendents, three iterations of an independent police investigation body and at least two versions of an internal affairs division. The Police Department has stalled on at least two attempts to implement an early-warning system to spot problem behavior.\n\nIn its 2019 consent decree with the Justice Department, the Police Department agreed to develop a system to identify officers at risk of misconduct, alert their supervisors and provide training. That system still has not been implemented , according to the latest consent decree update.\n\nIn addition, for most of Kriv's career, the police union's contract with the department allowed investigators to consider only the most recent five years of an officer's disciplinary history. (The current union contract eliminates that requirement). That meant that even officers with extensive histories of misconduct could have looked problem-free when department leaders weighed discipline options.\n\nAs a result, when investigators in 2013 looked into a complaint against Kriv, his recent disciplinary history was clean, so they proceeded as if he'd never been disciplined. The truth was that, by then, he had been suspended or reprimanded for at least 15 different incidents, but the most recent complaints were more than five years old or didn't appear on his record yet because they were still under investigation.\n\nAs Kriv successfully appealed Police Department discipline, he also was successfully beating more and more traffic tickets.\n\nFrom 2015 through mid-2022, Kriv got 51 tickets but paid only two.\n\nOther tickets - issued for reasons including exceeding the speed limit by at least 11 miles an hour, running red lights, blocking an area and parking where he shouldn't - were dismissed.\n\nHe got some tickets dismissed by making technical arguments - claiming a ticket wasn't filled out properly, for example - but most were dismissed after he blamed his girlfriend, records show.\n\nKriv contested tickets using that defense before at least 23 different judges. Sometimes he went before the same judge with the same story, but those appearances were typically years apart.\n\nAt a hearing in 2018, he tried to get out of a speeding ticket issued in a school zone.\n\n\"My girlfriend and I got in an argument that morning,\" he told the judge. \"We broke up. She took my fob and she took my car and I do have a police report.\"\n\n\"I didn't get it back until later that night around 9 o'clock. And I did have her arrested about a week later. We went to her workplace, but here's a copy of the police report.\"\n\nThe judge reviewed the report and dismissed the ticket.\n\nCitywide, it's rare for people to succeed in getting their tickets dismissed. In a typical year, the city issues about 1 million automated-camera tickets for speeding and red-light violations. People contest about 4% of those tickets, and about 1 in 10 win, according to an analysis of city ticket data.\n\nThere's no indication the Police Department knew how often Kriv was contesting his tickets in court. There's also no indication in records that the girlfriend he used as his alibi was real.\n\nLast year, the city's Office of Inspector General received a tip to look at Kriv - not for his work in uniform, but for a potentially fraudulent defense of a parking ticket he had received, records show.\n\nThe OIG followed that tip and concluded that Kriv had provided false testimony and fraudulent documentation related to parking and traffic violations since 2009, according to prosecutors. Since 2013, he had contested 44 tickets by saying his girlfriend had stolen his car. All 44 had been dismissed.\n\nThe office notified the Police Department that it was investigating Kriv.\n\nThe Cook County state's attorney's office in October barred Kriv from testifying in court as a witness, placing him on a list of police officers whose truthfulness is in question . Nonetheless, the police department kept him on the streets and he continued to write tickets and make DUI arrests.\n\nThe final time Kriv took an oath to tell the truth and then blamed his girlfriend for a speeding ticket was in September of 2022, records show. Once again, the story worked.\n\n\"Well, I had her arrested,\" Kriv said when the judge asked what happened to the woman. \"They charged her with a misdemeanor trespassing to a vehicle. That pretty much went nowhere.\n\n\"She got, like, three months' supervision or something like that. It's kind of a, I don't want to say the system's like a joke, but it didn't really do anything.\"\n\nAs Kriv, who is 56, was defending himself in traffic court last year, he also was eyeing retirement, going back and forth with the Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago to sort out his pension benefits. He was told he'd gain another year of seniority - and a larger pension - if he stayed on the force until Jan. 15.\n\nOn Jan. 12, the department collected his badge and stripped him of police powers.\n\nOn Jan. 14, Kriv got another speeding ticket.\n\nOn Jan. 17, Kriv retired.\n\nThe next day, Kriv's car was ticketed again for speeding.\n\nOn Jan. 31, Cook County prosecutors charged Kriv with four counts of perjury and five counts of forgery, all of them felonies, for allegedly lying to judges under oath and providing fictitious police reports in four traffic ticket cases.\n\nThe girlfriend story, prosecutors allege, was fake. Prosecutors calculated that, by getting out of 44 tickets, Kriv saved himself $3,665.\n\nThe state's attorney's office declined to comment about its case against Kriv.\n\nKriv emailed the pension board the day after he was charged and released on $10,000 bond, writing: \"When do I start getting my pension checks and does it come bi-weekly or once a month?\" His pension started at about $6,000 a month, according to the board.\n\nDeborah Witzburg, the inspector general whose office helped build the case against Kriv, declined to comment for this story. In a news release about the charges, she said: \"The truthfulness and credibility of police officers is foundational to the fair administration of justice, and to CPD's effectiveness as a law enforcement agency.\"\n\nRead More\n\nGrace, Kriv's attorney, noted that the criminal charges are not related to his duties as a police officer. \"He understands the importance of accountability by all citizens when it comes to paying his outstanding tickets and looks forward to resolving this matter by making good on any oversights he may have,\" Grace said.\n\nIn late March, a Cook County judge called out, \"Jeffrey Kriv,\" and the former officer stepped forward to be arraigned. He pleaded not guilty. Each offense is punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nWhen reached by phone, Kriv said he didn't want to talk because \"nobody gets a fair shake with the media\" and his attorney had advised him not to say anything.\n\n\"When it is all said and done, this will be dismissed,\" he said. \"There is nothing to it.\"\n\nKriv got three more speeding tickets soon after he retired in mid-January. He didn't contest any of them, and he paid the fines.\n\nThen he got three more speeding tickets.\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica? Help Us Do Journalism.\n\nGot a story we should hear?

      "text": "A Police Car Hit a Kid on Halloween 2019. The NYPD Is Quashing a Move to Punish the Officer.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nIt was a little more than two years ago that I really started learning about the reality of police oversight in America.\n\nOn Halloween night in 2019, my wife and our then-6-year-old daughter were walking home from trick-or-treating in our Brooklyn neighborhood when they saw a New York Police Department car go the wrong way down a street and smack into a teenager, who fell and then ran away.\n\nWhen I contacted the NYPD afterward, they told me that what my family saw hadn't happened. A police car hadn't hit a teenager. The teenager had hit the car. Or, as an NYPD statement put it , he \"ran across the hood of a stationary police car.\"\n\nI ended up diving into the case and wrote about it the next summer during the global racial justice protests spawned by George Floyd's murder.\n\nRead More\n\nThe police had been looking for a group of Black, male teenagers who reportedly had stolen a cellphone. After the teenager who'd been hit by the car ran away, my wife, Sara, watched as officers turned their attention to other Black boys.\n\nThe police lined the boys up against the wall of our local movie theater, then arrested three of them. The boys insisted they had just been trick-or-treating. The youngest was 12. He was crying, asking repeatedly, \"What did I do?\"\n\nI didn't hear anything more about the case for a long while. Then, a few weeks ago, the city agency charged with investigating civilians' complaints of police abuse let me know it had finally finished its investigation.\n\nThe Civilian Complaint Review Board found that, contrary to the NYPD's assertions, an officer did hit a kid with his car. It also found that officers, including the precinct commander, had arrested the boys without justification. An officer had even drawn his gun and pointed it at one of the boys.\n\nOne of the officers, the report noted, was wearing a sweatshirt with a logo of the Punisher , a Marvel character who kills lawbreakers, which is popular with cops and white nationalists. The sweatshirt also had a blue line over the American flag and the acronym DILLIGAF. (\"Do I Look Like I Give a Fuck.\") The officer told investigators he hadn't known the meaning of the logo or the acronym on his sweatshirt.\n\nThe police response that night started when some teenagers told officers they had been robbed at the local park. But the officers only had what investigators later described as \" varying and inconsistent descriptions \" of who they were looking for.\n\nThe officers stopped a group of boys a few blocks away. There was little about them that matched the description of the assailants other than that they were Black, young and walking together. Indeed, the CCRB's report noted, one of the officers \" stated that he was not certain whether they were involved .\"\n\nSome of the boys ran, including the one who was hit by the police car. (They told investigators that they ran because they were scared.)\n\nThe boys who were arrested - a 15-year-old, a 14-year-old and the 12-year-old - said that the officers never offered any explanation for why they were stopped. They were released without charges, after being held for hours. Their parents said they weren't given any documentation on the arrests. The mother of one of the boys worked for the NYPD as a school safety officer, but even she couldn't get any record of what happened.\n\nIt was as if the case was being pushed into a fog.\n\nThe CCRB began investigating after receiving a witness complaint. But the agency's investigations are dependent on the NYPD cooperating. And as often happens, the NYPD has been slow to do so .\n\nTake body-worn cameras, which are often critical in abuse investigations. The CCRB noted it faced \" extremely substantial delays \" in getting the Halloween night footage from the NYPD. While some cities have given civilian investigators direct access to body cam footage, the NYPD has rejected calls to do the same.\n\nThe agency also did not get to interview officers until more than a year after the incident. By the time officers did finally submit to interviews, they had serious trouble with their recollections. When the officer who drove the car was asked whether he had hit a kid, he \" stated that he could not remember .\"\n\nIn December, the CCRB told me it had just filed disciplinary charges against the officers: for wrongful arrests, for pulling a gun without justification, and for, as the bureaucratic lingo puts it, \" Force, Vehicle .\"\n\nThe next step would typically be disciplinary hearings, in which the CCRB acts as the prosecutor and the proceedings are overseen by an NYPD judge, who answers ultimately to the police commissioner. While the penalties after guilty verdicts are often wrist-slappy, like lost vacation days , it seemed like this case could be a rare, if modest, victory for police accountability.\n\nThen, about a week after I heard about the outcome of the investigation, I learned of another twist.\n\nThe NYPD had informed the CCRB that it was invoking its authority to unilaterally end the cases against most of the officers the civilian agency had charged with misconduct. No disciplinary charges would be brought against them.\n\nInstead of letting the CCRB's disciplinary process play out, the NYPD said it would handle the cases internally. The NYPD wrote, as it has many times before, that allowing the CCRB case to continue \"would be detrimental to the Police Department's disciplinary process.\"\n\nWhen it came to the officer who had hit the kid with his car, the NYPD said it was an \"alleged traffic accident\" and that therefore the CCRB had no authority to investigate in the first place.\n\nThe NYPD did decide that the disciplinary charges against one officer could continue - for using offensive language and telling one of the teens to stop filming on his phone.\n\nIt was all remarkable, but also par for the course.\n\nLike many police departments around the country, the NYPD has complete discretion to overrule the civilian agency that is supposed to help oversee it.\n\nIn New York City, the police commissioner can and often does choose to ignore the results of CCRB-brought disciplinary trials. The commissioner can ignore guilty pleas and can even decide there should be no trial at all, as appears to be happening in this case. Last year, the police commissioner followed through on the CCRB's discipline recommendations in serious cases just 27% of the time .\n\nI sent the NYPD a series of questions, asking both about its power to ignore the CCRB and about how that power has been wielded in this case. I got a one-sentence response : \"The disciplinary process is ongoing.\"\n\nWe do know something about what's happened to the officers, and about their records. Thanks to legislation that New York state passed in the summer of 2020, police records are no longer secret. The CCRB's report names the officers involved.\n\nOfficer Christopher Brower drove into the boy, according to the report. Officer Christopher Digioia wore the Punisher sweatshirt and is the one officer still facing a disciplinary trial, for allegedly swearing at the teens. A search of their respective CCRB files shows they were also disciplined for another case together. Investigators found that, in April 2019, about six months before the Halloween incident, the two had refused to provide their names or badge numbers to a civilian. The NYPD penalized them for that with \"instructions.\"\n\nThe precinct commander who the CCRB concluded oversaw the wrongful arrests is Inspector Megan O'Malley. She told investigators she believed the arrests were justified because the boys ran and one had dropped a kitchen knife. O'Malley has since been promoted and now heads a precinct in midtown Manhattan.\n\nThe officer who, the report said, first ordered the boys to be stopped and then pointed a gun at one of them is Lt. John Dasaro. He told investigators he had been worried that the boy was armed. Dasaro was moved to work at the internal affairs unit that investigates use of force against civilians.\n\nNone of the officers responded to my requests for comment.\n\nI recently shared all the developments with one of the boys from that night.

      "text": "A Police Car Hit a Kid on Halloween 2019. The NYPD Is Quashing a Move to Punish the Officer.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nIt was a little more than two years ago that I really started learning about the reality of police oversight in America.\n\nOn Halloween night in 2019, my wife and our then-6-year-old daughter were walking home from trick-or-treating in our Brooklyn neighborhood when they saw a New York Police Department car go the wrong way down a street and smack into a teenager, who fell and then ran away.\n\nWhen I contacted the NYPD afterward, they told me that what my family saw hadn't happened. A police car hadn't hit a teenager. The teenager had hit the car. Or, as an NYPD statement put it , he \"ran across the hood of a stationary police car.\"\n\nI ended up diving into the case and wrote about it the next summer during the global racial justice protests spawned by George Floyd's murder.\n\nRead More\n\nThe police had been looking for a group of Black, male teenagers who reportedly had stolen a cellphone. After the teenager who'd been hit by the car ran away, my wife, Sara, watched as officers turned their attention to other Black boys.\n\nThe police lined the boys up against the wall of our local movie theater, then arrested three of them. The boys insisted they had just been trick-or-treating. The youngest was 12. He was crying, asking repeatedly, \"What did I do?\"\n\nI didn't hear anything more about the case for a long while. Then, a few weeks ago, the city agency charged with investigating civilians' complaints of police abuse let me know it had finally finished its investigation.\n\nThe Civilian Complaint Review Board found that, contrary to the NYPD's assertions, an officer did hit a kid with his car. It also found that officers, including the precinct commander, had arrested the boys without justification. An officer had even drawn his gun and pointed it at one of the boys.\n\nOne of the officers, the report noted, was wearing a sweatshirt with a logo of the Punisher , a Marvel character who kills lawbreakers, which is popular with cops and white nationalists. The sweatshirt also had a blue line over the American flag and the acronym DILLIGAF. (\"Do I Look Like I Give a Fuck.\") The officer told investigators he hadn't known the meaning of the logo or the acronym on his sweatshirt.\n\nThe police response that night started when some teenagers told officers they had been robbed at the local park. But the officers only had what investigators later described as \" varying and inconsistent descriptions \" of who they were looking for.\n\nThe officers stopped a group of boys a few blocks away. There was little about them that matched the description of the assailants other than that they were Black, young and walking together. Indeed, the CCRB's report noted, one of the officers \" stated that he was not certain whether they were involved .\"\n\nSome of the boys ran, including the one who was hit by the police car. (They told investigators that they ran because they were scared.)\n\nThe boys who were arrested - a 15-year-old, a 14-year-old and the 12-year-old - said that the officers never offered any explanation for why they were stopped. They were released without charges, after being held for hours. Their parents said they weren't given any documentation on the arrests. The mother of one of the boys worked for the NYPD as a school safety officer, but even she couldn't get any record of what happened.\n\nIt was as if the case was being pushed into a fog.\n\nThe CCRB began investigating after receiving a witness complaint. But the agency's investigations are dependent on the NYPD cooperating. And as often happens, the NYPD has been slow to do so .\n\nTake body-worn cameras, which are often critical in abuse investigations. The CCRB noted it faced \" extremely substantial delays \" in getting the Halloween night footage from the NYPD. While some cities have given civilian investigators direct access to body cam footage, the NYPD has rejected calls to do the same.\n\nThe agency also did not get to interview officers until more than a year after the incident. By the time officers did finally submit to interviews, they had serious trouble with their recollections. When the officer who drove the car was asked whether he had hit a kid, he \" stated that he could not remember .\"\n\nIn December, the CCRB told me it had just filed disciplinary charges against the officers: for wrongful arrests, for pulling a gun without justification, and for, as the bureaucratic lingo puts it, \" Force, Vehicle .\"\n\nThe next step would typically be disciplinary hearings, in which the CCRB acts as the prosecutor and the proceedings are overseen by an NYPD judge, who answers ultimately to the police commissioner. While the penalties after guilty verdicts are often wrist-slappy, like lost vacation days , it seemed like this case could be a rare, if modest, victory for police accountability.\n\nThen, about a week after I heard about the outcome of the investigation, I learned of another twist.\n\nThe NYPD had informed the CCRB that it was invoking its authority to unilaterally end the cases against most of the officers the civilian agency had charged with misconduct. No disciplinary charges would be brought against them.\n\nInstead of letting the CCRB's disciplinary process play out, the NYPD said it would handle the cases internally. The NYPD wrote, as it has many times before, that allowing the CCRB case to continue \"would be detrimental to the Police Department's disciplinary process.\"\n\nWhen it came to the officer who had hit the kid with his car, the NYPD said it was an \"alleged traffic accident\" and that therefore the CCRB had no authority to investigate in the first place.\n\nThe NYPD did decide that the disciplinary charges against one officer could continue - for using offensive language and telling one of the teens to stop filming on his phone.\n\nIt was all remarkable, but also par for the course.\n\nLike many police departments around the country, the NYPD has complete discretion to overrule the civilian agency that is supposed to help oversee it.\n\nIn New York City, the police commissioner can and often does choose to ignore the results of CCRB-brought disciplinary trials. The commissioner can ignore guilty pleas and can even decide there should be no trial at all, as appears to be happening in this case. Last year, the police commissioner followed through on the CCRB's discipline recommendations in serious cases just 27% of the time .\n\nI sent the NYPD a series of questions, asking both about its power to ignore the CCRB and about how that power has been wielded in this case. I got a one-sentence response : \"The disciplinary process is ongoing.\"\n\nWe do know something about what's happened to the officers, and about their records. Thanks to legislation that New York state passed in the summer of 2020, police records are no longer secret. The CCRB's report names the officers involved.\n\nOfficer Christopher Brower drove into the boy, according to the report. Officer Christopher Digioia wore the Punisher sweatshirt and is the one officer still facing a disciplinary trial, for allegedly swearing at the teens. A search of their respective CCRB files shows they were also disciplined for another case together. Investigators found that, in April 2019, about six months before the Halloween incident, the two had refused to provide their names or badge numbers to a civilian. The NYPD penalized them for that with \"instructions.\"\n\nThe precinct commander who the CCRB concluded oversaw the wrongful arrests is Inspector Megan O'Malley. She told investigators she believed the arrests were justified because the boys ran and one had dropped a kitchen knife. O'Malley has since been promoted and now heads a precinct in midtown Manhattan.\n\nThe officer who, the report said, first ordered the boys to be stopped and then pointed a gun at one of them is Lt. John Dasaro. He told investigators he had been worried that the boy was armed. Dasaro was moved to work at the internal affairs unit that investigates use of force against civilians.\n\nNone of the officers responded to my requests for comment.\n\nI recently shared all the developments with one of the boys from that night. He was in ninth grade when officers ordered him up against the wall. His mom and 9-year-old sister watched from across the street, where they had been trick-or-treating.\n\n\"It's just all getting blown over,\" he said, sounding deflated. \"So, it's kind of like, what's the point of doing all this?\"\n\nBut the Halloween case isn't fully over yet.\n\nAfter the NYPD said it would be overriding the CCRB cases, the agency formally objected. The NYPD has yet to give its response.\n\nTechnically, the CCRB can move ahead if the NYPD doesn't respond.

      "text": "New Louisiana Law Serves as a Warning to Bystanders Who Film Police: Stay Away or Face Arrest\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nThis article was produced for ProPublica's Local Reporting Network in partnership with Verite News . Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.\n\nFour years before a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd, prompting nationwide demonstrations, hundreds of people marched in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to protest officers' killing of Alton Sterling in front of a convenience store. Law enforcement responded in force: Officers armed with rifles, body armor and gas masks pushed protesters back and forcibly arrested about 200 people. Some were injured.\n\nA group of 13 protesters and two journalists filed suit, alleging their constitutional rights were violated when they were arrested. Eventually, the city agreed to pay them $1.17 million. Photographs and videos taken by protesters, witnesses and journalists were critical in contradicting officers' claims that protesters were the aggressors, said William Most, an attorney for the plaintiffs.\n\nOn Thursday, a Louisiana law will go into effect that will make it a misdemeanor for anyone, including journalists, to be within 25 feet of a law enforcement officer if the officer orders them back. The two independent journalists who sued, whose photos were used to support allegations against the police, said they wouldn't have been able to capture those images if the law had been on the books during the protests.\n\nKaren Savage was working for a news site focused on juvenile justice issues on the second day of the demonstrations in July 2016 when she photographed officers putting a Black man in a chokehold as they detained him. Cherri Foytlin, who was working for a small newspaper and a community media project, said she was within 4 feet when she photographed officers violently dragging a Black man off private property and arresting him.\n\nFoytlin and Savage said they are hesitant to cover protests in Louisiana now that they could face criminal charges if they're too close to an officer. \"I was thinking about how far exactly 25 feet is, and, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. It's going to be whatever the officer wants it to be,\" Savage said. \"And if it doesn't get to court, it won't matter because they will have accomplished what they wanted, which was to get the cameras away.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, a coalition of media companies representing a couple dozen Louisiana news outlets, including Verite News, filed suit against Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, State Police Superintendent Robert Hodges and East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore III, alleging the law violates the First Amendment .\n\nIn a statement provided Thursday, Murrill said the law ensures law enforcement officers can do their jobs without being threatened or impeded by others. She said she looks forward to \"defending this reasonable response to documented interference with law enforcement.\" State Police spokesperson Capt. Nick Manale declined to comment on the suit; a representative for Moore did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPolice buffer laws, as they are commonly known, are relatively new; Louisiana is the fourth state to enact one. Although those states already prohibit interfering with police officers, supporters say buffer laws are necessary to protect police from distrustful, aggressive bystanders. And with advances in cellphone cameras, including zoom lenses, supporters say there's no need to get close to officers in order to record their activities.\n\n\"There's really nothing within a 25-feet span that someone couldn't pick up on video,\" Rep. Bryan Fontenot, R-Thibodaux, the sponsor of Louisiana's bill and a former law enforcement officer, said during a legislative hearing this year. At the same time, he said, \"that person can't spit in my face when I'm making an arrest.\" (He did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nFoytlin disagreed. \"You can't even get an officer's badge number at 25 feet. So there's no way to hold anyone accountable.\"\n\nShe and Savage said police targeted them during the Baton Rouge protests because they were taking photos of protesters being slammed to the ground, dragged across the pavement, choked and zip-tied by law enforcement officers. Both journalists were charged with obstructing public rights of way and resisting arrest. Prosecutors did not pursue those charges.\n\nThe journalists and protesters sued the city of Baton Rouge, the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office and the Louisiana State Police, claiming law enforcement officers had used excessive force when arresting them. The Sheriff's Office was dismissed as a defendant because a judge concluded its deputies weren't involved with those arrests. The State Police settled for an undisclosed amount in 2021. The suit against Baton Rouge went to trial in 2023; the city agreed to the million-dollar settlement the day before closing arguments.\n\nNeither the Sheriff's Office nor the Baton Rouge Police Department responded to requests for comment. The Louisiana State Police declined to comment on the lawsuit or protests.\n\nFoytlin said she didn't think the settlement would cause law enforcement agencies to change their tactics; now, she believes they'll be emboldened by the buffer law to crack down more harshly on anyone trying to document officers' actions.\n\n\"From what I saw in Baton Rouge, and what they were able to get away with, I have no doubt that in the future, the consequences of trying to use your free speech or to protest are going to be much harsher,\" she said.\n\nGiven the inconsistent use of police body-worn cameras, said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, often the only way people can guard against false charges and prove that officers used excessive force is to film them in close proximity. \"In the absence of video or audio evidence,\" she said, \"it's very difficult to convince anyone that the story occurred in any way different other than what the police report.\"\n\nSuch video was critical in a lawsuit Ahmed handled in which a woman sued two sheriff's deputies over her arrest in St. Tammany Parish, across Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans.\n\nThe May 2020 incident started with an anonymous complaint about someone riding a motorcycle without a helmet in a Slidell neighborhood, according to the lawsuit. Deputies Ryan Moring and Kyle Hart showed up at Teliah Perkins' home, writing in an incident report that they saw Perkins ride a motorcycle without a helmet. In Perkins' lawsuit, she denied doing so.\n\nThe conversation quickly became heated. Perkins accused the deputies of harassing her because she is Black; the deputies wrote in the incident report that she was \"irate\" and verbally attacked them .\n\nPerkins called for her son De'Shaun Johnson, then 14, and her nephew, then 15, to come outside and record what was happening, according to the deputies' incident report and the videos. When they did, at least one of the deputies ordered them to go back on the porch, which was more than 25 feet away.\n\nThe boys ignored the deputies and continued to film from about 6 feet away. As Hart forced Perkins to the ground, Moring approached Johnson, shoving him and telling him to move back, according to Perkins' lawsuit and her son's video. When Perkins screamed that she was being choked, Moring stood in front of Johnson to block his view, he later admitted in his deposition. Moring then pointed his Taser at the boy.\n\n\"You can't tase a child,\" Johnson said, according to the lawsuit and the son's video.\n\n\"Watch me,\" Moring responded.\n\nPerkins was arrested for resisting a police officer with force or violence, battery of a police officer, having no proof of insurance and failing to wear a helmet. She was found guilty only on the resisting charge; the others were dropped. She sued the deputies in federal court, claiming they had violated her and her son's rights. An appeals court dismissed Perkins' claims against the deputies, but her son's claim against Moring went to trial. In May, a jury found that Moring had intentionally inflicted emotional distress on Johnson and awarded him $185,000, to be paid by the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office.\n\nAhmed said she believes the jury was swayed by videos of the incident, which showed \"with clear granularity exactly what was transpiring.\"\n\nMoring denied in court that he intentionally harmed Johnson and has filed a notice of appeal. The deputies' lawyer didn't comment for this story.\n\nIn an interview with Verite News and ProPublica, Perkins said she fears what could have happened had the new law been in effect. The boys could have been arrested when they refused to move back to the porch. And from there, she said, neither would have been able to see or hear what was happening to her.\n\nJohnson, who is about to start his first year at Alabama State University, said the videos he and his cousin took that day are the only evidence of what actually happened. Without them, he said, no one would have believed a 14-year-old boy's claim that a deputy had threatened to shock him with a Taser simply because he was recording with a cellphone.\n\nThere were no police buffer laws when Floyd was murdered on a Minneapolis street in 2020. Seventeen-year-old Darnella Frazier stood several feet away and recorded a video that showed Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressing his knee into Floyd's neck and back for more than nine minutes, causing Floyd to lose consciousness and die. The video was critical in securing Chauvin's conviction for second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He was sentenced to more than 22 years in prison.\n\nFloyd's murder fueled protests across the country and efforts to rein in the police. New York City ended qualified immunity , a legal defense used to shield officers from civil liability. Many states restricted the types of force officers can use, according to the Brennan Center for Justice .\n\nThe video of Chauvin \"really drew people's attention to how powerful these recordings can be in inspiring protests and legislative action,\" said Grayson Clary, a staff attorney at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. \"I think some legislators are now trying to claw back ground that they feel they lost.\"\n\nArizona state Sen. John Kavanagh, a Republican from outside Phoenix who authored the first of these bills in 2022, wrote in an op-ed that police officers asked him to introduce it because \"there are groups hostile to the police that follow them around to videotape police incidents, and they get dangerously close to potentially violent encounters.\"\n\nKavanagh's bill, which was signed into law by then-Gov. Doug Ducey, prohibited people from filming police within 8 feet. But federal courts across the country have affirmed the right to film the police, and a federal judge struck down the law after a coalition of media outlets and associations sued the state.\n\nIndiana was the next state to pass a similar law. It, like the two others enacted since, doesn't mention filming and requires people to stay at least 25 feet from police. That's based on a controversial theory, often cited to justify police shootings, that someone armed with a knife can cover 21 feet running toward an officer before the officer can fire their weapon.\n\nShortly after the law was enacted in April 2023, an independent journalist sued the city of South Bend after an officer pushed him 25 feet from a crime scene and another officer ordered him to move back another 25 feet. The journalist claimed in the lawsuit that it was impossible to observe the crime scene from that distance. The state denied in court that the journalist's rights were violated.\n\nIn January, a federal judge dismissed the journalist's suit, stating that officers have a right to perform their jobs \"unimpeded.\" The judge said 25 feet is a \"modest distance ... particularly in this day and age of sophisticated technology\" and that \"any effect on speech is minimal and incidental.\" That case is under appeal.\n\nA second lawsuit in Indiana, filed in December by a group of news organizations and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, is pending. They are suing the state attorney general and the prosecutor and sheriff of Marion County, where Indianapolis is located, arguing that it is \"essential for reporters to be within 25 feet of law enforcement in order to record them.\" In a court filing, the defendants have argued that the law doesn't infringe on reporters' ability to record police activities.\n\nFlorida's law went into effect in April. An early version of that bill specified that it did not apply to the act of peacefully recording, photographing or witnessing a first responder, which it called a \"legitimate purpose.\" That language was taken out of the bill before it was passed.\n\nRep. Angela Nixon, D-Jacksonville, proposed changing the bill's name to \" The I Don't Want the World to See the Police Kill an Unarmed Innocent Man Like George Floyd Again, So I Want To Protect Bad Cops and Violate Free Speech Act.\" Her amendment failed.\n\nIf these laws stand up to constitutional challenges, \"we're going to see more states go down this road,\" said Clary of the Reporters Committee.\n\nThe effect of Louisiana's law may be limited in New Orleans, where the police department has been under federal oversight since 2013 due to widespread abuses , including excessive use of force and racial discrimination. New Orleans Independent Police Monitor Stella Cziment said the law may violate a court-approved list of reforms, which states that police must allow people to \"witness, observe, record, and/or comment\" on officers' actions, including arrests and uses of force. Another provision says officers cannot arrest anyone for being nearby or recording them except under certain conditions, including risks to the safety of officers or others.\n\nIn response to questions from Verite News and ProPublica, the New Orleans Police Department said it is revising its policies to account for the new law, and those policies could \"restrict officers' actions\" more than the law does. The NOPD said the Department of Justice and a team of court-appointed monitors will review any changes; neither responded to requests for comment.\n\nRead More\n\nHowever, the Louisiana State Police, which recently sent a contingent of troopers to New Orleans under a directive from Gov. Jeff Landry, does not have to abide by the terms of the consent decree , according to a federal judge. As such, troopers are free to invoke the new law.\n\nThe State Police is being investigated by the Department of Justice following a 2021 Associated Press investigation that uncovered more than a dozen incidents over the past 10 years in which troopers beat Black men and sought to cover up their actions . The State Police didn't respond to a request for comment on those incidents.\n\nWhen asked how troopers are being trained to use the new law, Manale said only that they undergo regular training on how to engage with the public. The State Police, Manale said, \"strives to ensure a safe environment for the public and our public safety professionals during all interactions.\"\n\nDrew Costley of Verite News contributed reporting.\n\nUpdate, Aug. 1, 2024: This story was updated to include a comment from Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill about the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Louisiana's buffer law.\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "New Louisiana Law Serves as a Warning to Bystanders Who Film Police: Stay Away or Face Arrest\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nThis article was produced for ProPublica's Local Reporting Network in partnership with Verite News . Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.\n\nFour years before a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd, prompting nationwide demonstrations, hundreds of people marched in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to protest officers' killing of Alton Sterling in front of a convenience store. Law enforcement responded in force: Officers armed with rifles, body armor and gas masks pushed protesters back and forcibly arrested about 200 people. Some were injured.\n\nA group of 13 protesters and two journalists filed suit, alleging their constitutional rights were violated when they were arrested. Eventually, the city agreed to pay them $1.17 million. Photographs and videos taken by protesters, witnesses and journalists were critical in contradicting officers' claims that protesters were the aggressors, said William Most, an attorney for the plaintiffs.\n\nOn Thursday, a Louisiana law will go into effect that will make it a misdemeanor for anyone, including journalists, to be within 25 feet of a law enforcement officer if the officer orders them back. The two independent journalists who sued, whose photos were used to support allegations against the police, said they wouldn't have been able to capture those images if the law had been on the books during the protests.\n\nKaren Savage was working for a news site focused on juvenile justice issues on the second day of the demonstrations in July 2016 when she photographed officers putting a Black man in a chokehold as they detained him. Cherri Foytlin, who was working for a small newspaper and a community media project, said she was within 4 feet when she photographed officers violently dragging a Black man off private property and arresting him.\n\nFoytlin and Savage said they are hesitant to cover protests in Louisiana now that they could face criminal charges if they're too close to an officer. \"I was thinking about how far exactly 25 feet is, and, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. It's going to be whatever the officer wants it to be,\" Savage said. \"And if it doesn't get to court, it won't matter because they will have accomplished what they wanted, which was to get the cameras away.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, a coalition of media companies representing a couple dozen Louisiana news outlets, including Verite News, filed suit against Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, State Police Superintendent Robert Hodges and East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore III, alleging the law violates the First Amendment .\n\nIn a statement provided Thursday, Murrill said the law ensures law enforcement officers can do their jobs without being threatened or impeded by others. She said she looks forward to \"defending this reasonable response to documented interference with law enforcement.\" State Police spokesperson Capt. Nick Manale declined to comment on the suit; a representative for Moore did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPolice buffer laws, as they are commonly known, are relatively new; Louisiana is the fourth state to enact one. Although those states already prohibit interfering with police officers, supporters say buffer laws are necessary to protect police from distrustful, aggressive bystanders. And with advances in cellphone cameras, including zoom lenses, supporters say there's no need to get close to officers in order to record their activities.\n\n\"There's really nothing within a 25-feet span that someone couldn't pick up on video,\" Rep. Bryan Fontenot, R-Thibodaux, the sponsor of Louisiana's bill and a former law enforcement officer, said during a legislative hearing this year. At the same time, he said, \"that person can't spit in my face when I'm making an arrest.\" (He did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nFoytlin disagreed. \"You can't even get an officer's badge number at 25 feet. So there's no way to hold anyone accountable.\"\n\nShe and Savage said police targeted them during the Baton Rouge protests because they were taking photos of protesters being slammed to the ground, dragged across the pavement, choked and zip-tied by law enforcement officers. Both journalists were charged with obstructing public rights of way and resisting arrest. Prosecutors did not pursue those charges.\n\nThe journalists and protesters sued the city of Baton Rouge, the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office and the Louisiana State Police, claiming law enforcement officers had used excessive force when arresting them. The Sheriff's Office was dismissed as a defendant because a judge concluded its deputies weren't involved with those arrests. The State Police settled for an undisclosed amount in 2021. The suit against Baton Rouge went to trial in 2023; the city agreed to the million-dollar settlement the day before closing arguments.\n\nNeither the Sheriff's Office nor the Baton Rouge Police Department responded to requests for comment. The Louisiana State Police declined to comment on the lawsuit or protests.\n\nFoytlin said she didn't think the settlement would cause law enforcement agencies to change their tactics; now, she believes they'll be emboldened by the buffer law to crack down more harshly on anyone trying to document officers' actions.\n\n\"From what I saw in Baton Rouge, and what they were able to get away with, I have no doubt that in the future, the consequences of trying to use your free speech or to protest are going to be much harsher,\" she said.\n\nGiven the inconsistent use of police body-worn cameras, said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, often the only way people can guard against false charges and prove that officers used excessive force is to film them in close proximity. \"In the absence of video or audio evidence,\" she said, \"it's very difficult to convince anyone that the story occurred in any way different other than what the police report.\"\n\nSuch video was critical in a lawsuit Ahmed handled in which a woman sued two sheriff's deputies over her arrest in St. Tammany Parish, across Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans.\n\nThe May 2020 incident started with an anonymous complaint about someone riding a motorcycle without a helmet in a Slidell neighborhood, according to the lawsuit. Deputies Ryan Moring and Kyle Hart showed up at Teliah Perkins' home, writing in an incident report that they saw Perkins ride a motorcycle without a helmet. In Perkins' lawsuit, she denied doing so.\n\nThe conversation quickly became heated. Perkins accused the deputies of harassing her because she is Black; the deputies wrote in the incident report that she was \"irate\" and verbally attacked them .\n\nPerkins called for her son De'Shaun Johnson, then 14, and her nephew, then 15, to come outside and record what was happening, according to the deputies' incident report and the videos. When they did, at least one of the deputies ordered them to go back on the porch, which was more than 25 feet away.\n\nThe boys ignored the deputies and continued to film from about 6 feet away. As Hart forced Perkins to the ground, Moring approached Johnson, shoving him and telling him to move back, according to Perkins' lawsuit and her son's video. When Perkins screamed that she was being choked, Moring stood in front of Johnson to block his view, he later admitted in his deposition. Moring then pointed his Taser at the boy.\n\n\"You can't tase a child,\" Johnson said, according to the lawsuit and the son's video.\n\n\"Watch me,\" Moring responded.\n\nPerkins was arrested for resisting a police officer with force or violence, battery of a police officer, having no proof of insurance and failing to wear a helmet. She was found guilty only on the resisting charge; the others were dropped. She sued the deputies in federal court, claiming they had violated her and her son's rights. An appeals court dismissed Perkins' claims against the deputies, but her son's claim against Moring went to trial. In May, a jury found that Moring had intentionally inflicted emotional distress on Johnson and awarded him $185,000, to be paid by the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office.\n\nAhmed said she believes the jury was swayed by videos of the incident, which showed \"with clear granularity exactly what was transpiring.\"\n\nMoring denied in court that he intentionally harmed Johnson and has filed a notice of appeal. The deputies' lawyer didn't comment for this story.\n\nIn an interview with Verite News and ProPublica, Perkins said she fears what could have happened had the new law been in effect. The boys could have been arrested when they refused to move back to the porch. And from there, she said, neither would have been able to see or hear what was happening to her.\n\nJohnson, who is about to start his first year at Alabama State University, said the videos he and his cousin took that day are the only evidence of what actually happened. Without them, he said, no one would have believed a 14-year-old boy's claim that a deputy had threatened to shock him with a Taser simply because he was recording with a cellphone.\n\nThere were no police buffer laws when Floyd was murdered on a Minneapolis street in 2020. Seventeen-year-old Darnella Frazier stood several feet away and recorded a video that showed Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressing his knee into Floyd's neck and back for more than nine minutes, causing Floyd to lose consciousness and die. The video was critical in securing Chauvin's conviction for second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He was sentenced to more than 22 years in prison.\n\nFloyd's murder fueled protests across the country and efforts to rein in the police. New York City ended qualified immunity , a legal defense used to shield officers from civil liability. Many states restricted the types of force officers can use, according to the Brennan Center for Justice .\n\nThe video of Chauvin \"really drew people's attention to how powerful these recordings can be in inspiring protests and legislative action,\" said Grayson Clary, a staff attorney at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. \"I think some legislators are now trying to claw back ground that they feel they lost.\"\n\nArizona state Sen. John Kavanagh, a Republican from outside Phoenix who authored the first of these bills in 2022, wrote in an op-ed that police officers asked him to introduce it because \"there are groups hostile to the police that follow them around to videotape police incidents, and they get dangerously close to potentially violent encounters.\"\n\nKavanagh's bill, which was signed into law by then-Gov. Doug Ducey, prohibited people from filming police within 8 feet. But federal courts across the country have affirmed the right to film the police, and a federal judge struck down the law after a coalition of media outlets and associations sued the state.\n\nIndiana was the next state to pass a similar law. It, like the two others enacted since, doesn't mention filming and requires people to stay at least 25 feet from police. That's based on a controversial theory, often cited to justify police shootings, that someone armed with a knife can cover 21 feet running toward an officer before the officer can fire their weapon.\n\nShortly after the law was enacted in April 2023, an independent journalist sued the city of South Bend after an officer pushed him 25 feet from a crime scene and another officer ordered him to move back another 25 feet. The journalist claimed in the lawsuit that it was impossible to observe the crime scene from that distance. The state denied in court that the journalist's rights were violated.\n\nIn January, a federal judge dismissed the journalist's suit, stating that officers have a right to perform their jobs \"unimpeded.\" The judge said 25 feet is a \"modest distance ... particularly in this day and age of sophisticated technology\" and that \"any effect on speech is minimal and incidental.\" That case is under appeal.\n\nA second lawsuit in Indiana, filed in December by a group of news organizations and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, is pending. They are suing the state attorney general and the prosecutor and sheriff of Marion County, where Indianapolis is located, arguing that it is \"essential for reporters to be within 25 feet of law enforcement in order to record them.\" In a court filing, the defendants have argued that the law doesn't infringe on reporters' ability to record police activities.\n\nFlorida's law went into effect in April.

      "text": "Looking Up an NYPD Officer's Discipline Record? Many Are There One Day, Gone the Next.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nIn the summer of 2021, New York Police Department officer Willie Thompson had sex at least twice with a witness to a Harlem carjacking that he was investigating. When a prosecutor questioned Thompson about his relationship with the witness, Thompson first lied, denying the relationship, before recanting and confessing the next day, according to an internal discipline report . About a week later, the woman, sounding upset, called the prosecutor and said Thompson had cornered her at a bodega, blaming her for getting him in trouble and threatening that officers from the precinct would be coming to her home, the document shows.\n\nThompson, who declined to comment, was found guilty by the NYPD on two misconduct charges and was placed on probation.\n\nBut if you looked up his disciplinary history on the department's public database of uniformed officers , you would be unlikely to learn that.\n\nProPublica has found the NYPD site for allowing the public to track officers' misconduct is shockingly unreliable. Cases against officers frequently vanish from the site for days - sometimes weeks - at a time. The issue affects nearly all of the officers in the database, with discipline disappearing from the profiles of patrol officers all the way up to its most senior uniformed officer.\n\nProPublica examined more than 1,000 daily snapshots of the database's contents and found that, since the fall of 2022, the number of discipline cases that appear in the database has fluctuated often and wildly. Try to pull up the record for a disciplined officer and the site sometimes spits back, \"This officer does not have any applicable entries.\"\n\nSince May 2021, at least 88% of the disciplinary cases that once appeared in the data have gone missing at some point, though some were later restored. As of this week, 54% of cases that had at one point been in the system were missing.\n\n\"It is really disconcerting to see that there are records that are there one day that are not the next,\" said Jennvine Wong, a supervising attorney with the Legal Aid Society's Cop Accountability Project .\n\nIn the NYPD's Officer Database, Discipline Records Frequently Vanish\n\nA ProPublica analysis of more than 1,000 daily snapshots of the NYPD's Office Profile database found that, since fall 2022, cases have repeatedly disappeared and the number of publicly accessible cases fluctuates often and wildly.\n\nThe NYPD did not respond to repeated requests for interviews or comment.\n\nBecause the department's database is designed to show discipline only for active officers, some cases relating to former officers might have been removed from the data over time. Yet that would only explain a fraction of the missing cases. For most of the past year, at least a third of cases that had previously appeared in the database were missing.\n\nThese missing cases have included Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey, the force's highest-ranking uniformed officer, and six deputy chiefs whose assignments include the department's transit bureau and the Joint Terrorism Task Force.\n\nThe allegations against these high-ranking officers include being \"discourteous\" to a suspect, drinking while on duty, improper use of department property, and wrongful searches, frisks and uses of force.\n\nIn the chief of department's case, Maddrey was docked 45 vacation days over a 2015 incident in which he impeded internal affairs officials who were investigating an altercation with an ex-lover and fellow officer. The incident ended with the officer brandishing a gun at Maddrey. When a reporter looked up Maddrey's discipline record on Wednesday, the department's system reported no disciplinary cases against him.\n\nIn interviews, several advocates for police reform and accountability said the issues raised by ProPublica's analysis renewed their concerns about the NYPD's competence, legal compliance and accountability.\n\n\"It just continues to undermine the public confidence in that they care at all about discipline and police accountability,\" said Lupe Aguirre, a senior staff attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union. \"Their track record shows that they are both unwilling and unable to hold their officers accountable.\"\n\nWhile people across the country rallied against police brutality in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis officers in 2020, reform advocates in New York scored a major victory. Capitalizing on the groundswell of public demand for accountability, they pushed lawmakers to repeal a state statute that, for more than four decades, prohibited the release of personnel information about police officers.\n\nRead More\n\nEarly the next year, the NYPD published a searchable database of its uniformed officers, allowing the public to look up cops and see their training histories, departmental awards and, for the first time, internal discipline records. In a department-wide memo, agency brass reportedly touted the move as a \"step that increases transparency and improves accountability.\"\n\nDespite a 2012 local law that requires agencies to publish their data on the city's open-data platform, the police department chose a vendor best known for selling \"athlete management\" software for sports teams to run the officer lookup system.\n\nThe source code of the officer profile website reveals it runs on software from RockDaisy , a New York-based software company. A blog post on its site , first published in 2017 and updated last year, says it has been licensed to several teams in the NFL, NHL and NBA and \"the world's largest police department,\" an apparent reference to the NYPD.\n\nRockDaisy's founders did not respond to ProPublica's inquiries about the company's relationship with the police department. While RockDaisy does appear in a database of qualified vendors, a spokesperson for the city comptroller, which audits agency spending and reviews city contracts, said her office could not find any contracts with or payments to the company.\n\nAguirre and Wong, the Legal Aid Society attorney, cited the department's habit of resisting oversight to argue that disclosure of officer misconduct data should not be entrusted to the department itself.\n\n\"It all should be up on [NYC] Open Data,\" Wong said, referring to the citywide portal that publishes data from various agencies, including the NYPD, on everything from 311 calls and filming permits to a census of the city's trees .\n\nA schedule of upcoming releases shows that the NYPD's officer profile data was supposed to be added to Open Data by the end of last year, but that still has not happened.\n\nA spokesperson for the city's chief technology officer, whose agency operates the Open Data platform, did not respond to ProPublica's request for comment.\n\nAdrienne Schmoeker, who led the city's Open Data program from 2016 to 2019 and served as New York City's deputy chief analytics officer under former Mayor Bill de Blasio, said it was not unusual for data releases to fall behind schedule. But failing to publish quality data reliably, she said, risks losing the public's trust, especially when New Yorkers assume the worst: that agencies are hiding unflattering information.\n\n\"That's extremely problematic, even if it's wrong,\" Schmoeker said, \"because it erodes the trust that is essential between New Yorkers and their government.\"\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica?

The next step would be a disciplinary trial overseen by the New York Police Department, during which prosecutors from the oversight agency would present evidence and question the officer in a public forum.\n\nThen last fall, the police commissioner intervened.\n\nExercising a little-known authority called \"retention,\" the commissioner, Edward Caban, ensured the case would never go to trial.\n\nInstead, Caban reached his own conclusion in private.\n\nHe decided that it \"would be detrimental to the Police Department's disciplinary process\" to pursue administrative charges against the officer, Gerard Dowling, according to a letter the department sent to the oversight agency. The force that the officer used against Villafane was \"reasonable and necessary.\" The commissioner ordered no discipline.\n\nToday, Dowling is a deputy chief of the unit that handles protests throughout the city.\n\nVideo Taken by a Civilian Shows NYPD Officer Gerard Dowling Grabbing Brianna Villafane's Hair During a Protest\n\nHis case is one of dozens in which Caban has used the powers of his office to intervene in disciplinary cases against officers who were found by the oversight agency to have committed misconduct.\n\nSince becoming commissioner last July, he has short-circuited cases involving officers accused of wantonly using chokeholds, deploying Tasers and beating protesters with batons. A number of episodes were so serious that the police oversight agency, known as the Civilian Complaint Review Board, concluded the officers likely committed crimes.\n\nAs is typical across the United States, New York's police commissioner has the final say over officer discipline. Commissioners can and often do overrule civilian oversight boards. But Caban's actions stand out for ending cases before the public disciplinary process plays out.\n\n\"What the Police Department is doing here is shutting down cases under the cloak of darkness,\" said Florence L. Finkle, a former head of the CCRB and current vice president of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement. Avoiding disciplinary trials \"means there's no opportunity for transparency, no opportunity for the public to weigh in, because nobody knows what's happening.\"\n\nIndeed, the department does not publish the commissioner's decisions to retain cases, and the civilian oversight agency makes those details public only months after the fact. Civilians are not told that the Police Department ended their cases.\n\nTo piece together Caban's actions, ProPublica obtained internal records of some cases and learned details of others using public records, lawsuits, social media accounts and other sources.\n\nRetention has been the commissioner's chief method of intervention. He has prevented the cases of 54 officers from going to trial in his roughly one year in office - far more than any other commissioner, according to an analysis of CCRB data. His predecessor, Keechant Sewell, did it eight times in her first year, even as she faced more disciplinary cases.\n\nIn addition, under Caban, the Police Department has failed to notify officers that the oversight agency has filed charges against them - a seemingly minor administrative matter that can actually hold up the disciplinary process. The rules say that without this formal step, a departmental trial cannot begin. Seven cases have been sitting with the department since last summer because it has never formally notified the officers involved, according to the CCRB.\n\nThese cases are particularly opaque, as there is no publicly available list of them.\n\nIn one episode, the CCRB found that an officer had shocked an unarmed man with a Taser four times while he was trying to back away.\n\n\"He Tased me for no reason,\" recalled William Harvin Sr. \"He was coming to me, Tasing my legs, my back.\"\n\nThe review board found that the officer, Raul Torres, should face trial. But the Police Department has yet to move the case forward, a fact Harvin learned from a reporter. \"They take care of their own,\" he said, shaking his head. (Torres, who has since been promoted to detective, declined to comment and his lawyer said the officer had \"no choice\" but to use force.)\n\nVideo Shows an NYPD Officer Shocking William Harvin Sr. Four Times With a Taser\n\nIn more than 30 other instances, Caban upended cases in which department lawyers and the officers themselves had already agreed to disciplinary action - the most times a commissioner has done so in at least a decade. Sewell set aside four plea deals during her first year as commissioner.\n\nFor one officer, Caban rejected two plea deals: In the first case, the officer pleaded guilty to wrongly pepper-spraying protesters and agreed to losing 40 vacation days as punishment. Caban overturned the deal and reduced the penalty to 10 days. In the second, the officer pleaded guilty to using a baton against Black Lives Matter protesters \"without police necessity.\" Caban threw out the agreement, which called for 15 vacation days to be forfeited. His office wrote that it wasn't clear that the officer had actually hit the protesters, contrary to what the officer himself already admitted to in the plea. The commissioner ordered no discipline.\n\nThe under-the-radar moves run counter to Mayor Eric Adams' pledge during his candidacy to improve policing by \"building trust through transparency.\" This year, in his State of the City address, Adams also promised that cases of alleged misconduct would \"not languish for months.\"\n\nIn a statement to ProPublica, a spokesperson for the mayor's office defended the Police Department and Caban's record: \"Mayor Adams has full confidence in Caban's leadership and ability to thoroughly review all allegations of police misconduct, and adjudicate accordingly.\"\n\nA Police Department spokesperson declined to answer detailed questions, responding instead with a one-sentence statement: \"The NYPD continues to work closely with the Civilian Complaint Review Board in accordance with the terms of the memorandum of understanding.\"\n\nThat memorandum stemmed from a political compromise reached about a decade ago. Concerned that the department's policing tactics were too aggressive, members of the City Council pushed for the CCRB to be able to prosecute cases rather than simply make recommendations to the police commissioner.\n\nThe final memorandum , produced after protracted negotiations with the Police Department, included the mechanism that has since allowed Caban to intervene in disciplinary cases. The agreement states that the commissioner may take cases away from CCRB prosecutors if the commissioner determines that allowing the agency to move ahead will be \"detrimental to the Police Department's disciplinary process\" or if the \"interests of justice would not be served.\"\n\nChris Dunn, the legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, objected at the time to that veto power. Shown the number of cases that Caban has retained, he told ProPublica, \"This is exactly why we were so concerned about this authority.\"\n\nThe agreement stipulated that retentions can be used only on officers with \"no disciplinary history,\" a limitation that Caban and other commissioners have not always followed. Caban has on three occasions retained cases of officers who the CCRB had previously found engaged in misconduct.\n\nWhile commissioners can still choose to impose significant punishment after retaining a case, they often don't. In 40% of the cases that Caban has retained, he has ordered no discipline. In the cases in which he has ordered discipline, it has mostly been light, such as the loss of a few vacation days. The most severe punishment, ProPublica found, was docking an officer 10 vacation days for knocking a cellphone out of the hand of someone who was recording him.\n\nDisciplinary trials can produce significant consequences for officers - if they're allowed to proceed.\n\nIn 2018, CCRB prosecutors brought charges against the officer who killed Eric Garner , the Staten Island man whose cries of \"I can't breathe\" helped ignite the Black Lives Matter movement. It would be a last chance to hold the officer, Daniel Pantaleo, accountable after a grand jury had declined to indict him. The commissioner at the time, James O'Neill, moved to handle the case internally, according to multiple current and former review board officials. (O'Neill did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThe CCRB, however, pushed back. \"I went to war,\" recalled Maya Wiley, the chair of the board at the time, who went to City Hall to argue against the Police Department's plans. Officials in Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration overruled the commissioner and let the trial move ahead. Pantaleo was found guilty of using a banned chokehold. Amid huge public interest and scrutiny, the police commissioner then fired him.\n\nThe current approach to police discipline under Caban is something civil rights advocates attribute to his boss, Adams, a former police captain who has struck a tough-on-crime image and opposed policing reforms since taking office two years ago. \"We cannot handcuff the police,\" Adams told reporters when vetoing two criminal justice reform bills in January.\n\nLast year, the mayor reportedly urged Sewell to reject recommended disciplinary action against a top uniformed officer, who was also an Adams ally. She declined and pushed to discipline the officer, resigning shortly afterward. Mr. Adams then appointed another close ally to the position: Caban.\n\nCaban has his own history with the disciplinary process. Over his 30 years on the force, he has twice been found by the CCRB to have engaged in misconduct, making him an outlier in the department. The vast majority of officers have never been found by the oversight agency to have committed any misconduct.\n\nIn one case, he was ordered to complete more training after he arrested a civilian for not providing ID. In the other, related to refusing to provide the names of officers to a civilian who said they had mistreated her, there is no record of discipline.\n\nThe Police Department did not comment on Caban's record, but it previously said , \"Caban's awareness of that process will only help him bring a fair and informed point of view to those important decisions.\"\n\nCaban recently rejected discipline in a case in which two officers had killed a man in his own apartment during a mental health crisis. The chair of the review board criticized the decision, a move that earned Adams's ire . She also requested more resources to investigate complaints, which rose 50% last year. Instead, the Adams administration imposed cuts, forcing the board to stop investigating various kinds of misconduct, including officers who lie on the job.\n\n\"In this administration we have a mayor who runs the Police Department,\" said Dunn, of the New York Civil Liberties Union. \"He sets the tone, and the tone is 'we're cutting police accountability and discipline.'\"\n\nThe police union, the Police Benevolent Association, disagrees, saying Caban's actions are a critical counter to what it sees as frequent overreach by the civilian oversight board. \"The police commissioner has a responsibility to keep the city safe,\" the union's president, Patrick Hendry, said in a statement. \"CCRB's only goal is to boost their statistics and advance their anti-police narrative by punishing as many cops as possible.\"\n\nLast fall, Caban sent his own signal. He gave one of the department's top positions to an officer who tackled and shocked a Black Lives Matter protester with a Taser in the summer of 2020. Tarik Sheppard, a captain at the time, was heading to a disciplinary trial when his case was retained a year later, with no discipline given. Sheppard is now deputy commissioner for public information. He regularly appeared on television this spring to talk about the Police Department's response to campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe outcomes have been different for the victims. Destiny Strudwick, the protester who was tackled and shocked with a Taser, has struggled since the encounter nearly four years ago. \"Sometimes I feel like the human psyche is only made to handle so much,\" she said. \"And what happened to me, it just was too much.\"\n\nSheppard did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Police Department never informed Strudwick or Villafane that the cases against the officers who hurt them had been upended. After learning what had happened, both felt that the department had denied them justice.\n\nRead More\n\n\"That makes my heart sink,\" said Strudwick, after ProPublica told her of Sheppard's retention.\n\nAs for Villafane, she gasped when she was shown the Police Department letter wiping away the case against Dowling, who did not respond to requests for comment. She slowly read a line out loud, \"His actions therefore do not warrant a disciplinary action.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"He's supposed to be protecting us and he's hurting us,\" Villafane said. \"Who am I supposed to call to feel safe now? Not him.\"\n\nDo you have information about the police we should know?

Caban has on three occasions retained cases of officers who the CCRB had previously found engaged in misconduct.\n\nWhile commissioners can still choose to impose significant punishment after retaining a case, they often don't. In 40% of the cases that Caban has retained, he has ordered no discipline. In the cases in which he has ordered discipline, it has mostly been light, such as the loss of a few vacation days. The most severe punishment, ProPublica found, was docking an officer 10 vacation days for knocking a cellphone out of the hand of someone who was recording him.\n\nDisciplinary trials can produce significant consequences for officers - if they're allowed to proceed.\n\nIn 2018, CCRB prosecutors brought charges against the officer who killed Eric Garner , the Staten Island man whose cries of \"I can't breathe\" helped ignite the Black Lives Matter movement. It would be a last chance to hold the officer, Daniel Pantaleo, accountable after a grand jury had declined to indict him. The commissioner at the time, James O'Neill, moved to handle the case internally, according to multiple current and former review board officials. (O'Neill did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThe CCRB, however, pushed back. \"I went to war,\" recalled Maya Wiley, the chair of the board at the time, who went to City Hall to argue against the Police Department's plans. Officials in Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration overruled the commissioner and let the trial move ahead. Pantaleo was found guilty of using a banned chokehold. Amid huge public interest and scrutiny, the police commissioner then fired him.\n\nThe current approach to police discipline under Caban is something civil rights advocates attribute to his boss, Adams, a former police captain who has struck a tough-on-crime image and opposed policing reforms since taking office two years ago. \"We cannot handcuff the police,\" Adams told reporters when vetoing two criminal justice reform bills in January.\n\nLast year, the mayor reportedly urged Sewell to reject recommended disciplinary action against a top uniformed officer, who was also an Adams ally. She declined and pushed to discipline the officer, resigning shortly afterward. Mr. Adams then appointed another close ally to the position: Caban.\n\nCaban has his own history with the disciplinary process. Over his 30 years on the force, he has twice been found by the CCRB to have engaged in misconduct, making him an outlier in the department. The vast majority of officers have never been found by the oversight agency to have committed any misconduct.\n\nIn one case, he was ordered to complete more training after he arrested a civilian for not providing ID. In the other, related to refusing to provide the names of officers to a civilian who said they had mistreated her, there is no record of discipline.\n\nThe Police Department did not comment on Caban's record, but it previously said , \"Caban's awareness of that process will only help him bring a fair and informed point of view to those important decisions.\"\n\nCaban recently rejected discipline in a case in which two officers had killed a man in his own apartment during a mental health crisis. The chair of the review board criticized the decision, a move that earned Adams's ire . She also requested more resources to investigate complaints, which rose 50% last year. Instead, the Adams administration imposed cuts, forcing the board to stop investigating various kinds of misconduct, including officers who lie on the job.\n\n\"In this administration we have a mayor who runs the Police Department,\" said Dunn, of the New York Civil Liberties Union. \"He sets the tone, and the tone is 'we're cutting police accountability and discipline.'\"\n\nThe police union, the Police Benevolent Association, disagrees, saying Caban's actions are a critical counter to what it sees as frequent overreach by the civilian oversight board. \"The police commissioner has a responsibility to keep the city safe,\" the union's president, Patrick Hendry, said in a statement. \"CCRB's only goal is to boost their statistics and advance their anti-police narrative by punishing as many cops as possible.\"\n\nLast fall, Caban sent his own signal. He gave one of the department's top positions to an officer who tackled and shocked a Black Lives Matter protester with a Taser in the summer of 2020. Tarik Sheppard, a captain at the time, was heading to a disciplinary trial when his case was retained a year later, with no discipline given. Sheppard is now deputy commissioner for public information. He regularly appeared on television this spring to talk about the Police Department's response to campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe outcomes have been different for the victims. Destiny Strudwick, the protester who was tackled and shocked with a Taser, has struggled since the encounter nearly four years ago. \"Sometimes I feel like the human psyche is only made to handle so much,\" she said. \"And what happened to me, it just was too much.\"\n\nSheppard did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Police Department never informed Strudwick or Villafane that the cases against the officers who hurt them had been upended. After learning what had happened, both felt that the department had denied them justice.\n\nRead More\n\n\"That makes my heart sink,\" said Strudwick, after ProPublica told her of Sheppard's retention.\n\nAs for Villafane, she gasped when she was shown the Police Department letter wiping away the case against Dowling, who did not respond to requests for comment. She slowly read a line out loud, \"His actions therefore do not warrant a disciplinary action.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"He's supposed to be protecting us and he's hurting us,\" Villafane said. \"Who am I supposed to call to feel safe now? Not him.\"\n\nDo you have information about the police we should know?

Now Prosecutors Are Dropping Cases That Relied on His Testimony.\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nProsecutors in Illinois have dropped at least 15 court cases that hinged on the word of a former Chicago police officer who's now charged with perjury and forgery after he got dozens of traffic tickets dismissed by testifying each time that his girlfriend had stolen his car.\n\nJeffrey Kriv is accused of lying under oath 44 times to get out of speeding, parking and red light camera tickets involving his personal vehicles.\n\nIn his 26 years as a Chicago officer, Kriv was known for being one of the city's most prolific drunken-driving enforcers, which means many more pending cases in which he was an arresting officer could be in peril. The most recent DUI arrests he made involve allegations of dangerous driving.\n\nOn just one morning this month, an assistant state's attorney made motions declining to prosecute seven cases where Kriv was the arresting officer, some of which dated to 2021. The assistant state's attorney offered no reason, but in court, defense attorneys mentioned Kriv's alleged credibility issues.\n\n\"This is the officer who has been charged with a felony,\" one defense lawyer told Judge Chloe Pedersen after his client's DUI case was called.\n\n\"This is a Kriv matter,\" another defense attorney said as his client's case was dismissed.\n\nWhile Kriv retired in January just before he was charged criminally, he had faced nearly 100 misconduct complaints from citizens and fellow officers in his tenure on the force. ProPublica and the Chicago Tribune previously detailed Kriv's long history of alleged misconduct as an officer and his current legal trouble . Prosecutors charged him in January with four counts of perjury and five counts of forgery, all felonies, in connection with four of the traffic tickets he accrued. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department knew in early 2022 that the Office of Inspector General was investigating Kriv for lying to get out of tickets. Then, on Oct. 28, the state's attorney's office added Kriv to its list of officers whose credibility issues meant the office would not call them to testify in criminal cases, sometimes called the do-not-call list.\n\nBut the Police Department would not answer ProPublica when asked why it kept Kriv on the streets until January, when it stripped him of police powers.\n\nIn those few months, Kriv made two dozen arrests and issued seven traffic citations, according to Police Department records obtained by ProPublica. He was the primary arresting officer in 18 of those cases; charges already have been dropped in seven of them. A spokesperson for the Police Department declined to comment.\n\nThe state's attorney's office said there are 10 pending felony cases in which Kriv was the arresting officer. Two cases filed after he was put on the do-not-call list are moving forward; the other eight cases remain under review, a spokesperson said.\n\nThere may be other cases - most of them likely misdemeanor DUIs - involving Kriv that are still pending. The state's attorney's office said it does not track misdemeanors, and the Cook County clerk's office and chief judge's office also said they did not have that information. Most DUI cases are misdemeanors, however, and Kriv regularly made about 100 arrests a year on DUI charges, according to annual counts published by an anti-drunken-driving group. Kriv estimated last year that hundreds of his cases might be awaiting an outcome.\n\nKriv's attorney, Tim Grace, told reporters that he and his client would not comment for this story, though Kriv has twice emailed reporters to defend himself against misconduct complaints and call ProPublica's reporting biased, including in an email last week.\n\nIn a 2,000-word email sent in June, he said that he had nearly 150 honorable mentions and two life-saving awards and was consistently one of the city's top arresting officers for DUI charges. He also criticized other officers, a judge and the Police Department as a whole.\n\n\"I've been on the job for 27 years and I was a worker. Any officer that works will get complaints. Some false, some true,\" Kriv wrote. \"I could do what many, many officers do and that would be nothing.\"\n\nKriv also sent a strongly worded email to a prosecutor last November, while he was still working as a police officer, after he learned he would not be allowed to testify about arrests he made. In the email, he defended his honesty and threatened to \"not go out of my way to arrest people for DUI\" going forward.\n\n\"My reputation as a Chicago Police Officer is immaculate and all my testimony on any case that I have been involved in is spot on,\" he wrote to Assistant State's Attorney Emily Leuin, after calling her a coward. ProPublica obtained the email through a public records request.\n\n\"Go ahead and dismiss my cases where someone was seriously hurt because the offender was drunk. This is something you have to live with but by all accounts, you obviously have no qualms about doing so. I'm sure [anti-drunk-driving groups] will like to know what is going on with the dozens, if not hundreds of cases of mine that are currently pending an outcome,\" he wrote.\n\nLeuin did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDespite his threats, Kriv did make DUI arrests for the rest of his tenure as an officer. He arrested a Chicago man in December 2022 after he said he watched the driver go the wrong way on a one-way street and then go through a stop sign. \"Very strong odor of alcoholic beverage on breath, slurred/thick-tongued speech, glassy eyes, confused,\" Kriv wrote in the charging documents.\n\nThat case was dismissed in April.\n\nOther cases, meanwhile, are moving forward despite Kriv's indictment. In traffic court this month, defense attorney Steve Roach asked the prosecutor whether Kriv, who made the arrest, would be subpoenaed in his client's DUI case. The prosecutor said no, leaving Roach to wonder how the state could continue with its case.\n\n\"Because you've got a primary arresting officer who has an indictment against him which involves questions of one's honesty, I wouldn't be playing games with these cases,\" Roach said in an interview.\n\nThe Cook County public defender's office is representing several people in Kriv's arrest cases. A spokesperson said that in cases the state continues to pursue, the office will demand trials and the state will have to decide whether to make its cases without Kriv.\n\nThe collapse of Kriv's cases shares some similarities with the problematic DUI arrests made by Chicago police officer John Haleas nearly 20 years ago. Even after the police administration confirmed that Haleas had falsified reports in DUI arrests, he remained on duty. (In fact, he is still a Chicago police officer, though he was later convicted of attempted obstruction of justice and the department tried to fire him.)\n\nThere's also a key difference between Haleas and Kriv: how the state's attorney has reacted to pending court cases. The state's attorney dismissed more than 150 of Haleas' pending cases when he was found to have lied.\n\nThe state's attorney's office in July made public its list of officers in Cook County who it has barred from testifying in criminal cases - more than 300 officers in all, the vast majority of them from the Chicago Police Department. About 60 officers were added this year, and the office adopted a new policy last month that spells out prosecutors' duty to disclose its problematic witnesses to defendants.\n\n\"The culture that allowed disreputable law enforcement officers to testify in court propelled Cook County's reputation as the wrongful conviction capital of the country,\" State's Attorney Kim Foxx said in a press release about the disclosure list.\n\nChicago has a long history of scandalous cops whose cases fell apart when their own corruption or misdeeds were revealed. Over the years, officials have grappled with how to handle the fallout in court, as well as what to disclose to defendants and the public about these cases.\n\nA spokesperson for the state's attorney's office said the list of officers with credibility issues is public and that disclosures to defendants would be made when evidence is typically shared.\n\nProPublica contacted more than a dozen defense attorneys currently representing clients arrested by Kriv, and only one said he had been notified by a prosecutor that Kriv was barred from testifying. Other lawyers were unaware that Kriv would not be called as a witness. One said the state's attorney's office had left his case \"in limbo\" and he is skeptical that the prosecutor can mount a case without Kriv.\n\n\"Every time I show up, the state's attorney doesn't know what's going on,\" said defense attorney Marco Rodriguez, who is representing a client in a DUI case.\n\nAmong the Kriv cases that have been dismissed is one from October 2022 involving a woman who was idling in a crosswalk but asleep, according to Kriv's police report. He noted in the report that there was vomit on the car seat and on the woman's pants. Her blood alcohol content was 0.19%, more than twice the legal limit to drive, according to the report, obtained through a public records request.\n\nRead More\n\nProsecutors dropped the case against her in March.\n\nEven in his last weeks as a police officer, Kriv arrested at least five people over four days on DUI charges, including a 41-year-old driver he said he'd found on Dec. 10 passed out behind the wheel of his running Honda Accord in the middle of a dead-end street. The man \"seemed confused\" and the \"whole front end\" of his car was damaged and the tires shredded.\n\nKriv noted that the driver had an explanation for the car's damage.\n\nHe wrote that the man \"stated his car was like that from his girlfriend as it was her fault previously.\"\n\nThat case also has been dismissed.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI pursue stories about abuses of power - often focusing on schools and education - and stories about private businesses throughout the Midwest.\n\nTips about government and business, particularly in the Midwest, are welcome.

(In fact, he is still a Chicago police officer, though he was later convicted of attempted obstruction of justice and the department tried to fire him.)\n\nThere's also a key difference between Haleas and Kriv: how the state's attorney has reacted to pending court cases. The state's attorney dismissed more than 150 of Haleas' pending cases when he was found to have lied.\n\nThe state's attorney's office in July made public its list of officers in Cook County who it has barred from testifying in criminal cases - more than 300 officers in all, the vast majority of them from the Chicago Police Department. About 60 officers were added this year, and the office adopted a new policy last month that spells out prosecutors' duty to disclose its problematic witnesses to defendants.\n\n\"The culture that allowed disreputable law enforcement officers to testify in court propelled Cook County's reputation as the wrongful conviction capital of the country,\" State's Attorney Kim Foxx said in a press release about the disclosure list.\n\nChicago has a long history of scandalous cops whose cases fell apart when their own corruption or misdeeds were revealed. Over the years, officials have grappled with how to handle the fallout in court, as well as what to disclose to defendants and the public about these cases.\n\nA spokesperson for the state's attorney's office said the list of officers with credibility issues is public and that disclosures to defendants would be made when evidence is typically shared.\n\nProPublica contacted more than a dozen defense attorneys currently representing clients arrested by Kriv, and only one said he had been notified by a prosecutor that Kriv was barred from testifying. Other lawyers were unaware that Kriv would not be called as a witness. One said the state's attorney's office had left his case \"in limbo\" and he is skeptical that the prosecutor can mount a case without Kriv.\n\n\"Every time I show up, the state's attorney doesn't know what's going on,\" said defense attorney Marco Rodriguez, who is representing a client in a DUI case.\n\nAmong the Kriv cases that have been dismissed is one from October 2022 involving a woman who was idling in a crosswalk but asleep, according to Kriv's police report. He noted in the report that there was vomit on the car seat and on the woman's pants. Her blood alcohol content was 0.19%, more than twice the legal limit to drive, according to the report, obtained through a public records request.\n\nRead More\n\nProsecutors dropped the case against her in March.\n\nEven in his last weeks as a police officer, Kriv arrested at least five people over four days on DUI charges, including a 41-year-old driver he said he'd found on Dec. 10 passed out behind the wheel of his running Honda Accord in the middle of a dead-end street. The man \"seemed confused\" and the \"whole front end\" of his car was damaged and the tires shredded.\n\nKriv noted that the driver had an explanation for the car's damage.\n\nHe wrote that the man \"stated his car was like that from his girlfriend as it was her fault previously.\"\n\nThat case also has been dismissed.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI pursue stories about abuses of power - often focusing on schools and education - and stories about private businesses throughout the Midwest.\n\nTips about government and business, particularly in the Midwest, are welcome.

      "text": "A Capitol Police Officer Is Killed in Another Deadly Attack at U.S. Capitol\n\nA U.S. Capitol Police officer was killed and a second was injured on Friday afternoon following an attack on the Capitol, in which authorities say a suspect rammed a vehicle into the officers. The attack came nearly three months after the deadly insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nFriday's deadly attack prompted another lockdown across the Capitol grounds, setting the U.S. capital city once again on edge. Less than two weeks ago, the outer security perimeter and barbed wire that had encircled the Capitol Building since the pro-Trump mob broke into the complex had started to come down.\n\nThis time, the barricade that the suspect tried to ram through stopped the attack, after which the suspect was shot and killed by responding law enforcement. But the incident's proximity to Jan. 6 was an unambiguous reminder that the formerly accessible Capitol grounds designed to embody America's principles of transparency and open governance has become a target of violent attack.\n\nAt a rare press briefing on Friday, authorities said that there does not appear to be an ongoing threat. They said that the suspect was not known to the Capitol Hill police or the D.C. metropolitan police. They did not have any information so far about his motive, including whether he was targeting a particular lawmaker. They said the incident did not appear to be terrorism related. The investigation is ongoing.\n\nAccording to authorities, the suspect rammed a blue sedan into a barricade along Constitution Avenue and hit the officers with the car. He then exited the vehicle with a knife in hand and \"lunged\" at police. He failed to respond to verbal commands from officers, and \"at least\" one officer then fired. He has been pronounced dead.\n\nThe attack comes during what is already a deadly year for law enforcement in D.C. The officer who died Friday was identified by the agency as Officer William \"Billy\" Evans later in the afternoon. The other officer who was injured was not identified.\n\nThe Jan. 6 attack resulted in five deaths, including another member of the Capitol Police, Brian Sicknick . Two more law enforcement officers, Capitol Police Officer Howard Liebengood and DC metropolitan police officer Jeffrey Smith, who reportedly responded to the pro-Trump mob, subsequently died of suicide .\n\n\"I ask you to please keep the United States Capitol Police family in your thoughts and prayers at this time. It has been an extremely difficult and challenging year for us, but we will get through this, and we do appreciate the community support,\" said acting chief of U.S. Capitol Police Yogananda Pittman at the press briefing.\n\nVideos of the scene and response circulated on social media, including of a helicopter landing on a Capitol lawn near the scene, east of the Capitol building, as captured by Punchbowl News. Roll Call also captured video of national guard troops responding.\n\n\"We are shocked and saddened to learn that the U.S. Capitol and its police officers have once again come under a fatal attack,\" U.S. Capitol Historical Society CEO Jane Campbell said in a statement. \"This is a remarkable turn of history. In more than two centuries, never before have two acts of violence at the Capitol occurred so closely together.\"\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ordered Capitol flags at half-mast following the incident. \"Today, once again, these heroes risked their lives to protect our Capitol and our Country, with the same extraordinary selflessness and spirit of service seen on January 6. On behalf of the entire House, we are profoundly grateful,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"Congress stands ready to assist law enforcement with a swift and comprehensive investigation into this heinous attack.\"\n\nLawmakers from both parties put out statements of sympathy for the officers. \"On this Good Friday, I would ask that all Americans pray for healing for the surviving injured officer, for comfort for Officer Evans's family, and for all the officers and families of our Capitol Police,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement.\n\nPresident Joe Biden also put out a statement offering condolences. \"I have been receiving ongoing briefings from my Homeland Security Advisor, and will be getting further updates as the investigation proceeds,\" Biden said.\n\nThe incident will almost certainly spark further debate on security around the Hill. On Friday, both the House and Senate were on recess, so an already unusually empty complex due to coronavirus would have had even less people present. But on Jan. 6, as rioters sought to disrupt the certification of the presidential election results, hundreds of lawmakers, staff members, and administrative staff had to hide from the insurrectionists who broke into the Capitol building. For several weeks after, the atmosphere in Congress remained tense as new security measures were put in place to protect the people who work in the building.\n\nUntil recently, the spot where the incident happened on Friday was out of public reach because of an outer perimeter that had been put in place following the Jan. 6 attack. The outer barrier had been recently removed; lawmakers from both sides of the aisle and residents of the District complained the campus was inaccessible to the general public.\n\nWrite to Lissandra Villa at lissandra.villa@time.com"

      "text": "Officer's Guilty Plea in Breonna Taylor Case Raises Questions About Possible Cooperation With Feds\n\nA guilty plea last week by a former Louisville Metro Police (LMPD) detective involved in the botched raid that led to Breonna Taylor's death opens the door to her possibly cooperating with prosecutors, according to experts-something that is very rare in investigations of law enforcement officers.\n\nThe Justice Department charged Kelly Goodlett with helping to falsify the affidavit for the search warrant that authorized the \"no-knock\" entry into Taylor's apartment in March 2020.\n\n\"Goodlett acknowledged that she helped another LMPD detective and their supervisor obtain a warrant to search Taylor's home, despite knowing that the officers lacked probable cause to do so,\" the federal prosecutors said in a statement on Aug. 23.\n\nGoodlett and two other former LMPD officers-Kyle Meany and Joshua Jaynes-are accused of lying to get the search warrant for Taylor's home. Meany and Jaynes are also charged with violating Taylor's civil rights, which carries a maximum of up to life in prison if they are convicted.\n\nAnother officer, Brett Hankinson, is facing a separate federal charge of violating Taylor's civil rights for allegedly using excessive force by firing 10 times into Taylor's apartment.\n\nLocal media has questioned whether Goodlett is going to testify against her two former colleagues which is highly unusual for cops to do-especially in high profile cases. Usually, officers tend to band together and back one another in the face of official or criminal investigations, says Steve Cohen, a former prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New ‎York.\n\n\"For so many reasons and for so many years it has always been difficult to obtain the cooperation of a law enforcement officer,\" Cohen says. \"There is so much pressure on you as a law enforcement officer to stand by your brothers and sisters. The notion of violating that relationship, even to vindicate a broader principle becomes very difficult.\"\n\nBeyond that, though, the involvement of the Justice Department in a case like this is also not very common, says Joe Margulies, a criminal law professor at Cornell University and former defense attorney. \"The mere fact that the feds got involved as a separate prosecution is unusual. Most cases of police shootings, even with multiple co-defendants, do not lead to federal charges,\" Margulies says.\n\nWhat is more routine, according to Margulies and other experts, is the alleged wrongdoing: making false statements on documents like affidavits and search warrants . Such misconduct \"is staggeringly common. These are casual falsehoods that are calculatedly inserted into an affidavit in support of a warrant application. They are practiced at this,\" Margulies says.\n\nHere's what to know about the status of the charges against the four officers involved in Breonna Taylor's killing.\n\nOf the four officers charged by federal prosecutors, Goodlett faces the least serious charge, by far - one count of felony conspiracy. The Department of Justice alleged that she and Jaynes worked together to write the false warrant affidavit and after the raid worked together to write a false police report to cover up the affidavit.\n\nDuring a hearing last week, Goodlett pleaded guilty to the felony charge. She resigned from the police department on Aug. 5, a day after the federal charges were announced. Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, was in the courtroom when Goodlett pleaded guilty.\n\n\"The warrant affidavit requested permission for officers to make a 'no-knock' entry at Taylor's home because the alleged drug dealers that LMPD was investigating had a history of fleeing from the police and destroying evidence,\" the DOJ statement said. \"Goodlett admitted that all of the information in the warrant affidavit justifying a no-knock entry for Taylor's home was false as it related to Taylor. Goodlett was not aware of any valid reason to seek a no-knock warrant at Taylor's home.\"\n\nIt's not often that police officers in these types of cases plead guilty. \"It could well be that the prosecutors recognized that she was somebody that was likely to cooperate and may have gotten an indication from her lawyer,\" Cohen says. \"I would imagine it's highly likely that she does cooperate.\"\n\nDespite what evidence the DOJ has, a witness who can break down exactly what happened in this kind of case is always helpful for a jury. \"You always want a narrator to tell the story,\" Cohen says.\n\nGoodlett is facing up to five years in prison, along with a possible $250,000 fine-considerably less than the other officers, if they are convicted. It's likely that Goodlett had reached an agreement with the prosecution before the charges were filed, Margulies suggests. \"That's customary. If they got a member of the conspiracy that's already come to an agreement to cooperate they'll separate that person and their charges from the others,\" he says.\n\nGoodlett's lawyer, Brandon Marshall, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nShe is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 22.\n\nJaynes is facing three charges-conspiracy, falsifying records in a federal investigation and violating Taylor's civil rights. Meany is facing two charges: violating Taylor's civil rights and lying to federal investigators.\n\nJaynes was allegedly involved with Goodlett in creating the false affidavit. He and Goodlett told a judge that their real target-Taylor's former boyfriend-was getting packages delivered to her house, even though there was no evidence of that, prosecutors said.\n\nAccording to a federal indictment, Jaynes provided a false document to the FBI around May 2020 \"which he knew would be used in a criminal investigation into the preparation and execution of the Springfield Drive warrant at Breonna Taylor's home.\" In this document, Jaynes provided misleading information about the connection between Taylor and alleged drug trafficking.\n\nA couple of weeks later, Jaynes and Goodlett met in a garage to discuss the false affidavit that they made, prosecutors say. \"[Joshua Jaynes] relayed to [Kelly Goodlett] that they needed to get on the same page because they could both go down for putting false information in the Springfield Drive warrant affidavit,\" the indictment reads.\n\nMeanwhile, along with the civil rights charges that he shares with Jaynes, Meany is alleged to have made false statements to the FBI during the course of their investigation into the incident. Prosecutors say he told federal authorities that the LMPD SWAT team requested the no-knock section of the warrant affidavit when that wasn't true.\n\nAttorneys representing Meany and Hayes did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe trial for Meany and Hayes is slated to begin in October.\n\nHankison's charges stem from his actions the night of the raid. While the officers were at the front door of Taylor's house, he went to the side of Taylor's house and fired 10 shots through a bedroom window and sliding door.\n\nThe window and door were covered with blinds and blackout curtains so it was impossible for him to see anything inside the house. During his state trial earlier this year, Hankison argued that he thought the officers who were conducting the raid were under gunfire. He was found not guilty in that trial.\n\nHankinson's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHis trial is scheduled to begin in November.\n\nWrite to Josiah Bates at josiah.bates@time.com"

Kennedy on the dedication of the week of May 15 as \"National Police Week,\" in which he noted that law-enforcement officers had been protecting Americans since the nation's birth.\n\nIn fact, the U.S. police force is a relatively modern invention, sparked by changing notions of public order, driven in turn by economics and politics, according to Gary Potter, a crime historian at Eastern Kentucky University.\n\nPolicing in Colonial America had been very informal, based on a for-profit, privately funded system that employed people part-time. Towns also commonly relied on a \"night watch\" in which volunteers signed up for a certain day and time, mostly to look out for fellow colonists engaging in prostitution or gambling. (Boston started one in 1636, New York followed in 1658 and Philadelphia created one in 1700.) But that system wasn't very efficient because the watchmen often slept and drank while on duty, and there were people who were put on watch duty as a form of punishment.\n\nNight-watch officers were supervised by constables, but that wasn't exactly a highly sought-after job, either. Early policemen \"didn't want to wear badges because these guys had bad reputations to begin with, and they didn't want to be identified as people that other people didn't like,\" says Potter. When localities tried compulsory service, \"if you were rich enough, you paid someone to do it for you - ironically, a criminal or a community thug.\"\n\nAs the nation grew, however, different regions made use of different policing systems.\n\nIn cities, increasing urbanization rendered the night-watch system completely useless as communities got too big. The first publicly funded, organized police force with officers on duty full-time was created in Boston in 1838. Boston was a large shipping commercial center, and businesses had been hiring people to protect their property and safeguard the transport of goods from the port of Boston to other places, says Potter. These merchants came up with a way to save money by transferring to the cost of maintaining a police force to citizens by arguing that it was for the \"collective good.\"\n\nIn the South, however, the economics that drove the creation of police forces were centered not on the protection of shipping interests but on the preservation of the slavery system. Some of the primary policing institutions there were the slave patrols tasked with chasing down runaways and preventing slave revolts, Potter says; the first formal slave patrol had been created in the Carolina colonies in 1704. During the Civil War, the military became the primary form of law enforcement in the South, but during Reconstruction, many local sheriffs functioned in a way analogous to the earlier slave patrols, enforcing segregation and the disenfranchisement of freed slaves.\n\nIn general, throughout the 19th century and beyond, the definition of public order - that which the police officer was charged with maintaining - depended whom was asked.\n\nFor example, businessmen in the late 19th century had both connections to politicians and an image of the kinds of people most likely to go on strike and disrupt their workforce. So it's no coincidence that by the late 1880s, all major U.S. cities had police forces. Fears of labor-union organizers and of large waves of Catholic, Irish, Italian, German, and Eastern European immigrants, who looked and acted differently from the people who had dominated cities before, drove the call for the preservation of law and order, or at least the version of it promoted by dominant interests. For example, people who drank at taverns rather than at home were seen as \"dangerous\" people by others, but they might have pointed out other factors such as how living in a smaller home makes drinking in a tavern more appealing. (The irony of this logic, Potter points out, is that the businessmen who maintained this belief were often the ones who profited off of the commercial sale of alcohol in public places.)\n\nAt the same time, the late 19th century was the era of political machines, so police captains and sergeants for each precinct were often picked by the local political party ward leader, who often owned taverns or ran street gangs that intimidated voters. They then were able to use police to harass opponents of that particular political party, or provide payoffs for officers to turn a blind eye to allow illegal drinking, gambling and prostitution.\n\nThis situation was exacerbated during Prohibition, leading President Hoover to appoint the Wickersham Commission in 1929 to investigate the ineffectiveness of law enforcement nationwide. To make police independent from political party ward leaders, the map of police precincts was changed so that they would not correspond with political wards.\n\nThe drive to professionalize the police followed, which means that the concept of a career cop as we'd recognize it today is less than a century old.\n\nFurther campaigns for police professionalism were promoted as the 20th century progressed, but crime historian Samuel Walker's The Police in America: An Introduction argues that the move toward professionalism wasn't all good: that movement, he argues, promoted the creation of police departments that were \"inward-looking\" and \"isolated from the public,\" and crime-control tactics that ended up exacerbating tensions between police and the communities they watch over. And so, more than a half-century after Kennedy's 1963 proclamation, the improvement and modernization of America's surprisingly young police force continues to this day.\n\nA version of this article also appears in the May 29 issue of TIME.\n\nWrite to Olivia B.

      "text": "The Story Behind the Viral Photo of the Officer and the KKK\n\nThe officer stands calmly as a group of white supremacists act out behind him. One man's outstretched right arm signals a Nazi salute. Another wears a red hood. A third rests a Confederate flag on his shoulder.\n\nThe provocative scene that Saturday afternoon in Charlottesville, captured with an iPhone, was shared with a modest public following but would attract a wide audience. \"Confederate flags, Nazi salutes, and Klansmen having their rights protected by a black police officer,\" reads a tweet posted on Aug. 12 by Ubadah Sabbagh, a Ph.D. student at Virginia Tech. \"This picture hurts.\" James P. O'Neill, commissioner of the New York City Police Department, shared the image and commended law enforcement in Charlottesville \"for handling today's events with true professionalism. Much respect.\" Tim Hogan, a former member of the Hillary for America communications team, tweeted it , too: \"A picture worth a thousand words.\" A writer, Yashar Ali, suggested the image be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. \"A black police officer protecting a group of men who wish him harm,\" he wrote in a tweet. \"Incredible.\" He prefaced that remark with a question common during breaking news: \"Who took this photo?\"\n\nAnd when was it taken? The picture went viral on Aug. 12, as the Virginia college town was rocked by unrest over the planned \"Unite the Right\" rally. Tensions that morning had devolved into street clashes, as dozens of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and Klansmen faced off against a fierce contingent of counterprotesters over plans to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a city park. As intense pictures from the violence made the rounds, this image stood alone. A distraction in what otherwise felt like a moment of chaos.\n\nThe image spread further after a speeding car smashed into counterdemonstrators-sending bodies flying, killing one woman and injuring 19 others. But as the retweets entered into the tens of thousands, doubts emerged that this image was from Saturday's events. In the uncomfortable haze of live breaking news it became the latest in a long line of images to be grabbed and shared online without credit or context. Social networks are minefields for information-gatherers. Photographers lose control of their work while those who share it reap the rewards: retweets, likes, followers. Images are separated from their intended meaning, and can even take on a new one.\n\nAnd so began a hunt for the photographer.\n\nA reverse image search on Google pointed to Reddit, where a thread with the photo was submitted on July 15 under the headline: \"Police Officer Nash protects the KKK's first amendment rights as they protest the removal of two statues commemorating Confederate generals in Charlottesville, VA last weekend.\" The entry supported suspicions the image was not from Aug. 12. Among the comments was a link to another thread , submitted four days prior, titled, \"This picture was taken at the KKK rally July 8th in Charlottesville, Virginia.\" Helpful, but it raised more questions than answers.\n\nThe search moved to Facebook, where Frank Somerville, an anchor with KTVU in Oakland, Calif., shared a post on July 13 by Kimberly Payne Hawk that included the picture. She had first seen the image on the Facebook page of a friend. Would she happen to know the photographer?\n\nReached by Facebook message, she offered a name of a local resident. A few scrolls through the Instagram feed of an account associated with the name and there the picture was, between another protest image and a photograph celebrating a soft drink.\n\nJill Mumie lives about a block away from Justice Park. On July 8, a scorcher of a Saturday, she ventured out to support the counterprotesters. \"I knew I wanted to go and be a part of that,\" she tells TIME. \"I went by myself and just wanted to be part of the energy.\"\n\nMumie, 42, had recently moved to Charlottesville from New Jersey, where she worked for five years in Philadelphia's hospitality industry. In college she had studied art and photography and worked as a Canon EOS Tech Support representative. She was only in town for about a week and a half before the rally.\n\nThat afternoon, she positioned herself near an area that had been cordoned off \"in anticipation of what might unfold.\" She purposefully stayed in front of the officer, waiting for what she felt was the right moment that captured the \"bizarre\" scene that was unfolding.\n\nOnce the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan arrived, she recalled \"a huge surge of people behind me.\" And so with her iPhone, Mumie tried a few different shots. In one outtake, a girl stands beside the officer, snapping a picture of the commotion as the officer stares elsewhere. The angle of his chin, the tilt of his head, something felt off. In another outtake, the attention is focused on a man behind the officer who displays a middle finger in Mumie's direction.\n\nWithout much water on such a hot day, Mumie left the area soon after. At one point, the gathering of about 50 Klansmen would be deemed unlawful and authorities would forcefully break up the crowd that was angered, in part, by officers' escort of the Klansmen back to their vehicles. Hours later, a local outlet, The Daily Progress , reported that police had arrested 23 people in connection with the protest.\n\nMumie later posted an image from the scene to her Instagram account ( @lil_mooms )-what she calls her \"sketchbook.\" With a few hundred followers, it began in an eddy, but was pulled into the mainstream. This past weekend, friends alerted her that it was being shared widely. \"You have this person being professional and protecting the free speech of Americans and then you have this hate speech behind him,\" she says. \"I remember looking at it after the fact and thought it really does sum it up.\"\n\nFor Mumie, the picture is about the show of restraint and resilience. She uses words like \"duty\" and \"honor\" and invokes former First Lady Michelle Obama's message during last year's Democratic National Convention: \"When they go low, we go high.\"\n\nDays before the Aug. 12 rally, Mumie dropped off a copy of the photograph, along with her contact information, at the local police department.\n\nWas the officer aware of the icon he'd become?\n\nA school resource officer at Charlottesville High School, Darius Nash, confirmed to TIME on Aug. 14 that it was he in the photograph.\n\n\"I don't feel like I'm a hero for it,\" Nash wrote in an email statement that morning. \"I swore to protect my city and that's what I was there to do. I don't think it makes me a hero, just doing what I believe in.\"\n\nLater in the afternoon, Nash said he appreciated the show of support for law enforcement and said the experience \"humbled me a whole lot, just seeing how a picture like that can reveal so much.\" At one point, highlighting how much the community has been affected by the violence, Nash said a friend of his wife knew the victim of the car-ramming, Heather Heyer. \"So we all felt it.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Police Officer Fired After Allegedly Mishandling Explicit Photos of Slain University of Utah Student\n\nA police officer in Logan, Utah, was fired after a state investigation concluded he \"mishandled\" explicit photographs that were used to extort University of Utah student Lauren McCluskey, the Logan Police Department announced Friday.\n\nIn October 2018, 21-year-old McCluskey told the University of Utah Police Department that her ex-boyfriend Melvin Rowland was extorting her for money by threatening to release explicit photographs of her. She then sent those photographs to Officer Miguel Deras, the on-duty campus police officer, according to a report summarizing the Utah Department of Public Safety's (UDPS) investigation into Deras' conduct. A little over a week later, McCluskey was shot and killed by Rowland, who later died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nThe UDPS investigation began after the Salt Lake Tribune reported back in May that Deras had inappropriately downloaded, shared and bragged about the photos of McCluskey to his co-workers. The Tribune reported that Deras had saved the photos to his personal phone. However, the investigation did not find evidence that Deras had downloaded the images or sent them to \"anyone other than the detective assigned to the case,\" Chatman said in his statement. However, as the Tribune notes in its coverage, the report says Deras had gotten a new phone since McCluskey's killing and \"the information which was ultimately recovered may have been the products of backups (or partial or incomplete backups) from the previous phones he had owned.\"\n\nThe UDPS's investigation found that Deras showed the photographs of McCluskey to \"a small number of officers\" who \"inappropriately commented on the photos before, during or immediately after a shift change briefing,\" the University of Utah's Chief of Police Rodney Chatman said in a statement on Wednesday. \"I am deeply disturbed by this finding and disappointed in the officers who were present and who did not report this incident through appropriate university channels.\"\n\nDeras had since left the university's police force and was working for the Logan Police Department. In a statement released on Friday, the Logan Police Department said Deras' employment had been \"ended effective immediately\" after the UDPS's report concluded he had \"mishandled sensitive evidence\" in the McCluskey case.\n\n\"Our continuing efforts to hold sacred the public's trust and our duty to serve and protect has resulted in today's decision,\" Logan Chief of Police Gary Jensen said in a statement.\n\nChatman also said the University of Utah is \"pursuing action against individual officers based on the findings in [UDPS's] report.\"\n\nDeras' attorney Jeremy Jones released a letter in response to the UDPS's investigation on Wednesday, saying, \"This report directly falsifies virtually every aspect of the Tribune's original reporting and roundly corroborates Officer Deras' account of events as released on May 19, 2020. Contrary to the prior reporting Deras did not inappropriately download images to his phone. He did not electronically share them with another officer... He is not, nor has he ever been, a boogeyman.\"\n\nWhen asked for comment on Deras' firing from the Logan Police Department, Jones told TIME, \"Unfortunately this is what happens when you have somebody get tried in the media. We really perceived the original reporting in this story to have been thoroughly debunked and falsified. Unfortunately, that hasn't stopped the public pressure campaign from costing Miguel Deras his job.\"\n\n\"This is a clear attempt to obfuscate,\" said the Tribune 's Senior Managing Editor Matt Canham when asked to comment on Jones' statements. \"If anyone wants to know what happened here, read The Salt Lake Tribune 's investigative reporting, or read the Department of Public Safety report, or the comments from the University of Utah police chief or the comment from the Logan Police Department.\"\n\nFollowing the recent release of the report, students at the University of Utah protested, calling for Deras' firing. A Change.org petition titled \"Fire and Press Charges against Miguel Deras for Distributing Lauren McCluskey's Photos,\" which launched three months ago, has at least 135,446 signatures as of Saturday afternoon ET.\n\nWrite to Madeleine Carlisle at madeleine.carlisle@time.com"

      "text": "'The Correct Decision.' NYPD Fires Daniel Pantaleo, Officer Involved in Eric Garner Chokehold Death\n\nDaniel Pantaleo , the New York City police officer who fatally choked Eric Garner, has been fired - more than five years after Garner's death prompted widespread outrage over police brutality and his final words - \"I can't breathe\" - became a rallying cry for protesters across the country.\n\n\"I stand before you today confident that I have reached the correct decision,\" New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill made the announcement at a press conference Monday. \"It is clear that Daniel Pantaleo can no longer effectively serve as a New York City police officer.\"\n\nEarlier this month, on Aug. 2, Pantaleo was suspended from the police department following a disciplinary trial judge's recommendation that he be fired.\n\nGarner's case prompted widespread outrage after the release of video footage of Pantaleo holding Garner down in a chokehold while attempting to arrest him on July 17, 2014. Garner, who was facing arrest for allegedly selling loose cigarettes, was repeatedly heard saying, \"I can't breathe,\" as officers forced him to the ground. Garner died just weeks before Michael Brown was fatally shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. Both cases sparked a movement for calling for police reform, and fueling a national debate over race and police use of force.\n\nThe New York City medical examiner's office later said Garner's death was a homicide caused by neck compressions - compressions believed to have been caused by the chokehold. During Pantaleo's disciplinary trial in May, the doctor who conducted Garner's autopsy testified that the combination of the chokehold and chest compressions caused a \"lethal cascade\" of events that ended in a fatal asthma attack, according to the New York Times.\n\nWhile the decision marks the end of a chapter for Pantaleo and the Garner family, both sides have vowed that it's not over. For Pantaleo, his lawyer Stuart London said a press conference that Pantaleo will file an appeal over his termination (Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch also criticized the move, saying the commissioner \"has chosen politics and his own self-interest over the police officers he claims to lead\"). For the Garner family, Eric's daughter Emerald Snipes Garner thanked O'Neill for \"finally\" making his decision, but added that it \"should have been made five years ago,\" Snipes Garner added that she would like to see other officers involved held accountable, as well as lobbying for the passage of what Garner's family call the \"Eric Garner law,\" which would ban police chokeholds entirely.\n\n\"We weren't expecting for [Pantaleo] to actually be fired,\" Snipes Garner tells TIME. \"Of course we wanted it but we were trying to be realistic.\"\n\n\"We've had to relive the moment (Eric Garner's death) constantly for the past five years but we pushed through and have spread awareness about police brutality.\" She also believes that this firing will be a wake up call to other officers. \"I think that police officers will begin to think twice about what they're doing and follow the correct procedure,\" she says.\n\nIn a separate press conference, Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, thanked supporters, saying \"it's been five long years that I have fought this fight. I have not fought it alone.\"\n\nThe decision could have ripple effects for years. Michael Avery, the president of the National Police Accountability Project, said that this decision should be an example for other police departments. \"I hope that this will become a pattern going forward,\" Avery tells TIME. \"I hope that other police chiefs and other police commissioners will follow this in the future. When a finding is made by an administrative body within a police department that an officer has violated policy then there should be a consequence.\"\n\nThe decision to fire Pantaleo could also impact the relationship between the police and the communities they serve. Henry Smart III, a professor at John Jay College of criminal justice, says that this could lead to more trust between the police and everyday people\n\n\"This one case can't change everything, but it is a signal to the community,\" Henry Smart III, a professor at John Jay College of criminal justice tells TIME. \"I think this will promote dialogue between community members and police officers, as opposed to the us versus them scenario that we've been operating on.\" While acknowledging there is more work to be done - citing a need for more equitable law enforcement for all citizens, and that officers cannot discriminate based on race or social economic status - Professor Smart also praised commissioner O'Neill. \"You have to give this commissioner credit for doing something beyond the status quo that we expect from the NYPD.\"\n\n\"Being for police accountability is not mutually exclusive with supporting our men and women\" on the NYPD, New York City's Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said.\n\nHowever, Avery also pointed out that these decisions could be followed by blowback from police unions and officers. \"If you look at the statement that was made by the PBA president [after Pantaleo's suspension was announced], he's virtually inviting police officers not to do their jobs in the future,\" Avery says. \"I think that's the height of irresponsibility.\" (In that statement, Lynch described the decision as \"political insanity\" and argued it left officers feeling \"expendable.)\n\nO'Neill's verdict marks his first confirmed punishment as an officer.\n\nIn December 2014, a Staten Island grand jury decided against indicting Pantaleo on criminal charges, saying they found \"no reasonable cause\" to do so, sparking protests nationwide. Less than a year after this decision, in July 2015, Garner's family settled a wrongful death lawsuit against the city for $5.9 million.\n\nThree years after the settlement, in July 2018, the NYPD approved the enacting of disciplinary proceedings against Pantaleo, saying it had lost patience with the federal process, the Associated Press reported.\n\nLast month, federal prosecutors also said they would not bring civil rights charges against Pantaleo, noting that the evidence \"does not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Officer Pantaleo acted in willful violation of federal law.\" The NYPD's disciplinary trial finally began in May 2019, culminating in Maldonado's recommendation of termination.\n\nThe ultimate decision came down to O'Neill after Deputy Commissioner of Trials Rosemarie Maldonado recommended he be fired. Maldonado had been tasked with determining whether Pantaleo used a chokehold on Garner - a move banned by official police policy. She found that he did, but noted in her 45-page report that a lot of the contact with the neck was \"accidental and unintentional.\" Fred Davie, chairman of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, which acted as a prosecutor at Pantaleo's department trial last spring, took Maldonado's recommendation to imply that his argument at trial was correct: Pantaleo's chokehold did, in fact, cause Garner's death.\n\nO'Neill's decision on Monday brought quick praise from Garner's family and swift criticism from Pantaleo's lawyer and Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a Monday press conference: \"Today we have finally seen justice done. Today we saw the NYPD's own disciplinary process act fairly and impartially.\"\n\nDe Blasio, who is running for president , has received criticism during his campaign for the way the city handled the Garner case. Activists protesting the incident interrupted the second Presidential debate in July.

      "text": "'The Correct Decision.' NYPD Fires Daniel Pantaleo, Officer Involved in Eric Garner Chokehold Death\n\nDaniel Pantaleo , the New York City police officer who fatally choked Eric Garner, has been fired - more than five years after Garner's death prompted widespread outrage over police brutality and his final words - \"I can't breathe\" - became a rallying cry for protesters across the country.\n\n\"I stand before you today confident that I have reached the correct decision,\" New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill made the announcement at a press conference Monday. \"It is clear that Daniel Pantaleo can no longer effectively serve as a New York City police officer.\"\n\nEarlier this month, on Aug. 2, Pantaleo was suspended from the police department following a disciplinary trial judge's recommendation that he be fired.\n\nGarner's case prompted widespread outrage after the release of video footage of Pantaleo holding Garner down in a chokehold while attempting to arrest him on July 17, 2014. Garner, who was facing arrest for allegedly selling loose cigarettes, was repeatedly heard saying, \"I can't breathe,\" as officers forced him to the ground. Garner died just weeks before Michael Brown was fatally shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. Both cases sparked a movement for calling for police reform, and fueling a national debate over race and police use of force.\n\nThe New York City medical examiner's office later said Garner's death was a homicide caused by neck compressions - compressions believed to have been caused by the chokehold. During Pantaleo's disciplinary trial in May, the doctor who conducted Garner's autopsy testified that the combination of the chokehold and chest compressions caused a \"lethal cascade\" of events that ended in a fatal asthma attack, according to the New York Times.\n\nWhile the decision marks the end of a chapter for Pantaleo and the Garner family, both sides have vowed that it's not over. For Pantaleo, his lawyer Stuart London said a press conference that Pantaleo will file an appeal over his termination (Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch also criticized the move, saying the commissioner \"has chosen politics and his own self-interest over the police officers he claims to lead\"). For the Garner family, Eric's daughter Emerald Snipes Garner thanked O'Neill for \"finally\" making his decision, but added that it \"should have been made five years ago,\" Snipes Garner added that she would like to see other officers involved held accountable, as well as lobbying for the passage of what Garner's family call the \"Eric Garner law,\" which would ban police chokeholds entirely.\n\n\"We weren't expecting for [Pantaleo] to actually be fired,\" Snipes Garner tells TIME. \"Of course we wanted it but we were trying to be realistic.\"\n\n\"We've had to relive the moment (Eric Garner's death) constantly for the past five years but we pushed through and have spread awareness about police brutality.\" She also believes that this firing will be a wake up call to other officers. \"I think that police officers will begin to think twice about what they're doing and follow the correct procedure,\" she says.\n\nIn a separate press conference, Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, thanked supporters, saying \"it's been five long years that I have fought this fight. I have not fought it alone.\"\n\nThe decision could have ripple effects for years. Michael Avery, the president of the National Police Accountability Project, said that this decision should be an example for other police departments. \"I hope that this will become a pattern going forward,\" Avery tells TIME. \"I hope that other police chiefs and other police commissioners will follow this in the future. When a finding is made by an administrative body within a police department that an officer has violated policy then there should be a consequence.\"\n\nThe decision to fire Pantaleo could also impact the relationship between the police and the communities they serve. Henry Smart III, a professor at John Jay College of criminal justice, says that this could lead to more trust between the police and everyday people\n\n\"This one case can't change everything, but it is a signal to the community,\" Henry Smart III, a professor at John Jay College of criminal justice tells TIME. \"I think this will promote dialogue between community members and police officers, as opposed to the us versus them scenario that we've been operating on.\" While acknowledging there is more work to be done - citing a need for more equitable law enforcement for all citizens, and that officers cannot discriminate based on race or social economic status - Professor Smart also praised commissioner O'Neill. \"You have to give this commissioner credit for doing something beyond the status quo that we expect from the NYPD.\"\n\n\"Being for police accountability is not mutually exclusive with supporting our men and women\" on the NYPD, New York City's Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said.\n\nHowever, Avery also pointed out that these decisions could be followed by blowback from police unions and officers. \"If you look at the statement that was made by the PBA president [after Pantaleo's suspension was announced], he's virtually inviting police officers not to do their jobs in the future,\" Avery says. \"I think that's the height of irresponsibility.\" (In that statement, Lynch described the decision as \"political insanity\" and argued it left officers feeling \"expendable.)\n\nO'Neill's verdict marks his first confirmed punishment as an officer.\n\nIn December 2014, a Staten Island grand jury decided against indicting Pantaleo on criminal charges, saying they found \"no reasonable cause\" to do so, sparking protests nationwide. Less than a year after this decision, in July 2015, Garner's family settled a wrongful death lawsuit against the city for $5.9 million.\n\nThree years after the settlement, in July 2018, the NYPD approved the enacting of disciplinary proceedings against Pantaleo, saying it had lost patience with the federal process, the Associated Press reported.\n\nLast month, federal prosecutors also said they would not bring civil rights charges against Pantaleo, noting that the evidence \"does not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Officer Pantaleo acted in willful violation of federal law.\" The NYPD's disciplinary trial finally began in May 2019, culminating in Maldonado's recommendation of termination.\n\nThe ultimate decision came down to O'Neill after Deputy Commissioner of Trials Rosemarie Maldonado recommended he be fired. Maldonado had been tasked with determining whether Pantaleo used a chokehold on Garner - a move banned by official police policy. She found that he did, but noted in her 45-page report that a lot of the contact with the neck was \"accidental and unintentional.\" Fred Davie, chairman of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, which acted as a prosecutor at Pantaleo's department trial last spring, took Maldonado's recommendation to imply that his argument at trial was correct: Pantaleo's chokehold did, in fact, cause Garner's death.\n\nO'Neill's decision on Monday brought quick praise from Garner's family and swift criticism from Pantaleo's lawyer and Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a Monday press conference: \"Today we have finally seen justice done. Today we saw the NYPD's own disciplinary process act fairly and impartially.\"\n\nDe Blasio, who is running for president , has received criticism during his campaign for the way the city handled the Garner case. Activists protesting the incident interrupted the second Presidential debate in July. In a statement released on Monday, the Legal Aid Society critiqued de Blasio's role, saying that \"the Mayor's legacy will have to bear this stain and all of its costs forever.\" Their statement added:\n\nNYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo should have been fired in 2014 and immediately stripped of his pension. Despite Mayor Bill de Blasio's many attempts to point fingers elsewhere and spread the blame for years of inaction, New Yorkers now know that City Hall had the authority and jurisdiction to act decisively on this matter early on yet still did not.\n\nEchoing Snipes Garner and other police reform activists, Legal Aid also called for the other officers involved in Garner's arrest to be fired.\n\nDonna Lieberman, the Executive Director of the ACLU NY, released a statement saying that the firing of Pantaleo \"affirms what we all know: Pantaleo used excessive force on an unarmed Black man and is not fit to serve as a police officer.\"\n\n\"While this is some measure of long-overdue relief, we have a long way to go to achieve true police accountability,\" Lieberman said in the statement. \"The NYPD must take further steps to rebuild trust between officers and the communities they serve, put an end to police brutality against communities of color, and ensure what happened to Eric Garner will never happen again.\"\n\n\"The most important thing we can do to change is to never have the tragedy again,\" de Blasio said. \"We have to do everything that we possibly can do to avoid there ever being another tragedy.\"\n\nNew York Rep.

      "text": "What Mike Fanone Can't Forget\n\nI t wasn't a cop bar; that was the point. They weren't there to meet other cops. They were there to meet girls. The three police officers took seats at the wine bar in D.C.'s trendy Navy Yard neighborhood-exposed concrete walls, leather banquettes, $13 tuna tartare-and despite its being a wine bar, despite the Wednesday night half-price-wine special, they ordered beers.\n\nMay 12, 2021, was a balmy night, and dozens of newly vaccinated young urbanites mingled out on the patio. At 10 p.m., the cops asked the bartender to put CNN on the TV.\n\n\"A true American hero, officer Michael Fanone,\" intoned the host, Don Lemon. \"This is difficult to watch. But it is the truth of what happened that day. The truth-not the lies that you've been hearing.\" The screen filled with Fanone's body-camera footage from the Jan. 6 insurrection , airing publicly for the first time. \"Officer Fanone is outside on the Capitol steps on the lower west terrace,\" Lemon said. \"This is approximately 3:15 on that day.\"\n\nMike Fanone-wiry, bearded, his arms and neck covered in tattoos-nursed a Modelo at the bar and took it all in again. It had been four months since the day Fanone nearly died defending the Capitol-the day a self-described redneck cop who voted for Donald Trump was beaten unconscious by a mob waving Thin Blue Line flags and chanting \"U.S.A.\" The day Fanone, a narcotics officer with the D.C. metropolitan police department (MPD) who'd planned to spend his evening shift buying heroin undercover, voluntarily rushed to defend the seat of American democracy and wound up in hand-to-hand combat with a horde hellbent on unstealing the election. The day Fanone was dragged down the Capitol's marble stairs, beaten with pipes and poles, tear-gassed and stun-gunned. The day he pleaded for his life as they threatened to shoot him with his own gun, telling the rioters he had kids, until they relented and spared him.\n\nOn the TV at the bar, Fanone's hand strained to push them away. The crush parted, and the full scene came into view: the grand terrace, the teeming crowd. Bodies upon bodies as far as the eye could see. Red hats and camo, Trump flags and American flags , all pressing forward, trying to break the cops' tenuous hold on the central door into the building. There is a thin blue line between order and chaos, and at that moment, Mike Fanone was it.\n\nGet a print of TIME's Cover Portrait of Mike Fanone here\n\nThe footage showed Fanone getting pulled out into the scrum. A man's voice: \"I got one!\" Then Fanone began to scream the high-pitched, undignified screams of a man being tased in the back of the neck.\n\nThe bar fell silent as the body-cam footage played. And suddenly, for the first time since that day, Fanone was sobbing uncontrollably, shoulders heaving as his buddies put their arms around him.\n\nFanone-40, nearly broke, living with his mother, seeing ghosts, unable to return to duty in the only job he'd ever loved, possibly forever-had seen the footage a hundred times. But this was the first time he'd viewed it with other people, watched them witness what he lived through, see it through his eyes, feel his aggression, his valor, his abject terror. He sat there crying for a good 20 minutes. At some point he looked up and realized he was surrounded: everyone in the bar had come inside from the patio and gathered around him, watching the footage on the screen.\n\nThe months since Jan. 6 had not been easy for Fanone. Still recuperating from life-threatening injuries and posttraumatic stress disorder, he'd found himself increasingly isolated. Republicans didn't want him to exist, and Democrats weren't in the mood for hero cops. Even many of his colleagues didn't see why he couldn't just get over it. That very day, a GOP Congressman had testified that what had happened was more like a \"tourist visit\" than an \"insurrection.\" But no one could see this footage, Fanone thought, and deny what really happened that day. History would be forced to record it.\n\nThis is the story of what happened after Jan. 6. This is Mike Fanone's story, recounted over weeks of searching conversations and corroborated by witnesses, public records and videotape. It is a story about what we agree to remember and what we choose to forget, about how history is not lived but manufactured after the fact. In the aftermath of a national tragedy, we are supposed to come together and say \"never forget,\" to agree on the heroes and the villains, on who was at fault and how their culpability must be avenged. But what happens if we can't agree? What if we're too busy arguing to face what really happened?\n\n\"There's people on both sides of the political aisle that are like, 'Listen, Jan. 6 happened, it was bad, we need to move on as a country,'\" Fanone tells me one recent afternoon on the well-kept back patio of his mother's house, between long swigs from a beer can. It's in a quiet exurban Virginia neighborhood, ranch houses alternating with McMansions, American flags flying over big green yards. \"What an arrogant f-cking thing for someone to say that wasn't there that day,\" he says. \"What needs to happen is there needs to be a reckoning.\"\n\nWhat makes a hero? Is it bravery, charging into danger to protect others? Is it sacrifice, the damage sustained in the process? Or is it the man who refuses to let us forget?\n\nAfter Fanone regained consciousness that day, he and his partner, Jimmy Albright, stumbled away from the Capitol to their patrol car, weaving like drunks from the chemical agents they'd inhaled. At one point Albright fell to his knees and vomited uncontrollably. They kept walking, arms around each other's shoulders.\n\nWhen they were almost there, Fanone said to Albright, \"Dude, my neck hurts so bad.\" He pulled down the collar of his black uniform, and Albright gasped: the back of his neck was covered in pink, splotchy burns.\n\n\"Dude, what happened?\" Albright asked.\n\n\"Dude, they were tasing me,\" Fanone said.\n\nAlbright took a picture with his phone to show Fanone what his own neck looked like.\n\nFanone drifted in and out of consciousness as Albright drove to the emergency room. The security guard at the entrance told them they couldn't go in without masks on. Albright pushed the guard aside, dragging his partner by the shoulders. At the intake counter, as a staffer was asking for his insurance information, Fanone collapsed on the floor.\n\nThe ER was jammed with a motley array of injured cops and rioters and COVID-19 patients. On the stretcher next to Fanone's lay a rioter whose cheeks had been pierced by a rubber bullet at close range: it had gone in one side of his face and out the other. The doctors asked Fanone if he'd ever had heart problems, because his body was flooded with troponin, a chemical indicating cardiac distress. He'd had a heart attack, they told him.\n\nFrom his hospital bed, he watched the news. On CNN, someone was questioning whether the police had used sufficient force to repel the rioters, asking why they hadn't arrested more people on the scene. Outraged, Fanone looked up CNN, called the number that came up on his phone and told the woman who answered that Mike Fanone with the metropolitan police department needed to talk right away to that jerk on the air who was insulting the good name of every police officer.\n\n\"Sir,\" she said, \"this is the front desk.\"\n\nHe burned to set the record straight, and he soon got his chance. A photo went viral in the days after the riot: Fanone in his helmet and tactical vest, face distorted in a furious battle grimace, the lone cop in a sea of rioters, Thin Blue Line flag waving ironically over his head. His ex-wife, the mother of his three youngest daughters, proudly posted his name on social media, and suddenly everyone seemed to have his number.\n\nThe following week, at his urging, the department set up a round of interviews with the Washington Post and major TV networks. Fanone, one of several officers authorized to speak to the press, was the star of every segment. \"They were overthrowing the Capitol, the seat of democracy, and I f-cking went,\" he said, neck tattoos peeking from his collar. He was pugnacious, funny, charismatic, unfiltered. The battle, he quipped, felt like the movie 300, \"except without the six-pack abs, which none of us have.\"\n\nPerhaps most indelibly, Fanone offered his take on the rioters who'd heeded his pleas for mercy. \"A lot of people have asked me my thoughts on the individuals in the crowd that helped me,\" he drawled. \"I think the conclusion I've come to is, like, thank you\"-here he paused and squinted-\"but f-ck you for being there.\"\n\nThe response was overwhelming. Thousands of letters, tens of thousands of emails, poured into the MPD. Men wanted to thank him. Children said they looked up to him. Women swooned. (Fanone turned down a request to pose nude in Playgirl. ) Liberals posted worshipful memes. Joan Baez, the singer and activist, made an oil painting of his face and captioned it: \"Thank you, but f-ck you for being there.\" At a gas station at 5 a.m., an elderly Black woman walked up and said, \"Are you Michael Fanone? Can I hug you?\" and burst into tears as he held her in his arms.\n\nPeople were hungry for heroes, hungry for a sliver of humanity in the ugliness and violence. Here was the brave cop who rushed into danger and put his life on the line for his country. He was embarrassed by the attention, but it also seemed right on some level, like America agreed that what happened at the Capitol was an attack on all of us, like we were coming together to denounce the bad guys and lift up the good.\n\nBut the story was only beginning.\n\nThe House of Representatives initiated impeachment proceedings against Trump for inciting the riot, and the Democratic lawmakers managing the impeachment reached out to Fanone for help putting together their case. He met House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and shocked her with his foul language. On Jan. 13, 10 Republicans joined the Democrats in voting to impeach Trump for a second time. Fanone called each of their offices to thank them.\n\nThe 10 Republicans invited him to meet at the Capitol Hill Club. They hailed his heroism-and told him they feared they'd just ended their political careers. Death threats were pouring in from their pro-Trump constituents. Right-wing activists were lining up to unseat them in primaries. It didn't make sense to Fanone that there were only 10 of them. Hadn't all the members of Congress been there that day? Hadn't they fled the chamber in terror as he and his colleagues held off the mob? The Republicans told him that plenty of their colleagues privately agreed Trump was to blame, Fanone says. But they didn't want to commit political suicide.\n\nRead more : How Trump's Effort to Steal the Election Tore Apart the GOP-and the Country\n\nAt the same time, Fanone had questions about the investigation into the assault he suffered. MPD detective Yari Babich had been assigned to the case, but Fanone learned Babich had posted a bunch of nasty comments on social media about Fanone's media tour-calling him an egomaniac, a celebrity wannabe, unprofessional, a buffoon. Fanone complained to the department but says he was told Babich was entitled to his opinion. (In response to a detailed list of written questions, the MPD declined to comment on this or other aspects of this story. TIME was unable to immediately reach Babich for comment.) He kept complaining, and eventually Babich was taken off the case, according to law-enforcement officials familiar with the matter. But cops gossip like hens, and Fanone knew that if one guy was talking this way he probably wasn't the only one. Fanone had thought that in telling his story he was speaking for all of them, helping them get the recognition they deserved. What if other cops didn't see it that way?\n\nAfter two weeks, the adrenaline that carried him through Jan. 6 and the immediate aftermath started to wear off. His phone stopped ringing. He wanted to go back on TV and respond to the lies Trump and his acolytes were telling, but the department's public-information officer told him the mayor's office was not authorizing any more interviews.\n\nFanone's head hurt constantly. Everything seemed to be rushing at him all the time; he needed to be somewhere quiet. The doctors told him he had PTSD. He'd be going about his day, and suddenly the idea that he would be better off dead would appear in his mind. He didn't know how to shake it. Then it would just as suddenly be gone, until it came back again.\n\nAnger alternated with self-doubt. He kept watching the video footage, but instead of feeling proud, he started picking it apart. The famous photo-what if what people saw on his face was not bravery but fear? How had he let himself get pulled into the crowd, away from the group? Was it his fault? What more could he have done?\n\nIn February, Fanone and a couple of other officers were invited to the Super Bowl. The police chief persuaded him to go on behalf of the department, telling him it would prove that the nation could still rally around law enforcement. The officers were told there would be a ceremony at halftime, Fanone says-a solemn procession of honor and reverence, the sort of thing we do to create heroes in America. But at the last minute, the officers were told to leave their uniforms at home. While the game featured elaborate tributes to health care workers and to racial justice, the cops got only a brief callout from the announcers as they were shown in their box midway through the third quarter. (The NFL denied the officers were promised an on-field ceremony.)\n\nHe was a good cop-one of the best. Fanone was born in the District and raised in Alexandria, Va., his father a lawyer, his mother a social worker. They divorced when he was 8. His dad was a partner at a big firm, but Fanone hated the stuffy status-grubbing of fancy-pants D.C. He spent his free time with his mother's working-class family in rural Maryland, boating, fishing, crabbing, hunting and watching John Wayne movies. \"Michael was a cowboy from the time he was 3 years old,\" says his mother Terry Fanone.\n\nAttempts to smuggle the self-styled backwoods boy into the professional class were unsuccessful. He spent a year at Georgetown Prep, the private school whose alumni include two U.S. Supreme Court Justices, but was asked not to return. When his parents sent him to boarding school in Maine instead, he saved his pocket money and bought a bus ticket back home. After his parents kicked him out, he got a job working construction and eventually completed his high-school diploma at Ballou, a nearly all-Black public school in southeast D.C.\n\nFanone joined the Capitol Police shortly after 9/11, but he knew by the time he finished at the academy that he didn't want to spend his career there. Fanone and his buddy Ramey Kyle would drive down to the projects on their lunch break and chase drug dealers, to management's chagrin. \"We were 21-, 22-year-old adrenaline junkies-we wanted to run and gun,\" Fanone recalls. After a couple of years, he and Kyle both moved to the MPD.\n\nFanone loved the job-the thrill of it, the intensity, the brotherhood of officers. He recalls the rush of pulling up to the projects and watching people scatter. Gradually he honed his skills, working with informants, establishing probable cause, liaising with federal agencies on wiretap cases and big busts. He studied local defense attorneys and relished sparring with them on the witness stand. \"He went from being this wild and crazy, reckless guy-that was his image at the beginning-to thinking things out and planning ahead and being meticulous,\" says Jeff Leslie, who was Fanone's partner for more than a decade. \"Mike is the best narcotics officer I've ever worked with, including FBI and DEA.\"\n\nAt some point in his 30s, Fanone realized there was more to life than the job. His mentor, someone he thought of as a living legend, retired, and there were no parades-the department just carried on without him. Fanone stopped volunteering for overtime and re-established contact with the teenage daughter he barely knew. He got married, had three more daughters, got divorced.\n\nHe wasn't interested in politics-it should be, he thought, like the Olympics, something to gawk at every four years and then put away. But for a white cop who spent his time policing Black neighborhoods, politics became harder and harder to ignore. He hated the way liberal politicians and the media always made police the bad guys. After the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., people seemed to assume every cop was like Darren Wilson, the white officer who shot Brown. Of course there were bad cops, but they weren't all like that. The city council kept making new rules about what they could and couldn't do. He did his best to follow the blitz of reform-minded dictates from above: community outreach, sensitivity training, de-escalation. He took to heart the ideas about better rather than more arrests, he says, only to be penalized for not arresting enough people. Tired of anti-police sentiment and feeling a bit of kinship with the bombastic, abrasive politician, Fanone voted for Trump in 2016.\n\n\"If I didn't speak out against Trump, would people think I was just another evil white cop?\"\n\n\"If I didn't speak out against Trump, would people think I was just another evil white cop?\"\n\nBut with Trump in office, policing in America only became more fraught. Jeff Leslie spent the summer of 2020 working 12-hour days at the George Floyd protests in D.C., standing stoically on the sidelines as white kids from the suburbs spat in his face and called him a racist. The very first day, a brick went through his cruiser window and a Molotov cocktail nearly lit it on fire. \"I said to some of these white guys in antifa gear, 'Look, you're more educated than me, and I do believe you care about Black people,'\" Leslie recalls. \"'Let me take you down to the hood and show you how you can really invest in some young Black lives.'\" The law-abiding citizens of those neighborhoods weren't calling to abolish the police, Leslie says; they told him they wanted more police to clean up their community. None of the protesters ever took him up on his offer.\n\nLeslie was there on Jan. 6. He was in the battle with Fanone and got hit with hammers. But he's suspicious of Fanone's new liberal friends. \"I love the guy, and I'm concerned that all those people are using and manipulating him,\" Leslie says. \"He's always wanted us to be respected and appreciated for what we do, and it's never going to happen. We're never going to get a parade. No one cares. Now all these people want to use him against Trump. But these are still the same people calling us white supremists and saying we should be defunded.\"\n\nFanone shares that worry: \"If I didn't speak out against Trump, would people think I was just another evil white cop?\" What he hoped to make people understand was that he wasn't some exceptional \"good cop\"-he was every cop. The worst kind of cop: the arrogant adrenaline junkie. And the best kind of cop: meticulous, humane, committed. Maybe the liberals who supported him would see they ought to support the others too-the hundreds who answered the call at the Capitol; the thousands who rush into danger every day for the sake of their ungrateful asses.\n\nBecause Fanone was just like every other cop. Unless, after Jan. 6, he wasn't.\n\nAndrew Clyde, a first-term Republican representing Georgia's Ninth district, witnessed more of the Jan. 6 chaos than many of his colleagues. Around the time Fanone was getting tased on the Capitol terrace, as most members of Congress were being whisked to safety, Clyde, a 57-year-old former Navy aviator and gun-shop owner, bravely helped barricade the door to the House chamber as rioters massed outside.\n\nYet Clyde soon became a case study in the GOP's determination to forget. On May 12-the day Fanone broke down at the bar-Clyde insisted in a House hearing that the footage from Jan. 6 resembled a \"normal tourist visit\" more than the coup attempt liberals portrayed.\n\nSomething broke open inside Mike Fanone when he heard Clyde's comments. His courage, his fists, his neck, had kept these guys from being strung up, and now they wanted to pretend it never happened? How could they deny it when it was all right there on video? Fanone couldn't let these cowards keep twisting the facts. The department's press officer had stopped answering his calls. He didn't care. He'd gone rogue.\n\nBut the Republicans weren't the only ones who wanted to put Jan. 6 behind them. A new President had taken over, promising to heal the nation 's wounds, and the public had turned its attention to the future: the pandemic ebbing, Congress passing laws. Fanone wrote a letter to every politician he could think of, demanding to know why the officers who fought that day hadn't been recognized. The White House acknowledged the letter but never got back to him; the mayor's office did not respond. (A spokesman said the White House was still in the process of responding to Fanone's three-month-old letter. The mayor's office noted that the officers were subsequently honored at an employee-appreciation ceremony.)\n\nFanone's new political friends told him not to take it personally. That President Biden was trying to \"lower the temperature\" in the country. That D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser couldn't be seen as too pro-police in the current political climate. He wasn't being slighted, they told him; he was just politically inconvenient.\n\nIn Congress, official honors for police who defended the Capitol were caught up in legislative squabbling. The Senate voted in February to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman, who'd led a mob away from the Senate chamber as Senators evacuated. But the House wanted to give medals to all the officers who were there. Months of back-and-forth ensued.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans feuded over how to investigate Jan. 6. Bipartisan negotiations to establish an independent, 9/11-style commission looked promising until the House and Senate GOP leaders, Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell, torpedoed the talks. In the days after the riot, McCarthy had said Trump bore responsibility for it and McConnell had passionately denounced him. Now they had an upcoming election to worry about.\n\nRead more : The Start of the Jan. 6 Insurrection Inquiry Shows Its Stakes-And Its Shortcoming\n\nOn June 15, the House finally passed legislation awarding gold medals to the Capitol Police and MPD for their valor on Jan. 6. Twenty-one Republicans voted against it, including Clyde. Fanone decided to pay each of them a visit. He and Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, a 6-ft. 7-in. Black man who'd spent Jan. 6 herding rioters on an interior staircase as they hurled racial slurs, went to each of the 21 lawmakers' offices, politely requesting to schedule appointments. But the only one they met that day was Clyde.\n\nFanone spotted him getting into an elevator, and he and Dunn followed Clyde in. \"How are you doing, Congressman?\" Fanone said as the doors closed, putting out his hand.\n\nClyde shrank away. \"You're not going to shake my hand?\" Fanone said.\n\n\"I don't know who you are,\" Clyde said.\n\n\"I apologize,\" Fanone said, and launched, for the umpteenth time, into his practiced spiel. \"My name is Michael Fanone. I'm a D.C. metropolitan police officer who fought on Jan. 6 to defend the Capitol, and as a result I was significantly injured. I sustained a heart attack and a traumatic brain injury after being tased numerous times at the base of my skull, as well as being severely beaten.\"\n\nClyde turned away and started fumbling with his phone. The elevator doors opened, and he bolted. (Clyde later issued a statement acknowledging the elevator encounter but said he did \"not recall [Fanone's] offering to shake hands.\")\n\nFanone called his new friend Eric Swalwell, a Democratic Representative from California, and told him what had just happened.\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" Swalwell asked.\n\n\"Tweet it, motherf-cker!\" said Fanone, who eschews social media.\n\nSwalwell and another friend, Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger, both tweeted about the incident. Fanone went on television and called Clyde a \"coward.\" The story was all over the news. He had fought back against the lies with the force of his truth, and for a moment, he believed he had won.\n\nBut the rot was setting in-the fatigue, the forgetting, the whitewashing. Trump claimed Jan. 6 was not a riot but a \"lovefest,\" that the rioters' interactions with police that day were more like \"hugging and kissing.\" Newsmax did a segment portraying Fanone as a mentally ill anti-Trumper; one of the network's anchors called him a \"crybaby\" and an \"unhinged gangbanger.\" QAnon zealots in private forums whispered that he was a paid actor, not a cop at all. Republican Congressman Paul Gosar called the police shooting of Ashli Babbitt -a rioter who was attempting to force her way into the Speaker's Lobby off the House floor-an \"execution.\" Polls showed that more and more Republicans saw the attack on the Capitol as a display of patriotism.\n\nIn meetings with GOP members of Congress, Fanone asked how they could claim to \"back the blue\" while selling him out. They brought up Black Lives Matter and how they'd had the cops' backs. \"You guys don't seem to have a problem when we're kicking the sh-t out of Black people,\" Fanone recalls saying. \"But when we're kicking the sh-t out of white people, uh-oh, that's an issue.\" He found himself explaining why attempting to overthrow a CVS was slightly different than attempting to overthrow the government. Why the peaceful transfer of power was a bigger deal than a few anarchists in Portland, Ore.\n\nConservative pundits quibbled with the riot's body count, pointing out that Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who died the day after he helped fight off the rioters, had technically passed away of \"natural causes\" after a series of strokes. Fanone had gone to the Capitol to see Sicknick's body lie in honor, buying his only suit for the occasion. He'd gotten to know Sicknick's mother and girlfriend. (All of them, incidentally, were Trump voters.) Is that what they'd be saying if I didn't make it? Fanone wondered. That he'd died of a heart attack? That it wasn't Trump's fault, just \"natural causes\"?\n\nFox News hosts invented other explanations for the violence: antifa provocateurs, FBI infiltrators. Tucker Carlson called Dunn \"an angry left-wing political activist\" who could not \"pretend to speak for the country's law-enforcement community.\" Fanone wanted to go on Fox News to argue but, he says, a booker told him there was a networkwide ban on his appearing. (A Fox News spokesperson denied this.)\n\nMuch as he hated to admit it, Fanone was starting to suspect Carlson had a point. Maybe officers like him and Dunn, who wanted Trump held accountable, were the exception. Watching the body-cam footage again, he noticed how many cops were standing around, kibitzing with the rioters. He thought of his MPD colleagues: out of more than 3,000 on duty, about 850 had responded to the Capitol. What about all the others?\n\nThe vast majority of police officers-would they have been on the other side of those battle lines?\"\n\nWhere was his backup? Where was the police union, which rushed to the defense of any officer criticized by left-wing politicians? The Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), which endorsed Trump in 2016 and 2020, had issued a lukewarm statement on Jan. 6 urging \"everyone involved to reject the use of violence and to obey the orders of law enforcement officers to ensure that these events are brought to a swift and peaceable end.\" Numerous active-duty FOP members have since been charged in connection with the riot. In at least one case, the union is trying to keep an accused rioter from being fired by his department.\n\nThere was an FOP meeting on July 14, and Fanone and Dunn decided to attend. Fanone arrived with specific demands. He wanted a public condemnation of the 21 Republican lawmakers who'd voted against the gold medals. He wanted Clyde and Gosar condemned specifically, and he wanted the officer who shot Babbitt defended as forcefully as the FOP had defended officers who shot Black citizens in the past. Fanone addressed the FOP's national president, Patrick Yoes, an ardent Trump supporter. \"You are doing a disservice to your membership by not speaking the truth of that day,\" Fanone said. \"You have an opportunity to educate Americans-not just police officers but Americans-about what actually happened, and you're not doing it.\"\n\nYoes bristled. He told Fanone the only thing he could offer was access to the FOP's free wellness program. (In an interview, Yoes said the FOP hopes to work with Fanone and his local union to resolve his complaints. \"I see his struggles, I see he is dealing with a lot, and he may have some misconceptions about it,\" Yoes says, \"but I assure you we have been there for him and will continue to be.\")\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the D.C. lodge voted to endorse Yoes for another term as union president.\n\nHealed from his physical injuries but still on mental-health leave, Fanone now spends most days alone. He goes to the gym, takes care of his daughters part time, fields media calls. He probably can't go back to undercover work, and he wonders if he'd be safe going back on the job at all. Colleagues he's known for decades don't talk to him anymore. Guys who never called to check in when he was in the hospital send him taunting memes about his liberal-darling status.\n\n\"I had convinced myself, Mike, you're vocalizing the opinions of thousands and thousands of police officers. But I'm starting to think I'm vocalizing the beliefs of just one,\" Fanone says one day over lunch, as his three young daughters dig into their chicken tenders. \"While there are still some officers that are very supportive of me, I can count them on one hand. The vast majority of police officers-would they have been on the other side of those battle lines?\"\n\nHis mission to defend his colleagues' actions had morphed into something bigger and more daunting. What he had to do, he concluded, was not just to speak up on behalf of law enforcement. He needed to shake his fellow Americans out of their Trump-induced delusions, debunk the lies that had poisoned his friends' minds. He needed to root out the hatred that led to Trump in the first place.\n\n\"The greatest trick in history was Donald Trump convincing redneck Americans that he somehow speaks for them,\" says Fanone, who includes himself in that category. \"He will destroy this country simply for the sake of his ego, just because he can't accept that he lost an election.\"\n\nIn late July, Fanone was one of four officers who testified at the first hearing of the House committee investigating Jan. 6, a proceeding that just two Republicans took part in. \"The indifference shown to my colleagues is disgraceful,\" he cried, pounding the table. A Fox News anchor joked that he should get an Oscar for acting. His voice mail filled with threats and mockery. \"I wish they would have killed all you scumbags,\" one caller said. Others threatened to rape and kill his mother and daughters. Trump reportedly called Fanone and the other officers \"pussies.\" Two days after the hearing, another cop Fanone knew who'd been there on Jan. 6 died by suicide-the fourth to take his own life since the riot.\n\nFor most Americans, Jan. 6 keeps getting further away. For Fanone, it's still the only thing-the day his life stopped. And yet, as awful as it was, he's grateful for it. \"That's, like, difficult to come to terms with. What if I had not gone through that?\" he says. \"I'd be the same dumbass that I was on Jan. 5. Not evil in my motivations. But ignorant to the truth.\"\n\nAnd so he keeps telling his story-the story of what really happened that day.\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, Mike Fanone woke up early, as usual, and went to the gym. He'd been living with his mom since a breakup left him with an apartment he couldn't afford, working a second job at a security consultancy, saving for a down payment on a house for him and the girls-Piper, 9; Mei-Mei, 7; and Hensley, 5. Terry went to her prayer group, and when she came back she told her son she'd had a funny feeling and said an extra prayer for him.\n\nFanone's shift was scheduled to start at 2:30 p.m. His plan for the day involved a heroin buy at the James Creek public housing project in southwest D.C. The buyer would be a longtime informant whom Fanone considered a friend, a 68-year-old Black transgender woman named Leslie. (Leslie, who suffered from cancer, AIDS and various addictions, has since died, which Fanone learned because he was listed as her emergency contact.) But shortly after noon, seeing what was happening in the news, he called off the buy and drove to the station instead.\n\nThings were getting hairy. He had just hit the 14th St. Bridge when he heard the commander on the scene say on the radio that the department had run out of chemical munitions such as tear gas and pepper spray-not just what it had on hand at the Capitol but the whole department's supply. In all his years on the job, that had never happened. A call went out requesting aid from surrounding jurisdictions.\n\nAt the station he met Albright, who was changing into his uniform. \"What do you want to do?\" Albright said.\n\n\"We're going to go,\" Fanone said. \"Get us a vehicle.\" He went to his locker and took out the uniform he'd never worn before, still in its plastic wrapping. He grabbed a tactical vest, a radio, a body camera, a helmet and a gas mask.\n\nIn the parking lot, a sergeant was tossing car keys to anyone volunteering to go to the Capitol. They parked a couple of blocks away. Fanone couldn't figure out how to attach the gas mask to his vest, so they both left their masks in the car. It was eerily quiet as they approached the building on foot, passing abandoned police cars and barricades. Albright pointed out a trail of blood on the ground.\n\nThey went in the south entrance and made their way to the columned chamber known as the Crypt, lined with historic statues and a replica of the Magna Carta. A couple of dozen trespassers were milling about. As the partners tried to figure out where to go, a 10-33 call-officer in distress-came over the radio from the west front of the Capitol. They went.\n\nWhat if I had not gone through that? I'd be the same dumbass that I was on Jan. 5. Not evil in my motivations. But ignorant to the truth.\"\n\nSome rioters had gone around and trickled in through other windows and doors, but it was this entrance, facing the White House, where most of the mob was trying to force its way in. Fanone and Albright came upon a narrow, stone-walled tunnel choked with clouds of gas. A commander in a gray coat was hunched over, retching, trying to wipe the tear gas from his face. Fanone saw that it was his friend Ramey Kyle. A dull roar was getting louder as they approached. \"Hold the line!\" Kyle shouted over the din.\n\nFanone and Albright went into the tunnel. The floor was slick with vomit. About 30 officers were pressed against a pair of brass-bordered double doorjambs, four or five abreast, several rows deep. The ones in front strained to push the crowd far enough from the doors to yank them closed, trying to lock their plexiglass riot shields together. But the rioters had managed to tear some of the shields away and were beating the cops with them.\n\nFrom the back, Fanone and Albright could see the officers were ragged: injured, bleeding, blinded, fatigued. Some had been there for hours. They could also see that if the line broke, they would be trampled in the narrow tunnel, and the rioters would overrun the building. This was the last line of defense.\n\n\"Let's get some fresh guys up front!\" Fanone yelled. \"Who needs a break?\" Some officers pointed at colleagues they thought needed relief, but nobody volunteered to come off the line.\n\nWhat makes a hero? Is it bravery? Is it sacrifice? Or is it the man who refuses to let us forget?\n\n\"C'mon, MPD, dig in!\" Fanone yelled, bracing his hands against the other officers' backs. \"Push! Push 'em the f-ck out!\"\n\nHe and Albright got to the front. It was only then that they looked out on the sea of people for the first time and saw what they were up against. The rioters were coordinating efforts, yelling \"Heave! Ho!\" and lunging in rhythm.\n\nAn officer yelled, \"Knife!\" and Albright turned to his left, away from Fanone, to grab the weapon. When he turned back Fanone was gone.\n\nHe was out in the crowd, surrounded by rioters. They dragged him face first down the stairs and punched and kicked and beat him. They ripped off his badge and took his radio. One kept lunging for his weapon. Someone was yelling: \"Kill him with his own gun!\" Fanone felt an excruciating pain at the base of his skull-the taser-and cried out, but he couldn't hear himself scream. The rioters seemed intent on torturing him. He thought about pulling his gun. He would be justified in defending himself, but then what? He thought of his daughters. He didn't want to die. \"I've got kids!\" he cried.\n\nA couple of rioters surrounded him, fighting off others. \"Bring him up, bring him up,\" one said. \"Don't hurt him,\" said another. \"Which way do you want to go?\"\n\n\"I want to go back inside,\" he whimpered, and that's the last thing he remembers. The rioters lofted his limp, unconscious body to the doorway-the battle line. Albright grabbed him and pulled him back through the phalanx.\n\nOne of the officers carrying Fanone back into the hallway shouted, \"I need a medic! Need an EMT, now!\" Albright followed, crazed with fear. \"I got it. It's my partner!\" he yelled. \"Mike, stay in there, buddy. Mike, it's Jimmy. I'm here.\"\n\nWhat does Mike Fanone deserve? A parade? A key to the city? A White House ceremony? He's not asking for any of that. He's not asking to be called a hero-he just wants us to remember what his sacrifice was for. Fanone believes we can't keep trying to outrun this thing; we've got to turn around and face it, defeat it once and for all. That if all we do is turn away and hope it fades, it will just keep getting stronger until it comes back to kill us all.\n\nFanone has gotten none of those traditional heroes' honors. None of the officers have. But perhaps that's normal. Perhaps we always fail our heroes: the veterans who sleep in the street, the whistle-blowers languishing in penury. Perhaps all the medals and ceremonies are our constant, insufficient attempt to atone. But we can never be grateful enough. For our comfort, for our safety, for our freedom.\n\nThey laid him down on a luggage cart-there were no more stretchers, no more ambulances. \"Take his f-cking vest off, man. He's having trouble breathing,\" Albright said frantically. He took Fanone's gun so that he wouldn't come to and instinctively reach for it, thinking he was still out in the crowd.\n\n\"C'mon, Mike,\" Albright pleaded. \"C'mon, buddy, we're going duck hunting soon.\"\n\n\"Fanone, Fanone,\" another officer said. \"You all right, brother?\"\n\nThe world swam blurrily back into view.\n\n\"Did we take that door back?\" Fanone asked.\n\nThey took back the door. They defended the Capitol. That is the story Mike Fanone won't let us forget.\n\n-With reporting by Vera Bergengruen, Mariah Espada, Nik Popli and Simmone Shah\n\nWrite to Molly Ball at molly.ball@time.com"

      "text": "What Mike Fanone Can't Forget\n\nI t wasn't a cop bar; that was the point. They weren't there to meet other cops. They were there to meet girls. The three police officers took seats at the wine bar in D.C.'s trendy Navy Yard neighborhood-exposed concrete walls, leather banquettes, $13 tuna tartare-and despite its being a wine bar, despite the Wednesday night half-price-wine special, they ordered beers.\n\nMay 12, 2021, was a balmy night, and dozens of newly vaccinated young urbanites mingled out on the patio. At 10 p.m., the cops asked the bartender to put CNN on the TV.\n\n\"A true American hero, officer Michael Fanone,\" intoned the host, Don Lemon. \"This is difficult to watch. But it is the truth of what happened that day. The truth-not the lies that you've been hearing.\" The screen filled with Fanone's body-camera footage from the Jan. 6 insurrection , airing publicly for the first time. \"Officer Fanone is outside on the Capitol steps on the lower west terrace,\" Lemon said. \"This is approximately 3:15 on that day.\"\n\nMike Fanone-wiry, bearded, his arms and neck covered in tattoos-nursed a Modelo at the bar and took it all in again. It had been four months since the day Fanone nearly died defending the Capitol-the day a self-described redneck cop who voted for Donald Trump was beaten unconscious by a mob waving Thin Blue Line flags and chanting \"U.S.A.\" The day Fanone, a narcotics officer with the D.C. metropolitan police department (MPD) who'd planned to spend his evening shift buying heroin undercover, voluntarily rushed to defend the seat of American democracy and wound up in hand-to-hand combat with a horde hellbent on unstealing the election. The day Fanone was dragged down the Capitol's marble stairs, beaten with pipes and poles, tear-gassed and stun-gunned. The day he pleaded for his life as they threatened to shoot him with his own gun, telling the rioters he had kids, until they relented and spared him.\n\nOn the TV at the bar, Fanone's hand strained to push them away. The crush parted, and the full scene came into view: the grand terrace, the teeming crowd. Bodies upon bodies as far as the eye could see. Red hats and camo, Trump flags and American flags , all pressing forward, trying to break the cops' tenuous hold on the central door into the building. There is a thin blue line between order and chaos, and at that moment, Mike Fanone was it.\n\nGet a print of TIME's Cover Portrait of Mike Fanone here\n\nThe footage showed Fanone getting pulled out into the scrum. A man's voice: \"I got one!\" Then Fanone began to scream the high-pitched, undignified screams of a man being tased in the back of the neck.\n\nThe bar fell silent as the body-cam footage played. And suddenly, for the first time since that day, Fanone was sobbing uncontrollably, shoulders heaving as his buddies put their arms around him.\n\nFanone-40, nearly broke, living with his mother, seeing ghosts, unable to return to duty in the only job he'd ever loved, possibly forever-had seen the footage a hundred times. But this was the first time he'd viewed it with other people, watched them witness what he lived through, see it through his eyes, feel his aggression, his valor, his abject terror. He sat there crying for a good 20 minutes. At some point he looked up and realized he was surrounded: everyone in the bar had come inside from the patio and gathered around him, watching the footage on the screen.\n\nThe months since Jan. 6 had not been easy for Fanone. Still recuperating from life-threatening injuries and posttraumatic stress disorder, he'd found himself increasingly isolated. Republicans didn't want him to exist, and Democrats weren't in the mood for hero cops. Even many of his colleagues didn't see why he couldn't just get over it. That very day, a GOP Congressman had testified that what had happened was more like a \"tourist visit\" than an \"insurrection.\" But no one could see this footage, Fanone thought, and deny what really happened that day. History would be forced to record it.\n\nThis is the story of what happened after Jan. 6. This is Mike Fanone's story, recounted over weeks of searching conversations and corroborated by witnesses, public records and videotape. It is a story about what we agree to remember and what we choose to forget, about how history is not lived but manufactured after the fact. In the aftermath of a national tragedy, we are supposed to come together and say \"never forget,\" to agree on the heroes and the villains, on who was at fault and how their culpability must be avenged. But what happens if we can't agree? What if we're too busy arguing to face what really happened?\n\n\"There's people on both sides of the political aisle that are like, 'Listen, Jan. 6 happened, it was bad, we need to move on as a country,'\" Fanone tells me one recent afternoon on the well-kept back patio of his mother's house, between long swigs from a beer can. It's in a quiet exurban Virginia neighborhood, ranch houses alternating with McMansions, American flags flying over big green yards. \"What an arrogant f-cking thing for someone to say that wasn't there that day,\" he says. \"What needs to happen is there needs to be a reckoning.\"\n\nWhat makes a hero? Is it bravery, charging into danger to protect others? Is it sacrifice, the damage sustained in the process? Or is it the man who refuses to let us forget?\n\nAfter Fanone regained consciousness that day, he and his partner, Jimmy Albright, stumbled away from the Capitol to their patrol car, weaving like drunks from the chemical agents they'd inhaled. At one point Albright fell to his knees and vomited uncontrollably. They kept walking, arms around each other's shoulders.\n\nWhen they were almost there, Fanone said to Albright, \"Dude, my neck hurts so bad.\" He pulled down the collar of his black uniform, and Albright gasped: the back of his neck was covered in pink, splotchy burns.\n\n\"Dude, what happened?\" Albright asked.\n\n\"Dude, they were tasing me,\" Fanone said.\n\nAlbright took a picture with his phone to show Fanone what his own neck looked like.\n\nFanone drifted in and out of consciousness as Albright drove to the emergency room. The security guard at the entrance told them they couldn't go in without masks on. Albright pushed the guard aside, dragging his partner by the shoulders. At the intake counter, as a staffer was asking for his insurance information, Fanone collapsed on the floor.\n\nThe ER was jammed with a motley array of injured cops and rioters and COVID-19 patients. On the stretcher next to Fanone's lay a rioter whose cheeks had been pierced by a rubber bullet at close range: it had gone in one side of his face and out the other. The doctors asked Fanone if he'd ever had heart problems, because his body was flooded with troponin, a chemical indicating cardiac distress. He'd had a heart attack, they told him.\n\nFrom his hospital bed, he watched the news. On CNN, someone was questioning whether the police had used sufficient force to repel the rioters, asking why they hadn't arrested more people on the scene. Outraged, Fanone looked up CNN, called the number that came up on his phone and told the woman who answered that Mike Fanone with the metropolitan police department needed to talk right away to that jerk on the air who was insulting the good name of every police officer.\n\n\"Sir,\" she said, \"this is the front desk.\"\n\nHe burned to set the record straight, and he soon got his chance. A photo went viral in the days after the riot: Fanone in his helmet and tactical vest, face distorted in a furious battle grimace, the lone cop in a sea of rioters, Thin Blue Line flag waving ironically over his head. His ex-wife, the mother of his three youngest daughters, proudly posted his name on social media, and suddenly everyone seemed to have his number.\n\nThe following week, at his urging, the department set up a round of interviews with the Washington Post and major TV networks. Fanone, one of several officers authorized to speak to the press, was the star of every segment. \"They were overthrowing the Capitol, the seat of democracy, and I f-cking went,\" he said, neck tattoos peeking from his collar. He was pugnacious, funny, charismatic, unfiltered. The battle, he quipped, felt like the movie 300, \"except without the six-pack abs, which none of us have.\"\n\nPerhaps most indelibly, Fanone offered his take on the rioters who'd heeded his pleas for mercy. \"A lot of people have asked me my thoughts on the individuals in the crowd that helped me,\" he drawled. \"I think the conclusion I've come to is, like, thank you\"-here he paused and squinted-\"but f-ck you for being there.\"\n\nThe response was overwhelming. Thousands of letters, tens of thousands of emails, poured into the MPD. Men wanted to thank him. Children said they looked up to him. Women swooned. (Fanone turned down a request to pose nude in Playgirl. ) Liberals posted worshipful memes. Joan Baez, the singer and activist, made an oil painting of his face and captioned it: \"Thank you, but f-ck you for being there.\" At a gas station at 5 a.m., an elderly Black woman walked up and said, \"Are you Michael Fanone? Can I hug you?\" and burst into tears as he held her in his arms.\n\nPeople were hungry for heroes, hungry for a sliver of humanity in the ugliness and violence. Here was the brave cop who rushed into danger and put his life on the line for his country. He was embarrassed by the attention, but it also seemed right on some level, like America agreed that what happened at the Capitol was an attack on all of us, like we were coming together to denounce the bad guys and lift up the good.\n\nBut the story was only beginning.\n\nThe House of Representatives initiated impeachment proceedings against Trump for inciting the riot, and the Democratic lawmakers managing the impeachment reached out to Fanone for help putting together their case. He met House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and shocked her with his foul language. On Jan. 13, 10 Republicans joined the Democrats in voting to impeach Trump for a second time. Fanone called each of their offices to thank them.\n\nThe 10 Republicans invited him to meet at the Capitol Hill Club. They hailed his heroism-and told him they feared they'd just ended their political careers. Death threats were pouring in from their pro-Trump constituents. Right-wing activists were lining up to unseat them in primaries. It didn't make sense to Fanone that there were only 10 of them. Hadn't all the members of Congress been there that day? Hadn't they fled the chamber in terror as he and his colleagues held off the mob? The Republicans told him that plenty of their colleagues privately agreed Trump was to blame, Fanone says. But they didn't want to commit political suicide.\n\nRead more : How Trump's Effort to Steal the Election Tore Apart the GOP-and the Country\n\nAt the same time, Fanone had questions about the investigation into the assault he suffered. MPD detective Yari Babich had been assigned to the case, but Fanone learned Babich had posted a bunch of nasty comments on social media about Fanone's media tour-calling him an egomaniac, a celebrity wannabe, unprofessional, a buffoon. Fanone complained to the department but says he was told Babich was entitled to his opinion. (In response to a detailed list of written questions, the MPD declined to comment on this or other aspects of this story. TIME was unable to immediately reach Babich for comment.) He kept complaining, and eventually Babich was taken off the case, according to law-enforcement officials familiar with the matter. But cops gossip like hens, and Fanone knew that if one guy was talking this way he probably wasn't the only one. Fanone had thought that in telling his story he was speaking for all of them, helping them get the recognition they deserved. What if other cops didn't see it that way?\n\nAfter two weeks, the adrenaline that carried him through Jan. 6 and the immediate aftermath started to wear off. His phone stopped ringing. He wanted to go back on TV and respond to the lies Trump and his acolytes were telling, but the department's public-information officer told him the mayor's office was not authorizing any more interviews.\n\nFanone's head hurt constantly. Everything seemed to be rushing at him all the time; he needed to be somewhere quiet. The doctors told him he had PTSD. He'd be going about his day, and suddenly the idea that he would be better off dead would appear in his mind. He didn't know how to shake it. Then it would just as suddenly be gone, until it came back again.\n\nAnger alternated with self-doubt. He kept watching the video footage, but instead of feeling proud, he started picking it apart. The famous photo-what if what people saw on his face was not bravery but fear? How had he let himself get pulled into the crowd, away from the group? Was it his fault? What more could he have done?\n\nIn February, Fanone and a couple of other officers were invited to the Super Bowl. The police chief persuaded him to go on behalf of the department, telling him it would prove that the nation could still rally around law enforcement. The officers were told there would be a ceremony at halftime, Fanone says-a solemn procession of honor and reverence, the sort of thing we do to create heroes in America. But at the last minute, the officers were told to leave their uniforms at home. While the game featured elaborate tributes to health care workers and to racial justice, the cops got only a brief callout from the announcers as they were shown in their box midway through the third quarter. (The NFL denied the officers were promised an on-field ceremony.)\n\nHe was a good cop-one of the best. Fanone was born in the District and raised in Alexandria, Va., his father a lawyer, his mother a social worker. They divorced when he was 8. His dad was a partner at a big firm, but Fanone hated the stuffy status-grubbing of fancy-pants D.C. He spent his free time with his mother's working-class family in rural Maryland, boating, fishing, crabbing, hunting and watching John Wayne movies. \"Michael was a cowboy from the time he was 3 years old,\" says his mother Terry Fanone.\n\nAttempts to smuggle the self-styled backwoods boy into the professional class were unsuccessful. He spent a year at Georgetown Prep, the private school whose alumni include two U.S. Supreme Court Justices, but was asked not to return. When his parents sent him to boarding school in Maine instead, he saved his pocket money and bought a bus ticket back home. After his parents kicked him out, he got a job working construction and eventually completed his high-school diploma at Ballou, a nearly all-Black public school in southeast D.C.\n\nFanone joined the Capitol Police shortly after 9/11, but he knew by the time he finished at the academy that he didn't want to spend his career there. Fanone and his buddy Ramey Kyle would drive down to the projects on their lunch break and chase drug dealers, to management's chagrin. \"We were 21-, 22-year-old adrenaline junkies-we wanted to run and gun,\" Fanone recalls. After a couple of years, he and Kyle both moved to the MPD.\n\nFanone loved the job-the thrill of it, the intensity, the brotherhood of officers. He recalls the rush of pulling up to the projects and watching people scatter. Gradually he honed his skills, working with informants, establishing probable cause, liaising with federal agencies on wiretap cases and big busts. He studied local defense attorneys and relished sparring with them on the witness stand. \"He went from being this wild and crazy, reckless guy-that was his image at the beginning-to thinking things out and planning ahead and being meticulous,\" says Jeff Leslie, who was Fanone's partner for more than a decade. \"Mike is the best narcotics officer I've ever worked with, including FBI and DEA.\"\n\nAt some point in his 30s, Fanone realized there was more to life than the job. His mentor, someone he thought of as a living legend, retired, and there were no parades-the department just carried on without him. Fanone stopped volunteering for overtime and re-established contact with the teenage daughter he barely knew. He got married, had three more daughters, got divorced.\n\nHe wasn't interested in politics-it should be, he thought, like the Olympics, something to gawk at every four years and then put away. But for a white cop who spent his time policing Black neighborhoods, politics became harder and harder to ignore. He hated the way liberal politicians and the media always made police the bad guys. After the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., people seemed to assume every cop was like Darren Wilson, the white officer who shot Brown. Of course there were bad cops, but they weren't all like that. The city council kept making new rules about what they could and couldn't do. He did his best to follow the blitz of reform-minded dictates from above: community outreach, sensitivity training, de-escalation. He took to heart the ideas about better rather than more arrests, he says, only to be penalized for not arresting enough people. Tired of anti-police sentiment and feeling a bit of kinship with the bombastic, abrasive politician, Fanone voted for Trump in 2016.\n\n\"If I didn't speak out against Trump, would people think I was just another evil white cop?\"\n\n\"If I didn't speak out against Trump, would people think I was just another evil white cop?\"\n\nBut with Trump in office, policing in America only became more fraught. Jeff Leslie spent the summer of 2020 working 12-hour days at the George Floyd protests in D.C., standing stoically on the sidelines as white kids from the suburbs spat in his face and called him a racist. The very first day, a brick went through his cruiser window and a Molotov cocktail nearly lit it on fire. \"I said to some of these white guys in antifa gear, 'Look, you're more educated than me, and I do believe you care about Black people,'\" Leslie recalls. \"'Let me take you down to the hood and show you how you can really invest in some young Black lives.'\" The law-abiding citizens of those neighborhoods weren't calling to abolish the police, Leslie says; they told him they wanted more police to clean up their community. None of the protesters ever took him up on his offer.\n\nLeslie was there on Jan. 6. He was in the battle with Fanone and got hit with hammers. But he's suspicious of Fanone's new liberal friends. \"I love the guy, and I'm concerned that all those people are using and manipulating him,\" Leslie says. \"He's always wanted us to be respected and appreciated for what we do, and it's never going to happen. We're never going to get a parade. No one cares. Now all these people want to use him against Trump. But these are still the same people calling us white supremists and saying we should be defunded.\"\n\nFanone shares that worry: \"If I didn't speak out against Trump, would people think I was just another evil white cop?\" What he hoped to make people understand was that he wasn't some exceptional \"good cop\"-he was every cop. The worst kind of cop: the arrogant adrenaline junkie. And the best kind of cop: meticulous, humane, committed. Maybe the liberals who supported him would see they ought to support the others too-the hundreds who answered the call at the Capitol; the thousands who rush into danger every day for the sake of their ungrateful asses.\n\nBecause Fanone was just like every other cop. Unless, after Jan. 6, he wasn't.\n\nAndrew Clyde, a first-term Republican representing Georgia's Ninth district, witnessed more of the Jan. 6 chaos than many of his colleagues. Around the time Fanone was getting tased on the Capitol terrace, as most members of Congress were being whisked to safety, Clyde, a 57-year-old former Navy aviator and gun-shop owner, bravely helped barricade the door to the House chamber as rioters massed outside.\n\nYet Clyde soon became a case study in the GOP's determination to forget. On May 12-the day Fanone broke down at the bar-Clyde insisted in a House hearing that the footage from Jan. 6 resembled a \"normal tourist visit\" more than the coup attempt liberals portrayed.\n\nSomething broke open inside Mike Fanone when he heard Clyde's comments. His courage, his fists, his neck, had kept these guys from being strung up, and now they wanted to pretend it never happened? How could they deny it when it was all right there on video? Fanone couldn't let these cowards keep twisting the facts. The department's press officer had stopped answering his calls. He didn't care. He'd gone rogue.\n\nBut the Republicans weren't the only ones who wanted to put Jan. 6 behind them. A new President had taken over, promising to heal the nation 's wounds, and the public had turned its attention to the future: the pandemic ebbing, Congress passing laws. Fanone wrote a letter to every politician he could think of, demanding to know why the officers who fought that day hadn't been recognized. The White House acknowledged the letter but never got back to him; the mayor's office did not respond. (A spokesman said the White House was still in the process of responding to Fanone's three-month-old letter. The mayor's office noted that the officers were subsequently honored at an employee-appreciation ceremony.)\n\nFanone's new political friends told him not to take it personally. That President Biden was trying to \"lower the temperature\" in the country. That D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser couldn't be seen as too pro-police in the current political climate. He wasn't being slighted, they told him; he was just politically inconvenient.\n\nIn Congress, official honors for police who defended the Capitol were caught up in legislative squabbling. The Senate voted in February to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman, who'd led a mob away from the Senate chamber as Senators evacuated. But the House wanted to give medals to all the officers who were there. Months of back-and-forth ensued.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans feuded over how to investigate Jan. 6. Bipartisan negotiations to establish an independent, 9/11-style commission looked promising until the House and Senate GOP leaders, Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell, torpedoed the talks. In the days after the riot, McCarthy had said Trump bore responsibility for it and McConnell had passionately denounced him. Now they had an upcoming election to worry about.\n\nRead more : The Start of the Jan. 6 Insurrection Inquiry Shows Its Stakes-And Its Shortcoming\n\nOn June 15, the House finally passed legislation awarding gold medals to the Capitol Police and MPD for their valor on Jan. 6. Twenty-one Republicans voted against it, including Clyde. Fanone decided to pay each of them a visit. He and Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, a 6-ft. 7-in. Black man who'd spent Jan. 6 herding rioters on an interior staircase as they hurled racial slurs, went to each of the 21 lawmakers' offices, politely requesting to schedule appointments. But the only one they met that day was Clyde.\n\nFanone spotted him getting into an elevator, and he and Dunn followed Clyde in. \"How are you doing, Congressman?\" Fanone said as the doors closed, putting out his hand.\n\nClyde shrank away. \"You're not going to shake my hand?\" Fanone said.\n\n\"I don't know who you are,\" Clyde said.\n\n\"I apologize,\" Fanone said, and launched, for the umpteenth time, into his practiced spiel. \"My name is Michael Fanone. I'm a D.C. metropolitan police officer who fought on Jan. 6 to defend the Capitol, and as a result I was significantly injured. I sustained a heart attack and a traumatic brain injury after being tased numerous times at the base of my skull, as well as being severely beaten.\"\n\nClyde turned away and started fumbling with his phone. The elevator doors opened, and he bolted. (Clyde later issued a statement acknowledging the elevator encounter but said he did \"not recall [Fanone's] offering to shake hands.\")\n\nFanone called his new friend Eric Swalwell, a Democratic Representative from California, and told him what had just happened.\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" Swalwell asked.\n\n\"Tweet it, motherf-cker!\" said Fanone, who eschews social media.\n\nSwalwell and another friend, Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger, both tweeted about the incident. Fanone went on television and called Clyde a \"coward.\" The story was all over the news. He had fought back against the lies with the force of his truth, and for a moment, he believed he had won.\n\nBut the rot was setting in-the fatigue, the forgetting, the whitewashing. Trump claimed Jan. 6 was not a riot but a \"lovefest,\" that the rioters' interactions with police that day were more like \"hugging and kissing.\" Newsmax did a segment portraying Fanone as a mentally ill anti-Trumper; one of the network's anchors called him a \"crybaby\" and an \"unhinged gangbanger.\" QAnon zealots in private forums whispered that he was a paid actor, not a cop at all. Republican Congressman Paul Gosar called the police shooting of Ashli Babbitt -a rioter who was attempting to force her way into the Speaker's Lobby off the House floor-an \"execution.\" Polls showed that more and more Republicans saw the attack on the Capitol as a display of patriotism.\n\nIn meetings with GOP members of Congress, Fanone asked how they could claim to \"back the blue\" while selling him out. They brought up Black Lives Matter and how they'd had the cops' backs. \"You guys don't seem to have a problem when we're kicking the sh-t out of Black people,\" Fanone recalls saying. \"But when we're kicking the sh-t out of white people, uh-oh, that's an issue.\" He found himself explaining why attempting to overthrow a CVS was slightly different than attempting to overthrow the government. Why the peaceful transfer of power was a bigger deal than a few anarchists in Portland, Ore.\n\nConservative pundits quibbled with the riot's body count, pointing out that Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who died the day after he helped fight off the rioters, had technically passed away of \"natural causes\" after a series of strokes. Fanone had gone to the Capitol to see Sicknick's body lie in honor, buying his only suit for the occasion. He'd gotten to know Sicknick's mother and girlfriend. (All of them, incidentally, were Trump voters.) Is that what they'd be saying if I didn't make it? Fanone wondered. That he'd died of a heart attack? That it wasn't Trump's fault, just \"natural causes\"?\n\nFox News hosts invented other explanations for the violence: antifa provocateurs, FBI infiltrators. Tucker Carlson called Dunn \"an angry left-wing political activist\" who could not \"pretend to speak for the country's law-enforcement community.\" Fanone wanted to go on Fox News to argue but, he says, a booker told him there was a networkwide ban on his appearing. (A Fox News spokesperson denied this.)\n\nMuch as he hated to admit it, Fanone was starting to suspect Carlson had a point. Maybe officers like him and Dunn, who wanted Trump held accountable, were the exception. Watching the body-cam footage again, he noticed how many cops were standing around, kibitzing with the rioters. He thought of his MPD colleagues: out of more than 3,000 on duty, about 850 had responded to the Capitol. What about all the others?\n\nThe vast majority of police officers-would they have been on the other side of those battle lines?\"\n\nWhere was his backup? Where was the police union, which rushed to the defense of any officer criticized by left-wing politicians? The Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), which endorsed Trump in 2016 and 2020, had issued a lukewarm statement on Jan. 6 urging \"everyone involved to reject the use of violence and to obey the orders of law enforcement officers to ensure that these events are brought to a swift and peaceable end.\" Numerous active-duty FOP members have since been charged in connection with the riot. In at least one case, the union is trying to keep an accused rioter from being fired by his department.\n\nThere was an FOP meeting on July 14, and Fanone and Dunn decided to attend. Fanone arrived with specific demands. He wanted a public condemnation of the 21 Republican lawmakers who'd voted against the gold medals. He wanted Clyde and Gosar condemned specifically, and he wanted the officer who shot Babbitt defended as forcefully as the FOP had defended officers who shot Black citizens in the past. Fanone addressed the FOP's national president, Patrick Yoes, an ardent Trump supporter. \"You are doing a disservice to your membership by not speaking the truth of that day,\" Fanone said. \"You have an opportunity to educate Americans-not just police officers but Americans-about what actually happened, and you're not doing it.\"\n\nYoes bristled. He told Fanone the only thing he could offer was access to the FOP's free wellness program. (In an interview, Yoes said the FOP hopes to work with Fanone and his local union to resolve his complaints. \"I see his struggles, I see he is dealing with a lot, and he may have some misconceptions about it,\" Yoes says, \"but I assure you we have been there for him and will continue to be.\")\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the D.C. lodge voted to endorse Yoes for another term as union president.\n\nHealed from his physical injuries but still on mental-health leave, Fanone now spends most days alone. He goes to the gym, takes care of his daughters part time, fields media calls. He probably can't go back to undercover work, and he wonders if he'd be safe going back on the job at all. Colleagues he's known for decades don't talk to him anymore. Guys who never called to check in when he was in the hospital send him taunting memes about his liberal-darling status.\n\n\"I had convinced myself, Mike, you're vocalizing the opinions of thousands and thousands of police officers. But I'm starting to think I'm vocalizing the beliefs of just one,\" Fanone says one day over lunch, as his three young daughters dig into their chicken tenders. \"While there are still some officers that are very supportive of me, I can count them on one hand. The vast majority of police officers-would they have been on the other side of those battle lines?\"\n\nHis mission to defend his colleagues' actions had morphed into something bigger and more daunting. What he had to do, he concluded, was not just to speak up on behalf of law enforcement. He needed to shake his fellow Americans out of their Trump-induced delusions, debunk the lies that had poisoned his friends' minds. He needed to root out the hatred that led to Trump in the first place.\n\n\"The greatest trick in history was Donald Trump convincing redneck Americans that he somehow speaks for them,\" says Fanone, who includes himself in that category. \"He will destroy this country simply for the sake of his ego, just because he can't accept that he lost an election.\"\n\nIn late July, Fanone was one of four officers who testified at the first hearing of the House committee investigating Jan. 6, a proceeding that just two Republicans took part in. \"The indifference shown to my colleagues is disgraceful,\" he cried, pounding the table. A Fox News anchor joked that he should get an Oscar for acting. His voice mail filled with threats and mockery. \"I wish they would have killed all you scumbags,\" one caller said. Others threatened to rape and kill his mother and daughters. Trump reportedly called Fanone and the other officers \"pussies.\" Two days after the hearing, another cop Fanone knew who'd been there on Jan. 6 died by suicide-the fourth to take his own life since the riot.\n\nFor most Americans, Jan. 6 keeps getting further away. For Fanone, it's still the only thing-the day his life stopped. And yet, as awful as it was, he's grateful for it. \"That's, like, difficult to come to terms with. What if I had not gone through that?\" he says. \"I'd be the same dumbass that I was on Jan. 5. Not evil in my motivations. But ignorant to the truth.\"\n\nAnd so he keeps telling his story-the story of what really happened that day.\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, Mike Fanone woke up early, as usual, and went to the gym. He'd been living with his mom since a breakup left him with an apartment he couldn't afford, working a second job at a security consultancy, saving for a down payment on a house for him and the girls-Piper, 9; Mei-Mei, 7; and Hensley, 5. Terry went to her prayer group, and when she came back she told her son she'd had a funny feeling and said an extra prayer for him.\n\nFanone's shift was scheduled to start at 2:30 p.m. His plan for the day involved a heroin buy at the James Creek public housing project in southwest D.C. The buyer would be a longtime informant whom Fanone considered a friend, a 68-year-old Black transgender woman named Leslie. (Leslie, who suffered from cancer, AIDS and various addictions, has since died, which Fanone learned because he was listed as her emergency contact.) But shortly after noon, seeing what was happening in the news, he called off the buy and drove to the station instead.\n\nThings were getting hairy. He had just hit the 14th St. Bridge when he heard the commander on the scene say on the radio that the department had run out of chemical munitions such as tear gas and pepper spray-not just what it had on hand at the Capitol but the whole department's supply. In all his years on the job, that had never happened. A call went out requesting aid from surrounding jurisdictions.\n\nAt the station he met Albright, who was changing into his uniform. \"What do you want to do?\" Albright said.\n\n\"We're going to go,\" Fanone said. \"Get us a vehicle.\" He went to his locker and took out the uniform he'd never worn before, still in its plastic wrapping. He grabbed a tactical vest, a radio, a body camera, a helmet and a gas mask.\n\nIn the parking lot, a sergeant was tossing car keys to anyone volunteering to go to the Capitol. They parked a couple of blocks away. Fanone couldn't figure out how to attach the gas mask to his vest, so they both left their masks in the car. It was eerily quiet as they approached the building on foot, passing abandoned police cars and barricades. Albright pointed out a trail of blood on the ground.\n\nThey went in the south entrance and made their way to the columned chamber known as the Crypt, lined with historic statues and a replica of the Magna Carta. A couple of dozen trespassers were milling about. As the partners tried to figure out where to go, a 10-33 call-officer in distress-came over the radio from the west front of the Capitol. They went.\n\nWhat if I had not gone through that? I'd be the same dumbass that I was on Jan. 5. Not evil in my motivations. But ignorant to the truth.\"\n\nSome rioters had gone around and trickled in through other windows and doors, but it was this entrance, facing the White House, where most of the mob was trying to force its way in. Fanone and Albright came upon a narrow, stone-walled tunnel choked with clouds of gas. A commander in a gray coat was hunched over, retching, trying to wipe the tear gas from his face. Fanone saw that it was his friend Ramey Kyle. A dull roar was getting louder as they approached. \"Hold the line!\" Kyle shouted over the din.\n\nFanone and Albright went into the tunnel. The floor was slick with vomit. About 30 officers were pressed against a pair of brass-bordered double doorjambs, four or five abreast, several rows deep. The ones in front strained to push the crowd far enough from the doors to yank them closed, trying to lock their plexiglass riot shields together. But the rioters had managed to tear some of the shields away and were beating the cops with them.\n\nFrom the back, Fanone and Albright could see the officers were ragged: injured, bleeding, blinded, fatigued. Some had been there for hours. They could also see that if the line broke, they would be trampled in the narrow tunnel, and the rioters would overrun the building. This was the last line of defense.\n\n\"Let's get some fresh guys up front!\" Fanone yelled. \"Who needs a break?\" Some officers pointed at colleagues they thought needed relief, but nobody volunteered to come off the line.\n\nWhat makes a hero? Is it bravery? Is it sacrifice? Or is it the man who refuses to let us forget?\n\n\"C'mon, MPD, dig in!\" Fanone yelled, bracing his hands against the other officers' backs. \"Push! Push 'em the f-ck out!\"\n\nHe and Albright got to the front. It was only then that they looked out on the sea of people for the first time and saw what they were up against. The rioters were coordinating efforts, yelling \"Heave! Ho!\" and lunging in rhythm.\n\nAn officer yelled, \"Knife!\" and Albright turned to his left, away from Fanone, to grab the weapon. When he turned back Fanone was gone.\n\nHe was out in the crowd, surrounded by rioters. They dragged him face first down the stairs and punched and kicked and beat him. They ripped off his badge and took his radio. One kept lunging for his weapon. Someone was yelling: \"Kill him with his own gun!\" Fanone felt an excruciating pain at the base of his skull-the taser-and cried out, but he couldn't hear himself scream. The rioters seemed intent on torturing him. He thought about pulling his gun. He would be justified in defending himself, but then what? He thought of his daughters. He didn't want to die. \"I've got kids!\" he cried.\n\nA couple of rioters surrounded him, fighting off others. \"Bring him up, bring him up,\" one said. \"Don't hurt him,\" said another. \"Which way do you want to go?\"\n\n\"I want to go back inside,\" he whimpered, and that's the last thing he remembers. The rioters lofted his limp, unconscious body to the doorway-the battle line. Albright grabbed him and pulled him back through the phalanx.\n\nOne of the officers carrying Fanone back into the hallway shouted, \"I need a medic! Need an EMT, now!\" Albright followed, crazed with fear. \"I got it. It's my partner!\" he yelled. \"Mike, stay in there, buddy. Mike, it's Jimmy. I'm here.\"\n\nWhat does Mike Fanone deserve? A parade? A key to the city? A White House ceremony? He's not asking for any of that. He's not asking to be called a hero-he just wants us to remember what his sacrifice was for. Fanone believes we can't keep trying to outrun this thing; we've got to turn around and face it, defeat it once and for all. That if all we do is turn away and hope it fades, it will just keep getting stronger until it comes back to kill us all.\n\nFanone has gotten none of those traditional heroes' honors. None of the officers have. But perhaps that's normal. Perhaps we always fail our heroes: the veterans who sleep in the street, the whistle-blowers languishing in penury. Perhaps all the medals and ceremonies are our constant, insufficient attempt to atone. But we can never be grateful enough. For our comfort, for our safety, for our freedom.\n\nThey laid him down on a luggage cart-there were no more stretchers, no more ambulances. \"Take his f-cking vest off, man. He's having trouble breathing,\" Albright said frantically. He took Fanone's gun so that he wouldn't come to and instinctively reach for it, thinking he was still out in the crowd.\n\n\"C'mon, Mike,\" Albright pleaded. \"C'mon, buddy, we're going duck hunting soon.\"\n\n\"Fanone, Fanone,\" another officer said. \"You all right, brother?\"\n\nThe world swam blurrily back into view.\n\n\"Did we take that door back?\" Fanone asked.\n\nThey took back the door. They defended the Capitol. That is the story Mike Fanone won't let us forget.\n\n-With reporting by Vera Bergengruen, Mariah Espada, Nik Popli and Simmone Shah\n\nWrite to Molly Ball at molly.ball@time.com"

      "text": "Officer spared jail over fatal Tasering of 95-year-old\n\nA former police officer has been spared a jail sentence over his fatal decision to Taser a 95-year-old woman with dementia symptoms at an Australia aged care home.\n\nKristian White said he had used the weapon to prevent a \"violent confrontation\" after finding Clare Nowland disoriented and holding a small kitchen knife in May 2023.\n\nBut the officer was found guilty of manslaughter by a jury last November, after prosecutors argued his actions towards the great-grandmother, who later died of her injuries, were \"grossly disproportionate\".\n\nThe case sparked public outcry, with the judge at one point saying it was \"unlike any other that I have had to confront\" over nearly two decades on the bench.\n\nHanding down his sentence in the New South Wales (NSW) Supreme Court on Friday, Justice Ian Harrison said White's actions at Yallambee Lodge in the town of Cooma, near Canberra, were a \"terrible mistake\".\n\nThe \"obvious\" reality was that Mrs Nowland was a \"frail and confused 95-year-old woman\" who \"posed nothing that could reasonably be described as a threat of any substance\".\n\n\"The simple but tragic fact would seem to me to be that Mr White completely - and on one available view inexplicably - misread and misunderstood the dynamics of the situation,\" Mr Harrison said.\n\nThe trial heard White was called to the care home around 04:00 on 17 May 2023, after Mrs Nowland was seen ambling around the premises with two serrated steak knives.\n\nBody cam footage showed he warned Mrs Nowland to drop the blades while aiming his weapon at her, before saying \"bugger it\" and firing. She fell and hit her head, triggering a fatal brain bleed.\n\nThe defence highlighted evidence from one of the paramedics and White's police partner who both said Mrs Nowland had made them feel scared for their safety.\n\nBut prosecutors had argued Mrs Nowland - who weighed under 48kg (105lb) and used a walker to get around - did not pose a threat and the officer was \"impatient\", using his weapon just three minutes after confronting her.\n\nMrs Nowland's family, at a sentencing hearing last month, said White's \"unfathomable\" and \"inhumane\" actions had forever changed their lives.\n\n\"To this day I am traumatised by this gutless coward act,\" Michael Nowland, Clare's eldest son, told the court.\n\nWhite previously told the court he didn't think Mrs Nowland would be \"significantly injured\" and that he was \"devastated\" by her death.\n\nIn a letter of apology to her relatives, White wrote: \"I deeply regret my actions and the severe consequences they have caused, to not only Mrs Nowland, but also to your family and the greater community.\"\n\nJustice Harrison said a jail term was not necessary, given White had already lost his job and become an unwelcome member of the local community, and did not pose a risk of reoffending.  He added it would also be difficult for a former officer to live in prison.\n\nHe sentenced White to a community corrections order of two years - essentially a good behaviour bond - and 425 hours of community service.\n\nSpeaking outside court, Mr Nowland said his family was disappointed.\n\n\"A slap on the wrist for someone that's killed our mother,\" he said. \"It's very, very hard to process that.\"\n\n\"Justice and fairness, that's all we wanted.\"\n\nMrs Nowland's death sparked global outrage and drew scrutiny over NSW Police's use of force.\n\nWhite had served as a police officer with the NSW police for 12 years before he was removed after his conviction.\n\nCommissioner Karen Webb described the death as \"a terrible tragedy\" that shouldn't have happened, but stressed that the force's Taser and training policies are appropriate.\n\nNews on Wearside saw the results of a premenstrual disorder study and an update from Nissan bosses.\n\nMore and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need.\n\nValerie survived intense heat and avoided venomous snakes during her time lost in the wilderness.\n\nHer name will forever be associated with the scandals surrounding Jeffrey Epstein and his circle.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Ex-officer found guilty in death of Breonna Taylor\n\nA former police officer in the US state of Kentucky has been found guilty of violating the civil rights of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her own home during a botched raid four years ago.\n\nBrett Hankison, 47, could face up to life in prison after being convicted of using excessive force against the 26-year-old emergency room technician.\n\nBut the jury also found him not guilty on another charge of violating the civil rights of one of Taylor's neighbours.  It was the third time Hankison had stood trial in the case.\n\nThe verdict marks the first time any officer has been convicted in the deadly raid on 13 March 2020 that made Taylor's name a rallying cry during the racial justice unrest of that year.\n\nMembers of Taylor's family in court collapsed in tears after the verdict on Friday, according to the Louisville Courier Journal.\n\nProsecutors wanted Hankison to be immediately taken into custody, but their request was rejected by the judge, reports the local newspaper.\n\nThe jury of five white men, one black man and six white women began their deliberations on Wednesday.\n\nThe indictment accused Hankison of depriving Taylor of the right to be free from unreasonable seizures and depriving her neighbours of the right to be free from the deprivation of liberty without due process of law.\n\nHe fired 10 times into her apartment, in order, he said, to protect fellow officers as Taylor's boyfriend opened fire when officers broke down the door.\n\nAccording to the Courier Journal, Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, said after the verdict that she began to feel \"defeated\" as jury deliberations continued, but that she was \"glad\" the trial was over.\n\n\"1,694 days it took. It was long, it was hard, it was - I don't know if I've got some words (other than) 'thank God.'\", she said.\n\nHankison took the stand over two days of testimony during the retrial, telling the jurors he was \"trying to stay alive, trying to keep my partners alive\".\n\nHe was the first of the four officers charged in the case to face a jury.\n\nAnother former officer, Kelly Goodlett, pleaded guilty to falsifying the search warrant for Taylor's home.\n\nThe remaining two officers had their federal charges thrown out by a judge earlier this year. The US Justice Department recently indicted the two on new charges.\n\nTaylor was killed after officers wearing plain clothes executed a \"no-knock\" search warrant at her home. They burst into her apartment in the early morning hours while she and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were asleep.\n\nAuthorities believed Taylor's former boyfriend was using her home to hide narcotics.\n\nMr Walker fired a single shot when they knocked the door down, hitting one officer, Sgt John Mattingly, in the leg. Mr Walker said the officers did not announce themselves as police, and he thought they were intruders.\n\nThe three officers returned fire, shooting 32 bullets into the flat.\n\nAnother officer fired the shot that killed Taylor, but prosecutors said his use of deadly force was justified because Walker had opened fire first.\n\nNone of Hankison's bullets hit anyone, but they did enter a neighbouring property, where a pregnant woman, a five-year-old and a man had been sleeping.\n\nA subsequent police report contained errors, including listing Taylor's injuries as \"none\" and saying no force was used to enter, when a battering ram had been used.\n\nHankison was fired from Louisville Metro Police Department in June 2020.\n\nHis previous federal case last year ended in a mistrial when the jury told the judge it could not reach a unanimous verdict.\n\nHe was previously tried by a Kentucky state jury in March 2022, and acquitted on three counts of felony wanton endangerment.\n\nTaylor's family and Walker both received settlements from the city over the incident.\n\nA series of police reforms also were introduced in Louisville.\n\nHankison is due to be sentenced on 12 March next year.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Sixth officer fired after the beating death of Tyre Nichols\n\nA sixth Memphis officer was fired Friday after an internal police investigation showed he violated multiple department policies in the violent arrest of Tyre Nichols , including rules surrounding the deployment of a stun gun, officials said.\n\nPreston Hemphill had been suspended as he was investigated for his role in the Jan. 7 arrest of Nichols, who died in a hospital three days later. Five Memphis officers have already been fired and charged with second-degree murder in Nichols' death.\n\nNichols was beaten after police stopped him for what they said was a traffic violation. Video released after pressure from Nichols' family shows officers holding him down and repeatedly punching, kicking and striking him with a baton as he screamed for his mother.\n\nThe officers who have been fired and charged are Black, as was Nichols. Hemphill is white. One other officer has been suspended, but has not been identified.\n\nHemphill was the third officer at the traffic stop that preceded the arrest but was not at the location where Nichols was beaten after he ran away.\n\nOn body camera footage from the initial stop, Hemphill is heard saying that he used a stun gun against Nichols and declaring, \"I hope they stomp his ass.\"\n\nAlong with breaking rules regarding the use of a stun gun, Hemphill was also fired for violations of personal conduct and truthfulness, police said in a statement.\n\nPolice announced Hemphill's suspension on Jan. 30, but they said Hemphill was actually suspended shortly after the arrest.\n\nMemphis police spokeswoman Karen Rudolph has said information about Hemphill's suspension was not immediately released because Hemphill had not been fired. The department generally gives out information about an officer's punishment only after a department investigation into misconduct ends, Rudolph said.\n\nAfter the suspension was announced, lawyers for Nichols' family questioned why the department did not disclose Hemphill's discipline earlier.\n\n\"We have asked from the beginning that the Memphis Police Department be transparent with the family and the community - this news seems to indicate that they haven't risen to the occasion,\" attorneys Ben Crump and Anthony Romanucci said in a statement. \"It certainly begs the question why the white officer involved in this brutal attack was shielded and protected from the public eye, and to date, from sufficient discipline and accountability.\"\n\nAlso Friday, a Tennessee board suspended the emergency medical technician licenses of two former Memphis Fire Department employees for failing to render critical care.\n\nThe suspensions of EMT Robert Long and advanced EMT JaMichael Sandridge build on efforts by authorities to hold officers and other first responders accountable for the violence against Nichols. The Justice Department has opened a civil rights probe into the attack that was captured on video.\n\nThree fire department employees were fired after Nichols died. Former fire department Lt. Michelle Whitaker was the third employee let go, but her license was not considered for suspension Friday. The department has said she remained in the engine with the driver during the response to Nichols' beating.\n\nEmergency Medical Services Board member Jeff Beaman said during Friday's emergency meeting that there may have been other licensed personnel on scene - including a supervisor - who could have prevented the situation that led to the death of Nichols. Beaman said he hopes the board addresses those in the future.\n\nMatt Gibbs, an attorney for the state Department of Health, said the two suspensions were \"not final disposition of this entire matter.\"\n\nBoard members watched 19 minutes of surveillance video that showed Long and Sandridge as they failed to care for Nichols, who couldn't stay seated upright against the side of the vehicle, laying prone on the ground multiple times. They also considered an affidavit by the Memphis Fire Department's EMS deputy chief.\n\n\"The (state) Department (of Health) alleges that neither Mr. Sandridge nor Mr. Long engaged in emergency care and treatment to patient T.N., who was clearly in distress during the 19 minute period,\" Gibbs said.\n\nBoard member Sullivan Smith said it was \"obvious to even a lay person\" that Nichols \"was in terrible distress and needed help.\"\n\n\"And they failed to provide that help,\" Smith said. \"They were his best shot, and they failed to help.\"\n\nFire Chief Gina Sweat has said the department received a call from police after someone was pepper-sprayed. When the workers arrived at 8:41 p.m., Nichols was handcuffed on the ground and slumped against a squad car, the statement said.\n\nLong and Sandridge, based on the nature of the call and information they were told by police, \"failed to conduct an adequate patient assessment of Mr. Nichols,\" the statement said.\n\nThere was no immediate response to a voicemail seeking comment left at a number listed for Long. A person who answered a phone call to a number listed for Sandridge declined to comment on the board's decision.\n\nAn ambulance was called, and it arrived at 8:55 p.m., the statement said. An emergency unit cared for Nichols and left for a hospital with him at 9:08 p.m., which was 27 minutes after Long, Sandridge and Whitaker arrived, officials said.\n\nAn investigation determined that all three violated multiple policies and protocols, the statement said, adding that \"their actions or inactions on the scene that night do not meet the expectations of the Memphis Fire Department.\"\n\nThe fired officers involved were part of the so-called Scorpion unit, which targeted violent criminals in high-crime areas. Police Chief Cerelyn \"CJ\" Davis said after the video's release that the unit has been disbanded.\n\nMayor Jim Strickland said Friday that the city has ordered up a review of its police department - including special units and use-of-force policies - through the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, through the Collaborative Reform Initial Technical Assistant Center program, and the International Association of Police Chiefs. The COPS group is also aiding a review of the law enforcement response to the Uvalde, Texas, elementary school shooting that left 19 children and two teachers dead.\n\nThe killing led to renewed public discussion of how police forces can treat Black residents with excessive violence, regardless of the race of both the police officers and those being policed.\n\nAt Nichols' funeral on Wednesday, calls for reform and justice were interwoven with grief over the loss of a man remembered as a son, a sibling, a father and a passionate photographer and skateboarder.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "New Jersey Police Officer Killed, Second Officer Wounded in Shooting by 14-Year-Old, Authorities Say\n\nNEWARK, N.J.-A 14-year-old shot and killed a police officer and wounded another Friday evening in New Jersey, authorities said, in a chaotic scene that witnesses described as seeing officers running down a busy street before they heard a volley of a dozen or more gunshots.\n\nThe slain officer, 26-year-old Joseph Azcona, was part of a team of Newark police detectives and federal agents that had gone to capture a suspect in an illegal weapons sting when the officer was fired on in his vehicle, authorities said.\n\n\"He didn't even get a chance to step out of the vehicle before he was struck,\" Emanuel Miranda, Newark's director of public safety, told a Saturday morning news conference with Newark's mayor and top prosecutor.\n\nMiranda called Azcona a \"true hero.\"\n\nThe other officer who was struck was hospitalized with injuries that were not expected to be life-threatening, authorities said. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka called the shooting a \"heinous, callous disregard for humanity\" and that officers had gone to the scene knowing that \"grave danger was possible.\"\n\nPolice took five people into custody, including the 14-year-old who was charged with murder, attempted murder and possession of illegal weapons, Essex County Prosecutor Theodore N. Stevens II told the news conference.\n\nThe 14-year-old was shot and hospitalized with injuries that were not life threatening, Stevens said.\n\nStevens did not identify the boy or the other four people in custody who he said were undergoing questioning by investigators Saturday. Stevens and Miranda gave few other details about what led police to the group that fired on Azcona, the ensuing police response or the shootout.\n\nOne gun was recovered, Stevens said. It and officers' guns were being evaluated to determine which of them were fired and how many shots were fired, he said.\n\nAzcona. a five-year veteran of the Newark police force, was promoted to detective two years ago and assigned to an intelligence unit that was the \"best of the best,\" Miranda said.\n\nAzcona and the other officer were shot around 6:37 p.m. in the area of Broadway and Carteret after the team of detectives and federal agents went to investigate a report of illegal firearms activity, authorities said. Witnesses said they heard a string of gunshots after they saw officers running down the street on a commercial strip between a McDonald's and White Castle restaurants near the Passaic River.\n\nWitness Randy Mejia told WCBS-TV right before he heard gunshots that he saw officers running.\n\n\"It sounded like a car accident and it went boom, boom, boom,\" Mejia said.\n\nThe wounded officers were taken to University Hospital in Newark, where Azcona was pronounced dead around 2:30 a.m., Stevens said. Azcona's mother, father and brother were at the hospital to see him and grieve after the shooting, Miranda said.\n\nPolice declined to identify the officer who was wounded.\n\nBaraka expressed frustration that society hasn't figured out a way to prevent a 14-year-old with a firearm from shooting at police.\n\n\"We just have to do a better job. I have to do a better job. Our families have to do a better job. The community has to do a better job at making sure that our children are not handling guns in the street, shooting at police officers,\" Baraka said. \"This is not a police problem. This is our problem. This is our collective problem.\""

      "text": "Former Ohio Police Officer Found Guilty of Murder in 2020 Shooting of Unarmed Man\n\nA former Ohio police officer was found guilty of murder for killing an unarmed man who emerged from a darkened garage while holding a cellphone and a large set of keys.\n\nAdam Coy, a 17-year veteran of the Columbus police force, shot Andre Hill four times while responding to a neighbor's noise complaint on Dec. 22, 2020. He was charged with murder, felonious assault, and reckless homicide.\n\nOn Monday, almost four years after the shooting, a jury in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas delivered a verdict that found Coy guilty of all charges.\n\nProsecutors asked that Coy be sentenced immediately, but Franklin County Judge Stephen McIntosh set Nov. 25 as the sentencing date. The former officer faces a possible life sentence in prison.\n\nDuring the trial, Coy told jurors that he feared for his life because he thought he saw a silver revolver coming up in Hill's right hand as the man walked towards him. He said it was only after the shooting that he realized he mistook a set of keys for a gun.\n\n\"I thought I was going to die,\" Coy testified. \"I knew at that point I made a mistake. I was horrified.\"\n\nCoy had not activated the camera on what started as a nonemergency call, but a \"look-back\" feature recorded 60 seconds of video with no audio before the officer flipped the device on. The footage then shows him walking around for several minutes as more police officers arrived at the scene.\n\nBodycam footage from police officer Amy Detweiler, who was with Coy at the time of the shooting, shows two other Columbus officers rolling Hill over and putting handcuffs on him before leaving him alone again. None of the officers attempted first aid as Hill lay bleeding on the garage floor. Hill was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nCoy was fired days after the deadly encounter for failing to activate his body camera before the confrontation and for not providing medical aid to Hill.\n\nProsecutors said Hill had followed the officer's commands and was never a threat to the officers.\n\n\"We're taught do what the cops tell you to do, and you can survive that encounter,\" Franklin County Assistant Prosecutor Anthony Pierson said during closing arguments. \"That's not what happened here.\"\n\nThe officer's attorneys argued that Hill's lack of a weapon did not matter because Coy thought his life was in danger. \"He wasn't reckless, he was reasonable,\" said attorney Mark Collins.\n\nAlso advocating on Coy's behalf was the Ohio chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, which argued that the case was \"marked by political influence and bias\" as it involved a white officer killing a black man at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nColumbus Mayor Andrew Ginther, who pressured the police department to fire Coy in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, on Monday said he stood by that call.\n\nIn May 2021, Columbus reached a $10 million settlement with Hill's family, a payout reported to be the largest in the city's history."

She opens it and he greets her, identifying himself as an officer. She says \"Hi\" but then shuts the door.\n\nLiu keeps asking Wilson to open the door and speak to him, saying he wants to make sure she's OK. After three minutes, Wilson opens the door.

      "text": "Last year, Brian Lande, an officer in the Richmond, California police department, had to draw his gun to stop two drunk men from clobbering each other to death with metal rods.\n\nIn 2015, he threatened deadly force to stop a fight between two more drunk men. One was armed with a hatchet. Another, with a wrench.\n\nOn another occasion, he drew his firearm to arrest a man hopping a backyard fence, fleeing the scene of a burglary.\n\nNone of these was remarkable in Richmond, a working-class city just east of San Francisco that's notorious for its drive-by shootings, break-ins, carjackings, and countless petty crimes.\n\nWhen I asked Lande if he often had to unholster his gun-a standard-issue Glock 17-he told me he'd done it so many times that \"they all bleed into each other.\"\n\nLuckily, he's never had to pull the trigger.\n\nBut things could easily have gone south. If a suspect had made a suspicious move or pulled something out of his pocket that looked like a gun-it happens more than you'd think-he would have had less than a quarter of a second to make the most awful decision of his life: whether to kill another human being.\n\n\"You're in an incredibly inauspicious situation,\" Lande told me. \"The chance of making a good faith mistake is high.\"\n\nWhat that means is that if you're a cop, you've got to be confident that if a tragedy occurs-if a life is taken that should not have been taken-your chief, your city council, the powers that be will at least treat you fairly, hear you out, and ensure that justice is served.\n\nBut these days, a growing number of cops aren't so sure of that. Making the wrong decision is now a lot more likely to land you in prison, Lande explained. \"It's not tenable for my family,\" he said. So in early 2022, he started thinking about quitting his dream job.\n\nHe was hardly alone.\n\nA 2021 survey showed that police departments nationwide saw resignations jump by 18 percent-and retirements by 45 percent-over the previous year, with hiring decreasing by five percent. The Los Angeles Police Department has been losing 50 officers a month to retirement, more than the city can replace with recruits. Oakland lost about seven per month in 2021, with the number of officers sinking below the city's legally mandated minimum.\n\nThe list goes on: Chicago has lost more cops than it has in two decades. New Orleans is backfilling its shortfall of officers with civilians. New York is losing more police officers than it has since such figures started being recorded. Minneapolis and Baltimore have similar stories. St. Louis-one of the most dangerous cities in America-has lost so many cops that there's a seven-foot-tall, 10-foot-wide pile of uniforms from outgoing officers at police headquarters called \" Mount Exodus .\"\n\nAnd in San Francisco, just across the bay from Richmond, the police department has seen 50 officers out of a force of fewer than 2,000 take off for smaller, suburban departments, according to Lieutenant Tracy McCray, the head of the city's police union.\n\n\"That was a lot of talent for us,\" McCray said. \"They were great, bright new cops. A couple of them were born and raised in the city.\" These were the kind of officers that advocates for reform say they want more of: cops from the communities they police, black cops, Latino cops. \"All of their roots they had here,\" she said. \"They just up and left.\"\n\nA big part of what's prompting police to leave America's big cities is the perception the public has turned against them. A 2020 poll showed that only seven percent of police officers would advise their kids to go into law enforcement. Eighty-three percent of those who wouldn't recommend it cited \"lack of respect for the profession.\"\n\n\"Suddenly, everyone is telling us how to do our jobs. They're saying we're biased, racist, only want to hurt black and brown communities,\" said McCray, who is black. \"These officers worked in these communities, were invested in these communities. Suddenly, people who don't know us are saying you're this, you're that.\"\n\nIf you appreciate our in-depth reporting on the most important stories in America, become a subscriber:\n\nThe shift in police officers' perception of how they're viewed by the public happened gradually-starting with the first Black Lives Matter protests of 2013, after the shooting death of Travyon Martin and the acquittal of the man who killed him, George Zimmerman. There were more BLM demonstrations: in 2014, following the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York. Then came the 2015-2016 Democratic presidential primaries, in which BLM played a prominent role.\n\nAnd then, in late May 2020, George Floyd, a black man, was killed by a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, and it was caught on video. The incident ignited protests across the country -a \"racial reckoning\"-and soon after, reform.\n\nIn some cities, including Portland, Oregon and Columbus, Ohio, local governments set up police review boards with the power to subpoena police records and oversee day-to-day policing. States including Illinois , Minnesota , and Oregon tightened use-of-force standards. New Mexico and Minnesota required officers to intervene if another officer was using what might be deemed unreasonable physical force.\n\nIt became popular-even fashionable-for politicians in progressive circles to flaunt their anti-police credentials. In Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed, the city council resolved to \"begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department.\" (They reversed course after crime surged.) In New York, after winning the Democratic congressional primary, now-Rep. Jamaal Bowman tweeted : \"Police officers have sworn to protect and serve the institution of white supremacy.\"\n\nA month later, the ACLU tweeted that \"policing is rotten to its core\" and \"has always been a racist institution in the United States.\"\n\nIn Portland, Kristina Narayan-the legislative director for Tina Kotek, who was then Oregon's Speaker of the House and is now the governor-was arrested while participating in anti-police protests at which Molotov cocktails were thrown at the cops.\n\nAll of this revealed a disconnect between progressives and much of the rest of the country, including many Democrats: A 2020 New York Times poll showed that 63 percent of registered voters opposed cutting police budgets while 55 percent of Biden supporters favored it.\n\n\"When I was a cop, we were afraid we might mess up and get in trouble,\" said Peter Moskos, a former Baltimore police officer who teaches at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. \"But you had to do something wrong. Now cops are getting in trouble for doing exactly what they're supposed to do.\"\n\n\"The rules of the game changed,\" said Brian Lande, the Richmond police officer. He was referring to a 2019 California law that further limits when cops can use force-and more broadly, to the shift in thinking among Democratic elites.\n\nLande went on: \"Let's say you see a guy, he's just robbed a bank, he's got a gun, he's running now into the preschool.\" Once upon a time, that would have been enough to justify using force. Now you've got to be confident that a crime is \"imminent\"-and sometimes you have only milliseconds to figure that out.\n\nIf you get it wrong, and if the skin color of the cop and the victim suit the narrative that cops are propping up the institution of white supremacy and wantonly snuffing out black bodies, you could be prosecuted as a murderer.\n\n\"Other people who don't live in your community, but who are speaking on behalf of your community, don't know what the fuck they're talking about,\" McCray told me. \"Black Lives Matter was talking about putting ambassadors on the street-where they at?\" Referring to one of San Francisco's most violent neighborhoods, she added: \"Haven't seen one damn member of Black Lives Matter patrolling the Bayview making sure police aren't 'hunting and killing black people.' \"\n\nLande added: \"If you're a cop, you're like, 'Okay, well, I guess I'm not going to put myself in situations where that's likely to occur.' So I'm not going to go make traffic stops in places and of people that I think might likely be carrying firearms, because I don't want to have to get that decision right. That's too hard.\"\n\nIn Richmond, the politicians were signaling loud and clear: we don't like cops.\n\nAfter the riots in Ferguson, and especially after the murder of George Floyd, the Richmond City Council cut the police budget, forcing hiring freezes. Council members also threatened to slash officers' salaries by 20 percent.\n\nBy last spring, the Richmond Police Department had lost so many officers that those who remained were forced to work overtime 40 to 60 hours per month. That requirement came on top of being forced to work back-to-back shifts when unexpected vacancies opened up. Investigations and traffic enforcement more or less stopped. Burnt-out officers were just doing patrols-driving around passively, waiting for something to happen.\n\nWhen Lande tried to recruit new officers, cops told him they preferred to go somewhere with a friendlier local government, where they wouldn't have to fear getting laid off or having their salaries and benefits reduced. Many went to Napa and Sonoma Counties-wine country.\n\nLast September, Lande followed suit and left Richmond. \"I felt very conflicted about it,\" Lande told me. \"Residents of Richmond are disproportionately poorer, disproportionately victims of violent crimes.\"\n\nLande and I had known each other since our graduate school days, studying sociology at Berkeley. He's one of the most thoughtful and educated-and experienced-cops in the Bay Area. He has published academic papers on how to train the police to interact more effectively with the public. He had studied this question-police-community relations-while on a stint at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is part of the Pentagon.\n\nBut research hadn't been enough for Lande. \"As an academic sociologist, I learned quickly that my ability to make a difference was pretty limited,\" he said. As a police officer, he went on, \"I could make a difference in people's lives-and I wasn't bad at it.\"\n\nHe loved his job in Richmond. But the calculus of policing had changed.\n\nIn August, as Lande was preparing to leave, Richmond saw four murders in the span of a week. In the same time period, Oakland, to the south, experienced five murders in three days-and the following month, three homicides in a single hour.\n\nLande transferred to Kensington, a 15-minute drive away.\n\nKensington is filled with California craftsman-style bungalows, mid-century ranch houses and Spanish-style villas with Priuses and Teslas out front, and decks with gorgeous views of the San Francisco Bay out back. Black Lives Matters signs are everywhere, reflecting Kensington residents' solidarity with working-class black people in cities like Richmond-even as Richmond has become less safe as a result of the changes that movement has ushered in.\n\nLife is good: Officer Lande is now Sergeant Lande. His job involves far fewer risks. Much of his day is filled with administrative work at the station. When he goes out on patrol, he mostly writes parking tickets.\n\nBut he is not optimistic. \"An enormous amount of damage has been done,\" he told me. \"Instead of seeing real investment in policing, like what we see in Europe, we've seen a massive disinvestment.\"\n\nIn August 2022, President Biden announced his Safer America Plan in response to rising crime . Among other things, it includes plans to hire 100,000 more police officers. That upset the ACLU, which disparaged the plan as \"more criminalization and incarceration,\" and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, which asserted -without providing evidence-that adding police officers would only victimize black people.\n\nPeter Moskos, the former Baltimore police officer now teaching at John Jay College, was mystified by progressives who insist that the single greatest threat faced by black Americans is systemic racism. \"Congratulations!\" said Moskos, who has called for legalizing drugs in response to the drug war's ineffectiveness and its disproportionate impact on young black men. \"You've increased the black murder rate. You're giving blacks worse policing through this transfer of cops-and doing it smugly in the name of racial justice.\"\n\nLeighton Woodhouse is a journalist and documentary filmmaker in Oakland. His last piece for The Free Press was about the mythical origins of Santa Claus.\n\nwherever progressives pollute an area with their idiotic and unproven 'progress', woe is sure to follow. that is 100% accurate in the united states.\n\nThere are DOJ investigations into departments like Chicago and Baltimore that found routine civil rights violations.  These departments had major issues for years and years but the police omerta blocked any efforts to self correct.  Things came to a head and now the scales have tipped the other way and the police are on their back foot with people questioning every single move they make, no matter how reasonable.\n\nWhat's the lesson?  The lesson is that credible oversight over state power is needed.  That's not some wackadoo liberal agenda, it's a fundamental requirement for just government.  If you don't have that oversight abuses *will* happen and there *will* be a backlash that goes too far.\n\nYou're also seeing innovation in cities like Newark moving back towards community policing.  We're seeing that cracking down hard on crime isn't always the right thing to do - not because it hurts people's feelings but because it doesn't actually work.  That urban departments are losing officers that are amenable to reform is probably the most concerning thing in this story because that is the reasonable solution to the actual issue we're having, rather than some political football everyone likes to toss around.\n\nThere is also the issue that the power of the police is given to them by the citizens they police.  If the community isn't OK with killing someone for selling loosies, then the police can't kill someone for selling loosies.  There is no \"right\" for the police to just do whatever they want.\n\n10 or 15 years ago it was easy to find conservatives concerned about no knock warrants and other questionable police tactics.  Now that the left has taken on this cause (ironic since it is liberal cities which have the biggest problems with police abuse) all the conservatives have decided that the police are paragons of virtue, beyond reproach, and that anything they do is in the best interest of society.  It is no more or less idiotic than the left questioning obviously legitimate uses of force.\n\nLike every issue the truth is in the middle.  Most officers are great people.  Some of them are not.  Where you have people abusing their power that needs to be corrected.  When you have police legitimately using force in the face of wild and dangerous criminals crucifying them is not productive.  Policing strategies which are not having the desired effect need to be reexamined.\n\nIt's all common sense, but America doesn't care about common sense anymore.  They care about being right and creating well defined enemies.\n\nNo posts"

You're giving blacks worse policing through this transfer of cops-and doing it smugly in the name of racial justice.\"\n\nLeighton Woodhouse is a journalist and documentary filmmaker in Oakland. His last piece for The Free Press was about the mythical origins of Santa Claus.\n\nwherever progressives pollute an area with their idiotic and unproven 'progress', woe is sure to follow. that is 100% accurate in the united states.\n\nThere are DOJ investigations into departments like Chicago and Baltimore that found routine civil rights violations.  These departments had major issues for years and years but the police omerta blocked any efforts to self correct.  Things came to a head and now the scales have tipped the other way and the police are on their back foot with people questioning every single move they make, no matter how reasonable.\n\nWhat's the lesson?  The lesson is that credible oversight over state power is needed.  That's not some wackadoo liberal agenda, it's a fundamental requirement for just government.  If you don't have that oversight abuses *will* happen and there *will* be a backlash that goes too far.\n\nYou're also seeing innovation in cities like Newark moving back towards community policing.  We're seeing that cracking down hard on crime isn't always the right thing to do - not because it hurts people's feelings but because it doesn't actually work.  That urban departments are losing officers that are amenable to reform is probably the most concerning thing in this story because that is the reasonable solution to the actual issue we're having, rather than some political football everyone likes to toss around.\n\nThere is also the issue that the power of the police is given to them by the citizens they police.  If the community isn't OK with killing someone for selling loosies, then the police can't kill someone for selling loosies.  There is no \"right\" for the police to just do whatever they want.\n\n10 or 15 years ago it was easy to find conservatives concerned about no knock warrants and other questionable police tactics.  Now that the left has taken on this cause (ironic since it is liberal cities which have the biggest problems with police abuse) all the conservatives have decided that the police are paragons of virtue, beyond reproach, and that anything they do is in the best interest of society.  It is no more or less idiotic than the left questioning obviously legitimate uses of force.\n\nLike every issue the truth is in the middle.  Most officers are great people.  Some of them are not.  Where you have people abusing their power that needs to be corrected.  When you have police legitimately using force in the face of wild and dangerous criminals crucifying them is not productive.  Policing strategies which are not having the desired effect need to be reexamined.\n\nIt's all common sense, but America doesn't care about common sense anymore.  They care about being right and creating well defined enemies.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "James Damore was unpersoned after he wrote a memo at Google. Now he's living as a digital hermit in Luxembourg. We tracked him down.\n\nThe phrase \"the killing of George Floyd\" is beyond egregious propaganda.  He wasn't killed, he died because he had drugged himself above and beyond what his body's infirmities could tolerate and he chose to move that body in such a way that death was inevitable.  The \"trial\" of the police officer was filled with lies and a physician testified to the above cause of death.  The incarceration of that officer was a major injustice.\n\nYeah, but what about.... Does not refute the guilt admitted in accepting a pardon. ( see previous comment)\n\nWhile reading this story I was reminded of Arthur Millers play The Crucible. When a group experiences unusual stress the result is often some form of moral panic. Whether it be the Witch Trials in Salem, The Inquisition of Medieval Spain, The Red Scare of the American Cold War or The Wokeism of the Covid Panic. In all of these cases Heretics need to be created to perform an exorcisim to remove danger through expulsion and/or death symbolically  protecting the group. Mr. Damore's treatment is another sad example of the damage this kind of fear exacts when brought to a fever pitch as happened in 2020-2023. It is interesting the article posits Aspergers as the explanation why Mr Damore spoke honestly about the excesses of that time instead of knuckling under and keeping his mouth shut as everyone did during that embarrassing moment.  This brings to mind the phrase, \"Character only reveals itself when tested\". How we individually behaved during this period would be an interesting thing for each to ponder as it may be instructive in understanding who they really are more clearly and may cause some to act with grater integrity, honesty, humanity and wisdom in the future.\n\n\"the summer of 2020 after the killing of George Floyd.\"\n\nCorrection: the summer of 2020 after the overdosing of George Floyd.\n\nSo I wasn't a big fan of Joe's pre-emptive pardons....but maybe they do not seem quite as crazy now.\n\nThe purpose of a Pardon is to allow the recipient to avoid the consequences of their criminality. Issuance and acceptance of a Pardon is a tacit admission of criminal culpability.\n\nRight. So the same can be said of everyone Trump has pardoned as well.\n\nBut the pre-emptive stuff did not seem too kosher at the time....yet doesn't seem so crazy now when Trump does in fact seems to be chomping at the bit to go after those people.\n\nTrump could've taken the high road...but that's not the Orange Way.\n\nWhen you let rapists and murderers go free you are sick in the head.\n\nSomeone, please draw a cartoon showing an autopen like contraption wrapped around Joe's arm while he stares vacuously into space surrounded by Hunter, his siblings and in-laws and the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nLeave it to TFP to manage to focus on anti-whateveritisism in a story about Schumer.\n\nI've been a long time subscriber to TFP. I recommend you all to friends and family because of the excellent reporting. But today's front page reads like total grift. Damore wrote an internal memo that he was unjustly fired for in 2017... eight years ago... what has he been up to in the mean time? Trying to raise a family and be anonymous in an irrelevant city. Hardly fighting the good fight. Important profile? Really?\n\nJews are BIOLOGICALLY good at math, money, negotiation, discounts, and knowing they are \"permitted to deceive the Gentile in matters of business,\" etc. which is why they are good at finance/banking\n\nOr...\n\nJews are SOCIALIZED to be interested in math, money, discounts and being \"permitted to deceive the Gentile in matters of business,\" etc. which is why so many are in the field of finance/banking.\n\nThis is Sophmoric in intent and silly and stupid in content.\n\nGee, I'm sorry, but I only allot a few minutes each day to respond to Trumpeters, and your time is up. Try again when you have a good point to make.\n\nClearly Jefferson's \"polygraph\" is completely irrelevant to questions about a device that produces signatures without the signer's presence or even knowledge.\n\nBut I am *fascinated* to know why Jefferson built and used it in the first place! I can see the linked armatures being enough if they were connecting two ball-point or felt-tip pens. But surely Jefferson used quills, which must be frequently replenished with ink, right? Would it really be labor-saving to use this if each pen was a quill? Or was the point simply to produce two faithfully identical documents in the days before copying machines or carbon paper?\n\nDoes anybody out there have enough historical chops to explain?\n\nRe:Chuck Schumer.\n\nI find it interesting that Schumer has written a book on antisemitism. During the chaos at colleges in New York in support of Hamas after the October 7th massacre not a word came from him. As my wife has said many times, he was a putz when she was in high school with him and nothing has changed.\n\nA total putz and I wasn't in high school with him. I mean seriously he claimed his name Schumer means Shomer in Hebrew which means to guard/ guardian of Israel. He doesn't know what the word means and now has the chutzpah to write a book about anti semitism - God the goad of this man. The Democrats need to be shot of him if they want to survive till the midterms.\n\nThe huge problem with  this article on Damore is that it was, and is, easily provable horsesh*t. I am no fan of DEI, but the role of women in computing is historically very well established. Yes, if you treat women like sh*t they won't work well with you. Damore was and is an ignorant a$$hat.\n\nSeriously, WTAF Bari? From you? What next?  An article on how the earth is flat? We should tell Elon to dig through to the other side of the flat earth so he can  fall to Mars and the moon?\n\nAt least run paeans to bullsh*t on April 1st.\n\nIt sounds like you have been a victim of the smear campaign against Damore. Read his actual memo, and importantly, with the scientific citations, not the released memo stripped of the citations, which make him come off as a misogynist. If you can't admit that most of us women don't want to sit in front of a computer and code--because, on average, we gravitate more toward communications roles--then you're denying biology. Then, after reading his paper, maybe ask yourself what else you've been propagandized about. And then maybe apologize to this noble man.\n\nI read Damore's email in the original when it came out because it landed in my inbox. I refuted each point at the time. So no, all of your points are false---proven by history.  I don't have time to rewrite that refutation now, but I can make enough points. When I say it is bullsh*t, I mean that. Women are very good verbally, and coding is a kind of verbal skill. Many women are excellent with figures and math.\n\nDo you know what the \"computers\" were before the invention of the digital computer? They were humans who computed. Virtually all of them were women. Many had math degrees. So it was culturally natural that programmers would be women.  (Watch \"Hidden Figures\" It is a true story.)\n\nWhat happened is a transition from \"women's work\" to \"men's work\".\n\nhttps://somethingtosay.london/uncategorized/tech-industrys-gendered-history-from-womens-work-to-mens-work/ --- Keep in kind that when they talk about coding in the 1960's it was virtually all assembler code.  There was also Fortran and some other languages. But assembler stuck around for a while.\n\nAt the start of my career in 1980, I worked in an ATM and point of sale group at Wells Fargo. We worked 100% in assembler, IBM assembler and various others. I was one of two men in a group of 7. All of them were excellent at it. (My boss was a woman who reported to a woman, who reported to a woman, who reported to the president of the bank.) We did things like code a POS terminal through its front panel by hand. When I say by hand, there wasn't even a compiler. We literally wrote the assembler on paper, then hand translated it into machine code represented in hexadecimal. This was considered an ordinary thing to do. Tomorrow you might implement a 5 degree equation in an assembler. The systems worked and well.\n\nIn the 1990's women were roughly half the staff at a CASE tool company. Coding there was in multiple languages. 5 levels of abstraction.  About half the hires made it through their probationary period. It was hard.  When I ran a factory automation project, it was 1/3rd women, and that included going out on the factory floor with the heavy machinery and sparks. One of those women was the fastest and smartest software developer I ever knew. Really. When she was rated, they thought she had to be gaming the system. In assembler, 500 lines a month tested and installed was the bar. Good was 1000-1500 lines. This woman? She was up in the 30,000+ range. They were sure it was impossible, so we audited her code. There was no inclusion of junk code (an obvious hack that some would do). Not only was she the fastest by a stunning margin, but she also had the lowest rate of bug reports.\n\nAll through the 1990's nobody thought twice about whether women were \"fit for coding.\" It was a given. Then... the facebook and google generation came out of the ivies. Guys like Damore superimposed their ideas on the real world. And the demographic changed.  Women like yourself believed it.\n\nWomen are very sharp and good with details Dani. Women usually are good at keeping track and have good memories. Women usually work well with others, and are less concerned about whether they look stupid. I have never run across a woman in software who doubles down on a mistake by denying it is a mistake. I've had that happen with young men frequently, and young men will go on the offensive to save face.\n\nPS -  When I was in Russia, I found that all of the civil engineers, and many of the nuclear engineers (for reactors) were women. This had effects on infrastructure because female engineers naturally solve female problems. This has long been the case, and Russian women were very matter of fact about engineering. My girlfriend at the time when she came to the US came home from a hair appointment very pensive. She said, \"Tell me. Why is American woman only talk of stupid things? Movie star. Stupid girl singer doing stupid girl in bar things. Why no talk of science? Why no space? Or politic?\"  It made me laugh. \"Why you laughing me? I serious!\" I had to tell her that if she ever figures it out, to tell me.\n\nMy stepdaughter when she came over had a hard time because in Russia, at 13, she was well into calculus. She felt infantilized forced into a math program she had done 4 years prior. This is a cultural thing. It has nothing at all to do with capability or fitness.\n\n\"Hidden Figures\" is not a true story. It's sort of based on history, but been debunked.\n\nhttps://hiddenfigurescritique.com/\n\nI will take a look. It's an interesting dataset. I appreciate it. However,  from reading the critique introduction you linked to, it is evident that these women were working at NASA as human computers, and that they became programmers. I was not using that example to say they deserved a presidential medal for it. I just intended that it buttress the point that human computers were women and that this segued into programming as the other link made clear.\n\nAnd Damore was never arguing that any given woman was incapable of being a programmer or mathematician, rather, that given the population of people good at math and interested in it as a career, it's irrational to expect that 50% of them are going to be women. The wife of one of my college roommates just finished up a career working black programs for a major defense contractor - she is a wiz at communications theory and way better at math than I was. Her mother was a high level mather teacher at a top private HS. No one is going to say she was incapable of the work, but she was the exception, not the rule. It's why we should judge people as individuals, not as members of a group.\n\nRush Limbaugh once argued that women should be allowed in the military in combat roles because an army of men would beat an army of women. Although that's true, it's not how you build the best army. Using objective standards required to do any job, as long as the best woman wanting the job is better than the worst man doing the job, she should get it. That's all anyone should care about. Damore would argue the same thing.\n\nI know what Damore argued. It is exactly what you are arguing.  He said women in general weren't fit for coding. That is the topic. You are arguing the same thing.  \"Some are exceptional.\" No. History proves this is wrong.\n\nI am saying, bullsh*t. Women in general are absolutely capable and fit for it. Not just exceptional ones. Very much so. Both of you are arguing against the reality of historical fact. Here you chose to ignore historical fact.\n\nThe armed forces is a different thing. We weren't talking about that. You decided to conflate that topic with coding as if it was the same thing. Israel has experience with women in combat. So does Russia have that experience, drafting masses of women into infantry for WW2. Historically, women fight when their homeland is being overrun by hellhounds. Physically, women's bodies tend to break down in infantry roles, and they aren't as fast and strong. No woman has ever fulfilled the requirements of SEAL training at the level of men. Most can't fulfill the basic training requirements at the level of men. But, women can function very well in some roles. As aircraft pilots, in tanks, as snipers, surgeons, etcetera.\n\nThe topic of Damore's screed when he wrote it was software/tech.\n\nOr, women just aren't good at math/coding, which is why they gravitate toward communication roles.\n\nOkay, so I clicked through on the Maine Wire, and not I wast to drill a burr hole in my skull and pour bleach on my brain...\n\nIt seems probable now that we had to take the idea of gender equality too far in order to discover its clear limitations.\n\nI think it was William Blake who said \"you never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.\"\n\nMaybe for some. But I (and I suspect I'm not alone) had no confusion about sex, AKA gender.\n\nNo update on the rash of antisenitic crimes in Australia?\n\nYou can be sure TFP will find thm-but don't dare to say or you will be...."

      "text": "The first person to report strange symptoms was a CIA officer posing as a diplomat at the U.S. embassy in Cuba.\n\nIt was December 2016. He was at home, in Havana, when he was overcome by a severe headache and dizziness. He heard a loud, persistent whirring sound. And then it felt like a wave, or a beam of energy, was pressing in on him.\n\nHe thought it was a one-time thing. But two weeks later, it happened again.\n\nSoon after, several other CIA officers in Havana started to experience similar symptoms. Then it spread to the diplomats. Tina Onufer, a foreign service officer in Havana, told NBC News that the symptoms she experienced were like \"pain like I have never experienced before in my life.\" She added: \"It was as if I had been seized by some invisible hand and I couldn't move.\"\n\nThe onset of what is now called Havana Syndrome came at an inopportune moment for the outgoing Obama administration. A year-and-a-half earlier, it had re-established diplomatic relations with Cuba. That ended a nearly six-decade standoff with the Communist regime that included the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, in which the United States and the Soviet Union came close to nuclear war.\n\nDonald Trump, vying for the Cuban-American vote in Florida, had made clear on the campaign trail his opposition to the deal Barack Obama had cut with the Castros. Then, Trump won the election, and a few weeks later, Fidel Castro died.\n\nState Department officials were determined not to let Havana Syndrome undermine the new détente. Nor did Pentagon higher-ups want problems. There was widespread agreement that the opening to Cuba was overdue and that politics had stopped it from happening sooner.\n\nBut over the course of 2017 more cases piled up: diplomats, CIA agents, U.S. military personnel. First in Havana. Then in China , where several staffers had to be evacuated from the U.S. consulate in Guangzhou. Then Russia , where a veteran CIA officer, Marc Polymeropoulos, was overtaken by a wave of nausea and recurring headaches that eventually forced him to retire. By the time Joe Biden was elected to the White House, there were at least 200 suspected cases worldwide.\n\nThe American diplomatic corps was angry.\n\nEric Rubin is president of the American Foreign Service Association, which represents 17,000 foreign service officers spread across several agencies-including 13,000 in the State Department. \"We are not sure what has caused this,\" he told me, \"but we're quite sure that it's serious and that the effects on our colleagues are real and very frightening.\"\n\n\"Look, there are fair instances of fuckery,\" a former State Department official now working in another government agency said. American military and intelligence personnel generally expect more aggressive harassment while on duty overseas. \"But the targeting of diplomats is very different. Diplomats are, by definition, not supposed to be fucked with in that regard.\"\n\nRubin said that diplomats affected by Havana Syndrome \"have been treated shabbily and have not had sufficient attention paid to their really worrying situations and the real, potential lifelong consequences.\" Diplomats who had reported Havana Syndrome-like symptoms were told they were being hysterical or cautioned against making too much noise, lest it derail their career.\n\nAmong foreign service officers-behind closed doors, in text chains, in WhatsApp messages, in private Facebook groups-there was a feeling that those at the highest echelons of the U.S. government were soft-pedaling the investigation.\n\n\"Under Trump and then, at the beginning of the Biden administration, there was an inadequate response,\" a senior U.S. diplomat told me. \"This is speculation-you can't confirm this, because it's not confirmable-but a lot of us read it as a desire not to get to the bottom of this because the consequences could be very grave.\"\n\nHe explained that, just as the Warren Commission did not want to discover the Soviets had had a hand in John F. Kennedy's assassination-which would have presumably triggered a war-the White House did not want to learn that the Russians were behind Havana Syndrome.\n\nA Neurological Disorder? Or a Psychiatric One?\n\nAs if to force the White House to take action, State Department officials have portrayed Havana Syndrome in the most sinister light possible.\n\n\"They went for the most exotic hypothesis out there when they should have stuck to mundane explanations,\" Robert Bartholomew told me. Bartholomew is a medical sociologist at the University of Auckland and co-wrote a book on the subject with Dr. Robert W. Baloh, a neurologist at UCLA: \"Havana Syndrome: Mass Psychogenic Illness and the Real Story Behind the Embassy Mystery and Hysteria.\" (The book was published in 2020 by a small German academic press.)\n\nBartholomew pointed to a Senate hearing in which the assistant head of western hemisphere affairs at the State Department repeatedly referred to \"attacks\" on U.S. personnel in Havana. After he wrapped up, the department's medical director added that his office had convened \"a panel of academic experts\" and that \"the consensus was that the patterns of injuries that had so far been noted were most likely related to trauma from a non-natural source.\"\n\nThis significantly raised the stakes. It stoked diplomats' fears about what was going on and their frustration with the White House for not doing more to stop it.\n\nTo Bartholomew, an expert in social contagions, it was overblown. \"When you hear the sound of hoofbeats in the night, you first think horses. You don't think zebras,\" Bartholomew said. \"They were going for unicorns. They were going for this thing people don't even know exists.\"\n\nThat uncertainty about what or whom we were up against was the crux of the problem. There were a lot of symptoms. And there was a lot of speculation about the cause of those symptoms. But there was no medical evidence proving that anything had actually happened-or been done-to anyone.\n\nAll that is known for sure about what is called Havana Syndrome is that Americans stationed not only in Cuba, Russia and China, but also in Austria, Australia, Colombia, Vietnam and Uzbekistan, among other countries, have complained of concussion-like symptoms such as nausea, blurred vision, hearing loss, headaches, short-term memory loss, irritability, and difficulty sleeping. In many cases, they have also said they heard clicking or cricket-like sounds.\n\nA growing cadre of diplomats, CIA officers, and other officials in the American intelligence community blamed the Kremlin, which was undoubtedly alarmed by the U.S. rapprochement with Cuba. The Russians had also spent decades developing \"directed-energy weapons\" that could blast microwaves at unknowing targets, causing extensive brain damage. (Republican Senator Susan Collins, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called Russia \"one of the key suspects.\")\n\nBut many neurologists, including those who reviewed the medical histories of the first CIA officers who complained of Havana Syndrome, are unsure whether anyone claiming to suffer from Havana Syndrome has sustained any neurological damage. They are unsure about what might have caused that damage, assuming there is any. And they are unsure about whether Havana Syndrome is a neurological disorder or, as neurologists say, \"psychogenic\"-meaning, originating in one's mind. (Several neurologists were quick to add that people suffering from psychogenic illness are not \"faking it,\" and they noted that it can be hard to distinguish between neurological and psychiatric illness.)\n\nHavana Syndrome was morphing into something of a foil for contemporary America: You either believed we were being preyed upon by invisible forces. Or you thought there was something wrong with those who did.\n\n'They Wanted to Believe'\n\nIn response to mounting pressure from diplomats, the State Department commissioned two studies-one with the top-secret JASON advisory group, the other with the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.\n\nThe JASON advisory group, which was founded in 1960 by Defense Department officials worried about Soviet technological prowess, released its report in 2018. (The report came to light in September only after BuzzFeed obtained a redacted copy.) Its most important finding was that Havana Syndrome was not the result of a directed-energy attack: \"No plausible single source of energy (neither radio/microwave nor sonic) can produce both the recorded audio/video signals, and the reported medical effects.\"\n\nIn 2020, the NASEM group, which is chaired by David Relman, a Stanford professor of medicine and microbiology, completed its report . In contrast with the JASON findings, the NASEM report strongly suggested that those thought to be suffering from Havana Syndrome were victims of a directed-energy attack. It noted that \"many of the distinctive and acute signs, symptoms, and observations reported\" by various State Department employees \"are consistent with the effect of directed, pulsed radio frequency (RF) energy.\"\n\nBut there were some odd things about the NASEM report.\n\nFirst, it relied heavily on an independent University of Pennsylvania study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that had asserted there were \"neurological manifestations\" of Havana Syndrome. But the University of Pennsylvania study had come in for sharp criticism -and the NASEM study failed to acknowledge any of it.\n\nSergio Della Sala, a neurologist at the University of Edinburgh and one of the most vocal critics of the University of Pennsylvania study, said in an email that the criteria used in the study had been so broad that virtually anyone would appear to be sick, \"including you, me, the UPenn authors, the JAMA editors and of course the U.S. diplomats.\"\n\nSecond, the NASEM group had access to very incomplete information about the Havana Syndrome patients. The report itself states that due to health privacy laws, they only got information provided \"by a small number of affected employees.\"\n\nFinally, according to a State Department spokesperson, the NASEM group did not have access to the JASON report-this despite the fact that the JASON advisory group had access to classified information the NASEM group was unable to see and, no doubt, would have been greatly helped by.\n\nKenneth Foster, a biomedical engineer at the University of Pennsylvania who has criticized the NASEM report (Foster had no connection with the University of Pennsylvania study), said in an email: \"It is shocking that State had also commissioned the JASON report (which destroyed the microwave theory), but did not show the report to NASEM.\" He added: \"NASEM should have been ashamed of itself for speculating in its report about microwaves with so little scientific support.\"\n\n\"It is clear,\" he concluded, \"that they wanted to believe in some kind of directed energy attack.\"\n\nAccording to Foster, the question the NASEM group should have been asking was: Why are we jumping to the conclusion that Havana Syndrome is, in fact, a syndrome?\n\n\"I think a big challenge is we don't even know how the people who developed Havana Syndrome are getting hurt,\" Dr. Amit Sachdev, the medical director for neurology and ophthalmology at Michigan State University, told me. \"And so, if you don't know how they're getting hurt, it's very hard to study why they have their symptoms. What are they being subjected to to develop their symptoms?\"\n\nThe Federal Government Goes (Mostly) All In\n\nNone of this has stopped the federal government from taking action.\n\nIn October, President Biden signed the Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks (or HAVANA) Act into law. The law authorizes the government to cover the medical expenses for any CIA or State Department employees \"who incur qualifying injuries to the brain.\"\n\nIt has been a tricky political dance for the Biden administration. On one hand, the administration does not want to expose itself to Republican attacks that it's not doing enough to support America's spies and diplomats. On the other hand, it appears reluctant to antagonize needlessly the Russians, Chinese, Cubans or anyone else. It remains administration policy to refer to Havana Syndrome cases as \"anomalous health incidents.\"\n\nIn September, the CIA station chief in Vienna was recalled after voicing skepticism about Havana Syndrome. That same month, Ambassador Pamela Spratlen, who had been yanked out of retirement to oversee State's handling of Havana Syndrome, was suddenly forced out of her new role. On a phone call with Havana Syndrome victims, Spratlen allegedly declined to rule out the possibility that the whole thing might be attributable to mass hysteria. \"Ambassador Spratlen was not well received by some or many of the people who were affected and was perceived as not being willing to conclude that something was going on,\" the senior diplomat said.\n\nLate last month, CIA director William Burns warned Russian intelligence officials that they would pay a stiff price if the Americans determine, once and for all, that the Kremlin is responsible.\n\nAll this despite the fact that the science behind Havana Syndrome looks even more porous today than it did in late 2016.\n\nA former State Department official, who was reluctant to speak openly and upset former colleagues, said there were some big outstanding questions. If this was really the work of a sophisticated foreign intelligence agency, why hadn't they targeted the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff? Or the president? Or Mark Zuckerberg?\n\nThere was also the question of timing. Havana Syndrome arrived on the American scene at the end of a tumultuous presidential campaign that had left tens of millions of Americans feeling unsure of what came next: Was the country about to be taken over by fascists? How had we arrived at this juncture? Suddenly, every unexplained phenomenon seemed to point to something nefarious and shadowy. The deep state, Big Tech, Beijing, Moscow.\n\nIn this climate, Bartholomew said, it was hard to overstate the power of suggestion. He blamed the State Department, and Defense and the White House, for encouraging Americans to believe they had been attacked by a weapon that, he said, doesn't exist.\n\n\"Havana Syndrome is reminiscent of the setup for many UFO and monster sighting flaps,\" he said. \"After an initial sensational report, residents begin to scrutinize their environment for evidence of the perceived anomaly. Given the inaccurate nature of human perception, people start to see what they expect to see. A rustling in the bushes becomes Bigfoot, the wake of a boat is mistaken for a lake monster, and Venus is taken for a UFO.\"\n\nSecretly, government officials have been communicating with their counterparts in other countries-issuing warnings, telling them to knock it off. These officials have been convinced-by their subordinates, a classified report-that something is being done to us. They wouldn't be risking their professional reputations or, presumably, the security of the United States if they doubted as much.\n\nBut the only thing we know for sure is that we don't know why at least 200 American public servants have been seriously hurt and, in some cases, forced to retire-even though many insist on believing that we do.\n\nThe real fuckery, as it were, is not Russian agents causing American spies and diplomats a great deal of suffering. That's awful, if it's true. It's awful no matter the cause. The real fuckery is that, five years after Havana Syndrome came to America, five years after America veered off its prescribed historical-political course, we remain convinced that the very bad thing that is happening to us is being imposed from the outside-a mysterious force infiltrating our homes and warping our brains. That whatever this is must be someone else's fault. That it can't be us.\n\nPlease Support Our Reporting\n\nI'm appreciative of this writing making clear his politics in framing the report the way he did. I now know I can dismiss it entirely with respect to any importance on this topic.\n\nIf our diplomats and spies are suffering this from social contagion, we're in even worse shape than we thought.\n\nWhile it's possible, how likely is it?  The cases occurred, not in a relatively compressed time, but sporadically over several years in widely separated locations.  That they are concentrated in a particular profession/workplace is somewhat suspicious, but then both the profession and the workplaces are also plausible targets of a hostile intelligence service.  One problem with the social contagion theory is that there's no way to prove it.  Normally, if we can exclude any known alternative explanation, then an unprovable but still plausible hypothesis is the best explanation, for the time being, anyway.\n\nWhile there is no technology known that could produce these symptoms in a deliberate, directed way, neither was radiation poisoning understood for a few decades after radioactive elements were isolated.  At least in theory, Madame Curie could have eliminated a rival by slipping a teaspoonful of radium into her tea and no toxicologist at the time would have known what to look for.  In the 1980s a few American military pilots reported blinding effects when near Russian fighters.  It was speculated that lasers may have been used, though I don't know what became of that idea.\n\nHavana Syndrome reminds me of the of the videos of objects moving in bizarre ways that Navy pilots have taken.  Nobody thinks they're simply a hoax, and while there have been suggestions they are light artifacts of some kind, nothing definitive has been announced.  You'd think the Navy would be on top of something like that.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "Welcome to Douglas Murray's column, \"Things Worth Remembering,\" in which he presents great speeches that we should commit to heart. Scroll down to listen to Douglas reflect on the words of Jeannette Bougrab, spoken the day after her partner was murdered by Islamists.\n\nThis has been a week of mourning for the families of the Americans who lost their lives to Islamism in New Orleans. The attack bears all the hallmarks of the atrocities that have taken place in European capitals in the past decade. Indeed, in a disturbing coincidence, this coming week marks the 10th anniversary of one of the most appalling acts of terrorism seen in modern times.\n\nIt was on January 7, 2015, that two Islamists went into the Paris offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo , murdering a caretaker on their way in, and burst into the weekly editorial meeting. Calling for the editor, Stéphane \"Charb\" Charbonnier, and four other cartoonists by name, they proceeded to murder them all-as well as three other members of the editorial staff, one of Charb's police bodyguards, and a guest at the meeting. While fleeing the scene, the two terrorists, who turned out to be brothers, shot and killed a Muslim police officer at point-blank range.\n\nIt was the worst attack on the free press in a Western country in our lifetimes. And the massacre presaged another massacre, at a kosher supermarket in Paris days later, which served as a reminder that the Islamists have a distinct set of enemies in their literal sights. For once, albeit only for a moment, the free world seemed to rally in support of the victims. Soon afterward, world leaders-including, slightly surprisingly, the head of the Palestinian Authority, President Mahmoud Abbas, and Queen Rania and King Abdullah of Jordan , none with a glowing record on combating terrorism-marched through the streets of Paris in a show of solidarity. The slogan \"Je Suis Charlie\" was seen everywhere.\n\nBut as I pointed out promiscuously at the time, most people weren't Charlie . In fact, almost nobody was. Supporters of the free press slightly mawkishly walked through the streets of Paris with pencils in their hands, as though this was any kind of stand. As I vividly recall Mark Steyn saying at the time, the best thing those demonstrators could have done was walk through the streets of Paris holding up the cartoons of Muhammad that the paper had run-which had caused repeated attacks on their offices even before 2015.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "It has been almost four years since George Floyd's death in police custody sparked riots in American cities and protests around the world. Since then, the public, thanks to the reporting of mainstream journalists, has settled on a consensus about what happened to Floyd on the evening of May 25, 2020: officers were in the process of arresting Floyd for paying with counterfeit money at a convenience store when Officer Derek Chauvin, with conscious cruelty, subjected him to his \" signature move \"-a knee on the neck-cutting off his oxygen supply and murdering him. Officers J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane, and Tou Thao, rather than intervene, aided and abetted Chauvin's crime.\n\nIf journalism is the first draft of history, then this draft is now due for a major revision.\n\nA new documentary by Alpha News, The Fall of Minneapolis , challenges three key parts of the story, now accepted as fact:\n\nThe knee-on-the-neck hold was Chauvin's signature move, as opposed to a standard maneuver practiced by the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD).\n\nAsphyxiation was the cause of George Floyd's death.\n\nChauvin received a fair trial by an impartial jury.\n\nI had never heard of Alpha News before this documentary. The producer of the film, Liz Collin, was a successful reporter and anchor at WCCO, Channel 4, in Minneapolis for many years before the death of George Floyd derailed her career. The sticking point was that her husband, former lieutenant and president of Minneapolis police union Bob Kroll, defended the four officers who arrested Floyd, denounced the rioters, who had recently captured and burned down a police precinct, as a \"terrorist\" movement, and highlighted Floyd's long rap sheet in a letter to police union members.\n\nBoth Kroll and Collin received an intense cancellation-including a protest outside their home-which led WCCO to push Collin out of her anchoring job, and eventually led her to leave WCCO and join Alpha News. While there, she teamed up with the film's director, Dr. JC Chaix, a former police officer and volunteer firefighter, to make The Fall of Minneapolis .\n\nWhen people think of George Floyd, they think of a viral clip captured and uploaded by a bystander. The infamous clip appeared to show Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds (later amended to 9 minutes and 29 seconds ) along with Floyd's bone-chilling screams: \"I can't breathe!\"; \"Mama!\"; \"I'm gonna die!\"\n\nLike everyone who watched this clip, I was horrified when I saw it. I could not understand why Chauvin continued to keep his knee on Floyd's neck when he clearly couldn't breathe. I couldn't even understand why they put him belly-down on the pavement in the first place-a humiliating and uncomfortable position-rather than in the back of the squad car.\n\nBut the viral clip, as so many often do, started in the middle of the story. When Judge Peter Cahill allowed full footage (with multiple angles) to become public in August 2020, it showed three things that were not obvious from the viral clip:\n\nFirst, the officers spent several minutes trying to get Floyd into the back of the squad car before agreeing, at Floyd's request, to place him on the ground instead. (Floyd had complained of claustrophobia in the back of the squad car.)\n\nSecond, Chauvin's knee was not on Floyd's neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds. It was probably on his neck for at most 4 minutes, after which it appeared to be \"above the shoulder blades,\" as one of the prosecution's own witnesses conceded during Chauvin's criminal trial in 2021.\n\nThird, and most importantly, Floyd was saying that he couldn't breathe before he was placed on the ground, as this clip from the documentary shows below:\n\nThe court of public opinion may have made up its mind based on a single out-of-context clip. But Chauvin's trial in 2021 represented a chance to revise that consensus in light of all the evidence. In order to convict Chauvin of felony murder -which differs from more serious murder charges in that it requires neither premeditation nor intent to kill-the prosecution had to prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Among other things, they had to prove that (1) Chauvin's actions constituted assault (or attempted assault), and (2) that Chauvin's actions caused the death of George Floyd.\n\nThe documentary throws both claims into doubt. What I discovered by making my own calls and confirming the documents shown in the documentary is that these key claims are not certain at all.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "A police officer who pulls over speeding black motorists-and only black motorists-isn't protecting \"law and order.\" He's engaging in invidious discrimination. So too the university administrators who suddenly discover they are free speech absolutists only when student protesters call for the death of their Jewish classmates.\n\nIn January, a junior at Columbia University, Khymani James, told a disciplinary committee at the school that Zionists \"don't deserve to live.\" \"Be grateful that I'm just not going out and murdering Zionists,\" he instructed them. Then, James headed back to campus, scot-free. (If he hadn't also posted a recording of the meeting to his social media site, discovered four months later, there might never have been any repercussions at all.)\n\nIt was the sort of stunt a star quarterback for the football team could have gotten away with a generation or two ago, when college coaches might have been eager to sweep sexual assault allegations under the rug. Or the son of a major donor to the university. James apparently enjoys a level of privilege every bit as sacrosanct: as a leader of the pro-Palestinian encampment at an Ivy League school, he could threaten Jewish students at his pleasure, university codes of conduct be damned.\n\nIf there was ever doubt whether calling for the genocide of Jews violates Columbia's code of conduct, on April 23, Rep. Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR) asked four Columbia University professors and administrators this explicitly. Every one of them said: \"Yes, it does.\" As for the encampments, they violate Columbia's Rules of University Conduct , disruptive behavior standards, university policy regarding \"tenting,\" disciplinary rules against \"vandalism/damage to property,\" unauthorized \"access/egress\" rules as well as Columbia's policy against harassment, according to a Notice to Encampment circulated by the university.\n\nIn the last two weeks, self-proclaimed pro-Palestinian protesters have set up encampments at dozens of American universities. Heedless of university restrictions against intimidation and harassment, they demonstrate where, when, and how they like. They cry \"Go back to Poland,\" \"baby killers,\" and \"globalize the Intifada\" at Jewish students. They wave the flags of designated terrorist groups, like Hezbollah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and hold up signs that beckon \" Al-Qasam's Next Targets ,\" with an arrow pointing at Jewish counterprotesters. (Al-Qassam is the wing of Hamas that carried out the October 7 massacre.)\n\nOn campuses that have-for a decade or more-repeated ad nauseam that priority one was the creation of a \"safe, inclusive, supportive, and fair\" community, the pro-Palestinian demonstrators wave Hezbollah flags, wear Hamas headbands, and conceal their faces with masks. They ignore all time, place, and manner restrictions on student demonstrations set by their schools, and refuse all demands from the universities to take down their tents or to move their protests elsewhere. And at Columbia, until April 30, when protesters took over Columbia's Hamilton Hall and the NYPD was at last called in, they almost got away with it.\n\nAt UCLA, protesters blocked students from entering the library during the midterms, asking those who wished to enter: \"Are you a Zionist?\" After a Jewish girl was reportedly beaten unconscious by pro-Palestinian protesters, pro-Israel counterprotesters at UCLA arrived in masks and hoodies, shooting off fireworks, firing tear gas, and throwing objects at the pro-Hamas protesters and attempting to physically destroy the encampments. Only then did UCLA call in the police to remove the encampments.\n\nInstead of immediately suspending the pro-Hamas protesters for breaking university rules, for weeks, university administrations instead chose to \"negotiate\" with the rule-breakers. At Columbia, the administration offered to review its policy on \"socially responsible investing\" (read: divesting from the world's only Jewish state), and offered to \"make investments in health and education in Gaza.\" At Brown, the administration promised protesters that they would put divestment from Israel on the agenda . At Northwestern, the administration meekly tossed rewards, including the promise to establish a full-ride scholarship for Palestinian students and guaranteed faculty jobs for Palestinian academics.\n\nAt Columbia, protesters rejected the offers, knowing they had the upper hand. When police arrived to break up the encampments, Columbia faculty in orange vests linked arms to form a human wall against the police, shielding the rule-breakers.\n\nThe lengths administrators have gone to placate, encourage, and embolden the pro-Hamas protesters in the past weeks provide a signal reminder that there are at least two sets of rules governing elite universities today: one for the favored, protected class; the other for everyone else. And in case anyone has any doubt which category Jewish students fall into, the unwillingness of universities to enforce their own codes of conduct against pro-Hamas protesters in the months since October 7 should disabuse them.\n\nConsider how racist speech (or even racially insensitive speech) has been received on virtually any major American campus for decades.\n\nIn 2017, an anonymous jerk put flyers up around American University's campus. The flyers displayed a Confederate flag, a stem of raw cotton, and read \"Huzzah for Dixie\" and the like.\n\nAmerican University immediately launched into emergency response mode, treating the flyers as a criminal threat. It published CCTV video and solicited help from the public in identifying the man who posted the flyers. An all points bulletin called \"CRIME ALERT\" went out for the man's arrest. The New York Times covered the incident; the words \"free speech\" do not appear once in the article. Instead, it approvingly noted that in a previous incident-when bananas were found hanging from nooses around campus-the FBI had been called to investigate.\n\nNor could I find any evidence of any free speech organization rushing to defend the man who posted the flyers-nor the racist provocateurs in any of dozens of similar incidents. No prominent \"free speech absolutists\" appear to have considered the expressive value of \"Huzzah for Dixie\" worth defending. Nor did pundits claim that inviting law enforcement to investigate such acts of hate-i.e., \"calling the police on your own students\"-was in any sense inappropriate or disproportionate. In almost every single case-at schools like Stanford, Johns Hopkins, Michigan State, University of Florida, Duke, and American University-where a symbolic noose was discovered on a campus, it was treated as a criminal threat, never as speech.\n\nAfter the Huzzah for Dixie flyers were found, the president of American University quickly issued a statement: \"I ask you to join me in standing together and show that we will not be intimidated. AU will respond strongly to attempts designed to harm and create fear,\" she wrote. \"When one of us is attacked, all of us are attacked.\"\n\nToday, in the face of months of bloodthirsty cries aimed at Jewish students (\"globalize the Intifada\"), university presidents line up to assure the protesters of their right to free speech.\n\nIn the abstract, if \"Huzzah for Dixie\" is worth the full mobilization of university resources and law enforcement, then waving the flag of a terrorist group, or writing \"burn you filthy zio\" to a student chat, or telling Jewish students to \"go back to Poland\" where millions of Jews were murdered in gas chambers, or pulling down the American flag over a statue of John Harvard and replacing it with the Palestinian flag, or painting \"Ziosgetfuckt\" on UPenn's statue of Ben Franklin, or calling Jews \"Hitler's children\"-all insults hurled at Jews on campus-are at least as menacing.\n\nBut in practice, the two types of incidents-rather, the two targets of the incidents-are treated entirely differently. Punishment is meted out swiftly and mercilessly, and with no consideration for free speech principles, any time Confederate flag flyers are posted, any time students hold culturally insensitive themed frat parties , any time colleges uncover student use of the N-word while in high school (or even a word in Mandarin that sounds like the N-word), or even when students or faculty make the familiar conservative argument that affirmative action sets black students up to fail. Rinse and repeat and repeat.\n\nSpeech on college campuses has been stultifyingly narrow-and very far from free-for decades. That pro-Hamas students cheer freely for \"intifada\" doesn't make it any freer now. The fact that certain students are allowed to call for the death of their Jewish classmates does not herald a new era of free expression. It only underscores that some bigotries enjoy the official sanction of these schools, and are accepted, tolerated, and rewarded with special dispensations and, indeed, goodies.\n\nUse of the N-word on campus or misgendering a classmate will no doubt be met with as swift punitive consequences as they have been for decades, as have a vast and more minute array of \"microaggressions.\" I invite anyone who doubts this to parade through any of our elite campuses with insulting cartoon depictions of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nAfter weeks of violent, destructive protest, which left campuses trashed and buildings damaged and graffitied, administrators have at last begun to enforce their own rules and call in the police. Perhaps they felt they had no choice: commencement ceremonies loom and lawsuits, recently filed by Jewish students, are on the way.\n\nBut watch the marble carefully as university administrators spin the cups. When a favored group is attacked, they discover a \"community safety\" concern with remarkable alacrity. When it's a disfavored group, suddenly the cup reveals \"free expression.\" The game is fixed, and the administrators show their hands. \"Community safety,\" or was it \"free speech\"? Surprise! They don't believe in either.\n\nAbigail Shrier is the New York Times bestselling author of Bad Therapy: Why the Kids Aren't Growing Up .\n\nRead all of our recent campus coverage here and subscribe to The Free Press:\n\nI could only stand to watch the first minute and a half of the tape of Mr./Ms. James' (I couldn't quite follow his/her/their pronouns) hearing.

Defeat in Vietnam bred a generation of military reformers, men such as Col. John Boyd USAF, Col. Mike Wyly USMC, and Col. Huba Wass de Czege USA, each of whom led a major effort to reorient his service. Today, the landscape is barren. Not a military voice is heard calling for thoughtful, substantive change. Just more money, please.\n\nSuch a moral and intellectual collapse of the officer corps is one of the worst disasters that can afflict a military because it means it cannot adapt to new realities. It is on its way to history's wastebasket. The situation brings to mind an anecdote an Air Force friend, now a military historian, liked to tell some years ago. Every military, he said, occasionally craps in its own mess kit. The Prussians did it in 1806, after which they designed and put into service a much improved new model messkit, through the Scharnhorst military reforms. The French did it in 1870, after which they took down from the shelf an old-model messkit-the mass, draft army of the First Republic-and put it back in service. The Japanese did it in 1945, after which they threw their mess kit away, swearing they would never eat again. And we did it in Korea, in Vietnam, and now in four new wars. So far, we've had the only military that's just kept on eating.\n\nWhy? The reasons fall in two categories, substantive and structural. Substantively, at the moral level-Colonel Boyd's highest and most powerful level-our officers live in a bubble. Even junior officers inhabit a world where they hear only endless, hyperbolic praise of \"the world's greatest military ever.\" They feed this swill to each other and expect it from everyone else. If they don't get it, they become angry. Senior officers' bubbles, created by vast, sycophantic staffs, rival Xerxes's court. Woe betide the ignorant courtier who tells the god-king something he doesn't want to hear. (I know-I've done it, often.)\n\nAt Boyd's next level, the mental, our officers are not professionals. They are merely craftsman. They have learned what they do on a monkey-see, monkey-do basis and know no more. What defines a professional-historically there were only three professions, law, medicine, and theology-is that he has read, studied, and knows the literature of his field. The vast majority of our officers read no serious military history or theory. A friend who teaches at a Marine Corps school told me the most he can now get majors to read is two pages. Another friend, teaching at an Army school, says, \"We are back to drawing on the cave wall.\"\n\nAs culpable as our officers are for these failings, they are not the whole story. Officers are also victims of three structural failures, each of which is enough to lay an armed service low.\n\nThe first, and possibly the worst, is an officer corps vastly too large for its organization-now augmented by an ant-army of contractors, most of whom are retired officers. A German Panzer division in World War II had about 21 officers in its headquarters. Our division headquarters are cities. Every briefing-and there are many, the American military loves briefings because they convey the illusion of content without offering any-is attended by rank-upon-rank of horse-holders and flower-strewers, all officers.\n\nThe pathologies that flow from this are endless. Command tours are too short to accomplish anything, usually about 18 months, because behind each commander is a long line of fellow officers eagerly awaiting their lick at the ice-cream cone. Decisions are pulled up the chain because the chain is laden with surplus officers looking for something to do. Decisions are committee-consensus, lowest common denominator, which Boyd warned is usually the worst of all possible alternatives. Nothing can be changed or reformed because of the vast number of players defending their \"rice bowls.\" The only measurable product is entropy.\n\nThe second and third structural failings are related because both work to undermine moral courage and character, which the Prussian army defined as \"eagerness to make decisions and take responsibility.\" They are the \"up or out\" promotion system and \"all or nothing\" vesting for retirement at 20 years. \"Up or out\" means an officer must constantly curry favor for promotion because if he is not steadily promoted he must leave the service. \"All or nothing\" says that if \"up or out\" pushes him out before he has served 20 years, he leaves with no pension. (Most American officers are married with children.)\n\nIt is not difficult to see how these two structural failings in the officer corps morally emasculate our officers and all too often turn them, as they rise in rank and near the magic 20 years, into ass-kissing conformists. Virtually no other military in the world has these policies, for obvious reasons.\n\nOf these two types of failings, the structural are probably the most damaging. They are also the easiest to repair. The Office of the Secretary of Defense, the president, and Congress could quickly fix all of them. Why don't they? Because they only look at the defense budget, and these are not directly budgetary issues. They merely determine, in large measure, whether we win or lose.\n\nFixing the substantive problems is harder because those fixes require changes in organizational culture. OSD cannot order our officers to come out from the closed system, fortified with hubris, that they have placed around themselves to protect the poor dears from ever hearing anything upsetting, however true. Congress cannot withhold pay from those officers who won't read. Only our officers themselves can fix these deficiencies. Will they? The problem is circular: not until they leave their bubble.\n\nIf American military officers want to know, or even care, why we keep losing, they need only look in the mirror. They seem to do that most of the time anyway, admiring their now-tattered plumage. Behind them in the glass, figures in turbans dance and laugh.\n\nWilliam S.

      "text": "My column in the March/April issue, \" An Officer Corps That Can't Score ,\" brought a number of responses. Among the more thoughtful was the question, \"If becoming military professionals requires that we read books, what books should be read?\"\n\nThe first answer is, \"A lot of them.\" When Marine Corps General John Kelly met several years ago with the seminar I taught for the Marines' Expeditionary Warfare School, he told my students (captains), \"I read a thousand books, then I understood war.\"\n\nFortunately, there are Cliff's Notes : the canon, a list of seven books that, if read in the order given, will take the student from the First Generation of modern war (1650-1865) into the Fourth (the present and future). They are not a substitute for General Kelly's thousand books, but they offer an intellectual framework without which it is difficult to make sense of events, whether historical or current.\n\nThe first book is Charles E. White's The Enlightened Soldier . It is a biography of Gerhard von Scharnhorst, who led the successful Prussian military reform movement that followed Prussia's defeat by Napoleon in 1806. This book explains why you are reading the rest of the canon. Scharnhorst lived at the beginning of the professionalization of European officer corps, an effort in which he played a central part. The Enlightened Soldier focuses on his work to educate other Prussian officers, including a lieutenant named Clausewitz, to get them reading, writing, and discussing ideas about war. When I taught a seminar at Quantico on the canon, my students, Marine officers, said this was their favorite book.\n\nThe second book is Robert Doughty's The Seeds of Disaster . Doughty was the longtime chairman of the Military History department at West Point, and he is the top English-language expert on the French Army in the 20th century. The French Army developed Second Generation war during and after World War I, and the U.S. Army and Marine Corps absorbed it from the French. The Seeds of Disaster is the history of our military doctrine. Every American officer to whom I have loaned my copy has said when returning it, \"This is us.\" It is the only somewhat dry book in the canon, but the reader may skip the parts on French Army organization. It is the doctrinal development that is essential.\n\nThe next book, Stormtroop Tactics by Bruce Gudmundsson, is the history of the development of Third Generation maneuver warfare by the German Army in World War I. Blitzkrieg was conceptually complete by 1918. Not merely new tactics, the Third Generation also embodied a radically different military culture, one with roots in Prussia that went back to the Scharnhorst reforms. This culture focused outward on the situation, the enemy, and the result the situation required rather than inward on orders, rules, processes, etc. The reader will quickly perceive that our U.S. armed forces are tactically and culturally almost 100 years out of date.\n\nThe next three books directly compare the Second and Third Generations. Book four, Martin Samuel's Command or Control? , compares British and German tactics and doctrine from the late 19th century into World War I. There is good reason why the British Army has often been described as lions led by asses. Book five is again by Robert Doughty, The Breaking Point . This volume, which is not dry, is the story of what happened when the Second and Third Generations met head-on in the German campaign against France in 1940. France had more tanks and better tanks than the Germans; she was defeated by her own doctrine, which we still follow. Book six, Martin van Creveld's Fighting Power , compares and contrasts the Second Generation U.S. Army in World War II with the Wehrmacht-not on the battlefield but as institutions. What emerges is two radically different institutional cultures, each consistent with its army's doctrine.\n\nThe final book in the canon is again by Martin van Creveld, and it is the most important book written thus far on Fourth Generation war: The Transformation of War . Creveld describes the state's loss of the monopoly on war it established in the Peace of Westphalia and the consequences thereof, including how state armed forces now find themselves fighting non-state entities to which they usually lose.\n\nSo the canon. If a bold reader thinks he might manage more than seven books, there are two others I would recommend. The first is Creveld's The Rise and Decline of the State . Although written after The Transformation of War , it is functionally a prequel in that it offers the history on which the theory in Transformation is based.\n\nThe second book is the best naval history in decades, Andrew Gordon's The Rules of the Game . The Royal Navy developed Third Generation war starting around the middle of the 18th century and had effectively institutionalized it by the Napoleonic Wars. The Rules of the Game tells the story of how and why they lost it in the 19th century and returned to inward-focused rigidity. It is a tale with much contemporary relevance, as signaling lies at its heart.\n\nWere the American military intellectually serious, our services would require that the canon be read by all officers, at least by the time they are majors. (I would recommend before commissioning.) But it is not. The canon, while not called that, was previously listed in order on the official Marine Corps Commandant's Reading List. In the latest version, all the books are gone. The Corps' new motto, it seems, is lege minus curre magis -read less, run more.\n\nWilliam S.

      "text": "Around the time of the Philando Castile shooting, I wrote the following :\n\nThe deep roots of the problem of police brutality and unjustified killings are complex. But some of the shallow reasons are relatively simple. Police are, increasingly, trained to treat suspects as a threat first, and as members of the citizenry they are bound to serve and protect second.\n\nThis week, in the wake of Jeronimo Yanez's incredible but frankly unsurprising acquittal, I wrote a follow-up:\n\nSt. Anthony Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez is clearly responsible for his actions on July 6, 2016, in both a moral and a legal sense. But from watching the footage of the shooting, it's plain that his actions sprang not from malice or cruelty but from pure, blind panic - a panic that his partner did not participate in, and for which no adequate justification has been provided.\n\nAs David French has argued in a pointed criticism of the verdict in the case, irrational panic is not supposed to be a legal defense against culpability. But by the same token, it's not hard to understand why it's hard to convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that an officer's fear was unreasonable, which is the standard for criminal conviction. In a strict sense, juries are reluctant to acknowledge themselves the peers of an accused officer in such a circumstance, and so to pass judgment on that officer's judgment, however fatally poor.\n\nBut what if officer Yanez were a robot?\n\nIn that case, there would be no question of morally identifying with the officer, or a juror questioning whether he or she could really know what it's like to be in that situation. The case would likely be open and shut. It just wouldn't be a case against the robot, but against the manufacturer, who put an incredibly dangerous machine on the street without properly testing whether it functioned properly.\n\nBluntly, if officer Yanez were a robot, the corporation responsible for building him would be staring at a massive lawsuit, and a very expensive product recall. Why isn't the same thing true of the St. Anthony Police Department?\n\nJust as my pieces on the shooting advocate deescalation, I tend to practice deescalation in my writing, which is to say, I try to get outside of my own feelings to understand them, and the feelings of those on the other \"side\" (presuming I have a \"side\"), and to think about practical solutions not only in technical terms but in terms of navigating that minefield of emotion. But I have to admit, sometimes that feels inadequate.\n\nMy colleague Rod Dreher asks whether there's a relationship between our state of permanent war and our apparent acceptance of the use of extreme force by the police, even in cases where it was clearly inappropriate. Another colleague, Pratik Chougule, asks whether America's childrearing practices are raising up a generation of instinctive authoritarians , both deferential to those with power and demanding that that power be used regularly to demonstrate that authority's care and concern.\n\nI think they are both on to something. We live in an age, and a society, where individuals increasingly feel powerless, and are turning to authority to salve that feeling, vesting it with ever greater scope and power, but receiving no salve, both because external authority can never substitute for self-assurance, and because the same forces that leave individuals feeling powerless - from social media to mass migration to the proliferation of powerful weapons to finance capitalism - also hamstring authority.\n\nSo a productive politics for our time has got to fight a two-front war: against the causes of our pervasive social anxiety, and against the false salves for that anxiety that have already proved far too appealing.\n\nAnd it still has to advocate for productive reforms - like better deescalation training for police - that presume a politics that cares more about results, and an authority that is more confident in its position, than is generally the case.\n\nNoah Millman, senior editor, is an opinion journalist, critic, screenwriter, and filmmaker who joined The American Conservative in 2012.

      "text": "The death of a police officer in the line of duty affects every other officer-and everyone else who has ever been one. Cops do not allow their brothers and sisters to die in vain; we honor them by learning from their deaths, by ensuring that others may live through their ultimate sacrifice.\n\nThank God the two Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies ambushed on Sept. 12 survived their attack. And two police officers shot in Louisville, Kentucky on Sept. 23 will recover .\n\nYet there are still lessons to be learned from these horrific encounters. The lessons aren't just for our police officers-they apply to all of us.\n\nThe deputies were in their car when they were ambushed, and each was struck by multiple gunshots. As the gunman ran away, the female deputy got out of her patrol car, radioed for help, and then applied a tourniquet to her wounded partner to save his life. Did I mention she had been shot through the jaw? Her radio transmission was remarkably clear for someone with a mouth full of blood and searing pain. She is the definition a hero. Even among cops, her story represents a special kind of \"unbreakable.\"\n\nBut there are a lot of cops who fit that description, and a lot of heroic police work happens every day in communities large and small throughout our nation. On the other hand, the perpetrator is clearly the opposite-a coward. That's the lesson here, a lesson in contrasts.\n\nWe see another contrast in this incident-a contrast in values. By now, many of us have seen the footage of protesters showing up at the hospital where the deputies were transported to block the exits and entrances and to express their hope for the officers' deaths. They threatened more violence.\n\nWhat that says is there's no longer any middle ground. The contrasts are too stark. We can side with a working mother, someone's daughter and neighbor, who is willing to risk her life for her community and her partner. Or we can side with those who laugh at her being shot and choking on her own blood, her only sin being the badge she wears. The choice is ours, and the distinction has been made crystal clear for us.\n\nIf your first impulse is to burn down the city after any use of force by the police, before any information comes out on the justification (or lack thereof), then you have chosen your side. Those who have chosen this side are unlikely to be dissuaded from their views, because running on pure emotion leaves little room for logic or facts. Sadly, we know that those who choose rage over reason will have a compliant media ready to reaffirm their rejection of this country, its values, and those guardians of the peace who enforce its laws and maintain its order.\n\nOur other choice is to choose the rule of law and to accept the responsibilities required for a civil society. We can remain vigilant in our requirement that government be held accountable for its actions while still supporting law enforcement as a core function of that government. We can reject calls to defund and even abolish the police, and instead seek to improve policing through better training and hiring, through bringing the best and brightest into the profession.\n\nChoosing this side requires that we exercise our responsibilities to our fellow citizen as often as we exercise our own rights. And finally, it requires that we always clearly identify the hero from the coward. We must choose wisely, but we all must choose.\n\nRandy Petersen is a senior researcher for the policing initiative at the Texas Public Policy Foundation. He spent 21 years as a police officer working in the patrol, investigations, training, and administrative divisions before retiring in 2014 and becoming a director of a police academy in Texas.\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

Leah Lauderback spoke on how the LIT is working to change policy, change minds, and create opportunities for LGBTQ+ members of the military during an interview with @airandspace . #PrideMonth2022 https://t.co/VGZrEB05WA\n\n- United States Space Force (@SpaceForceDoD) June 1, 2022\n\nA dissenting reader writes, and has given me permission to post:\n\nI've read you with interest since your BeliefNet days.  I've always appreciated your insights even if I disagreed, and broadly shared you outlook and sensibilities pretty closely.  But I have to write to give you a perspective you perhaps have gotten little of, because on one topic I've been ever more perplexed at what you're describing: the seemingly wokening U.S. military.\n\nI'm an active-duty military officer who's served at home and across the world in division-level headquarters and higher, with special operations teams, and in the Pentagon.   I'm not important or a policymaker, but am close enough to see what the world looks like from the top of the military hierarchy, and have been able to see what the military has been like over the past several years from the top, middle, and bottom.\n\nAnd, well, the woke-ization of the military you've been describing more and more just doesn't exist.\n\nCertain facts you build on do--there are trans servicemembers, for example.  The sort of language about pronouns or DEI that's found elsewhere in American culture can be found in the DoD as well.  But the overall narrative is just...off.\n\nI want to be clear, this isn't about me disagreeing with you, thinking the changes you describe are good or neutral rather than bad.  I simply don't see the sort of large transformation you seem to at all.  And forgive me for saying, but if the military were undergoing a woke revolution, I would know about it.\n\nLike I said, you can find trans people, DEI language, etc in the military.  Especially in an open democracy like ours, any cultural trend is going to be reflected in the armed forces.  But in the military all of those trends are light years behind corporate America, state & local governments, and American culture broadly.  The overall description your recent writing on this provides just doesn't match what actually exists here.\n\nFrom your posts, here's what it seems to me is going on:\n\nFirst, the nature of your writing and outlook leads to you getting a lot of emails and comments with examples of wokeism in the military, creating a sense of approaching avalanche, a cultural torrent engulfing the institution.  Outliers and anecdotes become a compelling narrative.\n\nSecond, you seem to hear from a fair number of retired service members or those with a one-degree-removed experience of the current military, whose own impressions are themselves based largely on what they hear from conservative media.  They in turn interpret outlier or decontextualized events through the lens of what they \"know.\"  Even current active-duty members can be prone to this, when it comes to other parts of the military they're not familiar with.  A soldier at Fort Hood might hear about an advisory concerning pronoun use and generdere language at the Air Force Academy, for example--he has no more knowledge of the situation at the Air Force Academy than anyone else who read about it online, but if he talks about it it sounds like his complaint is coming from an insider.\n\nThird, situations and incidents get simply misinterpreted.  What sparked me to write was your recent post here: https://www.theamericanconservative.com/diversity-is-our-strength-they-lied/ . When you say \"The Pentagon is talking about recruiting and promoting for characteristics other than the ability to fight wars,\" that's just...flatly inaccurate.  If you look again at the Military Times story you quote from, it's closer to the exact opposite: the Special Operations community promoting for a certain subset of skills that are less relevant now than they were means a LESS capable force that's LESS able to successfully handle the parts of special operations that are less kinetic.  Look at these quotes again:\n\n\"Part of that might look like more of a focus on the civil affairs and psychological operations parts of SOCOM , the organizations that do more of the \"hearts and minds\" work before a conflict gets to the point where operators are going after high-value targets in the middle of the night.\n\n-\"When someone has taken time out of the deployment churn to further their education or take a position outside the prescribed pipeline, \"it just, it doesn't compute somehow in these [selection and promotion] boards.\"\n\nIt's saying that in the last 20 years the door-kicking, nighttime raid aspect of special ops has been prioritized, to the point that people whose careers paths don't fit that mold aren't promoted nearly as often...but that we need to change that to successfully complete the sorts of hearts-and-minds, foreign civil and military-to-military engagement that's also a critical parts of special operations.  Exactly the sorts of mission sets we tended to fail horribly at in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe line about being okay if the initial results don't go smoothly means, in context, being all right with the inevitable friction as this shift in internal cultural emphasis takes place (and again, the key cultural shift is between prioritization of different traditional special ops roles).  The trans/DEI stuff was just a colorful aside to the main point.\n\nBut if I may say so, you saw the trans/DEI stuff and couldn't take in anything else.  You (mis) interpreted the entire story through that lens, as if SOCOM were mandating a quota of trans SEALs.  And it caused you to miss the story itself.  This is an example of a military command becoming MORE capable by  identifying gaps in its proficiency and addressing them.\n\nThe U.S. military has a mixed record in Iraq and Afghanistan, to put it mildly.  This story is about a course correction to that, which in other circumstances you'd be among the first to approve.\n\nThere's a fourth apparent cause to how your coverage of this issue has become exaggerated, which is that (and I apologize for putting it bluntly) you seem to fall for stories that either didn't happen or didn't happen the way they're presented.  I recall some time ago you published an account from a reservist JAG Corps Major who'd posted on Facebook a picture of a Jan 6 guy in the Capitol with a Confederate flag with a comment that could be interpreted as supportive (I don't know the Major's intention, but his comment certainly could be interpreted that way).  You published his account of not just being reprimanded but being told by a superior he was being surveilled.  To anyone familiar with the military in general and the Army JAG Corps in particular, much of his story rang false.  His description of the severity and rarity of his punishment was misleading, and his account otherwise got pretty fantastical.  If you're not familiar with the military and don't run the story by people who are (and who aren't emotionally invested in the narrative at stake), a wildly implausible story can seem plausible.\n\nThe U.S. military has struggled quite a bit with strategy and the highest \"why\" questions...why are we fighting here, why are we fighting the way we're fighting, etc.  But the military is very, very good at tactical engagement, and that's still the case.  Not long ago you linked a Chinese recruiting ad to show how China is still focused on martial virtue unlike our woke military.  Some time ago you did the same thing with a Russian recruiting ad.  Recent events in Ukraine should show how wildly unreliable a country's own recruiting ads are as measures of anything except advertising skill.  In fact, look up the battle of Kasham in 2018, when a small US force in Syria absolutely annihilated a larger Russian Wagner Group force with relative ease.  I don't mean to be overconfident here--I'm very familiar with risks and capability gaps we face as well--but it's impossible to deny that the U.S. military is incomparably superior to the Russian at any battlefield metric, no matter how un-woke and manly the latter might present itself as.\n\nMuch of the woke stuff that exists comes down to this: we want any American to be able to serve *and not feel like an interloper while doing so.*  I'm certainly not going to pretend that the balance is always right or that some units or commands don't sometimes get it quite wrong in one direction or the other.  But the overall narrative one finds in your posts on this just isn't accurate.  It's like if someone were regularly posting stories of serious crimes in New Orleans and presenting New Orleans as a crime-ridden hellhole where you can scarcely walk down the street without getting assaulted or robbed.  Even if the stories themselves are true or at least contain an element of truth, the overall narrative would be false.\n\nIf I can say one more thing, on a different but related topic, of our warmongering in Russia: I promise you everyone is aware of the nuclear risks.  Vice leaves virtue with no good options, and Russia's actions leave us with none likewise.  We can either leave Ukraine to its fate and allow the entire post-WWII settlement in international law to be cast aside and return to a world where wars of conquest are accepted, or risk further escalation.  It's worth remembering that in 2014, with Crimea, we already tried option 1 and leaned on Ukraine to de-escalate and not provoke a wider war, and it clearly didn't work out as we'd hoped.  Obviously reasonable minds can differ on this, and we might be wrong in our approach now, but no one is blase to the risks or blind to the situation.  Everyone is honestly doing their best here.  And to be honest, I'm kind of amazed that someone like you would encourage people to watch Tucker Carlson for the truth on this issue in particular, after the pretty scandalous way he hyped up the biolabs chimera, for all that on domestic politics Carlson had been an insightful voice.\n\nI genuinely appreciate this constructive criticism, and will take it to heart going forward. Reader, thank you.\n\nIf y'all have anything to say about this topic and can't post it below, email me at rod -- at -- amconmag -- dot -- com , and I'll post the better letters I receive. Advance warning: I'm deluged with mail, so it you want to make sure I see it, put \"WOKE MILITARY\" in the subject line.\n\nUPDATE: Lots of mail on this! Let's get started:\n\nRespectfully to your writer - many public school teachers told me the same thing years ago when I pointed out examples of schools going out of their way to push racial politics and LBGT agenda. Now it's pretty clear schools are completely infected top to bottom with it.\n\nWhen you have no less than the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the JCS pushing Kendi's nonsense, you're at the top of the rollercoaster and headed for decline.\n\nWith schools there are alternatives, but there's only one military, and that should be an issue for every American.\n\nAnother:\n\nIn response to the military service member who recently emailed you to refute the notions being expressed about the condition of the military, I'd like to reject two of his claims and make a point about another one:\n\n1) \" a small US force in Syria absolutely annihilated a larger Russian Wagner Group force with relative ease..... it's impossible to deny that the U.S. military is incomparably superior to the Russian at any battlefield metric, no matter how un-woke and manly the latter might present itself as\" That statement is a mischaracterization of the event he mentioned from 2018 and likely mistaken regarding the state of readiness of the US military. The 2018 event in Syria he mentioned was a small number of special operations soldiers getting into a very limited engagement and then calling in a massive amount of fire power from planes and heavy guns that were both able to operate with impunity.\n\nThere is not one single soldier, airman, sailor, or marine serving in the US military that has ever been in a real battle. And most of the experience the military has accumulated over the past two decades is not relevant to conventional armed conflict. If our planes are in real danger, our artillery is in real danger, and our information warfare and communications capabilities are restricted, then we'd all of sudden find ourselves in a completely different ball game and I hope the military is starting to take that seriously and is starting to train for real battle more and under as realistic conditions as possible as the Russians are getting the best training in the world right now and despite how it looks their military has actually been fairing pretty well given the circumstances and are likely to win what would have been a very challenging war for any one, including us.\n\nMost special operations skills have no use in battle and in a battle they are just glorified dismounted infantrymen and/or better recon or special mission soldiers but there won't be that many of those relevant to the size of our very oversized for conventional conflict special operations forces. The special operations forces should be shrunk and most of its current and future personnel, who are among the most motivativated and dedicated to their jobs in the military, should be in line units. Which leads to the second point in your readers article I'd like to disagree with:\n\n2) \"but that we need to change that to successfully complete the sorts of hearts-and-minds, foreign civil and military-to-military engagement that's also a critical parts of special operations.  Exactly the sorts of mission sets we tended to fail horribly at in Iraq and Afghanistan.\"\n\nI disagree with this to essentially the maximum possible degree. According to the secret SIGAR (Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction) findings that the Washington Post got their hands on: eighty percent of Afghanistan reconstruction funds never entered the country, huge amounts of Afghan gov spending were spent on wasted projects that seem to just be contractor scams (Western contractors!), huge amounts of other spending went to a mostly (some were great!) NGO ecosystem that was largely just a giant parasite, the local governments we set up were corrupt and oftentimes (bizarrely!) rife with pedophila, and crime and corruption were rampant. It doesn't matter how good your psychological operations personnel are, the best propaganda in the world won't be able to psyop a population into supporting that mess. And I think the US gov should be doing much, much less in regards to psyops, not more.\n\nAs for DEI. Well, DEI is mostly a scam, sort of like a mafia protection racket that demands regular payments or else they'll sick the Culture on you. The US military is already full of contracting scams, it certainly doesn't need another one, especially since DEI can additionally have a great many little effects that while individually small, can as a whole have not immediately apparent but none the less powerfully pernicious effects that degrade an organization over time.\n\nAnother:\n\nI am a Department of the Army civilian (civil servant) with 30+ years of service. I work for a civilian-heavy organization of roughly 1500 people.\n\nWe are going woke, and it's accelerating. In 2021 we had the first ever Pride Week. There were several events. The week culminated with a Pride Walk around our little base. It was kicked off by a \"special guest\" who pranced around tossing rose petals in the air. The group marched behind a big Pride flag. That act, as it turns out, got the Command's hand slapped, as it is against regs to display or march with any flag other than the US flag or a unit guide on. So this year they forbade display of the Pride flag. So the rainbows came in other shapes and sizes.\n\nThis year we had a whole month of Pride events, culminating in a video presentation by Rachel Levine. Fun fact: Levine and Gen Milley played high school football together. I reckon it's a safe bet they showered together. And here, all these years later....what are the odds?\n\nThere's more. We now have a set of Employee Resource Groups (ERG), closed groups for LGBT, Black, women, etc. All the usual protected classes. This year our Commander unilaterally, without any workplace polling, decreed that one restroom on each  floor would become All Gender.\n\nWe have exactly one M2F transgender person in the organization, and he works in another building. Minority rules. Cue Tevye singing: Inclusive! Inclusive!\n\nIt will only get worse. We have many people who are not just the nation's senior experts in their fields, but the world. Their knowledge is nearly impossible to replace. People are moving up their retirements because of the creeping wokeness. I can tell you that our Commander cares not a whit about that. He'll be gone next year, and a new wokeling will take the reins and lead us further down the road to perdition.\n\nAnother:\n\nI'm writing regarding your recent posts on culture in the military, and more generally about the articles you've written on the topic in the last couple years. I wanted to recommend to you a paper that was written in 2000 by the Israeli military historian Martin van Creveld. If you haven't read him before, he's a consistently fascinating author with an incredible breadth of knowledge.\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, the time when most western militaries began sex integration, Creveld wrote several papers on the topic and discussed the likely consequences of this change. A quarter century on, basically everything he said would happen did. What was unique about his analysis of the new co-ed military was that he looked at it from a sociological rather than physical perspective. His claims challenged the argument that so long as men and women were held to the same physical standards, a co-ed fighting force would work as effectively as a male-only force and would remain an appealing profession.\n\nThe paper where he made this case was called \"Less Than We Can Be: Men, Women and the Modern Military.\" In short, his argument was that militaries have always had two purposes: one political and one social. The political purpose is, in the famous Clausewitz quotation, the continuation of politics by other means. The social purpose, on the other hand, is for the men of a society to prove their masculinity. His arguments for this are fascinating. For example, he says that in Genesis the Hebrew words for \"adult man\" and \"warrior\" are interchangeable. Why masculinity is so fragile and requires constant proof is a more complex question. Creveld likens military service to sex-specific traits in other species - such as colours, plumage, or antlers - whose purpose is to attract the opposite sex. These traits, he says, would be robbed of their social function if they were shared between males and females. Likewise, he says that although there are women who are physically capable of fighting, creating women soldiers would by definition rob soldiering of its purpose as a test of manhood. In conclusion, he said that countries that create co-ed militaries would \"find it next to impossible to attract not just qualified men but any men, period.\"\n\nIn the years since he wrote this, his prediction about recruitment seems to have manifested. Across the western world, news stories about the failure of militaries to fill their ranks abound. Obviously, there are other factors that have played into this, such as the disastrous \"forever wars\" of the past couple decades and the revelations of pervasive corruption and lying of politicians and officers. But equally, it's impossible to deny that the changing social role (and associated prestige, vide Margaret Mead) of soldiering hasn't been a factor.\n\nAnother:\n\nMy brother, career military, is trying to hang on until he retires. He doesn't want to blow his pension by leaving early. He's got a few years left.   However, he's disgusted by how the military caters to woke these days. He keeps his mouth shut and does his job, but he's not proud of what the military has become.\n\nI don't have to prompt him to bring up how disgusted he is. I try to avoid talking about politics and the military, so the fact that he brings it up without me promoting is a clue that something radically different is going on. Again, without prompting, he'd tell me all about his support for Trump. He's never been particularly interested or active in politics like I've been in the past. He isn't particularly religious, but he worries about how Christian chaplains can do their job and support the military's policies on trans issues.\n\nIt's just not hard to miss that there is a culture shift in the military. I don't know about other military families, but I'm simply not interested in committing my brother or other service members to another war. He was deployed to both Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n... The fact that our military has embraced woke simply doesn't inspire confidence in the institution or the current situation in Ukraine.     Leadership matters and we are being presented with crazy and being told it's the rational, adult choice. I'm not going to be encouraging my teen son to join the armed forces.  I just can't do it with a straight face. In the past, that wouldn't be an issue.  Culture matters and the military has gone nutters.\n\nLast one for now:\n\nYour correspondent is absolutely wrong.\n\nI've been in/ around military for 35 years. It's worse than you think.\n\nGen. Milley the best/ worst example, but his predecessor Adm. Mullen virtually encouraged homosexual disobedience in the DADT days. And\"stalwart \" Gen Dunford just joined amicus brief in FAVOR of racial quotas. And \"staunch\" SECDEF Mattis objected to Trump's trans ban.\n\nDoD announced last week it will help troops get interstate abortions.\n\nThe brainwashing \"stand downs \" are endemic, \"conversations\" go only one way. It IS woke central. And no one in Congress or GOP will challenge it.\n\nUPDATE.2: More mail. Let's get started:\n\nI never served in the military (I work for the military as a civilian, however), so my opinion, according to your dissenting military officer, is probably worthless. I'm going to share it anyway, because as a taxpayer, that military belongs, ultimately, to Americans like myself and, without our consent, they have no mandate nor mission.\n\nFirst, I have a serious problem with what he says here:\n\nEspecially in an open democracy like ours, any cultural trend is going to be reflected in the armed forces.\n\nLater, he says:\n\nMuch of the woke stuff that exists comes down to this: we want any American to be able to serve *and not feel like an interloper while doing so.*\n\nI'm guessing he thinks this is either a good thing or entirely neutral, but it's not. Qualification for military service isn't just about the physical, it's also about the mental and the moral. Forget the LGBTQ stuff for a second - I can tell you, from firsthand experience, the military is staffed with people in uniform who hold very hard feelings towards this country and many of their fellow Americans. Millions of Americans share the same sentiments. Is this really a cultural trend that ought to be permitted in the military?\n\nSomething that's been true of the military in the post-draft era is that most Americans, if given the choice, would rather not serve in uniform. I'd wager that at least 60% of those serving today didn't grow up wanting to join the military. Most of them had to be literally recruited or encouraged to and, only then, did they decide military service was something worth pursuing. There exists evidence that this is the case. My point here is the military is just a job. You wear a uniform, you have to obey lots of rules, you don't have much of your own freedom. But, beyond that, it doesn't really matter what you do or think, as long as you show up for work, do as you're told, and stay out of trouble. Even on that latter point, I can tell you that military discipline is enforced nowhere near as strictly as people think. The military has become a credential, a status symbol, something for people to put on their resumes, especially for the officer corps. Because service tends to be of great benefit to most, if not all, who serve, to deny anyone the opportunity violates our sense of equality and fair play.\n\nIf service didn't have its benefits, as is the case in so many countries around the world, I don't know if the military would be as fierce a culture war battleground as it is today. There's a reason why day-laboring, forestry, and mining haven't become Wokeified, as critical these industries are to our national survival.\n\nThe idea that the perception of Wokeification of the military is simply the services reflecting American culture at large is actually a bad sign. When we fully professionalized the services beginning in 1973, part of the reason is because we saw that drafting from the entire population brought with it all sorts of problems the military could ill-afford. If this officer thinks it's not a big deal that the military is bringing in elements of society that shouldn't be defending the country, then why not just go back to drafting our troops? Then the military can indulge in all the cultural trends society has to offer. Imagine spending decades and untold sums of money to professionalize the services and get society's ills out of the ranks and, in the end, concluding what we need is for the military to adopt civilian cultural norms in the ranks. Mind you, many join the military precisely to get away from civilian society. This phenomenon was highlighted in Thomas Ricks' 1995 book Making the Corps .\n\nOf course, your dissenting officer would never agree to bringing back the draft, because he thinks he believes only the best should serve. But again, it's not just about being good at your job. Staff the military with people who don't like this country and don't like the people they're ostensibly protecting, then as the country fails, so will the military. After all, the military's a microcosm of American society. There are valid concerns to the military being too divergent from the society it's intended to protect, but it's also dangerous for a military to become too much like society. It's a scary thought, I know, but institutions like the armed forces really are the first and last line of defense for a country. If we don't want to trust law-abiding Americans with guns to hold it all together, then that really leaves only the military to do the job. But if those in power don't like the idea of the military becoming too far removed culturally and socially from society, I guess you can only shift to the other extreme. After all, balances are among the most difficult things to strike.\n\nIf I can say one more thing, on a different but related topic, of our warmongering in Russia:\n\nI promise you everyone is aware of the nuclear risks.  Vice leaves virtue with no good options, and Russia's actions leave us with none likewise.  We can either leave Ukraine to its fate and allow the entire post-WWII settlement in international law to be cast aside and return to a world where wars of conquest are accepted, or risk further escalation.\n\nHe then tries to reassure us all the U.S. military still is fully capable of fighting and winning wars:\n\nI don't mean to be overconfident here--I'm very familiar with risks and capability gaps we face as well--but it's impossible to deny that the U.S. military is incomparably superior to the Russian at any battlefield metric, no matter how un-woke and manly the latter might present itself as.\n\nI'm a bit of an outlier on the Right in the sense I haven't given up faith in the military's competence. Like him, I look at Russia's performance in Ukraine and I'm not blown away. Nor do I think the Chinese would fare much better. However, U.S. tactical competency needs to be placed in context. First, the ranks of those who do the shooting, no matter the service, are still comprised of the very people the military is attempting to decrease the proportion of: White Middle American males. There's an 80/20 rule in effect here, where 80% of the fighting is done by 20% of the force (not literally, but figuratively). Those who serve will tell you, at least on the enlisted side, there exists a distinct cultural divide between the \"tooth\" that does the fighting and most of the dying and the \"tail\" who supports them. So claiming that Wokeness hasn't eroded combat effectiveness is something of a non-sequitur since the people who win the tactical engagements aren't Woke and least receptive to the message. If the military is still good at warfighting, it's because, even in 2022, a certain kind of person is still doing the fighting and it's the kind of person our culture, media, military, and political leadership regards as deplorable. Thank goodness they're still filling the ranks, for now, anyway.\n\nYour reader leaves us with his foreign policy views:\n\nIf I can say one more thing, on a different but related topic, of our warmongering in Russia: I promise you everyone is aware of the nuclear risks.  Vice leaves virtue with no good options, and Russia's actions leave us with none likewise.  We can either leave Ukraine to its fate and allow the entire post-WWII settlement in international law to be cast aside and return to a world where wars of conquest are accepted, or risk further escalation.\n\nIf they're aware of the nuclear risks, but still choose to go down this path, that's not courage, that's stupidity. As he himself suggests, what happens in Ukraine affects Ukraine the most, not the U.S. We risk nuclear war when it means preserving our civilization and way of life, not to preserve the \"post-WWII settlement in international law.\" I wonder what he'd say about using the military to guard the U.S.-Mexico border? There's nothing unprecedented about that mission, but I feel like he wouldn't consider that an appropriate use of our military and \"against our values.\" It sure sounds to me he's a loyal institutionalist who's swallowed a heavy dose of the Kool-Aid, but that seems a bit lowbrow on my part, so I'll just leave it by saying he's saying what he'd be expected to say to have a successful career in uniform.\n\nAnother one:\n\nI'm not going to comment on the conditions in the military, as your follow-up guest emails totally obliterated the denials from the military person you quoted so extensively. Instead, I just want to make a brief comment on her general cluelessness, which spills over from the existence of wokeness in the military to the actions of the US military itself.\n\nHer whitewashing of the tragic and unprovoked US invasions of Irag and Afghanistan as \"mission sets we tended to fail horribly\" is supposed to draw a distinction between an invading US military and an invading Russian military. But the US is thousands of miles away from both Iraq and Afghanistan, and doesn't have NATO weapons pointed at it. There was no existential reason for the US to invade either of those countries, and to excuse them as mistakes or mission errors is disingenuous.\n\nHer claim that the US \"leaned on Ukraine to de-escalate and not provoke a wider war,\" is just BS. NATO did everything it could to stop Ukraine from abiding by the Minsk accords, and this was admitted by the former Ukrainian president himself. This woman is clearly an apologist of the rankest order. First for the senseless violence the US military has unleashed around the world, and second for her denial--or outright lies--about the woke infestation of the military.\n\nAnother:\n\nI don't know your correspondent, but that letter is so egregiously off-base that I couldn't help chiming in on it with the rest of the folks piling on.  I am a Ranger-qualified former infantry captain recently stationed in Europe; I commissioned from West Point near the top of my class and only just left the service, so I have *plenty* of firsthand experience with the new model woke military.\n\nI would like to focus on his point that your writing on the woke military is 'off-key'.  In a way, this is true.  The military isn't completely woke--not yet.  But it is getting there rapidly.  And it is doing so because wokeness is a symptom of total, bottomless ideological corruption on the part of America's military leadership.  These people don't care about winning wars.  They don't care about national defense.  They don't care about the American people.  The only thing that matters to them are sinecures at Raytheon and Lockheed after retirement.  Ideological corruption, not wokeness, will put paid to the American military when we next fight another war.\n\nBut wokeness is the un-missable sign that this will *surely* happen.  Your correspondent's attempts to dismiss these truths are yet another sign that the rot at the upper echelons of the military is out of control.  Your correspondent's claim that the American military is superior to the Russian armed forces in every conceivable metric is laughable.  I spent years training with Army units in Europe--the forces theoretically responsible for deterring Russian aggression--and I claim that our conventional, line infantry and armor units are nowhere near proficient enough to take on the Russian Army fighting for its life on its own terrain.  Corrupt leadership has demoralized our troops.  Training is unrealistic and does not simulate the conditions American soldiers will face against the Russians.  The exercises are always fixed so that we win and the Russian enemy loses.  We've never fought a war against an enemy with similar attack aviation, ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance), artillery, rocket artillery, electronic warfare, signals, and other assets that the Russians possess.  We've performed quite badly in the two wars we have recently fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, where we possessed immeasurably more combat power in every conceivable metric against poorly armed, poorly trained, poorly organized guerrillas who eventually defeated us.\n\nThe 101st Airborne's publicity stunt in Romania this week is a case in point.  The 101st Airborne would get rolled in the event of an actual fight with the Russians.  It simply does not have the organic artillery assets, armored units, or even ammunition and other weaponry, to survive a pitched fight against even one Russian Battalion Tactical Group, let alone the combined weight of the Russian Army.  The United States is *playing with fire* in the way that it has chosen to antagonize the Russians over Ukraine.  We are writing a check that we can't cash.  When the Russians come to collect, there will be hell to pay for our allies in the Baltics and in Poland who are counting on our security guarantees.  God in heaven forbid, *we* may even be forced to use nuclear weapons to protect our interests in Europe from the Russians (not the other way round!).\n\nIt blows my mind that the American public is so ignorant of the sheer dangerousness of the Biden Regime's foreign policy in Ukraine.  The Pentagon's insistent focus on wokeness and its fear of offending progressives has totally evaporated its ability to effectively advise and assist the Congress and the American people in military affairs.  We are in dire straits as a country.  Pray that we do not go to war soon.  When we do, the loss of life on the part of American soldiery will be immense.\n\nThat possibility may seem inconceivable now, but it will rapidly come to fruition if we do not seek a settlement with the Russians *immediately*.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "On Tuesday, the Pinal County Sheriff's Office in Arizona released body-camera footage of the death of Lawrence Knudsen, who was shot and killed by police in late March. Officers arrived at the scene after Knudsen called 911 and told the operator he was \"about to put a bullet in [his] head.\"\n\nIn an extended back-and-forth with the operator, Knudsen told her he was armed and that his handgun was \"on top of [his] tailgate\" by his right hand. He added that he was \"not looking to hurt any cops.\" Eventually, his tone became more aggressive, and he goaded the operator to \"just bring these motherf-ers [the cops] in.\"\n\nThree officers pulled up on a side street near Knudsen's home. Two were on the scene before the third officer arrived. When the two officers already on the scene approached Knudsen, they told him to put his hands up, and he obliged. \"My hands are up,\" Knudsen said. He was holding a small black object in his right hand, later discovered to be a vape pen, and a cell phone in his left.\n\nThe female officer closest to Knudson howled at him to \"Back the f-k up!\" Knudsen kept walking toward the officers with his hands in the air. At this point, the female officer had her service weapon pointed at Knudsen, and the nearby male officer had his taser pointed at Knudsen's chest.\n\n\"I'm doing this,\" Knudsen said as he approached the officers. His right hand, still in the air, tilted forward slightly, at which point the two officers simultaneously discharged their weapons-the female officer fired three bullets from her handgun, while the male officer discharged his taser. Knudsen collapsed. He was taken to the hospital where he died from the bullet wounds.\n\nThe police officers were in a difficult situation. They were told Knudsen was armed, and they knew he was suicidal. It is hard to tell from the body-camera footage how much the black object in Knudsen's hand resembled a firearm. It's certainly possible the officers reasonably mistook the vape pen for a gun.\n\nBut the Pinal County Sheriff's Office is not being made to sweat one way or the other. Knudsen was a heavy-set white guy from suburban Arizona. If he had been a black teenager? Come on.\n\nDon't expect any immolated AutoZones in Pinal County.\n\nJohn Hirschauer was assistant editor of The American Conservative .

      "text": "See? See?! :\n\nA former Georgia police officer who was investigated for a religious social media post that claimed \"there's no such thing\" as gay marriage said he felt pressured to resign after he was told he could be fired for sharing his beliefs.\n\nJacob Kersey, 19, who quit the Port Wentworth Police Department earlier this month, told Fox News Digital that he was placed on paid administrative leave Jan. 4 after he refused to remove the Facebook post he made regarding his Christian belief about marriage.\n\n\"God designed marriage,\" Kersey wrote in the post that was flagged by his superiors following \"an anonymous complaint,\" according to a Jan. 13 letter of notification first reported by the Daily Signal and provided to Fox News Digital. \"Marriage refers to Christ and the church. That's why there's no such thing as homosexual marriage.\"\n\nKersey wasn't fired after the investigation, but he said he decided to quit because he was told he could face termination for future social media posts that others find offensive. He said he has spoken with a law firm about possible legal action.\n\nUnbelievable -- but all too believable. The image of Kersey above is from this interview he did with Tony Perkins . I've been saying for some time now -- in The Benedict Option and Live Not By Lies -- that this is the world we live in now, and increasingly are going to be living in. Normative Christian belief is going to be increasingly hated, and outlawed -- or, in this case, if not outlawed, then will put orthodox Christians at professional risk.\n\nThe letter from the department to the cop (you can see if it you follow the link to the news story) informs the young man that there's a question about whether or not he could be \"objective\" in dealing with a situation involving an LGBT person. What a load of crap. Though I'm a Christian, if a cop posted to social media \"God does not exist. There is no such thing as God,\" I would be appalled if he faced any kind of investigation or discipline. I would not wonder if he could be objective in dealing with Christians or other theists. Why should I, unless there is concrete evidence that he has discriminated against people who believe in God? Why should the onus not be on me to tolerate atheists in the police department? If that hypothetical cop had said that people who believe in God are bad people, that would be a problem. Had Jacob Kersey said gays and lesbians are bad people, well, yes, the problem with that is obvious. But he simply offered an opinion on marriage -- an opinion that is shared by millions of Americans. If a cop had said on social media prior to Obergefell that same-sex couples who wish to marry should have that right, and it is wrong to say otherwise, so what? Why presume that he is incapable of being fair to people who disagree? If you have no actual evidence that a police officer who holds an opinion you don't like has mistreated others as a result of that opinion, then would this not be a case of policing thought?\n\nAgain, if a cop says that LGBT people, or persons of color, or white people, or Muslims, or whoever, are no damn good, then obviously that would be a big problem for a law enforcement officer. But there is a substantive difference between saying \"there is no such thing as same-sex marriage\" and \"gay people are bad.\" There is a substantive difference between saying \"God does not exist\" and \"Christians are bad.\" There is a substantive difference between saying \"I think Black Lives Matter is wrong\" and \"black people are bad.\" And so forth. If we are incapable of making that distinction, then we are no longer a classical liberal society, and we have very big problems.\n\nI am guessing that because he quit, and was not fired, his legal options aren't many, but I hope I'm wrong. I hope he sues.\n\nNevertheless, this is one more example of the special privileges Sacred Minorities have in our post-Christian society. By this point, if Christians can't read the handwriting on the wall, and if they aren't preparing themselves, their families, and their communities for persecution, they might well be ineducable. It is not going to get any better. You should know this. We have to stand up for ourselves wherever we can, but even as we do that, we have to prepare ourselves for a long internal exile. I was talking recently with an English priest about what's here, and what's coming. I told him that I don't fear that my children will be persecuted for their faith -- that's going to happen, even if the persecution is soft (e.g., loss of job and professional opportunities, versus prison or worse). I worry that they will apostatize under the pressure. That is a far, far worse fate. If you are a Christian who disagrees, then not only do you not understand the faith, and the history of the faith (meaning, the role of martyrs and confessors in the Christian imaginary), but you are also eventually going to lose your own faith under pressure, or raise kids who will not have the internal strength to resist.\n\nMark my words: this will be the cost of not preparing, of thinking that everything will eventually sort itself out if we just sit back and wait.\n\nTo sharpen the point: there is no question but that we have to fight this kind of prejudice and mistreatment wherever we can. But the fight is not simply external. The fight is also within ourselves, to root ourselves more fixedly in what we believe, and what we do, so we can withstand the test. It's easy to be a Christian when you are not put to the test. The easy days are over. The Christians in the West who find that their lives of faith are without struggle going forward will be those who are willing to change with the times. The ones who hold fast to the faith as it really is are those who have the internal and communal strength to stand firm even when they are made to suffer for it. That cop, Jacob Kersey, seems like one of those people.\n\nIf you haven't seen the film A Hidden Life , by Terrence Malick, you should watch it. It's not an easy film -- Malick is not a straightforward narrator -- but it tells the true story of an Austrian farmer who went to prison and sacrificed his life for Christ, rather than conform to what the Nazis demanded. Nearly everyone else in his village of churchgoing Catholics conformed to Hitler's demands. How did this farmer know that what the Nazis demanded was wrong, and find the strength to bear witness to the truth, even at the cost of his own life?\n\nThe first question -- the \"how did he know the Nazis were wrong?\" -- is a profound one. It's one that we, in our far remove in time and place from Nazi-era Austria, struggle to fathom. Last week when Andrew Sullivan interviewed me for his podcast, he asked about how I dealt with the revelation that my late father was almost certainly in the Klan in the 1960s. I told him that it wasn't really a shock, because I had long suspected that it had happened. Many white Protestant men of my father's generation were part of that, or if not part of it, then at least not hostile to it. My dad and I informally agreed to stop arguing about race at some point in the late 1980s, for the sake of family peace. So many white Southerners of my generation have had to make the same arrangement with family members: putting the love of family about our own convictions of what is right and what is wrong. They did the same for us. This is not something that the woke fanatics understand, because they place the abstraction of being Correct over the concrete value of living in community with flawed human beings whom you love, and who love you, despite your own flaws. The ugliest and least human thing about the woke is how they don't see people as people, but solely as bearers of abstract identities.\n\nAnyway, as I told Andrew, one big turning point for me in figuring out how to think about my folks and their generation's racial attitudes was coming to understand the information environment that shaped them. I grew up in a small Southern town in the 1970s, and was in the first generation of local kids to go to racially integrated schools. I realized one day that the only counternarrative white kids of my generation got to white supremacy was through watching network television. It's not the case that anybody sat us down and said, \"White people are superior\"; rather, it's simply a social reality that you can't end something like apartheid by law, and have all the sentiments it generated, and that upheld it, dissipate overnight. For most of us, the only place we encountered messaging saying that racism is wrong was in national news and entertainment media.\n\nEventually I put myself in the place of people of my parents' generation. My dad was born in 1934, my mom in 1943. They were fully formed adults by the time the Civil Rights Movement began having an effect. There was nothing in their lives to teach them that racism was wrong. My mom was not raised in the church, but white Southern churches were infamously conformist to the white supremacist narrative. There was no media counternarrative, anywhere. Now, if you had grown up in a culture that told you black people were inferior, and that the races shouldn't mix, and everybody around you agreed with this (and those who did not would have been too intimidated to speak out), then your fundamental ideas about the way reality works would be pretty skewed.\n\nMind you, I have been told the same thing over the years by teachers who work with inner-city minority kids: that it is very, very difficult for white suburban people to understand how radically different those kids' model of reality is, because their formative experiences in community are so different. It's not an excuse for bad behavior, on the part of anybody. But it must be taken into consideration when you are dealing with flesh and blood people. They don't know what they don't know -- and that is true for you and me as well. You have to have humility, and to realize that there are truths and realities that are invisible to you, because of your own epistemic formation.\n\nI've mentioned here before, and I said it to Andrew, that a breakthrough for me came in 2012, when, having moved back to my hometown, I read a 1964 article from Ebony magazine, that was a long, detailed account of a white riot that broke out on my hometown's courthouse lawn, when a black pastor registered to vote in 1963. I was genuinely shocked to read that piece, because I had not realized how violent the defense of the racist legal and social order had been. Nobody talked about this stuff to our generation. Nobody in the enraged white crowd was named in the piece, but had they been, I am sure I would have encountered the names of men I grew up respecting. Maybe my own father was in that crowd. I hope not, but it's certainly possible. Reading that story, I had to admit that had I been a young man in that time and place, I might well have been there too -- and would have thought I was defending my community, and defending a just social order! After all, it was all I had ever known. This is exactly the lesson the Catholic Church tries to teach its people in the Easter liturgy, when, in the Gospel reading telling of Christ's passion, the church directs the entire congregation to say, with the Jerusalem mob, \"Crucify him! Crucify him!\" Every single one of us would probably have joined the mob that day in Jerusalem. The mob truly believed it was defending the faith, and the social order, by putting this so-called blasphemer to death.\n\nWell, Franz Jägerstätter, the Austrian farmer who resisted the Nazis, not only knew that Hitler was an Antichrist, but found the strength to accept death to bear witness to the truth, and to not betray Jesus. How did he do it? The Malick film is frustratingly light on that part of the story, but the obvious answer is that the Catholic Franz lived in such a way in times of peace that when put to the test, he not only knew what to do, but was able to do it.\n\nHere is a key scene from the film. In it, Franz is inside his parish church, assisting a painter who is decorating the church with Biblical scenes. The painter says that he shows \"their comfortable Christ, with a halo over his head,\" but the actual life of Christ requires suffering. That, he says, is how you can tell an admirer of Christ from a disciple (a point straight out of Kierkegaard). The painter says \"a darker time is coming,\" one in which men won't fight the Truth, but rather simply ignore it. Watch:\n\nLook around you. The days are darkening. The late Benedict XVI, writing to the Slovak statesman Vladimir Palko in 2015, said that the power of the Antichrist grows and grows. It will become harder and harder to find clarity in the darkness now descending. I read in the Seewald biography of Benedict that one reason he was committed to the Second Vatican Council as a young priest serving as a theological adviser there was because he was so grieved by the Nazi legacy in his homeland. Joseph Ratzinger came from an anti-Nazi family -- a family that understood the evil of Nazism because it practiced its Catholicism faithfully. Yet according to Seewald, Ratzinger believed that the fact that the Nazi regime came to power is a sign of how de-Christianized Germany had become. A truly Christian Germany would not have accepted Nazism. Young Father Ratzinger's hope for the Council was that it would revitalize the faith, and make it more plausible to modern people, in part as an inoculation against Nazism and other anti-human extremisms.\n\nOn his 2006 visit to Auschwitz, Pope Benedict XVI said:\n\nThe rulers of the Third Reich wanted to crush the entire Jewish people, to cancel it from the register of the peoples of the earth.  Thus the words of the Psalm: \"We are being killed, accounted as sheep for the slaughter\" were fulfilled in a terrifying way.  Deep down, those vicious criminals, by wiping out this people, wanted to kill the God who called Abraham, who spoke on Sinai and laid down principles to serve as a guide for mankind, principles that are eternally valid.  If this people, by its very existence, was a witness to the God who spoke to humanity and took us to himself, then that God finally had to die and power had to belong to man alone - to those men, who thought that by force they had made themselves masters of the world.  By destroying Israel, by the Shoah , they ultimately wanted to tear up the taproot of the Christian faith and to replace it with a faith of their own invention: faith in the rule of man, the rule of the powerful.\n\nHe also spoke of anti-Nazi Germans who died there:\n\nThe Germans who had been brought to Auschwitz-Birkenau and met their death here were considered as Abschaum der Nation - the refuse of the nation.  Today we gratefully hail them as witnesses to the truth and goodness which even among our people were not eclipsed.  We are grateful to them, because they did not submit to the power of evil, and now they stand before us like lights shining in a dark night.  With profound respect and gratitude, then, let us bow our heads before all those who, like the three young men in Babylon facing death in the fiery furnace, could respond: \"Only our God can deliver us.  But even if he does not, be it known to you, O King, that we will not serve your gods and we will not worship the golden statue that you have set up.\"\n\nWe have to hope and pray that whatever is coming for us will not involve the kind of persecution that destroyed the lives of six million Jews, and other enemies of the Nazi regime. But worse than losing our lives would be losing our faith in God. It is far easier to imagine that happening than to imagine arising a new gulag archipelago or extermination camp network. It's easier to imagine, because it is happening everywhere now. To be an elderly European today is to have lived through the de-Christianization of your society and culture. When my kids, born at the dawn of the 21st century, are elderly, absent a great and unanticipated movement of God, this will be their story too: to have witnessed the de-Christianization of America. That a police officer in a small Georgia town could be made to fear for his job because he posted on social media a statement of faith in the Bible's model of marriage is a flashing-neon sign of the times.\n\nThe coming generations of American kids are going to be acculturated to a worldview that is no more comprehending of the Bible's teaching about homosexuality than my parents' generation was of the Bible's teaching about racism. I remember hearing older folks -- maybe my dad, but I honestly can't remember -- talking about how the Bible taught that racial segregation was God's will. I recall starting to read the Bible for myself when I was twelve years old, and going to my dad to ask how come if the Bible says this about race, and how to treat other people, that we all thought the opposite? He had no answer for me. He had not read the Bible; he had just accepted what his culture taught him, and figured that the Bible must support it. We look at that today with shock and disbelief, but the same sort of thing is happening now around homosexuality and the Bible, particularly in Christian circles. Many contemporary Christians are not interested in knowing what the truth is, and conforming their lives to it, even if it's hard; rather, they just want to ignore the truth, because it makes their lives uncomfortable.\n\nI get it. I'm not really much different. If an angel of the Lord came to me and pointed out to me how I personally fall short of the word of God in my own life, I would likely be genuinely shocked. We don't know what we don't know. But we ought to try our hardest to be open to learning, and to form within ourselves an ethic of humility and repentance, so that when our sins are made known to us, we turn from them, or at least undertake a sincere effort to try. That's what it means to be Christian. It was easy for me to judge my parents' generation for their racism when I was a young man, and the truth was so clear to me. But now that I'm older, and I have come to understand much better how weak human nature is, and how fiercely we resist the truth when it makes us uncomfortable, or is painful, I am more merciful. When Jesus said, from the cross, \"Forgive them, Father, for they know not what they do,\" he was modeling for us radical forgiveness, based on the mob's ignorance. All of us are a potential mob. All of us are fallen. All of us are tempted to baptize the ethics of the culture to which we belong. If you are a Christian who looks back on those white Christians of the Jim Crow times and wonder how on earth they could have believed those things when the Bible is so clear, but you also have reconciled yourself and your faith to the sexual ethics of our day, then I would tell you that you owe those racist white Christians an apology. You have done the same thing as they did: made Scripture say what you wanted it to say, for the sake of conforming to the social order, in part because it was too hard to say, \"We will not serve your gods.\"\n\nThe Benedict Option and Live Not By Lies are not about escaping the world. We can't escape the world. It is about trying to create communities of formation and discipleship that will teach people to be like Shadrach, Meshech, and Abednego: working in the world, but when put to the test, choosing suffering, even death, over apostasy.\n\nWe do not have that today, and it shows. We don't have all the time in the world, you know. Let the fate of young Jacob Kersey be a sign. And if it's not a sign to you, then you had better ask yourself: what's it going to take? What has to happen before you to rouse yourself from your comfortable slumber, and prepare for resistance?\n\nUPDATE: A reader writes:\n\nThe bigger issue is that even in small town Georgia there is now a ready commissar that is ready and willing to purge dissenters. Everyone is now Winston Smith. This is why the soft totalitarianism is exceedingly unlikely to remain so.\n\nThat being the case, reader, what are you doing about it? Most Christians under Soviet communism conformed. Those who did not developed strong practices and communities to help them endure. As you know, Father Kolakovic and his helpers prepared the Slovak Catholics for what they saw coming, even when some of the Church's leadership denied anything bad was likely to happen.\n\nUPDATE.2: Evangelical writer Trevin Wax:\n\nChristians will continue to face mounting pressure to signal our support for LGBT+ causes, to say \"love is love,\" to display the Pride flag-whatever pinch of incense will satisfy today's Caesars. Why? Because unless everyone everywhere pretends there's no substantial difference between male-female marriage and same-sex relationships, the spell is broken. The charade doesn't work. It's why the wars over pronouns and bathrooms are so heated. Unless we all play along, the jig is up.\n\nIvan Provorov's dissent exposes the lie at the heart of the sexual revolution. And let's face it: now that transgender theories are mainstream, we've moved beyond the question of morality . At the center of controversy today is the question of nature and the meaning of embodied reality. Why is there such pressure to fall in line? Because unless we all act like gender difference is superficial and irrelevant, the ancient view of marriage will persist and the newly invented view of marriage will be seen as the imposter it is.\n\nDo you get it? There can be no dissent. It was always going to be this way -- which is why some of us understood from the beginning that the whole circa 2005 \"How does my gay neighbors' marriage affect me?\" line was nonsense. You must affirm the Lie -- or else!\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "Here's a tale of two cops and two murders: Derek Chauvin and George Floyd, and John Doe and Ashli Babbitt. Two cops, two unarmed citizens killed. One you care about, one you don't. Even murder is politicized these days.\n\nNo one needs much of a recap on Chauvin and Floyd. George Floyd, a black man, tried to pass off a counterfeit $20 bill while messed up on drugs. White Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin and other cops responded, and in the process of restraining Floyd, killed him. Everyone has seen the video of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, and, as if it was a requirement, been coaxed to judge for themselves whether it was appropriate, necessary, and the cause of Floyd's death.\n\nA jury judged those things, too, and the result was a 22.5 year sentence for Chauvin (in handing down the sentence the judge said it was justified in part because Chauvin \"committed his crime in the presence of children,\" who of course had gathered to help jeer at the cops.) The woman who shot the snuff video got a special citation from the Pulitzer prize board.\n\nFloyd's death set off an angry summer of violence under the rubric Black Lives Matter, as progressives shut down opposing voices and several downtowns to insist Chauvin's actions were part of systemic racism reaching back to 1619 in unbroken lineage. Celebrities, politicians, and academics jostled each other for camera time to demand the police be defunded. You might have seen something about all this on the teevee?\n\nThere's also video of white Ashli Babbitt being killed by a black law enforcement officer, but it has been played by the mainstream media maybe 1/10,000th as often as the Floyd murder clip. Babbitt, wearing a Trump flag like a cape, was one of the rioters who smashed the glass on the door leading to the Speaker's Lobby of the Capitol. A plain clothes Capitol Police officer, apparently without warning, fired a shot and Babbitt fell into the crowd and died. It was the only shot fired in the riot. A SWAT team just behind Babbitt saw the situation differently and never fired on her or those with her.\n\nLike Floyd, Babbitt was unarmed. Like Floyd, Babbitt was committing a crime when she was killed by a cop. Unlike Floyd, there is no question of whether she was resisting arrest because the cop never got that far. He just shot her.\n\nIn the Floyd case, we know everything about Derek Chauvin, and saw him convicted in open court. Not so with Babbitt's killer. Almost all police departments nationwide are required to release an officer's name after a fatal shooting. Not the U.S. Capitol Police, which answers only to Congress. Even as Congress demands nationwide police reforms (ironically, the new, lower standards of proof proposed by H.R.1280 -George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021-would condemn the Capitol cop) they have steadfastly refused to release the name of Babbitt's killer.\n\nIn February, the Capitol Police stated they would \"share additional information once an investigation is complete.\" Investigators closed the case in April, cleared the still unnamed officer of wrongdoing in Babbitt's death without addressing the fact that the medical examiner ruled the death a homicide, and left it at that. Stuff happens.\n\nNo trial, no public accounting, not even a name for the Babbitt family to use in filing a wrongful death suit. Because Congress exempts the Capitol Police from the Freedom of Information Act, the family is forced to sue \"for documents that identify the officer who shot Babbitt... as well as notes and summaries of what the officer said regarding the shooting and the reasons he discharged his weapon.\"\n\nThey'd like more information on Babbitt's death than the \"investigation\" provided. The Department of Justice simply wrote there was \"insufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution.\" DOJ did not even bother to hide its legal fudge, which had its investigators look narrowly at a Constitutional question, not a homicide.\n\nWithout shame, DOJ said it focused on 18 U.S.C. § 242 , a federal criminal civil rights statute. This requires prosecutors prove the officer acted willfully to deprive Babbitt of her rights, here the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable seizure. Prosecutors would have to prove not only that the officer used constitutionally unreasonable force, but the officer did so \"willfully\" with the intent to deprive Babbitt of her Fourth Amendment rights. That meant evidence the officer acted out of fear, mistake, panic, misperception, negligence, or even poor judgment cannot establish the high level of intent required. In lay terms, that's called a set-up en route to a cover-up.\n\nContrast that with the Chauvin prosecution, where prosecutors laid out a spread of charges-manslaughter, second-degree murder, and third-degree murder-all in the one death of George Floyd, leaving the civil rights question that saved the Capitol cop as a separate matter. That allowed prosecutors to instruct the jury (there of course was no jury in Babbitt's case) to decide on emotion, saying \"Use your common sense. Believe your eyes. What you saw, you saw.\" Imagine a jury in Babbitt's case, over-exposed to a perpetually playing video of her killing, acting on the same instructions. But that never happened.\n\nNo one had much to say during the Babbitt investigation. In Floyd's case, Joe Biden said he was praying the jury would reach the \"right verdict,\" calling the evidence \"overwhelming in my view.\" Maxine Waters demanded protesters become \"more confrontational\" if Chauvin was acquitted. That was so blatantly inflammatory it was almost grounds for a mistrial, never mind an impeachment had she held higher office\n\nThe president cheers on one prosecution, remaining silent while another murder is made to go away. Cities erect monuments to George Floyd as a martyr while the New York Times runs gossipy articles on Babbitt's marriage problems. Asking for justice in Floyd's case is a duty, even if it means burning down stores. Those who want the same justice for Babbitt are mocked as QAnon cultists. Did she not also bleed?\n\nOh, there's more. Floyd was only on drugs passing fake money because of racism whereas Babbitt was a seditionist, a vandal, who was asking for it. Floyd's death created a movement for change. Trump's embrace of Ashli Babbitt anointed \"January 6 a heroic uprising\" for white supremacists seeking to overthrow democracy.\n\nAbsolutely no one would write of Floyd, as one mainstream media outlet did of Babbitt: \"her death, while tragic, occurred for a very good reason. The Air Force veteran, who had been fully converted into the most dangerous and fantastical pro-Trump conspiracy theories, had joined the aggressive vanguard of the January 6 insurrection.\" Babbitt deserved it. The article went on to compare Babbitt's status as martyr to \"Horst Wessel, a German storm trooper killed by communists in 1930, who inspired the eponymous Nazi anthem.\"\n\nOthers claim Donald Trump is liable for the death, that the answer to Who Killed Ashli Babbitt? is... Trump. The Washington Post wrote , \"The death of Ashli Babbitt offers the purest distillation of Donald Trump's view of justice,\" which apparently means to them Trump supported George Floyd's killing while mourning Babbitt's. Daily Beast fretted , \"If the base believes they are being prosecuted and even 'assassinated' [like Babbitt] they will justify anything to reject Democratic [sic] rule and future elections that deprive them of power.\"\n\nSears and Kmart pulled from sale T-shirts reading \"Ashli Babbitt American Patriot\" after an outcry on social media. Headlines read \"Marjorie Taylor Greene provokes outrage by comparing Ashli Babbitt's death to George Floyd's\" because Babbitt was okay to shoot \"while actively participating in a violent riot\" and Floyd was murdered by racists.\n\nIt is difficult in the face of so much hypocrisy to find the air to comment on the state of our country. Some murders are more equal than others. Dead bodies only matter when they can be used for your side's political purposes. Why are some cops murderers and others protected with anonymity and a free-pass investigation?\n\nThe absolute craven transparency of the progressive argument is what gives hope. Hope that at some point enough Americans will set aside their blind Trump rage, look past the 24/7 propaganda directed at them, and come to realize even murder now only matters for the partisan clicks it generates. Our media is happy to justify Babbitt's death, seeing it almost in biblical terms, divine retribution for supporting Trump. Floyd? Was always just a victim of an unjust society.\n\nAshli Babbitt was put down for political sins, and her killer escaped justice with the government's help. Now ain't that the Democratic vision of America?\n\nPeter Van Buren is the author of We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People , Hooper's War: A Novel of WWII Japan , and Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the 99 Percent .\n\nPeter Van Buren is the author of We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People , Hooper's War: A Novel of WWII Japan , and Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the 99 Percent .\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "So, I read the grand jury testimony of Dorian Johnson, the buddy of Ferguson's Michael Brown, and in the spirit of Chris Rock (video NSFW), I discerned from it some lessons that might be useful to people who don't want to risk being shot by police.\n\n1. Don't be a lawbreaker or hang out with lawbreakers. \"Nobody should ever want to go to jail,\" says former jailbird Dorian Johnson (p. 92). Who, despite this, begins his days by smoking pot like other people drink coffee. Smoking pot is illegal in Missouri. He testifies on page 24 that he starts every morning by smoking pot - and later testifies that he and Big Mike (Brown) were headed to the convenience store to buy cigarillos so they could smoke pot together. On pages 174-76, Johnson testifies about his (minor) criminal past, and how he got blamed for being with other kids who stole a package. He doesn't seem to connect this to the fact that he remained with Big Mike after watching Big Mike steal cigarillos. Trouble follows troublemakers. Stay away from them.\n\n2. When you go to the Kwikee Mart to buy the cigarillos with which to roll your morning blunt, don't reach across the counter to take what you want. In the normal world of law and order, people don't have the right to trespass in that way in a store. It is called theft. And don't use the fact that you are 6'4′′ and 300 pounds to bully the much smaller store clerk. (On pp. 84-86, Johnson admits that \"Big Mike\" stole the cigarillos, and pushed the clerk around, trying to be macho.) Do not be a thief, a thug, or a neighborhood bully, and you dramatically reduce your chances of having a fatal encounter with a police officer.\n\n3. When a police officer tells you to stop walking down the middle of the road, do what he says. This is the most amazing part of Johnson's testimony. He and Brown were both complete idiots. They were walking down the middle of a road, with traffic going by, and Officer Wilson told them to get back on the sidewalk. Johnson testified (see p. 65) that they told him they would get out of the road \"in a minute.\" One of the grand jurors asked Johnson why he and Brown didn't simply obey the officer's command, given that they were breaking the law by walking in the middle of the road. Johnson said (p. 69) that they did not take the cop seriously, and that they felt disrespected by him (\"it was more like, 'we're not your kids...'\").\n\nSeriously, they did this. A cop told these two dopes to get out of the road, and they figure that they will take their sweet time doing it, because they didn't like his attitude.\n\nDo not do this when a police officer gives you a lawful order.\n\nRemember, Johnson was Brown's friend, and is trying to make Brown look like a complete victim. Yet his testimony makes Mike Brown look like a very poor martyr to police brutality. In his testimony, Johnson says they told the cop that they would get out of the road \"in a minute\" because they were close to home, but he later says they said nothing to the cop. He says, repeatedly, that they were minding their own business and not doing anything wrong, but he concedes that a theft had just occurred down the street, and his friend Big Mike was the thief.\n\nOn pages 106-107, the grand jury is trying to nail down where Big Mike's hand was when Wilson's gun went off. Johnson testifies that Big Mike's right hand (which was struck by the bullet) was out of the car. The physical evidence shows, however, that Big Mike's arm was inside the car when he was shot in the hand. Johnson also testifies that Wilson shot Big Mike as Big Mike was running away, and hit him in the back. The autopsy showed no shots entering Big Mike from the rear. On pages 158-9, Johnson testifies that Big Mike, having been shot, was \"walking towards the officer saying [that he did not have a gun] in an angry manner.\"\n\nEverything I've said so far is based solely on the grand jury testimony of Dorian Johnson. Ofc. Darren Wilson, in his grand jury testimony (p. 208), says that after Dorian Johnson declined to return to the sidewalk, saying that he and Brown were almost to their destination, he (Wilson) said, \"What's wrong with the sidewalk?\" Brown replied, \"F-k what you have to say.\" It is not a good idea to speak to a police officer in this manner, if you wish to avoid an altercation with him. It is also not a good idea to curse the police officer a second time and slam the door on him as he's trying to get out of his SUV, nor is it advisable to reach into the cop's car and punch his face (p. 210). Do not grab the cop's gun if he draws it, and do not taunt him by telling him he is too much of a pussy to shoot you (p. 214).\n\nNone of this means that Wilson was justified in using deadly force against Brown (though if Wilson's testimony is true and accurate, it seems that way - and there's nothing in Johnson's testimony to counter it). And it doesn't mean that there aren't big problems with policing in Ferguson. I simply want to say here that the behavior of Brown and Johnson on that day is a good example of What Not To Do. Seriously, when a cop tells you to quit walking down the middle of the damn road , you do it. You don't tell him, \"In a minute,\" and you certainly don't curse him. What kind of knuckleheads think this is an appropriate way to respond to police authority? Maybe the deeper problem is a lack of respect for authority, for the law, and for the local community.\n\nPeople like Dorian Johnson and Michael Brown make neighborhoods worse. Did you know that the convenience store that the Gentle Giant robbed was looted the other night by the same sort of people as Mike Brown?

      "text": "Ferguson Through The Eyes of an Officer\n\nOn July 30, 2014, a husband and father of two was shot at point blank range in a relatively quiet residential area of Mendota Heights, Minnesota.\n\nThe man's name was Officer Scott Patrick , and he was performing a traffic stop on a driver who-it was later discovered-was a wanted fugitive. Patrick didn't even have a chance to grab his gun.\n\nIn the midst of the chaos in Ferguson, Missouri, there have been several debates jockeying for position. Last week I spoke to what is perhaps the biggest one- that this tragedy is indicative that racism is alive and well in our country. This is second only to the narrative that there is an extensive problem with police nation-wide.\n\nLet's step back for a second. Do we really understand what it means to be a cop? And does one altercation between an officer and a now-deceased teen really define it all?\n\nAP Photo\n\nMeet Túlio Tourinho, a Brazilian immigrant, Iraq War veteran and police officer in a large Kentucky metro area. (Tourinho appeared on TheBlaze Radio's Chris Salcedo Show two weeks ago - listen here at minute 20:27 for the interview).\n\nOfficer Tourinho is a rare breed in today's society. When it comes to the truth, it's no holds barred with Tourinho-and he's graciously agreed to help debunk some of the widespread myths that surround law enforcement today:\n\nMyth #1: Cops have no feelings; we can't think of them as human.\n\nEveryone's been there. You're blatantly speeding to work, and before you know it, you're pulled on the side of the road. The officer isn't exactly Mr./Ms. Congeniality and you're miffed. \"Geez,\" you think, \"it's not like I'm some kind of deviant.\"\n\nHow precisely does the officer know what you are?\n\n\"People mistake kindness for weakness and criminals will always be 'reading' the officer to see if they can 'take' the officer,\" Tourinho noted. \"And because the officer conducting routine traffic stops or answering to routine runs for service has no idea who the person/people are, or what they're capable of, it's imperative that the officer not be complacent and treat all events as a possible threat to his safety.\"\n\nPolice guard the front of the Buzz Westfall Justice Center where a grand jury will begin looking at the circumstances surrounding the fatal police shooting of an unarmed teenager Michael Brown on August 20, 2014 in Clayton, Missouri. Brown was shot and killed by a Ferguson, Missouri police officer on August 9. Despite the Brown family's continued call for peaceful demonstrations, violent protests have erupted nearly every night in Ferguson since his death. (Credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nTourinho went on to describe that officers have been killed by the unlikeliest of perpetrators-from the elderly to the disabled and beyond.\n\n\"Unarmed\" doesn't always equal \"un-dangerous.\"\n\nMyth #2: Police should just \"shoot to wound.\"\n\nUnlike the movies and television we're all used to seeing, in which a single bullet (wherever it lands) brings a perpetrator to his knees, it's a little more complicated in real life.\n\n[sharequote align=\"center\"]\"Unarmed\" doesn't always equal \"un-dangerous.\"[/sharequote]\n\n\"Because most deadly encounters with deadly weapons occur within 6 feet of the perpetrator,\" Tourinho said, \"officers are always taught to aim at center mass because it is the largest part of the body. Stopping the threat is always the number one priority. Always. And the threat is stopped when he or she stops moving.\"\n\nApply this principal to your own life. If faced with a deadly threat, your survival is top of mind.\n\n\"Back up might be minutes away, and, during a deadly confrontation, minutes are an eternity,\" Tourinho said.\n\nMyth #3: Deadly force has no ramifications for the cop, so he/she isn't likely to think twice.\n\nThere is a persistent idea that an officer-related shooting event is commonplace, and that there are no consequences.\n\n\"In most cases, months go by before the officer is allowed to return to work,\" Tourinho said, \"The officer is immediately placed on administrative leave with pay, given right to counsel, and offered an array of services such as chaplain or peer support or FOP [Fraternal Order of Police] legal services.\"\n\nIn other words, it's a big deal.\n\n(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nMyth #4: Police just shouldn't use their guns.\n\nIf you've got a suspect who has crossed the line and is willing to attack an armed officer, there's absolutely no telling what could unfold. Not only is deadly force authorized once an attack ensues, but it is often the lesser of two evils in the situation.\n\n\"The officer cannot take any chances,\" said Tourinho, who also points out that if \"an individual is willing to do that to a police officer, how much more is that person capable of inflicting on innocent civilian lives?\"\n\nMyth #5: Race always plays a role in who gets arrested.\n\nIt's simply mathematics. Just as there are probably more white arrestees in a northern Minnesota mining town, there are probably more black arrestees in south Chicago. This is pure demographics.\n\n\"The victim mentality will always suggest that ANY and EVERY encounter between an officer and a black person is a racist encounter,\" lamented Tourinho, \"that's the default presumption.\"\n\nTourinho continues, \"Now, are blacks arrested more than whites [overall]? Yes. Why? Because blacks are committing more crimes. That's a fact. The sociology and economics of it are another matter.\"\n\nNow, take Tourinho's insight and apply it to Ferguson.\n\nWe now have facts ( and 12 witnesses ) that seem to corroborate the officer's story.\n\nWe're now privy to information that suggests Brown was no \"gentle giant,\" but rather that he had roughed up a clerk at the store he robbed (the footage of which Eric Holder himself tried to have suppressed), and that his altercation with Officer Darren Wilson involved a \"bum-rush\" and a blowout fracture to one of Wilson's eye sockets-all while he attempted to grab Wilson's firearm.\n\nDon't get me wrong-all of these facts form part of a growing understanding of what happened in Ferguson-and we still have to wait for the final verdict.\n\nPolice officers man their positions in front of Ferguson businesses just after 10 p.m. on West Florissant Avenue on Saturday, Aug. 16, 2014. A curfew was to go into effect at midnight. (AP Photo/St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Robert Cohen)\n\nBut . . . assuming Wilson's story is true, and with Tourinho's points taken into consideration-what would we have had Wilson do? Allow himself to be killed simply because it would prevent Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and the Department of Justice from turning this into a media circus and a national race issue?\n\nTourinho puts it well: \"What does it say about us, as humans, when we are unwilling to give a police officer, someone who places their life on the line for the sake of innocents, the benefit of the doubt; when we are so hell-bent on judging, crucifying and burying a police officer without any due process or before all the facts are made evident? If we are willing to give a civilian the benefit of the discovery and fact-finding, why are we so unwilling to give cops the same?\"\n\nEven if Wilson is everything the Ferguson protestors say he is, we've got a justice system to fix that. Let's not throw the baby out with the bath water by making this about all cops.\n\nThe reality is that the average cop is no different than the average salesman, accountant, or writer . . . they just want to do their job, and go home alive at the end of the day. How many of us have the luxury of waking up without the relentless reality that today might be your last watch, just because somebody didn't want to go to jail, or because someone took issue with your profession?\n\nWhether people like it or not, every officer walks a thin blue line for society. There's very little between the people they protect, and the danger on the other side.\n\nDo a little soul-searching. Would you really walk that line by yourself?\n\nMary Ramirez is a full time writer, creator of www.afuturefree.com - a political commentary blog, and contributor to The Chris Salcedo Show.

      "text": "Exclusive: Officer who killed Ashli Babbitt abandoned US Capitol post for card game, lied to investigators about it, source says\n\nCapitol Police Internal Affairs Division probe led to a recommendation that Michael Byrd be fired for the 2001 incident. He kept his job.\n\nThe U.S. Capitol Police lieutenant who shot and killed Ashli Babbitt at the Capitol on Jan. 6 was recommended for termination in 2001 for abandoning his post in the Speaker's Office for a card game in a nearby cloakroom, then lying about it to Internal Affairs Division investigators, Blaze News has learned.\n\nThe 2001 investigation of Michael L. Byrd, 56, was the first known disciplinary case brought against the lieutenant who crept from his blind near the doors to the Speaker's Lobby on Jan. 6, 2021, and shot Babbitt to death. The 2001 incident is the fourth such disciplinary case disclosed since Nov. 20.\n\nA source with detailed knowledge of the Internal Affairs Division case told Blaze News that Byrd was charged with abandoning his post, eating and drinking at his post, and lying to investigators - a terminable offense. It is one of three Byrd disciplinary cases for which records could not be found when a House oversight subcommittee requested them in early 2024, the source said.\n\nByrd was assigned to the Speaker's Office of U.S. Rep. Denny Hastert (R-Ill.) on the evening in question. During his break, Byrd went to play cards in a cloak room near the House Chamber, the source said.\n\n'He ends up getting into some trouble, but they won't terminate him.'\n\nByrd went to relieve the officer who covered Hastert's office during Byrd's break, but then abandoned his post and returned to the cloakroom to play cards, the source told Blaze News.\n\n\"Well, the sergeant walks by and was like, 'Man, there's nobody in the Speaker's Office,'\" said the source, who has worked in the top levels of U.S. Capitol Police administration. \"This is a big issue.\"\n\nAn internal investigation was opened.\n\n\"Of course, we have cameras everywhere and we track him walking off post, going back to the cloakroom,\" the source said. \"And we talked to the other people in there and he was in there playing cards.\"\n\nInvestigators also found that Byrd was eating and drinking at his post in the Speaker's Office, activities forbidden by department policy, the source said.\n\n\"Supposed to be a bit of the decorum there, but he's sitting in a chair eating and drinking a soda, which is a big taboo, especially back then,\" the source said. \"It's the Speaker's Office.\"\n\nInvestigators confronted Byrd with their findings. He denied it all.\n\n\"Mike denies that he was supposed to be assigned to the post,\" the source told Blaze News. \"So therefore he couldn't abandon the post. He denied eating and denied drinking on the post.\"\n\nInvestigators already had the evidence they needed, but they gave Byrd a chance to come clean, the source said.\n\n\"They told him - and this is what we do when we're getting ready to charge somebody - 'We know different, Mike. There are video cameras up there.' Mike still denies it.\"\n\nThen-Lt. Michael L. Byrd shot Ashli Elizabeth Babbitt at 2:44 p.m. on Jan. 6, 2021, just as she leaned out a broken window into the House Speaker's Lobby. As Byrd's disciplinary record is being revealed in 2024, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said she wants Byrd charged with homicide. Photos by John Sullivan (left) and Aaron Babbitt\n\nThe USCP disciplinary officer recommended that Byrd be fired.\n\n\"So they charge him with eating, drinking on post, abandoning post,\" the source said. \"They charge him with untruthful statements with the recommendation to terminate.\"\n\nEven with the evidence and firing recommendation, Capitol Police administration did not part ways with Byrd.\n\n\"He ends up getting into some trouble, but they won't terminate him,\" the source said. \"So therefore they didn't want to move forward with the untruthful statements [charge], but that was still a sustained charge against him.\"\n\nThe source questioned how records of the 2001 case and two other disciplinary cases brought against Byrd could be \"missing,\" as congressional investigators were told by the USCP in early 2024. There are too many intersecting emails and memos outside Byrd's internal-affairs jacket for the record to be fully missing, the source said.\n\n\"That would've been documented so many different ways that it'd be impossible for them not to have it,\" the source said.\n\n\"It's funny to me that everyone knows Mike's a liar and the case that sustains it that had all the evidence that shows he is a liar is something that Tad [DiBiase] and the department can't find when there's all these different records. If they just did a search on the emails, all this stuff, it would be in existence.\"\n\nThomas A. \"Tad\" DiBiase is general counsel for U.S. Capitol Police.\n\nBlaze News reached out to the Capitol Police and an attorney for Byrd but did not receive a reply by press time.\n\nAs more details of Byrd's work history emerge, a key Republican lawmaker expressed reservations about Byrd's 2023 promotion to captain.\n\n\"I have concerns about this decision, given Byrd's lengthy disciplinary history and the apparent political influence of internal operational decisions related to Byrd following January 6 , 2021,\" U.S. Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) wrote in a Nov. 20 letter to Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger.\n\nRevelation of Byrd's 2001 disciplinary case comes as congressional investigators disclosed the lengths Democrat lawmakers and Capitol Police went to after Jan. 6 to provide Byrd with income, security upgrades at his Maryland home, and months of free lodging at a secure military hotel at Joint Base Andrews in Prince George's County, Md.\n\nU.S. Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.), shown here at a GOP leadership press event in Washington, D.C., Dec. 4, 2024, recently disclosed that several disciplinary cases had been filed over 20 years against Michael Byrd, the Capitol Police lieutenant who shot and killed Ashli Babbitt at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Photo by NathanPosner/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nRecords obtained by the Committee on House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight showed top House Democrats worked with DiBiase to find ways to help Byrd financially in the months after he shot and killed Babbitt at the Capitol. The records were first disclosed by journalist John Solomon and Just the News.\n\nByrd was given $36,000 in unrestricted funds as a \"retention bonus\" in 2021, while other Capitol Police officers received around $3,000 each. Byrd was reimbursed for more than $21,000 in security upgrades for his personal residence in Prince George's County.\n\nCapitol Police paid to house Byrd at the Joint Base Andrews military facility from July 2021 until late January 2022 at a cost of more than $35,000, according to records obtained by Judicial Watch Inc.

      "text": "Exclusive: Officer who killed Ashli Babbitt abandoned US Capitol post for card game, lied to investigators about it, source says\n\nCapitol Police Internal Affairs Division probe led to a recommendation that Michael Byrd be fired for the 2001 incident. He kept his job.\n\nThe U.S. Capitol Police lieutenant who shot and killed Ashli Babbitt at the Capitol on Jan. 6 was recommended for termination in 2001 for abandoning his post in the Speaker's Office for a card game in a nearby cloakroom, then lying about it to Internal Affairs Division investigators, Blaze News has learned.\n\nThe 2001 investigation of Michael L. Byrd, 56, was the first known disciplinary case brought against the lieutenant who crept from his blind near the doors to the Speaker's Lobby on Jan. 6, 2021, and shot Babbitt to death. The 2001 incident is the fourth such disciplinary case disclosed since Nov. 20.\n\nA source with detailed knowledge of the Internal Affairs Division case told Blaze News that Byrd was charged with abandoning his post, eating and drinking at his post, and lying to investigators - a terminable offense. It is one of three Byrd disciplinary cases for which records could not be found when a House oversight subcommittee requested them in early 2024, the source said.\n\nByrd was assigned to the Speaker's Office of U.S. Rep. Denny Hastert (R-Ill.) on the evening in question. During his break, Byrd went to play cards in a cloak room near the House Chamber, the source said.\n\n'He ends up getting into some trouble, but they won't terminate him.'\n\nByrd went to relieve the officer who covered Hastert's office during Byrd's break, but then abandoned his post and returned to the cloakroom to play cards, the source told Blaze News.\n\n\"Well, the sergeant walks by and was like, 'Man, there's nobody in the Speaker's Office,'\" said the source, who has worked in the top levels of U.S. Capitol Police administration. \"This is a big issue.\"\n\nAn internal investigation was opened.\n\n\"Of course, we have cameras everywhere and we track him walking off post, going back to the cloakroom,\" the source said. \"And we talked to the other people in there and he was in there playing cards.\"\n\nInvestigators also found that Byrd was eating and drinking at his post in the Speaker's Office, activities forbidden by department policy, the source said.\n\n\"Supposed to be a bit of the decorum there, but he's sitting in a chair eating and drinking a soda, which is a big taboo, especially back then,\" the source said. \"It's the Speaker's Office.\"\n\nInvestigators confronted Byrd with their findings. He denied it all.\n\n\"Mike denies that he was supposed to be assigned to the post,\" the source told Blaze News. \"So therefore he couldn't abandon the post. He denied eating and denied drinking on the post.\"\n\nInvestigators already had the evidence they needed, but they gave Byrd a chance to come clean, the source said.\n\n\"They told him - and this is what we do when we're getting ready to charge somebody - 'We know different, Mike. There are video cameras up there.' Mike still denies it.\"\n\nThen-Lt. Michael L. Byrd shot Ashli Elizabeth Babbitt at 2:44 p.m. on Jan. 6, 2021, just as she leaned out a broken window into the House Speaker's Lobby. As Byrd's disciplinary record is being revealed in 2024, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said she wants Byrd charged with homicide. Photos by John Sullivan (left) and Aaron Babbitt\n\nThe USCP disciplinary officer recommended that Byrd be fired.\n\n\"So they charge him with eating, drinking on post, abandoning post,\" the source said. \"They charge him with untruthful statements with the recommendation to terminate.\"\n\nEven with the evidence and firing recommendation, Capitol Police administration did not part ways with Byrd.\n\n\"He ends up getting into some trouble, but they won't terminate him,\" the source said. \"So therefore they didn't want to move forward with the untruthful statements [charge], but that was still a sustained charge against him.\"\n\nThe source questioned how records of the 2001 case and two other disciplinary cases brought against Byrd could be \"missing,\" as congressional investigators were told by the USCP in early 2024. There are too many intersecting emails and memos outside Byrd's internal-affairs jacket for the record to be fully missing, the source said.\n\n\"That would've been documented so many different ways that it'd be impossible for them not to have it,\" the source said.\n\n\"It's funny to me that everyone knows Mike's a liar and the case that sustains it that had all the evidence that shows he is a liar is something that Tad [DiBiase] and the department can't find when there's all these different records. If they just did a search on the emails, all this stuff, it would be in existence.\"\n\nThomas A. \"Tad\" DiBiase is general counsel for U.S. Capitol Police.\n\nBlaze News reached out to the Capitol Police and an attorney for Byrd but did not receive a reply by press time.\n\nAs more details of Byrd's work history emerge, a key Republican lawmaker expressed reservations about Byrd's 2023 promotion to captain.\n\n\"I have concerns about this decision, given Byrd's lengthy disciplinary history and the apparent political influence of internal operational decisions related to Byrd following January 6 , 2021,\" U.S. Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) wrote in a Nov. 20 letter to Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger.\n\nRevelation of Byrd's 2001 disciplinary case comes as congressional investigators disclosed the lengths Democrat lawmakers and Capitol Police went to after Jan. 6 to provide Byrd with income, security upgrades at his Maryland home, and months of free lodging at a secure military hotel at Joint Base Andrews in Prince George's County, Md.\n\nU.S. Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.), shown here at a GOP leadership press event in Washington, D.C., Dec. 4, 2024, recently disclosed that several disciplinary cases had been filed over 20 years against Michael Byrd, the Capitol Police lieutenant who shot and killed Ashli Babbitt at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Photo by NathanPosner/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nRecords obtained by the Committee on House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight showed top House Democrats worked with DiBiase to find ways to help Byrd financially in the months after he shot and killed Babbitt at the Capitol. The records were first disclosed by journalist John Solomon and Just the News.\n\nByrd was given $36,000 in unrestricted funds as a \"retention bonus\" in 2021, while other Capitol Police officers received around $3,000 each. Byrd was reimbursed for more than $21,000 in security upgrades for his personal residence in Prince George's County.\n\nCapitol Police paid to house Byrd at the Joint Base Andrews military facility from July 2021 until late January 2022 at a cost of more than $35,000, according to records obtained by Judicial Watch Inc. When he left the base for any reason, Byrd was provided with a Capitol Police dignitary protection detail, which a source told Blaze News could easily cost $425 per hour.\n\n'This is really bad for you all to do this when you know we're expecting to have funds soon.'\n\nDiBiase met with Jamie Fleet, staff director for then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), to discuss options to help Byrd, according to an email uncovered by congressional investigators. Pelosi had earlier said that she wanted Byrd \"taken care of,\" said a Blaze News source who directly witnessed the statement during a meeting.\n\nDiBiase suggested that they could place Byrd at one of the department's \"continuity sites,\" but that would require a top-secret clearance. Continuity sites are maintained to ensure that Capitol Police could continue to operate and communicate in the event of a catastrophe in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"We believe it would be very difficult for him to obtain one, give that he has had significant financial issues in the past and is currently on the USCP Lewis List,\" DiBiase wrote.\n\nThe Lewis List is a confidential database of police officers who have disciplinary records and could face added scrutiny if they were called as witnesses in criminal cases.\n\nCapitol Police considered assigning Byrd as head of security at the USCP Alternate Communications Facility, which is located outside the capital region. Under such a plan, Byrd could be awarded a per-diem payment for expenses. Sources told Blaze News that other Capitol Police officers assigned to the ACF have not been given per-diem payments.\n\nDiBiase wrote that the USCP could help Byrd obtain mental health assistance, \"but not move forward on a FFDE [fitness for duty evaluation] since a negative one could mean we should not allow him to carry our USCP-issued firearm if he is not fit to be a police officer.\n\n\"We believe it is more important for him to have his weapon and the ability to defend himself,\" DiBiase wrote. \"We have no indication Mike intends to harm himself and he has access to personal weapons, so even if we were to remove his weapon, there would still be some danger.\"\n\nAccording to Loudermilk's Nov. 20 letter, the Capitol Police had planned to loan a shotgun to Byrd, but he failed the federal background check and did not qualify after shotgun training.\n\nThere was an early plan to provide Byrd with a payment from the Capitol Police Officers Memorial Fund, which was founded to honor fallen officers and support their survivors.

      "text": "California police chief says early release of criminal led to horrific death of officer\n\nThe deputy's police cruiser was ripped in half.\n\nA California police chief blamed lax incarceration policies for the death of an officer in a horrible car crash.\n\nDeputy Hector Cuevas Jr. was killed when his patrol vehicle crashed into another car while chasing after 22-year-old Ryan Dwayne Turner Jr. on Monday. Cuevas' patrol vehicle was split in half from the force of the car accident, and he died at the scene.\n\n'Ryan Turner's actions speak loudly that he has a habitual pattern of fleeing law enforcement because he fears no consequences.'\n\nThe incident unfolded when deputies spotted a stolen vehicle in Victorville on St. Patrick's Day. When they tried to stop the vehicle, the driver fled from them. While giving chase, Cuevas hit a woman's car at an intersection. Turner then fled on foot and was apprehended by police.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Rialto Police Department said in a statement that Turner had a history of trying to flee from law enforcement.\n\nIn Jan. 2024, Turner was involved in a remarkably similar series of events. He was driving a reportedly stolen car when Rialto police tried to stop him and he fled from officers. In the pursuit, an officer crashed into another car in an intersection. Turner fled on foot but was captured.\n\nHe also tried to flee from officers after being handcuffed.\n\nAlthough he was charged with felony evasion, possession of a stolen vehicle, and grand theft auto, he pleaded no contest to grand theft auto and the other charges were dropped.\n\nHe was sentenced to 16 months in county prison, but served only eight months before being released.\n\nRialto Police Chief Mark Kling said that policies on crediting prisoners for time served likely led to the death of Deputy Cuevas.\n\n\"Because of this law, Ryan Turner was released from county prison after serving only half of his original 16-month sentence,\" said Kling. \"Before AB 109 and PC 4019 were enacted, there is a good likelihood that Ryan Turner would still be in state prison today and this deputy would still be alive. Ryan Turner's actions speak loudly that he has a habitual pattern of fleeing law enforcement because he fears no consequences.\"\n\nTurner was charged with second-degree murder.\n\nThe woman that Cuevas crashed into also spoke to KTTV-TV about the accident.\n\n\"I was about to turn left and then the cop came right in front of me, and he had no siren, no lights, nothing,\" said Marcelline Demyan.\n\n\"I feel sorry for his family. I know he has two kids and a wife and two siblings. I feel really sorry for them,\" she added.\n\nDemyan suffered a broken finger.\n\nScenes from the crash can be viewed on the news video from KTLA-TV on YouTube.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Jan. 6 case dismissed 40 days after judge found Luke Coffee guilty of 'assault' on Officer Lila Morris\n\nMorris testified that Coffee never struck or otherwise touched her; Judge Rudolph Contreras found him guilty anyway.\n\nTexas filmmaker Luke Coffee took a direct blow to the left arm from Metropolitan Police Department Officer Lila Morris on Jan. 6 , 2021, yet it was Coffee who was found guilty of assaulting the notorious D.C. officer who seconds later savagely beat Rosanne Boyland with a hardened walking stick, multiple videos viewed by Blaze News showed.\n\nForty days later, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ordered the case dismissed with prejudice on a motion from the U.S. Department of Justice - now controlled by President Donald J. Trump - drafted by acting U.S. Attorney Edward Martin.\n\n\"This journey has been about so much more than ourselves,\" Coffee told Blaze News after his case was dismissed.  \"It has been about standing firm for truth, even when the odds seemed insurmountable. It has been about shining a light on the humanity and dignity of the 1,500-plus J6ers who have endured unimaginable struggles.\n\n\"For four years, our lives were turned upside down, and yet, through it all, God has been working - restoring, redeeming, and preparing us for this very moment.\"\n\n'Luke Coffee might be dead today, but by the grace of God he was pulled to safety.'\n\nAt a Dec. 13 hearing to announce the verdicts in Coffee's bench trial, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mindy Deranek lionized Morris as a \"hero,\" a \"victim,\" and a \"valued member of the community\" who was honored by the U.S. government for her Jan. 6 actions.\n\nDeranek claimed that Boyland died of an \"overdose.\"\n\nShe failed to mention that the medical examiner's cause of death - acute amphetamine intoxication from a legal Adderall prescription for ADHD - is hotly contested by the Boyland family. The Boylands' forensic pathologist ruled that the death was caused by compression asphyxiation and said the amphetamine salts in her system from the prescription medication did not cause her death.\n\nThree hundred twenty-four days after his bench trial before Judge Contreras ended, Coffee was found guilty of civil disorder; assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers using a dangerous weapon; trespassing with a deadly or dangerous weapon; disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon; and engaging in physical violence in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon.\n\nCoffee, 45, of Dallas, was found not guilty of disorderly conduct in a capitol building. Two other charges had been previously dropped by prosecutors.\n\nMetropolitan Police Department Officer Lila Morris winds up with a wooden walking stick to strike protester Luke Coffee and a lifeless Rosanne Boyland outside the Lower West Terrace Tunnel at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. U.S. Department of Justice/Metropolitan Police Department body cam\n\nOne of Coffee's defense attorneys, Carolyn Stewart, said the DOJ moved to have Coffee immediately taken into custody Dec. 13, but Judge Contreras refused.\n\n\"The vindictive AUSA Deranek said she wanted to 'put lies to bed' while instead further defaming and lying about Lila Morris' illegal use of lethal force against Boyland and Coffee,\" Stewart told Blaze News. \"Appallingly, she said the dishonorable Morris was a 'hero' who was 'honored by the government' for her heroic fighting.\n\n\"I felt like vomiting at the lies that the murderer Morris is being called a hero,\" Stewart said.\n\nMorris was one of three MPD officers feted as Jan. 6 heroes by the National Football League at Super Bowl LV in Tampa - along with Michael Fanone and Daniel Hodges.\n\n\"Yes, the lying, unscrupulous DOJ calls the cowardly murder of the woman driven to unconsciousness by the MPD's illegitimate use of OC [pepper] spray and tear gas in a confined space with no escape route - where the MPD caused a stampede and Morris then beat the unconscious Rosanne - as 'heroic,'\" Stewart said.\n\nMorris and the officers who employed gas in the Lower West Terrace Tunnel about 4:20 p.m. should be tried for murder in Boyland's death, Stewart said.\n\n\"Luke Coffee might be dead today, but by the grace of God he was pulled to safety after being sprayed into unconsciousness by murderers,\" she said.\n\nNearly four years later, Boyland's death still looms over Jan. 6 like a storm cloud.\n\nShe had just wandered into the tunnel at 4:18 p.m. when police released a gas that bystanders said sucked the oxygen out of the air. An officer just inside the doors at the back of the tunnel started firing high-velocity projectiles, including pepper balls - one of which struck Boyland and caused her to fall, witnesses and her parents have said.\n\nThe panic from the gas and an aggressive push-out by police with shields caused protesters to spill from the tunnel like a waterfall, with many tumbling down the concrete steps, only to be crushed by layers of bodies, video shows.\n\n\"I put my arm underneath her and was pulling her out, and then another guy fell on top of her, and another guy was just walking [on top of her],\" Boyland's friend Justin Winchell told an Atlanta television station in 2021. \"There were people stacked two-three deep ... people just crushed.\"\n\nCapitol Police security video and open-source video from those who surrounded the mouth of the tunnel showed that Coffee stepped front and center and implored police to stop. He had earlier faced the crowd and repeatedly implored them to \"Stop!\" and \"Pray!\"\n\nLuke Coffee was repeatedly doused with pepper spray by police outside the Lower West Terrace Tunnel at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Capitol Police CCTV/Blaze News Graphic\n\nCoffee was targeted with heavy streams of pepper spray at least eight times, according to defense attorneys Stewart and Anthony Sabatini.\n\nMorris, who had worked her way to the front of the tunnel and was crouched behind a bystander trying to escape, picked a wooden walking stick from the ground and used it as a weapon rather than employ her department-issued riot stick, video showed.\n\nMorris used a two-handed overhead swing - a defense attorney described the swing \"as if using an axe\" - to strike Coffee in the left elbow with the walking stick, video showed. She swung at Coffee again but missed.\n\nThen, inexplicably, Morris turned her fury on the lifeless Boyland, who was turning purple from hypoxia. With a two-handed overhead swing, Morris delivered three blows to Boyland's body in quick succession, striking her head, face, and ribs, video showed.\n\nThe beating was so furious that the walking stick flew out of Morris' hands during the fourth swing, bounced off the top of the archway, and see-sawed onto the ground six feet away.\n\nMetropolitan Police Department Officer Lila Morris strikes protester Luke Coffee at the mouth of the Lower West Terrace Tunnel at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Video shows Morris then used the wooden walking stick to attack unconscious protester Rosanne Boyland. Metropolitan Police Department: Officer Lila Morris body cam\n\nDuring cross-examination at Coffee's trial, Morris said Coffee did not assault her. She said she was trying to defend herself against a man behind Coffee and to his left who wielded a \"long stick.\"\n\n\"Did the man in the center with the cowboy hat ever strike you?\" defense attorney Stewart asked.\n\n\"Not that I recall,\" Morris replied.\n\nStewart asked the officer how she was trained to use a riot stick.\n\n'I can make sure she is never forgotten.'\n\n\"Are you ever trained to hold it like a bat and strike it over somebody's head?\" Stewart asked.\n\n\"No,\" Morris answered.\n\nAfter she lost the walking stick, Morris turned her back on the crowd and was shortly pulled inside by other MPD officers, video showed. She was carried, kicking and flailing, into the Capitol basement hallway, saying, \"I can't breathe!\" bodycam video and Capitol CCTV recordings showed.\n\nMorris was approached by MPD Officer Anthony Walsh, who said, \"Take a minute to catch your breath. ... Were you pulled out into the crowd?\"\n\n\"I was in the front. They were pulling me, but they kept jabbing my face with something, hit me, and I couldn't ... I lost my breath and couldn't breathe,\" Morris said just prior to 4:34 p.m., according to Walsh's bodycam video.\n\nVideo showed that no one attempted to pull Morris into the crowd, but a man wearing orange ski goggles repeatedly attempted to smack her with what appeared to be a long wooden dowel. One of the thrusts struck Morris in the face shield, video showed.\n\nProtester Luke Coffee of Dallas holds up a crutch in what he says was an attempt to create a separation between police and the crowd outside the Lower West Terrace Tunnel at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. U.S. Capitol Police CCTV\n\nCoffee twice held up his hand in a \"stop\" gesture. Coffee picked up a 1.6-pound aluminum crutch and held it over his head. He said it was an effort to make himself as large as possible to be a barrier between police and the crowd.\n\nSecurity video showed Coffee held the crutch over his head for nine seconds before lowering it to waist level and pushing into the police line like a snowplow. He drove the entire line of officers back and stayed pressed against the front line for 20 seconds, according to prosecutors. After he slipped and fell, Coffee \"charged\" the line a second time, the DOJ argued.\n\nThe body cam of MPD Officer Steven Sajumon shows that once Coffee got back on his feet, he took what appeared to be two quick steps toward Sajumon with the crutch held in front. Coffee said he was blind from being doused with pepper spray. The officer put his right hand on Coffee's head, pushed him back, and said, \"We're good.\"\n\nCoffee said he then tried to switch the crutch into his left hand. Prosecutors claimed it was a \"swing\" at Sajumon that constituted assault. The officer's body cam shows his right hand on the tip of the crutch when he said, \"We're good, we're good.\" Judge Contreras found the interaction constituted felony assault by Coffee.\n\nCoffee told Blaze News that Officer Sajumon snapped him out of fight-or-flight mode when he patted him on the head and said, \"We're good.\" Coffee then stumbled away, collapsed, and fell unconscious to the ground.\n\nAaron James and Isaac Westbury help Luke Coffee of Dallas after Coffee fell inside the Lower West Terrace Tunnel at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. A short time later, Coffee collapsed and was dragged down the stairs. Metropolitan Police Department body cam\n\nBodycam video shows Coffee in a supine position being dragged down the steps from the tunnel at 4:29 p.m. Coffee said he was unconscious during this time, until bystanders helped to revive him.\n\nLindsey Graham, a social media influencer who is known as the Patriot Barbie, testified in Coffee's trial that when she encountered Coffee at the bottom of the steps, his eyes were swollen shut and he was in serious pain.\n\n\"He appeared to me somewhere within a few feet of me, with his face kind of red and swollen and his eyes closed, and he looked in need of help,\" Graham said, according to the court transcript. \"... What made me notice him was that he looked like he was in distress. He was sweating and crying, and his eyes were closed and his face was red and inflamed.\"\n\nGraham said she found bottled water that Coffee used to rinse his eyes, but that didn't bring relief. Blake McAlavy offered Coffee a bottle of thick green juice to use as a rinse, she said.\n\n\"Blake had some kind of green juice in his pocket that he had brought, and he gave Luke some green juice, hoping to help him as well.\"\n\nOfficer Morris testified that Coffee did not touch her with the aluminum crutch, but she felt squeezed in the crowd of officers and had trouble breathing.\n\nAt trial, defense attorney Stewart asked, \"So the crutch does not hit you?\"\n\n\"No, it doesn't hit me,\" Morris said.\n\n\"Okay,\" Stewart replied. \"I wanted to check here, because we're, we're charged with contact assault.\"\n\nAt the Dec. 13, 2024, verdict reading, Judge Contreras found Coffee guilty of seven counts, including felony assault on two police officers with the aluminum crutch he picked up off the ground. He found Coffee not guilty on one misdemeanor charge.\n\n'Let's put these lies to rest right now.'\n\nJudge Contreras ruled that the aluminum crutch qualified as a dangerous weapon and asserted that it was Coffee's intent to injure officers by pressing them back with the crutch.\n\nContreras said he did not believe Coffee acted out of concern for Boyland, and he claimed Coffee did not help Boyland get moved to safety after she was struck by Officer Morris.\n\n\"Other rioters moved Ms. Boyland out of the tunnel area seconds before Mr. Coffee charged the officers in the tunnel,\" Contreras said, \"thus highlighting that his attack on the officers in the tunnel was not reasonable or necessary with respect to defending Ms. Boyland, who, by that time, was out of the tunnel and off to the side, well out of harm's way.\"\n\nLuke Coffee holds up a crutch to create separation between police and protesters while bystanders pulled an unconscious Rosanne Boyland to safety outside the Lower West Terrace Tunnel at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Metropolitan Police Department body cam\n\nVideo shows, however, that bystanders who rescued Boyland after the beating by Morris pulled her to safety simultaneously to Coffee raising the crutch over his head.\n\nThe judge did not mention the beating that Morris doled out to the dying Boyland.\n\nJudge Contreras allowed prosecutor Deranek to put her arguments into the record as to why Coffee should be jailed.\n\nDeranek ripped Coffee and social media commentators for claiming Morris caused Boyland's death. Deranek contended that online discussion of Morris' actions made the officer a victim again, in addition to Coffee's alleged assault on her.\n\n\"Let's put these lies to rest right now,\" Deranek said, according to the trial transcript. \"Officer Morris had nothing to do with Roseanne [sic] Boyland's death. Roseanne Boyland was not killed by Officer Morris or any of the other officers defending the Capitol that day. She died of a tragic overdose.\"\n\nDeranek then blamed Coffee for the fact that police did not render aid to Boyland. Relying on a New York Times video analysis, Deranek said, \"It was in fact the defendant's actions that prevented the officers from rendering her aid as she lay dying.\"\n\nThe only contact any police officer had with Boyland before she was pulled into the Capitol was Morris and the wooden walking stick she used to strike the unconscious Boyland in the head, face, and ribs, video showed.\n\nLuke Coffee rinses out his eyes after being doused with pepper spray by police in the Lower West Terrace Tunnel at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Coffee said even though he wore sunglasses, his eyes and the skin around them sustained especially painful burns. Photos by Blake McAlavy (1986-2022)\n\nBodycam video, CCTV, and video from media and bystanders showed that no police officers moved to aid Boyland that afternoon, even when bystanders begged and pleaded and said Boyland was dying. Officers pushed more people from the tunnel on top of Boyland, who was crushed under the pileup, bodycam video showed.\n\nSheriff's deputy Ronald Colton McAbee repeatedly pointed at Boyland when he stepped in front of the police line just before Coffee arrived.\n\n\"Quit f**king trying to kill that girl!\" McAbee shouted at officers, according to MPD bodycam video. \"F**king stop!\"\n\nThe same argument used on Coffee was made against McAbee: that he prevented police from helping Boyland. Video from police body cameras, Capitol Police CCTV, and bystanders showed, however, that McAbee repeatedly tried to get officers to help Boyland, who lay a few feet from police.\n\nThe DOJ contention only added to the pain McAbee still experiences over Boyland's death.\n\n\"Her name will live on as long as there is breath in my lungs,\" McAbee wrote to Boyland's parents just after his trial. \"There will be justice for her. I couldn't bring her back, but I can make sure she is never forgotten.\"\n\nLike Blaze News? Bypass the censors, sign up for our newsletters, and get stories like this direct to your inbox.

      "text": "Jan. 6 case dismissed 40 days after judge found Luke Coffee guilty of 'assault' on Officer Lila Morris\n\nMorris testified that Coffee never struck or otherwise touched her; Judge Rudolph Contreras found him guilty anyway.\n\nTexas filmmaker Luke Coffee took a direct blow to the left arm from Metropolitan Police Department Officer Lila Morris on Jan. 6 , 2021, yet it was Coffee who was found guilty of assaulting the notorious D.C. officer who seconds later savagely beat Rosanne Boyland with a hardened walking stick, multiple videos viewed by Blaze News showed.\n\nForty days later, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ordered the case dismissed with prejudice on a motion from the U.S. Department of Justice - now controlled by President Donald J. Trump - drafted by acting U.S. Attorney Edward Martin.\n\n\"This journey has been about so much more than ourselves,\" Coffee told Blaze News after his case was dismissed.  \"It has been about standing firm for truth, even when the odds seemed insurmountable. It has been about shining a light on the humanity and dignity of the 1,500-plus J6ers who have endured unimaginable struggles.\n\n\"For four years, our lives were turned upside down, and yet, through it all, God has been working - restoring, redeeming, and preparing us for this very moment.\"\n\n'Luke Coffee might be dead today, but by the grace of God he was pulled to safety.'\n\nAt a Dec. 13 hearing to announce the verdicts in Coffee's bench trial, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mindy Deranek lionized Morris as a \"hero,\" a \"victim,\" and a \"valued member of the community\" who was honored by the U.S. government for her Jan. 6 actions.\n\nDeranek claimed that Boyland died of an \"overdose.\"\n\nShe failed to mention that the medical examiner's cause of death - acute amphetamine intoxication from a legal Adderall prescription for ADHD - is hotly contested by the Boyland family. The Boylands' forensic pathologist ruled that the death was caused by compression asphyxiation and said the amphetamine salts in her system from the prescription medication did not cause her death.\n\nThree hundred twenty-four days after his bench trial before Judge Contreras ended, Coffee was found guilty of civil disorder; assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers using a dangerous weapon; trespassing with a deadly or dangerous weapon; disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon; and engaging in physical violence in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon.\n\nCoffee, 45, of Dallas, was found not guilty of disorderly conduct in a capitol building. Two other charges had been previously dropped by prosecutors.\n\nMetropolitan Police Department Officer Lila Morris winds up with a wooden walking stick to strike protester Luke Coffee and a lifeless Rosanne Boyland outside the Lower West Terrace Tunnel at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. U.S. Department of Justice/Metropolitan Police Department body cam\n\nOne of Coffee's defense attorneys, Carolyn Stewart, said the DOJ moved to have Coffee immediately taken into custody Dec. 13, but Judge Contreras refused.\n\n\"The vindictive AUSA Deranek said she wanted to 'put lies to bed' while instead further defaming and lying about Lila Morris' illegal use of lethal force against Boyland and Coffee,\" Stewart told Blaze News. \"Appallingly, she said the dishonorable Morris was a 'hero' who was 'honored by the government' for her heroic fighting.\n\n\"I felt like vomiting at the lies that the murderer Morris is being called a hero,\" Stewart said.\n\nMorris was one of three MPD officers feted as Jan. 6 heroes by the National Football League at Super Bowl LV in Tampa - along with Michael Fanone and Daniel Hodges.\n\n\"Yes, the lying, unscrupulous DOJ calls the cowardly murder of the woman driven to unconsciousness by the MPD's illegitimate use of OC [pepper] spray and tear gas in a confined space with no escape route - where the MPD caused a stampede and Morris then beat the unconscious Rosanne - as 'heroic,'\" Stewart said.\n\nMorris and the officers who employed gas in the Lower West Terrace Tunnel about 4:20 p.m. should be tried for murder in Boyland's death, Stewart said.\n\n\"Luke Coffee might be dead today, but by the grace of God he was pulled to safety after being sprayed into unconsciousness by murderers,\" she said.\n\nNearly four years later, Boyland's death still looms over Jan. 6 like a storm cloud.\n\nShe had just wandered into the tunnel at 4:18 p.m. when police released a gas that bystanders said sucked the oxygen out of the air. An officer just inside the doors at the back of the tunnel started firing high-velocity projectiles, including pepper balls - one of which struck Boyland and caused her to fall, witnesses and her parents have said.\n\nThe panic from the gas and an aggressive push-out by police with shields caused protesters to spill from the tunnel like a waterfall, with many tumbling down the concrete steps, only to be crushed by layers of bodies, video shows.\n\n\"I put my arm underneath her and was pulling her out, and then another guy fell on top of her, and another guy was just walking [on top of her],\" Boyland's friend Justin Winchell told an Atlanta television station in 2021. \"There were people stacked two-three deep ... people just crushed.\"\n\nCapitol Police security video and open-source video from those who surrounded the mouth of the tunnel showed that Coffee stepped front and center and implored police to stop. He had earlier faced the crowd and repeatedly implored them to \"Stop!\" and \"Pray!\"\n\nLuke Coffee was repeatedly doused with pepper spray by police outside the Lower West Terrace Tunnel at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Capitol Police CCTV/Blaze News Graphic\n\nCoffee was targeted with heavy streams of pepper spray at least eight times, according to defense attorneys Stewart and Anthony Sabatini.\n\nMorris, who had worked her way to the front of the tunnel and was crouched behind a bystander trying to escape, picked a wooden walking stick from the ground and used it as a weapon rather than employ her department-issued riot stick, video showed.\n\nMorris used a two-handed overhead swing - a defense attorney described the swing \"as if using an axe\" - to strike Coffee in the left elbow with the walking stick, video showed. She swung at Coffee again but missed.\n\nThen, inexplicably, Morris turned her fury on the lifeless Boyland, who was turning purple from hypoxia. With a two-handed overhead swing, Morris delivered three blows to Boyland's body in quick succession, striking her head, face, and ribs, video showed.\n\nThe beating was so furious that the walking stick flew out of Morris' hands during the fourth swing, bounced off the top of the archway, and see-sawed onto the ground six feet away.\n\nMetropolitan Police Department Officer Lila Morris strikes protester Luke Coffee at the mouth of the Lower West Terrace Tunnel at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Video shows Morris then used the wooden walking stick to attack unconscious protester Rosanne Boyland. Metropolitan Police Department: Officer Lila Morris body cam\n\nDuring cross-examination at Coffee's trial, Morris said Coffee did not assault her. She said she was trying to defend herself against a man behind Coffee and to his left who wielded a \"long stick.\"\n\n\"Did the man in the center with the cowboy hat ever strike you?\" defense attorney Stewart asked.\n\n\"Not that I recall,\" Morris replied.\n\nStewart asked the officer how she was trained to use a riot stick.\n\n'I can make sure she is never forgotten.'\n\n\"Are you ever trained to hold it like a bat and strike it over somebody's head?\" Stewart asked.\n\n\"No,\" Morris answered.\n\nAfter she lost the walking stick, Morris turned her back on the crowd and was shortly pulled inside by other MPD officers, video showed. She was carried, kicking and flailing, into the Capitol basement hallway, saying, \"I can't breathe!\" bodycam video and Capitol CCTV recordings showed.\n\nMorris was approached by MPD Officer Anthony Walsh, who said, \"Take a minute to catch your breath. ... Were you pulled out into the crowd?\"\n\n\"I was in the front. They were pulling me, but they kept jabbing my face with something, hit me, and I couldn't ... I lost my breath and couldn't breathe,\" Morris said just prior to 4:34 p.m., according to Walsh's bodycam video.\n\nVideo showed that no one attempted to pull Morris into the crowd, but a man wearing orange ski goggles repeatedly attempted to smack her with what appeared to be a long wooden dowel. One of the thrusts struck Morris in the face shield, video showed.\n\nProtester Luke Coffee of Dallas holds up a crutch in what he says was an attempt to create a separation between police and the crowd outside the Lower West Terrace Tunnel at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. U.S. Capitol Police CCTV\n\nCoffee twice held up his hand in a \"stop\" gesture. Coffee picked up a 1.6-pound aluminum crutch and held it over his head. He said it was an effort to make himself as large as possible to be a barrier between police and the crowd.\n\nSecurity video showed Coffee held the crutch over his head for nine seconds before lowering it to waist level and pushing into the police line like a snowplow. He drove the entire line of officers back and stayed pressed against the front line for 20 seconds, according to prosecutors. After he slipped and fell, Coffee \"charged\" the line a second time, the DOJ argued.\n\nThe body cam of MPD Officer Steven Sajumon shows that once Coffee got back on his feet, he took what appeared to be two quick steps toward Sajumon with the crutch held in front. Coffee said he was blind from being doused with pepper spray. The officer put his right hand on Coffee's head, pushed him back, and said, \"We're good.\"\n\nCoffee said he then tried to switch the crutch into his left hand. Prosecutors claimed it was a \"swing\" at Sajumon that constituted assault. The officer's body cam shows his right hand on the tip of the crutch when he said, \"We're good, we're good.\" Judge Contreras found the interaction constituted felony assault by Coffee.\n\nCoffee told Blaze News that Officer Sajumon snapped him out of fight-or-flight mode when he patted him on the head and said, \"We're good.\" Coffee then stumbled away, collapsed, and fell unconscious to the ground.\n\nAaron James and Isaac Westbury help Luke Coffee of Dallas after Coffee fell inside the Lower West Terrace Tunnel at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. A short time later, Coffee collapsed and was dragged down the stairs. Metropolitan Police Department body cam\n\nBodycam video shows Coffee in a supine position being dragged down the steps from the tunnel at 4:29 p.m. Coffee said he was unconscious during this time, until bystanders helped to revive him.\n\nLindsey Graham, a social media influencer who is known as the Patriot Barbie, testified in Coffee's trial that when she encountered Coffee at the bottom of the steps, his eyes were swollen shut and he was in serious pain.\n\n\"He appeared to me somewhere within a few feet of me, with his face kind of red and swollen and his eyes closed, and he looked in need of help,\" Graham said, according to the court transcript. \"... What made me notice him was that he looked like he was in distress. He was sweating and crying, and his eyes were closed and his face was red and inflamed.\"\n\nGraham said she found bottled water that Coffee used to rinse his eyes, but that didn't bring relief. Blake McAlavy offered Coffee a bottle of thick green juice to use as a rinse, she said.\n\n\"Blake had some kind of green juice in his pocket that he had brought, and he gave Luke some green juice, hoping to help him as well.\"\n\nOfficer Morris testified that Coffee did not touch her with the aluminum crutch, but she felt squeezed in the crowd of officers and had trouble breathing.\n\nAt trial, defense attorney Stewart asked, \"So the crutch does not hit you?\"\n\n\"No, it doesn't hit me,\" Morris said.\n\n\"Okay,\" Stewart replied. \"I wanted to check here, because we're, we're charged with contact assault.\"\n\nAt the Dec. 13, 2024, verdict reading, Judge Contreras found Coffee guilty of seven counts, including felony assault on two police officers with the aluminum crutch he picked up off the ground. He found Coffee not guilty on one misdemeanor charge.\n\n'Let's put these lies to rest right now.'\n\nJudge Contreras ruled that the aluminum crutch qualified as a dangerous weapon and asserted that it was Coffee's intent to injure officers by pressing them back with the crutch.\n\nContreras said he did not believe Coffee acted out of concern for Boyland, and he claimed Coffee did not help Boyland get moved to safety after she was struck by Officer Morris.\n\n\"Other rioters moved Ms. Boyland out of the tunnel area seconds before Mr. Coffee charged the officers in the tunnel,\" Contreras said, \"thus highlighting that his attack on the officers in the tunnel was not reasonable or necessary with respect to defending Ms. Boyland, who, by that time, was out of the tunnel and off to the side, well out of harm's way.\"\n\nLuke Coffee holds up a crutch to create separation between police and protesters while bystanders pulled an unconscious Rosanne Boyland to safety outside the Lower West Terrace Tunnel at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Metropolitan Police Department body cam\n\nVideo shows, however, that bystanders who rescued Boyland after the beating by Morris pulled her to safety simultaneously to Coffee raising the crutch over his head.\n\nThe judge did not mention the beating that Morris doled out to the dying Boyland.\n\nJudge Contreras allowed prosecutor Deranek to put her arguments into the record as to why Coffee should be jailed.\n\nDeranek ripped Coffee and social media commentators for claiming Morris caused Boyland's death. Deranek contended that online discussion of Morris' actions made the officer a victim again, in addition to Coffee's alleged assault on her.\n\n\"Let's put these lies to rest right now,\" Deranek said, according to the trial transcript. \"Officer Morris had nothing to do with Roseanne [sic] Boyland's death. Roseanne Boyland was not killed by Officer Morris or any of the other officers defending the Capitol that day. She died of a tragic overdose.\"\n\nDeranek then blamed Coffee for the fact that police did not render aid to Boyland. Relying on a New York Times video analysis, Deranek said, \"It was in fact the defendant's actions that prevented the officers from rendering her aid as she lay dying.\"\n\nThe only contact any police officer had with Boyland before she was pulled into the Capitol was Morris and the wooden walking stick she used to strike the unconscious Boyland in the head, face, and ribs, video showed.\n\nLuke Coffee rinses out his eyes after being doused with pepper spray by police in the Lower West Terrace Tunnel at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Coffee said even though he wore sunglasses, his eyes and the skin around them sustained especially painful burns. Photos by Blake McAlavy (1986-2022)\n\nBodycam video, CCTV, and video from media and bystanders showed that no police officers moved to aid Boyland that afternoon, even when bystanders begged and pleaded and said Boyland was dying. Officers pushed more people from the tunnel on top of Boyland, who was crushed under the pileup, bodycam video showed.\n\nSheriff's deputy Ronald Colton McAbee repeatedly pointed at Boyland when he stepped in front of the police line just before Coffee arrived.\n\n\"Quit f**king trying to kill that girl!\" McAbee shouted at officers, according to MPD bodycam video. \"F**king stop!\"\n\nThe same argument used on Coffee was made against McAbee: that he prevented police from helping Boyland. Video from police body cameras, Capitol Police CCTV, and bystanders showed, however, that McAbee repeatedly tried to get officers to help Boyland, who lay a few feet from police.\n\nThe DOJ contention only added to the pain McAbee still experiences over Boyland's death.\n\n\"Her name will live on as long as there is breath in my lungs,\" McAbee wrote to Boyland's parents just after his trial. \"There will be justice for her. I couldn't bring her back, but I can make sure she is never forgotten.\"\n\nLike Blaze News? Bypass the censors, sign up for our newsletters, and get stories like this direct to your inbox.

      "text": "Police bodycam video: Florida cop fired after she shot man with his own gun during routine traffic stop\n\nThe wounded driver plans on suing.\n\nNewly released bodycam video shows the moment when a Jacksonville police officer shot a Florida man during a routine traffic stop. The cop was charged and reportedly terminated after the accidental shooting.\n\nOn Dec. 13, 2024, Jacksonville Sheriff's Office police officer S. Lowry conducted a routine traffic stop on a vehicle driven by Jason Arrington. The officer accused Arrington of driving through a red light, and Arrington disagreed.\n\n'Holy s**t!'\n\nBodycam video shows Arrington being compliant during the traffic stop and informing Officer Lowry that he was armed with a gun.\n\n\"So what we're gonna do is - just for my safety and your safety - I'm gonna have you step out of the vehicle,\" the officer instructs Arrington. \"And we're just gonna remove the pistol from you.\"\n\nThe officer continued, \"Then we're gonna run your license and make sure everything is good, and  then I'm gonna send you on your way.\"\n\nOfficer Lowry informs two other officers at the scene that the driver is \"very compliant\" and \"he does have a pistol on him.\"\n\nPolice bodycam video shows Arrington exiting the vehicle and then placing his hands on the roof of his truck.\n\nOfficer Mindy Cardwell is seen on police bodycam video attempting to extract the gun holstered in Arrington's waistband.\n\n\"She tugged on the gun the first time, then she tugged again,\" Arrington explained before adding, \"I don't know, she might have got nervous or whatever, and she pulled harder two more times, and that's when it discharged.\"\n\nSuddenly, a gunshot is heard in the video, and Arrington is seen slumping down in pain.\n\nLowry can be heard screaming, \"Holy s**t!\"\n\n'Gun owners in this state should be able to carry their firearms without the fear of an officer pulling them over on the side of the road, then voluntarily disclosing they're carrying a firearm, then being shot with their own weapon.'\n\nThe Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said in a statement , \"While Officer Cardwell was attempting to remove the firearm, it discharged, striking Mr. Arrington in the leg.\"\n\nThe bullet hit Arrington in the upper thigh and went through his right side.\n\nBodycam video shows Officer Caldwell's finger on the trigger of Arrington's handgun as she removes it from his waistband.\n\nWithin seconds, blood is seen flowing down Arrington's leg, and he needs assistance from an officer to walk. Officer A. Weippert applies a tourniquet to Arrington's leg, and Arrington is seen grimacing in pain. The officer then cuts the pants off Arrington's leg to locate the gunshot wound.\n\nFollowing the police shooting , Officer Lowry is heard whispering to himself: \"Goddamn.\"\n\nLowry also is heard telling dispatch that the police shooting was a \"negligent discharge.\"\n\nIn a late-December press conference , Arrington announced that he planned to sue over the officer-involved shooting.\n\n\"It messed with me as far as me working and stuff,\" Arrington said. \"Certain things in my job I can't do no more, perform, like getting up on equipment and stuff, you know, different things.\"\n\n\"I have to get on top of trains and unload stuff, forklift, crane, whatever I have to do at my job. It's kind of hard for me to do it. I can do it, but it's challenging, like real bad,\" Arrington stated.\n\nArrington's attorney - Kay Harper Williams - stated , \"Gun owners in this state should be able to carry their firearms without the fear of an officer pulling them over on the side of the road, then voluntarily disclosing they're carrying a firearm, then being shot with their own weapon.\"\n\nWilliams said she believes Officer Caldwell \"was not properly trained\" and \"certainly did not follow proper protocol.\"\n\nWeeks after the incident, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office released a memo spotlighting how police should conduct stops involving a citizen legally carrying a concealed firearm.\n\n\"The burden of proving an individual is not eligible to carry a concealed firearm falls on the investigating officer and is not an automatic presumption,\" the memo reads . \"Unless an officer has articulable suspicion that the detained person presents a threat to the safety of citizens or officers or has knowledge that the detained person is ineligible to carry a concealed firearm, officers should not seize a firearm (i.e. remove it from holster, vehicle, pocket, bag, etc.) from someone lawfully carrying it.\"\n\nInternal Affairs launched an investigation, and Cardwell was hit with a sustained charge of incompetence.\n\nCBS News on Wednesday reported that Caldwell had been fired.\n\nA week after the traffic stop, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office dismissed the traffic citation against Arrington.\n\nYou can watch police bodycam footage from all three of the officers involved in the shooting incident at the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office's official Facebook page , but it should be noted that the video is graphic.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Will Banning No-Knock Warrants Solve Violent Problem Between Police and the Public?\n\nShare This article\n\nAs violent crime surges nationwide, police departments are searching for solutions in order to mitigate violence in their communities.\n\nOne enforcement tactic is the use of no-knock warrants, which too often has led to unintended consequences and death. No-knocks are a result of the Nixon administration's war on drugs.\n\nNow, nearly 50-years later, they're often requested for use in high-risk situations involving suspects wanted for violent crimes.\n\nThe results, however, are questionable in terms of success and overshadowed by injury and death. As a warning, the video attached to this article might be disturbing.\n\nFresh on the mind of Americans is the death of 22-year-old Amir Locke on Feb. 2, 2022. Minneapolis police were granted a no-knock warrant, then quietly entered the apartment Locke was in. They announced themselves with guns drawn.\n\nBody camera footage shows that Locke was likely sleeping during the early morning raid, then reached for a gun before an officer shot and killed him.\n\n\"Those thugs that represent the Minneapolis Police Department executed my baby boy, beautiful baby boy in less than 9 seconds,\" said Locke's mother, Karen Wells.\n\nIn this case, however, the warrant was for Locke's 17-year-old cousin and two other homicide suspects. Locke had a license for the gun that was within his reach.\n\nNo charges have been filed in this case. The officer behind the gun is on leave as the investigation continues.\n\nA deep look into the history of no-knock warrants exposes massive growth and a deadly past.\n\nNumerous studies estimate the annual number grew from 1,500 in the early 1980s to more than 20,000 today. And in just a six-year period, between 2010 and 2016, a New York Times investigation found these raids led to the deaths of at least 81 civilians and 13 police officers.\n\n\"You can't control what a suspect does ... that's the problem,\" said Sergeant, Mike McGrew (Ret.).\n\nIn 31 years on the force, Sergeant McGrew investigated some of Santa Barbara's most violent crimes. The former hostage negotiator and major crimes detective believes in the use of no-knock warrants.\n\n\"This (cases like Amir Locke's) is not the norm,\" McGrew said. \"If you see something that's wrong, you have to remember the tens of thousands of things that went right through America every single day.\"\n\nStill, Locke's death combined with the high-profile case of Breonna Taylor, shot and killed by Louisville police in her own home, has ignited the effort to ban them.\n\n\"You are going to pass the law banning the no-knock warrants, starting here in the Twin Cities, where my son was born and raised,\" demanded Locke's mother.\n\nFour states have banned no-knock warrants: Florida, Oregon, Tennessee, and Virginia, while 34 states have some restriction or limitation.\n\n\"Unfortunately, over a period of time, they resulted in a higher number of injuries and deaths to law enforcement and occasionally also to suspects,\" said Commander Thor Ells (Ret.), the executive director for the National Tactical Officers Association.\n\nResponsible for training Swat teams nationwide, Ells no longer teaches no-knock protocols because he feels the danger outweighs the benefit. He says there are alternatives.\n\n\"There's the 'contain and call out' - simply surround the place,\" said Ells. \"There's phone calls or announcement through speakers. There are probably four or five - without giving up the whole playbook - alternatives that are available to law enforcement and effective in the search.\"\n\nStill, he says nothing currently puts an end to the controversial policy.\n\n\"The U.S. has a fragmented approach to law enforcement,\" Ells said. \"There are between 18 and 21,000 law enforcement agencies in the United States and there is no one standard.\"\n\nEven though a number of local and state governments have adopted safer alternatives, there is an effort to backtrack somewhat. A Republican-sponsored measure in Virginia's House of Delegates would repeal no-knock bans and work to fix a chaotic situation by implementing a fixed amount of time police should wait before entering.\n\nWhile declining an interview, the sponsor told CBN News it's unlikely to pass.\n\n\"You should be outraged. You should be outraged!\" protestors screamed in Minneapolis streets after Locke's death.\n\nCommander Ells argues it's time to implement safer tools for police to use in their investigations. The challenge, however, is the cost of trying to force a single playbook on the sheer number of agencies nationwide.\n\n\"Is there room for law enforcement to improve? In many respects, the answer is of course, yes,\" Ells said. \"If you start to set national standards, many of these agencies don't have the personnel and or the budget to meet that. So the challenge with setting a national standard ... it will be expensive.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\nShare This article\n\nBrody Carter has been reporting and anchoring at CBN since 2021.

      "text": "KY Church Partners with Police to Help Bridge Gap with Communities During Troubling Times\n\nShare This article\n\nThe murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer led to mass protests against racial injustice and police brutality, and even some calls to defund the police.\n\nIn this climate, how can law enforcement officers make inroads in their communities? CBN News discovered the Church may be one answer.\n\nGeorge Floyd's murder led to a push across the country to overhaul police departments. Cincinnati, Ohio, has not been immune to the protests.\n\n\"Have there been outcries and frustrations; there have been calls to defund the police; there have been calls to reimagine the police here in Cincinnati, just like there have been in other areas,\" Capt. Steve Saunders of the Cincinnati Police Department told CBN News.\n\nThe city is also on track for an especially violent year, with one report showing nearly 200 shootings, 29 deadly, in the first six months of 2021. Still, Saunders is pushing forward.\n\nPolice-Church Partnership\n\n\"It's troubling to see those higher crime rates; we're seeing that on a national level, not just in Cincinnati, certainly in larger cities, but we're not giving up because crime goes up,\" he said. \"We find a way to work together, to partner, to build collaborations and partnership to address those problems.\"\n\nOne partnership involves Seven Hills Church , a large congregation in the greater Cincinnati area. Pastor Marcus Mecum says as a part of an area pastoral group, Seven Hills was assigned to reach out to police.\n\n\"The police department in Cincinnati and Hamilton County, specifically, and then some other ones local here, have made it really easy to help connect us to real needs in the community, and sometimes also, within their departments,\" he shared with CBN News.\n\n\"And so, these are human beings; they have souls; they have families; they have futures; they have dreams, and we just do our best as a church to be there,\" he continued.\n\nTimes of Generosity\n\nIts support during the pandemic led the Cincinnati Police Department to name the church its 2020 \"Community Partner of the Year.\"\n\n\"During COVID, you had a lot of the different race riots, and we were down there as a church supporting the police by just feeding them, giving them water, some of them were on call for sometimes up to 20 hours,\" Mecum said.\n\nSaunders recalls other times of generosity.\n\n\"And they said they just wanted to share their support and love and encouragement for us,\" he explained. \"So that's, that's great. So it started off with a simple thing; they brought small gift bags for all of our officers and all of our civilians.\"\n\n\"We have about 1,200 employees,\" he added.\n\nA specific memorable moment came when members prayed over Police Chief Eliot Isaac.\n\n\"And to have people in the community praying for you and lifting you up and lifting your family up, it's created a hedge of protection over Chief Isaac,\" Saunders shared.\n\n\"And I know he's felt that inspiration and the power of the prayer and is extremely grateful, extremely grateful for them and what they've done for us,\" he continued.\n\nCommunity Connections\n\nThe church also helps promote connections with communities. For example, the church and the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office brought in retired Harlem Globetrotters to suburban Lincoln Heights as part of a basketball clinic for kids there.\n\nOrganizers describe the event as more than an entertaining game of basketball. They say it's an important tool to help develop a healthy relationship between law enforcement and the community.\n\n\"We have a basketball court, and it's filled with kids, and it's filled with adults, and some of those adults wear uniforms,\" Hamilton County Sheriff Charmaine McGuffey told CBN News. \"And some of those adults work in a church, and some of the adults are there to help people with whatever they need.\"\n\n\"And when the kids see that, when parents see that, they're so much more likely to say positive things at the dinner table, positive things to their community about what the black and gold means to this community and all through Hamilton County,\" she continued.\n\n\"But God worked it out where it's here, and for our young people here,\" Pastor Mike Pearl, the director of St. Monica's Recreation Center , shared with CBN News, as he was overcome with emotion. \"I'm just blessed, man, to be able to share it with our community 'cause sometimes our kids feel neglected, overlooked.\"\n\n\"Like I said, they have their challenges, but they're kids who love life, who need stuff like this, that positivity, especially from adults,\" he continued.\n\nBuilding Trust\n\nSeven Hills Church isn't the only organization working to help law enforcement in the Greater Cincinnati area build better community relations. A non-profit known as the Cincinnati Blue Line Foundation has also stepped up to help strengthen the bond between police and those they serve.\n\n\"That trust relationship - if you can build the trust in the community, your authority as a police officer is not only understood, it's just, you're valued,\" Saunders said. \"You're not there to take people out of the community; you're there to provide value to the community, to provide safety, to provide resources.\"\n\nSeven Hills Church has donated to the Cincinnati Blue Line Foundation, and Saunders hopes that will encourage other churches to do the same thing.\n\n\"When you hear that the work that you're doing is making a difference in your community, of course, that's so encouraging,\" Kyle Waid, an associate pastor of Seven Hills Church, told CBN News.\n\n\"But would we do it without the recognition?\" he asked. \"We would because this is ultimately what we feel like Jesus would do. He didn't come to be served but to serve.\"\n\nShare This article\n\nMark Martin currently serves as a reporter and anchor at CBN News, reporting on all kinds of issues, from military matters to alternative fuels.

      "text": "What Is Faith?\n\nPat Robertson\n\nShare This article\n\nIn the book of Hebrews, the Bible defines faith as \"the assurance (the confirmation, the title deed) of the things (we) hope for, being the proof of things (we) do not see and the conviction of their reality\" ( Hebrews 11:1 Close Hebrews 11:1 Faith is the confidence that what we hope for will actually happen; it gives us assurance about things we cannot see. OPEN VERSE IN BIBLE (nlt) , Amplified). We are hoping to reach heaven, a world we cannot see, and faith gives substance to our expectations.\n\nFaith can be a title deed to things we cannot see. For example, suppose there is a lot in a Florida resort, which you have never seen. A salesman comes to you and says, \"I have a lot in this plat, and if you will give me $10,000, I will give you a deed to it.\" So you give him the money, and he gives you the deed. The moment the deed transfers, you own the property. You might not see it for many years, but you know it is yours, because the title deed has conferred all ownership privileges upon you. From that moment on, you can begin to enjoy it.\n\nThat is faith. It is the title deed to things we cannot see. Faith is an attribute given by the Spirit of God that enables us to reach into God's invisible world and take possession of that which we cannot see.\n\nFaith is one of the fruits of the Spirit, and this means that it grows naturally for those who belong to God (see Galatians 5:22 Close Galatians 5:22 But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, OPEN VERSE IN BIBLE (nlt) ). The Bible says the testing of faith produces patience, which means we can develop a stronger faith by working on it (see James 1:3 Close James 1:3 For you know that when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow. OPEN VERSE IN BIBLE (nlt) ). If we exercise faith, just as we would exercise a muscle, it will grow. The more we walk in faith and appropriate things by faith, the more our faith grows. We get to a point where we say, \"If God can do what I have experienced, then surely He can do something more.\" Our faith will grow as we use it, whether it is faith for healing or for family unity or for finances or even for the conduct of national affairs.\n\nThere is also what is called a manifestation, or a gift of faith (see 1 Corinthians 12:7-9). This is a supernatural enablement of faith that God gives when it is especially needed.\n\nThis supernatural faith is the kind of faith that can move mountains, provide divine protection from danger, or provide for an unusual financial need. Faith can be something that is continuously growing through use, or it can be something that comes instantaneously as a gift from God.\n\nExcerpt taken from Answers to 200 of Life's Most Probing Questions, Copyright 1984 by Pat Robertson.\n\nShare This article\n\nDr. Robertson served as the founder and chairman of The Christian Broadcasting Network, Inc.

Protests against racial injustice and police brutality have become a daily occurrence since Floyd, 46, died while in police custody on May 25.\n\nAll four policemen at the scene of Floyd's death have been charged and arrested.\n\nTou Thao, Thomas Lane, and J. Alexander Kueng all face aiding and abetting charges and could spend up to 40 years in prison. Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, also had his charges upgraded to second and third-degree murder and manslaughter. Arbery, an unarmed black man, was killed by Gregory McMichael and his son, Travis on February 23. Video shows how the Georgia father and son chased down and shot Arbery as he ran through their neighborhood. Now they're charged with murder. Taylor was shot and killed inside her Louisville, KY apartment on March 13 when police raided her home to serve a warrant. The 26-year-old black woman was working as an EMT with the hopes of becoming a nurse.

      "text": "Budgeting a Contingency Fund\n\nMore Crown Financial articles\n\nBusiness\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nFinance\n\nCBNMoney.com - The Scriptures encourage us to plan for the unexpected and equate planning   with being wise. \"Go to the ant, O sluggard, observe her ways and be wise,   which, having no chief, officer or ruler, prepares her food in the summer and   gathers her provision in the harvest\" (Proverbs 6:6-8). Families are   best served if they make getting out of debt their first priority. Their   second priority (priorities one and two can be worked on simultaneously) should   be to establish contingency funds. Even if families have not reached   their goal of becoming debt free, it's still a good idea to begin setting aside   some money into a contingency fund. This type of fund is not long-range   savings for college or retirement; it is non-allocated short-term savings. Without contingency funds, if there were emergencies, families would   have to rely on credit and, ultimately, end up deeper in debt. Simply   put, without contingency funds, borrowing would be a foregone conclusion, the   use of credit would become a lifelong necessity, and debt would become a way of   life. Only after these two primary objectives are reached should families   think about investing in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. The need for   contingency funds There are two reasons why families need contingency   funds: for emergencies and for major expenditures . Emergencies. A contingency fund is first an emergency fund for   dealing with the unexpected. By having this money set aside and readily   available, emergencies can be paid for without having to   borrow. Unexpected expenses are not only bitter disappointments but they   can cause a painful realization if people do not have funds set aside to cover   the expenses. Even if some surplus has been set aside, there is little escape   from personal or family difficulties that result from financial emergencies. When there are crises or unexpected emergencies, much frustration can be   avoided if a contingency fund has been established to help absorb the distress   of the crisis. Major expenditures. A contingency fund also can be   used to finance major expenditures that are not in the family operating budget:   replacing an old car, buying furniture, replacing appliances, or remodeling. Whether contingency funds are used for emergencies or for major   expenditures, a good rule to follow is that whenever funds are withdrawn from   contingency accounts every effort should be made to rebuild the fund as quickly   as possible. How much should be allocated? Families should   allocate a percentage of their income to contingency funds. Although 10 percent   is preferred, a minimum of 5 percent of Net Spendable Income should be placed in   contingency funds. Even though some financial planners recommend keeping   a specific amount (like $10,000 for example) in contingency funds, most planners   recommend maintaining a minimum of three to six months' living expenses for   families who have steady incomes; for those who have fluctuating or seasonal   incomes, six months' living expenses is best. This does not mean that   large amounts of money should be saved while failing to pay creditors, but a   good habit to develop is to save a small amount on a regular   basis. How to save Families should make specific guidelines on   how they intend to fund contingency accounts. Then they must stick to those   guidelines and not allow compromise or a lackadaisical attitude regarding   funding the account. God commands every believer, \"Do not be conformed to   this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind\" (Romans   12:2). When it comes to saving, despite best intentions, it's easy to   rationalize putting it off until the next paycheck. Therefore, it often   helps to have money set aside automatically before families have an opportunity   to spend it. There are two paths that are the most common to automated savings.\n\nConclusion \"There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling   of the wise, but a foolish man swallows it up\" (Proverbs 21:20). The common   attitude presented in the Bible is to save on a regular basis, and it is   important that Christians develop good habits to replace bad habits. The   discipline it takes to do that can be very difficult, but laying this foundation   is vitally important; and, if it can be managed, contingency funds can give   families the freedom to start again when they find themselves facing unexpected   expenses. So, be diligent and be prayerful.\n\nA caring friend will be there to pray with you in your time of need."

      "text": "New Science of Epigenetics Proves DNA is Not Destiny\n\nShare This article\n\nDURHAM, NC - A new study suggests that it may possible to reverse the aging process.\n\nNine healthy volunteers took a cocktail of three common drugs for a year, and Nature magazine reports they lost an average of two and a half years on what's called their \"epigenetic clock\" which measures biological age.\n\nResearchers caution that the results are preliminary and not solid since it was a small study. But the science of epigenetics reveals that even though many of our health characteristics are in our genes, our actions can turn bad genes off and good ones on. So what does the term \"epigenetics\" mean?\n\nMedical science often proves the wisdom of the Bible, such as the benefits of fasting and forgiveness. Scripture also talks about God \"visiting the iniquity of the father on the children, on the third and fourth generations.\" Recent scientific studies are proving that true, as well, in the field of epigenetics.\n\nThanks to DNA home test kits, you can learn about your genes and various health issues by just filling a tube with saliva and sending it to the lab. While those results may reveal a lot, they don't always tell the whole story. We are equipped with a mechanism called the epigenome that tells our genes what to do.\n\nEpigenetics: Light Switch for Our Genes\n\nEpigenetic expert Dr. Michael Roizen , Cleveland Clinic's Chief Wellness Officer and author of Age Proof , told CBN News epigenetics is like a light switch. Our behavior can silence our genes or activate them.\n\n\"And which of your genes are on or not are, to a large degree, your choices, by things you do,\" he said, \"So is epigenetics important? Absolutely.\"\n\nOur DNA is made up of genes. Our behavior, such as what we eat, smoke, even think, dispatches marker to the top of our DNA which tell our genes to turn on or off.\n\n\"So if you're stressed and not managing it, you're going to turn certain genes on that cause inflammation,\" Dr. Roizen explained.\n\nPregnant mothers can dramatically influence their baby's genes, such as those that tell the body to hang onto fat.\n\nDr. Roizen gave this example. \"If you don't get enough food during pregnancy, your body, the baby's body, says 'Hey I'm going to come out to an environment that's sparse in food, so I'm going to turn on the genes that allow me to save food and allow me to be, if you will, very efficient.' That means that when you eat food after you're born, you're going to gain a lot more weight.\"\n\nThe Agouti Mouse Study\n\nThe reverse is also true. Even if a female in unhealthy before pregnancy, she can turn things around for her offspring if she adopts a healthier lifestyle while she's pregnant, as was proven in a pivotal study. The new field of epigenetics began at Duke University in 2003. Dr. Randy Jirtle proved DNA is not destiny with his landmark Agouti mouse study.\n\nThe mice carried the Agouti gene, which caused obesity, disease, and jaundice. But when Dr. Jirtle fed pregnant females lots of vitamins, her offspring ended up thin, health and brown, despite still carrying the gene.\n\n\"I feel like we made a contribution to science that will be there literally forever,\" Dr. Jirtle told CBN News . Dr. Jirtle compares epigenetics to programming a computer.\n\n\"The deterministic part in our system is the DNA. That's the stable part,\" Dr. Jirtle explained, \"The free will part comes in through the software that tells that deterministic how to work. We are in effect a programmable computer. That's how we were made.\"\n\nDr. Jirtle says the behavior of both parents can alter their child's gene expression and sometimes these changes stick.\n\nGenerational Curses\n\n\"You can see that, in effect, what God I think was telling us, is that, 'This is the way you're made, and if you mess with this system you're not going to alter the genome so much, but you're going to alter your programs,\" Dr. Jirtle said, \"And those, since they're not totally erased necessarily, as they go from generation to generation, as they go through the egg and the sperm, can literally give rise to problems in the next generation, and the following, and the following, out to four and five generations.\"\n\nAs epigenetics research proceeds, scientists hope to pinpoint how specific areas of the genome are affected. They also are trying to develop drugs that can manipulate the epigenome safely. Still, one thing is certain: lifestyle choices can bring out the best or worst in our DNA, changes that can be passed on to our children, grandchildren and beyond.\n\nShare This article\n\nAs CBN's Senior Medical Reporter, Lorie Johnson reports on the latest information about medicine and wellness.

And our exclusive photos of Hall outside reveal she is still wearing at least one ring on her wedding finger despite all the trauma to her marriage.\n\nCutting an unlikely temptress figure, she took her dog out for a pee break in the scrubs after returning home from work.\n\nOn a different day with a similar mission, she was wearing a Friends-themed t-shirt and black shorts, with an array of tattoos visible on both arms and legs.\n\nIt's unclear if Hall, whose records show she was originally licensed as a pharmacy technician in October 2018 before switching to her doomed cop career, is working full-time.\n\nBut she's probably taken a considerable pay cut from her previous role. Pharmacy technicians in Tennessee earn a reported average of $38,000 a year, compared to her old police department's current starting salary of $51,000 with an average of $59,000.\n\nPerhaps with that in mind, Hall certainly doesn't appear to be splashing out following her successful legal action against the City of La Vergne - they settled the lawsuit but denied any admission of liability.\n\nShe goes back and forth in an older model Nissan Rogue while a steel gray Toyota Tacoma pickup truck sits on the driveway.\n\nHall's husband allegedly wasn't on board with the open relationship despite her saying she was. Hall was still wearing her wedding ring when spotted by DailyMail.com\n\nHall was spotted wearing baggier blue scrubs, complete with a distinctive Tennessee College of Applied Technology patch on her left sleeve\n\nOn a different day, she was wearing a Friends-themed t-shirt and black shorts, with an array of tattoos visible on both her arms and legs\n\nHall was walking her dog. She also wore black shorts and white crocs\n\nHall travels in an older model of a Nissan Rogue while a steel gray Toyota Tacoma pickup truck also sits on the driveway\n\nJedidiah, a local Coffee County Sheriff's Deputy when the sensational story broke in January 2023, vowed to stand by her side when the scandal broke\n\nHer down-to-earth routine appears a far cry from the whirlwind of sexual shenanigans that catapulted La Vergne PD to nationwide infamy, with raucous amusement and the fallout that is still being felt to this day.\n\nThese alleged escapades included Hall giving oral sex while on duty, proposing threesomes with another officer and his wife, having affairs and whipping off her bikini top at a 'girls gone wild' hot tub party.\n\nShe'd told her cop clique that she was in an open marriage and also tried to recruit strait-laced former state park ranger Jedidiah into swinging sessions.\n\nBut her pastor's son husband 'wasn't really on board'. Instead, he accused his wife of cheating, according to an internal investigation after a whistleblower complaint by Sergeant Ty McGowan first exposed the astonishing goings on.\n\nThe probe led to Patrol Officer Juan Lugo, Sgt. Lewis Powell, Detective Seneca Shields and McGowan himself losing their jobs after being accused of having sex with Hall, who was booted at the same time.\n\nThree cops who traded naked pictures with Hall - Patrol Officers Patrick Magliocco and Gavin Schoeberl and K-9 officer Larry Holladay - were suspended. McGowan later went on local TV to deny he had sex with the female rookie, despite her insistence he did.\n\nHall was sworn in by then-Police Chief Burrel 'Chip' Davis in August 2021.\n\nBut just 15 months later he would also be fired for failing to discipline the officers at the time when he knew what was going on - and even pestered one of his sergeants to send him a video of Hall masturbating.\n\nLewis Powell was also fired after denying he was sexually involved with Powell. Investigators were told Hall performed oral sex on him while on duty. He later confessed to the allegations\n\nK-9 officer Larry Holladay was suspended for having an off-duty sexual relationship with Hall. The two met at hotels or his home.

He confessed to having sex with Hall and sending explicit images and was fired. Patrol Officer Gavin Schoeberl (right) swapped naked pictures with Hall but escaped suspension\n\nNow, DailyMail.com can reveal incredible new details about the 49-year-old's further downfall from chief in another knock-on from the scandal.\n\nThe former top cop is currently languishing in jail after being arrested on January 29, accused of the aggravated kidnapping and aggravated assault of his estranged wife Kelly amid their bitter divorce.\n\nThis comes after he was taken into custody for a separate incident in December when he was accused of stalking, but was released.\n\nAnd now, he has been hit by a slew of serious new felony charges following an incident at his former marital home in Murfreesboro, 20 miles from La Vergne.\n\nDavis was 'decertified' as a law enforcement officer in December, nd is on a $145,000 bond.\n\nA police report obtained by DailyMail.com revealed the former chief turned up at the home he once shared with cardiologist Kelly, 41, and their three daughters.\n\nHe is alleged to have violently attacked Kelly, grabbed a gun and refused to let her or their children call 911 during an hours-long stand-off.\n\nThis follows his physician wife starting divorce proceedings nearly three months ago, citing irreconcilable differences and accusing him of 'inappropriate marital conduct'.\n\nHall was sworn in by then-Police Chief Burrel 'Chip' Davis in August 2021. But was also fired for failing to discipline the officers at the time when he knew what was going on -  even pestering one of his sergeants to send him a video of Hall masturbating\n\nDavis was arrested on January 29  (left mugshot) for kidnapping charges after holding his estranged wife Kelly and children hostage. This was a month after he was arrested (right mugshot) at an apartment complex for stalking but was later released\n\nDavis' cardiologist wife Kelly, 41, asked for a divorce three months ago, citing irreconcilable differences and accusing him of 'inappropriate marital conduct'\n\nIn the filing, she requested full custody of their children and child support\n\nThe alleged drama began when Davis said to Kelly he was coming over to confront her 'current boyfriend' about their relationship. But Kelly told him he wasn't going anywhere with him.\n\nAnd when Davis arrived at her residence, things quickly went south.\n\n'Mrs Davis stated that when Burrel Davis arrived at the residence he immediately took Mrs Davis's phone, along with their daughters' phones... not allowing them to call 911,' said the Murfreesboro PD affidavit.\n\n'Burrel Davis went into Mrs Davis's bedroom and ripped her out of the chair by her pajamas, making her fall to the floor.\n\n'He then placed her in a chokehold and picked her up off the floor (with the chokehold). At this point (redacted) came into the bedroom to try and stop Mr Davis. Mr Davis then pushed (redacted) out of the way and kicked Mrs Davis on her side.\n\n'(Redacted) stated that after her mom was physically assaulted, Mrs Davis requested (redacted) to go call the police. (Redacted) ran to her room to get her phone, but her father Burrel Davis followed her into her bedroom and took her phone.'\n\nThe report continued: 'Mrs Davis stated that there was a firearm in the top dresser, and she went to grab it but Mr Davis got there first. He stated: \"Thank you for showing me where it was, if you call the police I'm going to make you watch me kill myself.\"\n\n'He kept telling Mrs Davis she was going to go with him or answer his questions while having the gun held to his head or in his mouth.\n\nDavis came over to confront his soon-to-be ex-wife's new boyfriend but instead placed her in a choke hold, put a gun to his head, threatened to kill himself and then wouldn't let her or their children leave the house for several hours\n\nDavis is on $145,000 bond and due to make his first court appearance on March 5 at Rutherford County Court\n\nHall grew up in rural Tennessee dreaming of becoming an actress but eventually chose law enforcement - a career that barely lasted two years\n\n'When Mrs Davis would try to answer his questions, he would tell her to 'shut the f*** up'. He made Mrs Davis and the three children sit down.'\n\nIt concluded: 'For the next several hours Mr Davis would not allow Mrs Davis or her three children to leave all while displaying the firearm. According to (redacted), Mrs Davis tried to get one of them to run to the neighbors to call 911 but he refused to let them.'\n\nThe report did not detail how the drama ended.\n\nDavis is not the only officer who is alleged to have attempted suicide since being embroiled in his department's wild antics.\n\nHall said in her successful claim against the city that she stopped 15-year veteran Sgt Powell when he threatened to kill himself after she tried to end having sex with him.\n\nHer lawsuit, which claimed she was 'sexually groomed' by her 'predator' superiors, said: 'Powell was crying and told Ms. Hall he drank an entire bottle of Jack Daniel's whiskey.\n\n'He threatened to kill himself, told Ms. Hall \"You did this to me\", and asserted that Ms. Hall was responsible for his imminent suicide.'\n\nHer claim also said: 'Sgt. Powell positioned himself as a reliable source of companionship and advice regarding Ms. Hall's career and her marriage.\n\nHall said in her successful claim against the city that she stopped 15-year veteran Sgt Powell when he threatened to kill himself after she tried to end their affair\n\n'Sgt. Powell persisted in requests for sex despite Ms. Hall's resistance. Eventually, Ms. Hall gave in to Sgt. Powell's requests for sexual favors.'\n\nHall also said she had tried 'to kill herself' in the aftermath of the affairs.\n\nIn the city's investigation, Hall admitted: 'I got stupid, I got desperate, I guess, and guys are guys and they'll stick their d**k in anything.'\n\nWhile discussing her affair with Powell, she said at one point they had carried out sex acts on police property, she said: 'I just gave him a b***job in the substation.\n\n'Me and my husband were kind of on the verge of a divorce and I just cracked and then it just kind of got out of hand.'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

Deneiderhavsein was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company and larceny.\n\nThe third man is yet to be found and has not been charged over the brawl.\n\nThe police prosecutor told the court Weaver should not be refused bail to live with his mother on the Northern Beaches because of the ferocity of the attack.\n\n'The force of stomp on [the officer's] head so significant that, on the footage itself, it produces and audible impact heard from a mobile phone on a balcony some distance away,' Edwards said.\n\nHis defence lawyer pointed to an absence of any criminal history but Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson agreed with the prosecution and said she was left with little choice but to deny bail, causing both Weaver and his mother to break down in tears.\n\nTwo men (pictured) have been arrested after an alleged vicious assault of two off-duty police officers in Sydney's inner west\n\nShocked witnesses are seen speaking to police at the crime scene in Newtown\n\nNSW Premier Chris Minns said 'all of NSW will be thinking of these brave men and their families' in a statement this week.\n\n'I'm devastated to hear that two off-duty police officers were seriously assaulted last night in the Inner West,' he said.\n\n'These two men saw an incident, went to assist those involved, and were brutally attacked, this is sickening.\n\n'Every day our police force put their lives on the line to keep us safe - even when they're not in uniform.'\n\nWeaver was denied bail and will front court on March 20.\n\nDeneiderhavsein did not apply for bail and will reappear on January 30.\n\nSorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

She admits touching and messaging PC A but claims it was 'not unwelcome' flirting and denies sexually touching PC B.\n\nA Hampshire Constabulary misconduct hearing in Eastleigh was told the three officers were in the boozer for a work social event.\n\nAlan Jenkins, representing the force, said the female officer's actions were 'plainly inappropriate' and 'sexually provocative'.\n\nHe said: 'The allegations against PC Johnson-Warne concern her sexual attentions towards two male colleagues, PC A and PC B, at a time when she was heavily intoxicated...\n\n'The first officer, PC A, was also sent messages via mobile phone which asked if he wanted to have sex with her, and at least one photograph of her in her underwear.\n\n'PC A was also treated inappropriately whilst he was passenger on the rear seat of a car with PC Johnson-Warne towards the end of the evening. She tried to pull his hand between her legs and under her clothing.\n\n'The second officer, PC B, was also touched in a sexually provocative manner over clothing whilst the group was in the Wetherspoons pub.\n\nPC Johnson-Warne is facing gross misconduct charges for the inappropriate touches. She admits touching and messaging PC A but claims it was 'not unwelcome' flirting and denies sexually touching PC B\n\n'For an officer sexually to touch colleagues in such a manner that they feel uncomfortable is plainly inappropriate.\n\n'The issue of gender is properly immaterial... whether a male officer touched female colleagues without their consent or a female officer touched male colleagues does not matter for these purposes.\n\n'Alcohol consumption, particularly if excessive, does not provide any excuse or justification for any touching that is unwelcome or unwanted in the circumstances.'\n\nPC A and PC B both told the panel they were unhappy with the advances from PC Johnson-Warne.\n\nPC A said: 'It was incredibly awkward, I have not had to deal with that behaviour before.\n\n'I did not know how to process or deal with it.\n\n'It was not anything I invited or wanted, I wanted that situation to stop.'\n\nPC B said: 'I did feel that I was a victim of something sexually inappropriate.\n\n'I'm not as sociable nowadays.\n\n'I have tried to ignore what happened and move on.'\n\nPC Johnson-Warne faces further allegations of gross misconduct for striking PC Brookes, after their relationship ended, and breaching bail conditions following that incident.\n\nShe denies hitting the fellow police officer but accepts a charge of misconduct for breaching her bail.\n\nThe misconduct hearing continues.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Daniels - reported by NFL network - revealed that the officer has been put on administrative duties during 'a thorough review of the matter'.\n\n'I'm committed to transparency and accountability to the community with any situation involving my officers,' the statement added. The officer in question has not been identified.\n\nHill, who still lined up for the Dolphins in their season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars , was reportedly ordered to pull over around one block away from Hard Rock after being cited for 'reckless driving' while making his way to the Stadium Sunday morning.\n\nMiami Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill was handcuffed and detained by police while entering the team's Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday morning. It is unclear if the officer in question is pictured in this photo\n\nAn officer has now been placed on administrative leave amid an investigation\n\nVideo of Tyreek Hill's arrest today: pic.twitter.com/Kope2Ma6tk\n\nThe NFL star was pinned to the ground and handcuffed, even appearing to have been struck by an unprovoked officer in shocking footage of the incident.\n\nHill was then seen being detained on the ground and led away in cuffs following a reported alleged altercation with an officer, before cops released him shortly after. Several of his Miami teammates are said to have pulled over to help deescalate the situation.\n\nAfter the astonishing ordeal, Hill continued to the stadium where he started for the Dolphins, even scoring a touchdown during the 20-17 Week 1 victory, which he celebrated by performing a handcuffed gesture.\n\nNews of Hill's detainment has sparked outrage online, with ESPN host Stephen A. Smith hitting out at the 'unnecessary' incident on Sunday morning and drawing comparisons with golf star Scottie Scheffler's infamous arrest in Kentucky earlier this year.\n\nSmith wrote on X alongside a video of Hill being placed in cuffs on the ground: 'Look for yourself. This is b.s. Totally unnecessary.\n\n'And btw...., I know the Scottie Scheffler incident was in Georgia - not Florida - and he was arrested, detained, booked. I also know we don't know all the details, blah....blah.....blah! But he wasn't faced down on the ground in cuffs? Then forcibly sat down again by officers a second time. Nah! This story isn't going away - and it doesn't need to.'\n\nThe Dolphins confirmed their player was safe and with his teammates at the stadium in a statement later on Sunday morning ahead of the game kicking off.\n\nThe team's statement read: 'This morning, WR Tyreek Hill was pulled over for a traffic incident about one block from the stadium and briefly detained by police. He has since been released.\n\nHill, who lined up for the Dolphins in their season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars , was seen being cuffed by police in videos circulating on social media\n\nThe wide receiver scored an 80-yard touchdown hours after being pinned by police in Miami\n\nThe 30-year-old mimicked him being detained as a celebration after scoring a long touchdown\n\n'Several teammates saw the incident and stopped to offer support.\n\n'Tyreek and all other players involved have safely arrived to the stadium and will be available for today's game.'\n\nDespite his client being released, Hill's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, has described the incident as a 'heartbreaking situation' which was 'completely unnecessary' and suggested they will take action.\n\nRosenhaus also branded his client's brief detainment as 'mindboggling'.\n\n'I'm very distraught about it,' he told Darlington on ESPN's Sunday NFL Countdown. 'We're going to have to look into it.'\n\nOn what Hill told him after the incident, Rosenhaus revealed: 'He said he was driving into the stadium, the police stopped him, took him out of the car and basically at that point got rough with him.'\n\nThe Dolphins receiver pictured with wife Keeta, whom he married in November of last year\n\n'It's a legal situation so I've got to be careful not to get into too many details,' he continued. 'But he was entering the stadium when all of this happened. All the extra stuff that happened just seems, from my perspective, completely unnecessary.\n\n'I'm very distraught about it, I was greatly worried about Tyreek. But thank god when I got there the situation was calming down.'\n\nHill is entering his third season with the Dolphins after joining from the Kansas City Chiefs back in 2022.\n\nThe five-time First-team All-Pro helped Kansas City win the Super Bowl in 2020 but is yet to enjoy the same success over in Miami.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

I believed in the value and integrity and accountability that the badge represented. But in April 2020, my belief was shattered.\n\n'I'm speaking out today, not just for myself, but for everybody who has been failed by the system. The San Diego Police Department's culture of retaliation and cover-ups must end,' she said in a press conference.\n\nIn a lengthy lawsuit, the former officer claims that her husband assaulted her and endangered their then-2-year-old autistic son while intoxicated at their home in Escondido, California on April 9, 2020.\n\nAllyson explained she was reportedly physically blocked, shoved into a wall and had her face pinned to a wall which resulted in a bruise under her left eye.\n\nDuring the incident, Mitchell allegedly also threatened to shoot her and 'repeatedly called her \"bitch\", \"cunt\", \"slut\", \"skank\" and \"whore\" while in the presence of their son'.\n\nAllyson Ford, who joined the San Diego Police Department at the age of 16 as a Volunteer Cadet and went on to be named Officer of the Year in 2014, sued the precinct over allegations of retaliation, wrongful termination and discrimination\n\nAccording to court documents, 'Sgt. Ford falsely accused Allyson of having an affair with another SDPD employee, referred to as \"Detective Doe.\"\n\n'Sgt. Ford even threatened to \"swat\" Detective Doe, which is the criminal practice of making a false call to the police in an attempt to bring about the dispatch of a large number of armed police officers to a particular address.\n\n'In other words, Sgt. Ford was threatening to abuse his police power to cause the cold-blooded execution of a fellow officer.\n\n'Sgt. Ford threatened to cause SDPD to terminate Allyson's and Detective Doe's employment, bragging he \"had friends in high places in the department\" and Allyson was \"stupid\" if she tried to resist.\n\nThe terrified detective ended up calling cops to her house and responding lieutenants from SDPD spoke to Escondido Police.\n\nShe ended up reporting felony domestic violence, DUI, harassment, threats and blackmail against Mitchell but to no avail.\n\nFurthermore, Allyson claims that her husband was never arrested or forced to surrender his weapons despite a judge-granted restraining order against him.\n\nAfter her report was lodged, the star detective revealed that department leaders began retaliating by denying her requests for leave and placing her under internal investigation multiple times.\n\nShe claims that the department systematically covered up complaints of violence by her then-husband, Sergeant Mitchell Ford and did not take appropriate action\n\nAllyson explained she was reportedly physically blocked, shoved into a wall and had her face pinned to a wall which resulted in a bruise under her left eye\n\nDuring the incident, Mitchell allegedly also threatened to shoot her and 'repeatedly called her \"bitch\", \"cunt\", \"slut\", \"skank\" and \"whore\" while in the presence of their son'\n\nAttorney John Gomez elaborated: 'Instead of supporting her, the San Diego Police Department ignored these findings, dismissed crucial evidence and allowed her husband to remain armed and in the field.\n\n'We believe the evidence in this case will prove that instead of investigating her complaints, they dismissed her reports, and instead of protecting her and her young son, enabled her husband to avoid the consequences, retain his firearms, violate restraining orders and continued to threaten and torment her, all the while acting as an active duty police officer.'\n\nApart from this, the lawsuit further claims that the department's management was providing Mitchell with confidential information about her complaints - including facts about her restraining order and child custody proceedings in order to protect the accused.\n\nShe submitted her resignation from her job in January 2024.\n\n'I tried to move on, and I tried to move forward. But you can't do that when your department keeps putting you under investigation.\n\n'I really tried to stay and I tried to make it work, but the environment became so toxic I had no choice but to resign,' she continued.\n\n'The San Diego Police Department, to me, was supposed to be my career, my life for the rest of my working life. And they ended that.'\n\nShe explained that she was speaking out to change the department's 'boys' club' culture and that she never wanted it to come to this.\n\nShe ended up reporting felony domestic violence, DUI, harassment, threats and blackmail against Mitchell but to no avail. Furthermore, Allyson claims that her husband was never arrested or forced to surrender his weapons despite a judge-granted restraining order against him\n\nApart from this, the lawsuit further claims that the department's management was providing Mitchell with confidential information about her complaints - including facts about her restraining order and child custody proceedings in order to protect the accused\n\nAfter her report was lodged, the star detective revealed that department leaders began retaliating by denying her requests for leave and placing her under internal investigation multiple times\n\n'This was by far the hardest decision I ever had to make. In the beginning, all I wanted was for this to just go away.\n\n'I never wanted my son to be able to Google this later and find out what's happening.\n\n'This isn't what anybody dreams of or wants, but it got so bad that I just couldn't help but think that I would not have wished this treatment on my worst enemy.\n\n'And I hope that they take this as a chance to make changes so that it doesn't happen again to anybody else. I hope it ends with me,' Allyson said during yesterday's conference.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.

He and his wife Terry, an elementary school teacher, .have been married since January 2016\n\nBodycam footage showed NFL star Tyreek Hill being dragged from his $300,000 McLaren and placed in handcuffs\n\nAccording to his brother David Torres, he is an 'excellent cop' - and Hill 'only has himself to blame' for the spat.\n\n'The tints that he had were illegal tints. For the safety of the officer, he has to be able to see inside the vehicle at all times,' David insisted, speaking exclusively to DailyMail.com.'\n\nIn South Florida in particular, you never know what's inside that car or what that person is doing. He's not only protecting himself, he's protecting all the rest of the officers around them.\n\n'Miami-Dade Police officers gave chase on their bikes after Hill roared past them at 10:39am to link up with his Dolphins teammates ahead of their season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nVideo released to the media reveals an officer tapping on Hill's window and the eight-time Pro Bowler winding it down and handing over his license.\n\n'Don't knock on my window like that,' Hill says, snarkily.\n\nThe heavily-tattooed law enforcement veteran was branded a bully and a hothead after clips of Sunday's pre-game clash went viral but Hill has since admitted he should have reacted differently\n\nTorres has worked in law enforcement for 27 years, is a part-time DJ, and a motorcycle fanatic who loves to don leathers and ride a Harley Davidson in his spare time\n\n'Just give me my ticket, bro, so I can go. I am going to be late. Do what you gotta do.'\n\nThe encounter soon turns ugly when Hill puts his window back up and ignores multiple requests to lower it.\n\n'I am going to get you out of the car. As a matter of fact, get out of the car,' the officer snaps at the $20 million-per-year star.\n\nTorres then comes into shot, the heavy-set cop angrily warning Hill: 'Get out of the car or I will break that f*****g window.'\n\nHe wrenches open the McLaren's rotating butterfly door and grabs the celebrated receiver before slamming him face first to the floor and putting a knee in the middle of his back.\n\nHill is then cuffed and marched towards the sidewalk where Torres again grabs him from behind and shoves him into a seating position.\n\nWhen the Super Bowl winner warns the officers that he recently underwent knee surgery and begs them to 'chill' they lecture him for ignoring their commands and tell him to 'stop crying'.\n\nHill was eventually released after receiving citations and fines totaling $309 for failing to wear a seat belt and driving carelessly.\n\nTorres is a military veteran and a member of the Peacemaker chapter of the Gunfighters Motorcycle Club\n\n'The officers have every right to keep themselves safe. And that's exactly what happened. They were keeping themselves safe,' David said regarding the incident involving his brother and Hill\n\nPaperwork filled out by officer M. Batista estimates that he was doing 60 in a 40-mph zone but doesn't mention anything about tinted windows on the 2018 McLaren 729S. Hill told the media afterwards that he was 'shell-shocked' by the incident and feared he could have been shot had he not been a famous NFL star.\n\nBut Torres's brother says his sibling treated the VIP athlete just like any other motorist because he doesn't follow football and had no clue who he was dealing with.\n\nHe believes the traffic stop would have gone down differently had Hill followed simple instructions.\n\n'Nobody really wants to admit that Tyreek disrespected the police officers,' David, 47, told DailyMail.com.\n\n'If you watch the video, he did not follow instructions from the get-go. He was yelling at the officer and telling him not to bang on his window.\n\n'If you know anything about dealing with police officers, you know do not raise your window on them'\n\n'The officers have every right to keep themselves safe. And that's exactly what happened. They were keeping themselves safe.'\n\nTorres is a military veteran and a member of the Peacemaker chapter of the Gunfighters Motorcycle Club.\n\nSocial media photos depict the Florida cop straddling a Harley Davidson with his wife Terry, an elementary school teacher, sat behind. The pair married in January 2016.\n\nFour years later Torres was knocked off his bike in an off-duty accident and was left fighting for his life, inspiring police pals to launch a GoFundMe to raise funds for his medical expenses.\n\nTorres recovered and was able to resume work, earning around $171,000 last year, including overtime, according to county records.\n\nHe also moonlights as 'dj_dno', spinning the latest EDM tracks by Steve Aoki and David Guetta to cater for 'all your music and entertainment needs', according to an Instagram profile.\n\nDanny's brother, David Torres, stands by the officer, telling DailyMail that he is an 'excellent cop' - and Tyreek 'only has himself to blam for the spat\n\nMiami-Dade Police Director Stephanie Daniels placed Torres on administrative duty after she viewed bodycam footage which she made public to demonstrate her department's 'commitment to transparency'.\n\nTorres's lawyers say he should be reinstated immediately, a verdict David agrees with.\n\n'My brother is a very charismatic guy, he's very likeable. Everywhere he goes people like him,' added David.'\n\n'He's got a strong character but you have to have one to be a South Florida cop for so long.\n\n'He's just a straightforward, black and white kind of person. I don't mean anything racial by that, I mean that he does things by the book.\n\n'I think he is an excellent cop. I don't see any reason why he shouldn't be reinstated.'\n\n'Hill - nicknamed Cheetah because of his blistering speed - finished the 2023 season with an NFL-leading 1,799 receiving yards and 13 touchdowns before Miami lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Wild Card Game .\n\nThe Dolphins wide receiver was pinned to the floor and placed in handcuffs on the opening Sunday of the NFL season\n\nBut it was also a turbulent year off the field as he suffered a major house fire, became embroiled in paternity suits with multiple women and filed to divorce wellness influencer Keeta Vaccaro, 28, just months after marrying her.\n\nHill withdrew the petition within days, claiming it was filed by his lawyers without his knowledge. The couple are expecting their first child.\n\nHill is also being sued by Sophie Hall, a plus-sized influencer, who says he charged at her and broke her leg during a practice drill at his mansion in Southwest Ranches.\n\nHill says the OnlyFans model tripped over a dog.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

I believe traffic stops are one of the most dangerous aspects of law enforcement.\n\nBowman added that Girvin had a long-lasting impact, not only on his brothers and sisters in Virginia Beach, but also back home in New York.\n\n\"I hope I led him in the right direction,\" he said. \"I told him, 'It's the best career path you'll ever choose.'

While they were on the ground \"defenseless,\" he shot them each a second time, leading to their subsequent deaths at local hospitals, according to Virginia Beach Police Chief Paul Neudigate.\n\nMcCoy was later found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.\n\nVirginia Beach Police Officer Cameron Girvin, center, was shot and killed Friday while conducting a traffic stop. (Photo courtesy of the Girvin family)\n\nTWO VIRGINIA BEACH POLICE OFFICERS SHOT DEAD WHILE 'DEFENSELESS' DURING LATE-NIGHT TRAFFIC STOP\n\nFamily members said Girvin, who started working for the department in 2020, wanted to be a police officer since he was 5 years old while growing up in the upstate New York town of Gates.\n\nGirvin's biological grandmother, Barbara Girvin, who raised him and was known to him as his mother, told Fox News Digital that as a child, when he had a chance to dress up for school or Halloween, he always donned the iconic police uniform.\n\nHe continued to pursue a law enforcement career, taking a criminal justice class in his freshman year of high school at Gates Chili High School.\n\n\"By the time he got to his senior year, he went to classes downtown in the sheriff's office, and he experienced work in the courthouse,\" Barbara Girvin said.\n\nVirginia Beach Police Officer Cameron Girvin, 25, was shot and killed Friday while conducting a traffic stop. (Photo courtesy of the Girvin family)\n\nWhile in high school, he aided local law enforcement agencies with undercover stings, since he looked old for his age, and participated in ride alongs.\n\nJoshua Bowman, a former Gates Police Department investigator, told Fox News Digital he first met Cameron at a nearby Starbucks, where he was working as a barista in high school.\n\n\"He was always smiling, always energetic, and very polite to every single customer,\" Bowman said. \"After some time, he started asking me questions about being a police officer in New York .\"\n\nHe later interned with the Gates Police Department.\n\nVirginia Beach Police Officer Cameron Girvin, right, was shot and killed Friday while conducting a traffic stop. (Photo courtesy of the Girvin family)\n\n\"He was the only intern that I've ever seen in 24 years that showed up on every ride along with a business suit on,\" Bowman said. \"If he saw an arrest here on the news, he would ask me about it. Like, tell me more. He seemed so interested in it, and when he did the ride alongs, the politeness and eagerness really stood out. He was a breath of fresh air.\"\n\nBarbara Girvin called him \"Mr. Neat,\" noting he always had to have on a clean shirt and his hair \"just so.\"\n\nMISSISSIPPI SHERIFF'S DEPUTY SHOT, KILLED WHILE RESPONDING TO DOMESTIC CALL: 'DIED A HERO'\n\nBowman said he still remembers the young man telling him he got into the police academy and was traveling south to become an officer.\n\n\"I was just so encouraged,\" he said. \"I was like, 'You're going to make it. You're going to make your family proud.' He seemed to be a gem and if he stayed in New York, I would hope that our office would have picked him up.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Girvin applied for and received offers from two law enforcement agencies - Texas Border Patrol and the Virginia Beach Police Department.\n\nAfter finding out he got both jobs on the same day, he decided to go to Virginia, because it was closer to his family in Gates.\n\nVirginia Beach Police Officer Cameron Girvin on his wedding day. (Photo courtesy of the Girvin family)\n\n\"He just knew what he wanted, and he was going to go after it,\" his mother said. \"When he went to Virginia, he was extremely happy because he was doing something that he loved. He loved his job. He loved the people he worked with.\"\n\nSoon after moving to Virginia, he married his high school sweetheart, Jessica.\n\nThe couple eloped on the beach during the COVID-19 pandemic, but renewed their vows in front of friends and family about two years ago at Oaks Manor in Churchville, New York.\n\nOfficer Girvin's wife, Jessica, is currently pregnant with their first child and is due in the summer, and she is working with Reese's wife to plan the joint police funeral in Virginia Beach.\n\nVirginia Beach Police Officer Cameron Girvin was expecting his first child with his wife, Jessica. (Photo courtesy of the Girvin family)\n\n\"She's so emotionally distraught,\" Barbara Girvin said.\n\nThe family added Reese and his wife married just last month.\n\nFollowing the tragedy, the family said it is remembering Officer Girvin for his outgoing personality and willingness to come to anyone's rescue.\n\n\"If anybody needed any help, he was the first one there. He never hesitated at all,\" Barbara Girvin said. \"If somebody needed someone to talk to, he would sit and talk to them. He was a good listener.\"\n\nOfficer Cameron Girvin, right, killed Friday while conducting a traffic stop. (Photo courtesy of the Girvin family)\n\nShe added he was a \"jokester\" and had so many friends growing up, that she would have to set up tents in the backyard to accommodate sleepovers.\n\nFollowing his death, she said fellow officers described him as the \"life of the party.\"\n\nComing from a family of civil servants and police officers, his mother said he knew the risks that came with the job. However, he was not deterred.\n\n\"When he saw that police officers passed in the line of duty, he would kind of investigate to see what had happened, but it didn't deter him from wanting to be one or wanting to continue,\" she said. \"His top priority was serving. ... He was very interested in keeping his community safe and doing what he could do to help them.\"\n\nBowman, himself a 24-year law enforcement veteran, explained that traffic stops are \"never routine\" and there is no way to know what the person's mental state will be.\n\nPENNSYLVANIA POLICE OFFICER KILLED IN HOSPITAL SHOOTING; GUNMAN DEAD, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nEven though officers approach the instances with the utmost safety, he said things can still go awry.\n\n\"When you pull someone over, you do not know how their day is going,\" he said. \"You do not know what is happening in their life and what they're going through. ... I believe traffic stops are one of the most dangerous aspects of law enforcement.\n\nBowman added that Girvin had a long-lasting impact, not only on his brothers and sisters in Virginia Beach, but also back home in New York.\n\n\"I hope I led him in the right direction,\" he said. \"I told him, 'It's the best career path you'll ever choose.' But unfortunately, there's evil in this world that walks among us, and unfortunately for him, he met that evil. It's not fair. Not fair at all.\"\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, a GoFundMe created to support the Girvin family had raised more than $70,000.\n\nAlexandra Koch is a breaking news writer for Fox News Digital.

      "text": "Family of Fallen NYPD Officer Gets Massive Million-Dollar Gift\n\nAmericans have stepped forward in droves to donate to funds for the family of slain New York Police Department officer Jonathan Diller. (@bennyjohnson / X screen shot)\n\nNo amount of money could ever bring someone back from the dead.\n\nBut in the wake of a senseless tragedy that left a wife without her husband and an infant without his father, generosity toward them would only be commendable.\n\nJonathan Diller was one such victim of the senseless tragedies that have increasingly overtaken our cities.\n\nHe was an NYPD cop who was murdered Monday when a routine traffic stop turned into a shootout.\n\nThe shooter was allegedly 34-year-old Guy Rivera, a man with over 20 prior arrests, including drug charges and other violent offenses. The man accused of driving the car during this shootout, 41-year-old Lindy Jones, had a similar criminal record.\n\nDiller's story went viral, especially when people learned that Diller left behind a wife, Stephanie, and a one-year-old son.\n\nA GoFundMe page created to support Diller's wife and son has, according to the New York Post , raised over $490,000, but among the most massive of the monetary contributions has come from the founder of the popular Barstool Sports podcast, Dave Portnoy.\n\nFox News reported that Portnoy initially started his fundraiser on Wednesday, via a video shared to the social media platform X and Portnoy's TikTok account.\n\nWe've raised about 240k so far for family of fallen NYPD cop Jonathan Diller. I'll match whatever our total raised through midnight today is. https://t.co/VaSg3WYpjy pic.twitter.com/IZ9gRkZohU\n\n- Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) March 27, 2024\n\nIn the video, Portnoy told his followers that, in support of Diller's family, \"We put T-shirts on sale, we've raised about 230, 240 grand directly for the family. Every penny that we make goes to the family. On top of that, whatever we sell, whatever we make, end of day today, midnight, I'm just going to match it, so, double up on whatever we can make.\"\n\nHe ended saying, \"I know money doesn't cure this, nothing can cure this, but it's the least we can do, and Barstool, myself, we have a long history supporting the cops, supporting the boys in blue, supporting first responders. You know, it's tragic.\"\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the Post reported, Portnoy's fundraiser had raised $750,000, which Portnoy, as he told his followers on X, matched to make a total of $1.5 million.\n\nThanks to everybody who donated. We raised 750k. With the matching of the funds that brings the total to 1.5 million that will go directly to the family. https://t.co/uta26geRjR\n\n- Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) March 28, 2024\n\nNow, as Portnoy himself admitted, no amount of money will return Diller to his grieving family.\n\nBut Portnoy's efforts should not go unnoticed or unappreciated.\n\nIn the divided state of current American culture, where many leftist activists successfully lobbied to get city police budgets slashed and criminals the most lenient sentences possible, Diller's story was not necessarily an isolated incident .\n\nMany officers have risked - or lost - their lives trying to mitigate the consequences of blue cities' soft-on-crime policies.\n\n🚨 Joe Biden and Barack Obama arrive in New York for a fundraiser while Donald Trump is en route to the wake of slain NYPD officer Jonathan Diller\n\npic.twitter.com/zWLYqdVGnn\n\n- Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) March 28, 2024\n\nAnd many of them never received the same public outcry or grief as did career criminals like George Floyd , or mentally disturbed homeless men like Jordan Neely .\n\nInstead, they were either forgotten or left unnamed by our Democratic elites, or at times even vilified by rabid anti-police advocates.\n\nPortnoy has performed an excellent service for Diller's family and the New York Police Department as a whole.\n\nWhat our lawmakers should do now is re-evaluate the policies that led to Diller's death in the first place.\n\nThis article appeared originally on The Western Journal .\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

(KMOV St. Louis / YouTube screen shots)\n\nA Missouri police officer and his supervisor are facing serious charges after a man they had allegedly detained was found beaten and bloodied in a field on July 4.\n\nAccording to KSDK-TV , former Northwoods police officer Samuel Davis is accused of arresting the man at a Walgreens and then beating him, breaking his jaw, before dumping him in the field in the town of Kinloch.\n\nHis supervisor, Michael Hill, is said to have gone back into the store after the arrest and made an \"incriminating statement\" to an employee about what would happen to the man.\n\nDavis allegedly drove the man in his squad car to a remote area of Kinloch without telling dispatchers. Court documents state that when they arrived, Davis pepper-sprayed and beat the man with a baton and told him to never come back to Northwoods.\n\nDavis was later arrested in North Carolina and charged with first-degree assault, armed criminal action and kidnapping . Hill was arrested soon after and charged with second-degree kidnapping.\n\nAccording to KMOV-TV , both Hill and Davis have been released on bail.\n\n\"Police officers who commit violence undermine the trust of the community,\" St. Louis County Attorney Wesley Bell said in a statement. \"There is no excuse for this criminal conduct, and my office will prosecute these officers to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nNorthwoods Police Chief Dennis Shireff also expressed dismay at the incident, writing, \"Words can barely begin to express the disappointment and the failure of what appears to be a reckless disregard for the humane treatment of others and the solemn duties of a law enforcement officer.\"\n\n\"This incident is directly contrary to the core values, goals, and policies of our police department and of the City of Northwoods.\"\n\nNow, we must remember that neither of these men has been convicted of anything yet, and they are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Nevertheless, in the current climate, this case is troubling.\n\nIn the wake of the George Floyd case and the ensuing \" defund the police \" movement, police officers have gotten a bad rap from politicians and the establishment media.\n\nObviously, the vast majority of police officers are good people who are trying to enforce the law and keep citizens safe, and incidents like this are very rare. But, unfortunately, these incidents are often all the public hears about individual officers.\n\nWhen these things happen, it only serves to further tarnish the reputation of upstanding men and women in blue. Officers need to be aware that their actions reflect not only on them, but on their department and on law enforcement as a whole.\n\nWe need to support our police officers while continuing to hold them to high standards.\n\nThis article appeared originally on The Western Journal .\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

      "text": "Trump Dismisses Chief Military Officer, Appoints New Leader\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Friday the dismissal of General Charles Brown, the current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump expressed his gratitude toward Brown for his extensive contributions and leadership, wishing him and his family a prosperous future. Brown's departure marks a pivotal moment in U.S. military leadership following over 40 years of service.\n\n\"I want to thank General Charles \"CQ\" Brown for his over 40 years of service to our country, including as our current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader, and I wish a great future for him and his family,\" Trump wrote.\n\nSimultaneously, Trump introduced his nominee for Brown's successor.\n\n\"Today, I am honored to announce that I am nominating Air Force Lieutenant General Dan \"Razin\" Caine to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General Caine is an accomplished pilot, national security expert, successful entrepreneur, and a \"warfighter\" with significant interagency and special operations experience,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump said Caine's appointment comes after he was overlooked for advancement during former President Joe Biden's presidency.\n\n\"General Caine was passed over for promotion by Sleepy Joe Biden. But not anymore! Alongside Secretary Pete Hegseth, General Caine and our military will restore peace through strength, put America First, and rebuild our military,\" Trump said. President Trump also announced plans to appoint five additional senior military officials, tasks he has delegated to Secretary Hegseth.\n\nIt was reported Thursday that Hegseth plans to dismiss Brown as part of President Trump's commitment to eliminate \"wokeness\" from the military. Brown reportedly appears on a list of proposed removals submitted to Congress.\n\nBrown had previously expressed his wish to retain his position even after Trump took office, and according to sources speaking to NBC News in Dec. 2024, Trump seemingly moderated his views on the general. Biden nominated Brown as chairman in 2023, and despite a heated confirmation hearing where senators scrutinized his alleged implementation of racial quotas in Air Force hiring practices, he was confirmed.\n\nMeanwhile, Brown's replacement, Caine , took office as the associate director for Military Affairs at the CIA on Nov. 3, 2021, after serving as the director of Special Programs at the Pentagon. Lt. Gen. Dan Caine, an F-16 pilot with extensive experience including over 150 combat hours, was commissioned in 1990 and has held numerous key roles, from the White House staff to special operations, and balances his military career with entrepreneurial ventures.\n\nThe Pentagon referred to Hegseth's statement when the Daily Caller News Foundation requested comment.\n\n(Featured Image Media Credit: Screen Capture/CSPAN)\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Man Pulls .44 Magnum and Shoots Officer in the Chest - Trooper Shrugs Off Direct Hit and Responds with Hellfire\n\nNorth Carolina state trooper Jeffrey Dunlap was shot in the chest before he returned fire and killed his assailant, Wesley Scott Taylor, on July 3. (@BuncombeCoDA / Twitter)\n\nA good guy with a gun is the best antidote to a bad guy with a gun - especially when that good guy is a state trooper.\n\nNow, the district attorney responsible for handling the case has made it clear the trooper's use of deadly force was justified, considering that he had just been shot with a round stopped by his ballistic vest.\n\nAccording to WLOS-TV , the shooting happened along Interstate 26 in Asheville, North Carolina, on July 3.\n\nTrooper Jeffrey Dunlap had stopped to assist what appeared to be a stranded motorist. The motorist - later identified as Wesley Taylor, 57 - then brandished a gun and shot Dunlap in the chest.\n\nDunlap was able to return fire, killing Taylor.\n\nThe trooper, a 13-year veteran of the force, was taken to a local hospital for observation and subsequently released, according to the North Carolina State Highway Patrol.\n\nThe reason for the attack is not known. A July 7 report from WLOS indicated that Taylor only had \"traffic citations and violations\" in North Carolina, as well as a charge of driving while impaired from 2012 - but that charge had been dismissed at the time.\n\nHowever, it was a different matter in Kentucky, where, WLOS reported, \"between 1984-1990, Taylor was found guilty of charges ranging from aggravated assault, fugitive warrants, forcible sex offenses, and burglary, for which he served time.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Buncombe County District Attorney Todd Williams said in a statement that no charges would be filed against Dunlap and that his use of deadly force was lawful.\n\n\"I find that Trooper Dunlap was legally justified to use deadly force against Taylor who shot Trooper Dunlap in the chest at close range with a .44 Magnum semi-automatic pistol,\" Williams said in a statement.\n\n\"No criminal charges will be filed in this matter and the [North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation] may close this investigation.\"\n\n\"Trooper Dunlap was legally justified to use deadly force . . . [n]o criminal charges will be filed in this matter and the NC SBI may close this investigation.\" - DA Todd Williams.\n\nSee the attached statement for more information.\n\nprior reporting: https://t.co/naop6erT2K pic.twitter.com/RH42LlaUpt\n\n- Buncombe County DA (@BuncombeCoDA) July 11, 2023\n\nAlso, lest you think this is some hard-on-crime district attorney laying down the law and holding the thin blue line here, keep in mind that Williams is a Democrat serving in one of the more liberal corners of the state - one where the county commissioners have endorsed a resolution calling for reparations for black people.\n\nThe biggest city, Asheville - where the shooting happened - is also a notorious leftie/hippie hotspot. In other words, when the DA says there's nothing to investigate here, there's nothing to investigate here.\n\nAs for Taylor, we'll never know what kind of lunacy made him pull a gun on a state trooper. We can only be thankful that Dunlap was wearing enough body armor to stop the round.\n\nIt's a reminder of why we need well-funded police officers , not desiccated police departments strongarmed by \"defund\" units into shifting money to \" mental health experts \" and other forms of intervention to deal with crime.\n\nWill a mental health expert have enough body armor to stop a .44 Magnum bullet? Will they be able to \"de-escalate\" a situation with a shooter like Taylor?\n\nOf course not. But that's what the defunders would have you believe. In their utopia, someone might be able to reason with Taylor. Just back away, man. Give the guy waving the high-caliber handgun a little space.\n\nWe may never know what motivated Taylor to shoot a police officer - but thank heavens Dunlap had the equipment to stay alive and the training to shoot back and ensure Taylor never pulls that handgun on another living soul.\n\nThis article appeared originally on The Western Journal .\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

(@Georgia_AG / Twitter)\n\nA Georgia police officer who died on duty is being remembered by his community for a life of service that ended too soon.\n\nOfficer Clarence \"CJ\" Williams died Saturday while chasing a suspect after a traffic stop, according to WCTV-TV . The Cairo Police Department said Williams had suffered a \"medical episode.\"\n\nThe Georgia Bureau of Investigation identified the suspect as Raymond Brown, 24, who was wanted for possession of cocaine and two counts of misdemeanor obstruction of officers. The bureau said on Facebook that Brown was in custody as of Monday.\n\nThe Cairo Police Department said in a Facebook post that Williams died \"serving the community he so loved.\"\n\nMaster Patrol Officer Clarence \"CJ\" Williams made a tremendous impact on his hometown of Cairo, Georgia & leaves behind a legacy of selfless service.\n\nWe'll continue to pray for his family, his brothers & sisters in blue, & all those who knew & loved him. https://t.co/ByjLDNtolr\n\n- GA AG Chris Carr (@Georgia_AG) January 30, 2023\n\nPolice Chief Giovannie Santos said in a statement that Williams passed away \"while serving his community and doing the profession he so loved.\"\n\n\"CJ was the type of person who genuinely cared about making a difference in our community and always approached his duties in that respect. His interest in our youth and his desire to become an officer in the city he grew up in is what stood out the most and is one of the reasons why he became a member of the department,\" Santos said.\n\n\"Anyone who was around him and saw him smile, knew just how infectious it was. It would not take you long, and you would quickly find yourself smiling with him as well, no matter how bad of a mood you may have found yourself in.\n\n\"I, along with every individual here at the department, will miss him dearly and all our lives are a little less full without his presence,\" Santos said.\n\nWilliams is only the second Cairo police officer ever to die on duty - the first was in 1907, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution .\n\n\"I feel lost without him; he was a brother to me,\" said Ronnie Allen, who considered Williams his best friend, according to WTXL-TV .\n\nWilliams graduated from Cairo High School in 2017. He joined the Cairo Police Department in 2020.\n\nMichael Best, the Grady County Schools director of student services, said the entire community feels the loss.\n\nHe summed up Williams this way: \"Just always a bright smile.

      "text": "Biden-Harris Equity Commission Wants To Spend $20 Million To Disarm Traffic Cops\n\nCriminals opened fire on at least 134 police officers during routine traffic stops from 2021 through 2023, federal data show. Now, an equity commission convened by the Biden-Harris administration wants to spend $20 million on a pilot program that would deploy unarmed cops to conduct traffic enforcement.\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Transportation Equity, an Obama-era body revived by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg last year, said in a report released this month that cops don't need to carry guns or tasers with them when out on the streets enforcing traffic laws. The commission, whose membership includes an activist who once said cars perpetuate \"systemic racism,\" urged the federal government to spend $20 million developing a pilot program to \"test the use of non-lethal, perhaps non-police traffic enforcement.\"\n\n\"Citing a driver for having a broken taillight, forgetting to use a turn signal, or even failing to stop at a stop sign, does not require the use of a gun, taser, or similar tool,\" the commission said.\n\nThe data suggest otherwise. In fact, traffic stops are one of the most dangerous aspects of a police officer's job, according to Justice Department statistics.\n\nRoutine traffic stops have been the third-deadliest out of 11 commonly performed police activities since the start of the Biden-Harris administration in January 2021, according to annual reports compiled by the Justice Department. At least 134 police officers have been shot at during traffic stops during the Biden-Harris administration, 23 of whom lost their lives.\n\nThe commission's recommendation to the Biden-Harris administration to disarm traffic cops could cause headaches for Vice President Kamala Harris, who in 2020 praised the \"defund the police\" movement but is now presenting herself to voters as a tough-on-crime former prosecutor. The Transportation Department did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe Justice Department reports detail how attacks on police officers during traffic stops can come out of nowhere. In one 2023 incident, for example, officers came under fire after stopping to assist a disabled motorist.\n\n\"The driver then opened fire, striking an officer,\" the Justice Department report stated . \"Officers returned fire, striking the suspect. The suspect fled the scene in the officer's vehicle but eventually crashed and died because of their injuries.\"\n\nSimilar stories abound. On July 3, a DUI suspect opened fire on two officers with the Los Angeles Police Department with a fully automatic rifle before fleeing the scene. The officers survived, with one suffering graze wounds to his head. The suspect was arrested less than two weeks later.\n\nFlorida police officer Joseph Bullock wasn't so lucky. A 19-year veteran trooper, Bullock pulled over to help someone who he thought was having car troubles in February 2020 when that person \"shot him, resulting in fatal injuries.\" Another police officer who was passing by the scene later killed the suspect, Tribune Media reported.\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Transportation Equity did not mention the inherent danger posed to police officers during traffic stops in its report. Instead, the commission highlighted a 2021 New York Times report that found police officers killed over 400 individuals during a five-year period. The Times report noted most of those killings were found to be legally justified.\n\n\"Considering the violence police have committed at traffic stops, especially on Black and Brown individuals, it is clear alternatives to this approach are necessary to ensure the safety of our streets,\" the commission's report said.\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Transportation Equity was first activated during the Obama administration but was shuttered during the Trump administration. Buttigieg revived the commission in August 2023 at the behest of 15 Democratic senators, including vulnerable swing state Sen. Bob Casey (D., Pa.) in November 2021.\n\n\"We believe that permanently reinstating the Committee would align with the Biden Administration's commitment to integrating equity throughout the President's Build Back Better agenda,\" Casey and his fellow senators wrote in a letter to Buttigieg. \"We also believe that the Committee would help recognize and address the impact of our transportation infrastructure on climate change, health, housing, disability rights, environmental justice, safety, and other issues through meaningful collaboration.\"\n\nPublished under: Bob Casey , Crime , Defund the Police , DEI , Joe Biden , Kamala Harris , Pete Buttigieg\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

Exclusive Interview with Hezbollah's Chief Recruitment Officer\n\nHezbollah, the Lebanese terrorist organization funded by Iran, has experienced an unprecedented turnover of senior leadership in 2024, and recently lost its longtime leader and \" moral compass ,\" Hassan Nasrallah, to an unfortunate workplace mishap . We spoke by phone to Sayyid Mustafa Hussein Jafar Fayad, the chief recruitment officer for Hezbollah, in order to give our readers an inside look at how the terror group is working to attract and retain a talented workforce. Enjoy!\n\nHello? Is this Sayyid Mustafa?\n\nNo. My name is Jafar Fayad.\n\nI was trying to reach the chief recruitment officer for Hezbollah. Is that you?\n\nYes. I was recently promoted.\n\nOh, congrats. May I ask what happened to Mustafa? We arranged this interview with him, but he stopped returning our pages for some reason.\n\nHe, um, can't come to the phone right now.\n\nWhy not?\n\nHe's buried.\n\nBuried? Like, in paperwork?\n\nNo. I can assure you at this moment our recruitment process is incredibly streamlined and involves no paperwork.\n\nThat's great to hear, but I'd feel more comfortable-\n\nThe Jews.\n\nI beg your pardon?\n\nThis is why Sayyid Mustafa can't talk with you today, alayhi as-salam .\n\nOh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Very well. I was wondering if you could tell me a little about your organization and the positions you are seeking to fill?\n\nCertainly. As the Associated Press recently explained , Hezbollah is a \"potent regional force\" comprised of paramilitary entrepreneurs driving positive impact in a dynamic ecosystem while promoting creative collaboration across antiquated divides in the pursuit of life-changing solutions to complex problems. We are based in Lebanon but have satellite offices throughout the Middle East and sleeper cells positioned around the world.\n\nThere has never been a better time to apply for a job in the Hezbollah organization, as we are in the midst of a bold restructuring program that has created a number of enticing advancement opportunities for new and existing employees. We are currently seeking applicants to fill dozens of recently vacated roles on Hezbollah's senior leadership team-including the secretary general position. Rest assured, the application process is a mere formality at this point given the 100 percent acceptance rate for new hires in the month of September. Motivated individuals are already being promoted at an unprecedented rate.\n\nThat's fantastic! Can you talk a little more about what you're looking for in a prospective Hezbollah employee?\n\nFirst and foremost, we're looking for people who are alive. It's something many of our older and most senior executives have struggled with of late, so that alone will get you in the door and moving up the ranks in no time. An intense hatred of Jews is preferred, as is proficiency in Microsoft Office programs, but it's not a dealbreaker. Hezbollah is committed to fostering an inclusive workplace environment while also striving to root out and eliminate infidel collaborators whose nefarious influence threatens to erode our core competencies and undermine our ability to leverage intentionality in pursuit of cross-functional returns.\n\nCan you describe some of the challenges facing your organization?\n\nAt the moment we are currently facing a lot of Jewish-related challenges, although ironically our media coverage has been mostly positive . Brain drain, so to speak, has also been an issue. Like most organizations, Hezbollah has faced a number of setbacks involving communications technology. Regrettably, we had to issue an urgent recall notice affecting a large number of personal communication devices earlier this month. I think I already mentioned the problem of nefarious collaborators, which is terribly annoying.\n\nThat sounds awful. Again, I'm so sorry this is happening to you. What can you tell me about the Hezbollah headquarters? What's it like to work there?\n\nWell, our headquarters in Beirut is undergoing significant renovations at the moment, so we are pleased to offer a flexible work-from-home policy for new and existing employees. We'll do our best to sponsor some happy hour events in the near future. We at Hezbollah are laser-focused on maintaining a joyous vibe within the organization. The way we see it, \"terrorism\" is just another word for hanging out with the guys.

      "text": "CIA Officer Arrested in Cambodia for 'Deadly Serious' Leak of Classified US Docs on Israel\n\nAn overseas CIA officer was arrested Tuesday in Cambodia and charged with leaking highly classified U.S. intelligence on Israel's military plans for a strike on Iran, according to the New York Times .\n\nThe Times identified the officer as Asif W. Rahman. He was indicted last week on two counts of \"willful retention and transmission of national defense information\" and transported to federal court in Guam to face the charges.\n\nThe leaked documents , which showed Israeli military movements in preparation for a retaliatory strike on Iran last month, sparked an international firestorm, with both American and Israeli officials accusing the Biden-Harris administration of working to hamstring Israel's sensitive operations. One senior Biden-Harris official described the leak as \"deadly serious\" and part of \"a concerted campaign to leak what at least seems to be classified information by anti-Israel elements.\"\n\nThe materials-compiled by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency-revealed Israeli Air Force movements and munitions ahead of the counterstrike, which was delayed as a result. Israel ultimately made good on its promise to strike Iran late last month, destroying large swaths of Tehran's air defense systems and several military installations.\n\nRahman held a top-secret security clearance and could access the information as part of his CIA duties. The documents first emerged publicly on a Telegram channel tied to the Iranian regime.\n\nWhile the leak served to further erode already tense diplomatic relations between the United States and Israel, the Jewish state made clear that it would not be deterred from a strike on Iran as payback for Tehran's two massive ballistic missile attacks this year.\n\n\"After we attack in Iran, they will understand in Israel and elsewhere what your preparations have included,\" former Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant said shortly after the classified documents became public. \"Everyone will understand your strength, the process of preparation and training-any enemy that tries to harm the State of Israel will pay a heavy price.\"\n\nThe leak also ignited congressional investigations, with Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) ordering the Biden-Harris administration to brief Congress every two weeks until the leaker was caught.\n\n\"This leak is an outrageous betrayal of an ally and a breach of trust that will undermine our relationship with partners for years to come,\" Cotton said last month in a letter to the White House. \"I am deeply concerned as to whether your administration will adequately address this serious security breach.\"\n\nWhile many thought the documents were seized from the Pentagon or State Department, overseas CIA officials can easily access the same classified systems. Rahman will now face charges of violating the U.S. Espionage Act, which carries a 20-year prison sentence.\n\nPublished under: Cambodia , CIA , Harris , Iran , Israel , Joe Biden\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

The two were the only female officers attempting the course in the current cycle, which began Thursday in Quantico, Virginia.\n\nWith the two most recent drops, there have been 29 attempts by female officers to pass the course since women have been allowed to volunteer, with none making it to graduation.

      "text": "Tammy Baldwin Aide Participated in Anti-Police Protest That Led to Brutal Assault on Officer Outside His Home\n\nWisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin's longtime aide participated in an anti-police demonstration outside a Wisconsin police officer's home during which the cop and his girlfriend were violently assaulted, according to police reports obtained by the Washington Free Beacon .\n\nTiffany Henry, who has served as Baldwin's Milwaukee office director since 2017, was part of a caravan of activists that drove to former Wauwatosa police officer Joseph Mensah's home on Aug. 8, 2020, where agitators smashed Mensah's windows, bludgeoned the officer over the head with a bullhorn, slashed his tires, fired a shotgun, and threatened to kill him and his dog, according to police records.\n\nHenry allegedly yelled at Mensah over a bullhorn, shouting \"this is what democracy looks like,\" and called the former officer a \"punk-ass bitch,\" according to police interviews with other protesters. She also allegedly offered to help pay the bail of another participant who fired his shotgun at the cop's home.\n\nHenry's involvement in the anti-police demonstration was first reported by Wisconsin Right Now in July 2021, but she continues to work for Baldwin. Henry was reportedly arrested for violating curfew during another anti-police protest in October 2020.\n\nBaldwin's office told the Free Beacon that Baldwin wasn't aware that Henry was participating in the protest at Mensah's house and didn't authorize it. The office said the senator didn't know about Henry's subsequent arrest until after the fact.\n\n\"Tiffany Henry was not acting as a representative of the Senator at these protests and Senator Baldwin did not authorize or know of Tiffany's involvement until after the events,\" said Baldwin's spokesman Eli Rosen. \"The Senator has formally reprimanded Tiffany for the unauthorized actions and required her to undergo ethics training.\"\n\nThe news comes as Baldwin has sought to distance herself from the \"defund the police\" movement and run ads that feature Wisconsin sheriffs defending her border policies.\n\nIt also comes a week after the Free Beacon reported that Henry cohosted a radical anti-police podcast, where guests praised Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, accused Jews of exploiting the black civil rights movement, and called police \"slave catchers\" who should be \"abolished.\"\n\nHenry-who boasted about her involvement with Baldwin's police policies on the show-was disciplined over the unauthorized podcast, a spokesman for Baldwin told the Free Beacon .\n\nHenry is associated with the People's Revolution, an extremist anti-police group that has organized violent protests around Wisconsin, including the one outside Mensah's house.\n\nMensah, who is black, came under scrutiny in 2020 for his involvement in three shootings in which young men, who were also black, were killed. Mensah, who said he was acting in self-defense, resigned from the police department and was later cleared of wrongdoing in the cases.\n\nOn Aug. 8, 2020, around 50 members of the People's Revolution descended on the house where Mensah was living with his girlfriend. The home \"was vandalized, [Mensah and his girlfriend] were beaten, multiple individuals in the [protest] group were armed, and a shotgun was fired,\" striking the house, according to a police report written by a responding officer.\n\nPeople's Revolution member Ronald Bell told police that one of the attendees was Henry, whom Bell described as a \"representative of Senator Tammy Baldwin.\"\n\n\"Henry [spoke] on the bullhorn at the protest stating, 'This is what democracy looks like,'\" said Bell in a police interview.\n\nAnother protester, Niles McKee, also told police that Henry worked for Baldwin. McKee said Henry was at the protest and was \"calling [Mensah] a 'punk-ass bitch' and using 'other colorful language,'\" according to his police interview.\n\nBell said Henry didn't do \"anything violent at the house,\" but she stayed through the demonstration, which ended after Bell fired a shotgun near Mensah. Henry then drove with the group to a nearby park afterwards, where another People's Revolution organizer warned members to delete any videos they had of the violence, according to Bell.\n\nBell said Henry called him the next day to ask if he was the person who fired the gun and said police were looking for him. She also allegedly offered to help pay for Bell's bail if he got arrested.\n\nOn the call, Henry and another activist \"told Bell they had a lawyer for him and they would pay his cash bail,\" said the police report. \"They did not tell him who the lawyer they had for him was.\"\n\nBell told police that \"none of the protests [the People's Revolution] have been doing lately have been peaceful.\"\n\nHe said he and other protesters hit and punched Mensah, and one participant bludgeoned Mensah over the head with a bullhorn. The bullhorn was then given to the sister of Alvin Cole-one of the young men whose death the group was protesting-\"as a trophy.\"\n\nBell pleaded guilty to battery to a police officer and was sentenced to two years in prison in 2022. McKee, who owned the shotgun that Bell fired, pleaded no contest to misdemeanor disorderly conduct.\n\nPublished under: Black Lives Matter , Crime , Defund the Police , Tammy Baldwin , Wisconsin\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

The home \"was vandalized, [Mensah and his girlfriend] were beaten, multiple individuals in the [protest] group were armed, and a shotgun was fired,\" striking the house, according to a police report written by a responding officer.\n\nPeople's Revolution member Ronald Bell told police that one of the attendees was Henry, whom Bell described as a \"representative of Senator Tammy Baldwin.\"\n\n\"Henry [spoke] on the bullhorn at the protest stating, 'This is what democracy looks like,'\" said Bell in a police interview.\n\nAnother protester, Niles McKee, also told police that Henry worked for Baldwin. McKee said Henry was at the protest and was \"calling [Mensah] a 'punk-ass bitch' and using 'other colorful language,'\" according to his police interview.\n\nBell said Henry didn't do \"anything violent at the house,\" but she stayed through the demonstration, which ended after Bell fired a shotgun near Mensah. Henry then drove with the group to a nearby park afterwards, where another People's Revolution organizer warned members to delete any videos they had of the violence, according to Bell.\n\nBell said Henry called him the next day to ask if he was the person who fired the gun and said police were looking for him. She also allegedly offered to help pay for Bell's bail if he got arrested.\n\nOn the call, Henry and another activist \"told Bell they had a lawyer for him and they would pay his cash bail,\" said the police report. \"They did not tell him who the lawyer they had for him was.\"\n\nBell told police that \"none of the protests [the People's Revolution] have been doing lately have been peaceful.\"\n\nHe said he and other protesters hit and punched Mensah, and one participant bludgeoned Mensah over the head with a bullhorn. The bullhorn was then given to the sister of Alvin Cole-one of the young men whose death the group was protesting-\"as a trophy.\"\n\nBell pleaded guilty to battery to a police officer and was sentenced to two years in prison in 2022. McKee, who owned the shotgun that Bell fired, pleaded no contest to misdemeanor disorderly conduct.\n\nPublished under: Black Lives Matter , Crime , Defund the Police , Tammy Baldwin , Wisconsin\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Eric Adams's Fallen Cop Photo Is a Fake\n\nDemocratic New York City mayor Eric Adams has repeatedly shown off a picture of a murdered police officer, saying he has kept the picture in his wallet for decades. In reality, the picture was a Google printout that Adams aides altered last year to make it look like \"the mayor had been carrying it for some time,\" the New York Times reported Thursday.\n\nAdams has used the picture to tout his image as tough on crime, saying last year that the killings of two police officers \"reminded him of the 1987 line-of-duty death of a friend, Officer Robert Venable,\" according to the Times report . \"I keep a picture of Robert in my wallet,\" Adams said. One week later, the mayor posed for a picture in which he held up the photo of Venable. He has \"repeated the moving anecdote\"-and held up the Venable photo-multiple times since.\n\nBut the photo \"had not actually spent decades in the mayor's wallet,\" the Times reported. Adams had, in fact, instructed City Hall employees to print out a Google image of the fallen officer and make it look older, \"including by splashing some coffee on it.\" Two former City Hall aides confirmed that \"they were informed about the manipulated photo last year, not long after it was created.\"\n\nThis is far from the first time Adams has faced accusations of manipulating the truth. The mayor, who claims to be a vegan, was caught ordering fish only days after he ordered New York City schools to serve only vegan food on Fridays, the Washington Free Beacon reported.\n\nThe mayor, who recently gave a six-figure city job to his sister-in-law and compared a woman to a slave owner for opposing rent hikes, has seen his favorability ratings fall, according to a Siena College poll last month. One reason for that drop is his poor polling among black voters: Only 29 percent of black voters in New York State have a favorable view of Adams, the poll found.\n\nAdams spokesman Fabien Levy blasted the Times report, saying it \"would be laughable if it were not so utterly offensive.\" Levy ignored \"repeated requests to elaborate about the authenticity of the photo\" and \"questions about whether the photo was made to look old,\" according to the Times .\n\nPublished under: Democrats , Eric Adams , Hypocrisy , New York , New York City , New York Times\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"
