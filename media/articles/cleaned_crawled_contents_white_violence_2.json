      "text": "White America's Waco Insanity: The Shocking Realities it Ignores About Racism & Violence\n\nMalcolm X, the famed Civil Rights leader and minister of the Nation of Islam, would have turned 90 years old this week. While America annually marks the significance of the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., it is only in Black communities nationally, and locally in Harlem, that we mark and celebrate the birth of King's most formidable racial adversary. Undoubtedly this has something to do with the very forthright and unflinching manner in which Malcolm X talked about race in the 1960s. El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, as Malcolm X was otherwise known, did not have any hope that white people could or would change when it came to race. Although King was far less optimistic at the end of his life about the capacity of white people to change, too, he still has the March on Washington speech, which represented the zenith of his racial optimism.\n\nAnd indeed we did get a front row seat to such insanity this week, when three biker gangs in Texas, had a shootout in a parking lot that left nine people dead and 18 people injured. More than 165 people have been arrested for their participation in this thuggish, ruggish, deadly, violent, white-on-white street brawl but there has been no mass outcry from the country about this. Though these motorcycle gangs were already under surveillance because of known participation in consistent and organized criminal activity, as Darnell Moore notes at Mic , \"the police didn't don riot gear.\" Moore further notes that \"leather and rock music weren't blamed,\" and there hasn't been any \"hand-wringing over the problem of white-on-white crime.\"\n\nWhite people, even well-meaning and thoughtful ones, have the privilege of looking at deadly acts of mass violence of this sort as isolated local incidents, particular to one community. They do not look at such incidents as indicative of anything having to do with race or racism. But everything from the difference in law enforcement response to media response tells us what we need to know about how white privilege allows acts of violence by white people to be judged by entirely different standards than those of any other group. If a Black motorcycle gang had engaged in a shootout in a parking lot, any honest white person will admit that the conversation would have sounded incredibly different.\n\nFrequently in conversations that I have observed or participated in with white people about race, the claim is levied that it is Black people \"who make everything about race.\" But this incident in Waco gives lie to that claim. It turns out that when white privilege is in clear operation, white people are invested in making sure that we don't see race in operation. Charles Mills, a philosopher of race, has a term which I think applies here: epistemology of white ignorance . By this means, he means that white people have created a whole way of knowing the world that both demands and allows that they remain oblivious to the operations of white supremacy, that white people remain \"intent on denying what is before them.\" Thus even though three gangs have now attacked each other in broad daylight and killed or injured 27 people, there is no nagging, gnawing sense of fear, no social anxiety about what the world is coming to, no anger at the thugs who made it unsafe for American families to go about their regular daily activities without fear of being clipped by a stray bullet, no posturing from law enforcement about the necessity of using military weapons to put down the lawless band of criminals that turned a parking lot into a war zone in broad daylight. More than that, there is no sense of white shame, no hanging of the head over the members of their race that have been out in the world representing everything that is wrong with America.\n\nThat kind of intra-racial shame is reserved primarily for Black people.\n\nMost white citizens will insist that this was just an isolated incident, even though the gangs were already under surveillance for consistent participation in criminal activity. And this studied ignorance, this sense in which people could look at this set of incidents and simply refuse to see all the ways in which white privilege is at play - namely that no worse than arrest befell any the men who showed up hours later with weapons, looking for a fight - returns me to the words of Malcolm X. For many Americans, this is just good ole American fun, sort of like playing Cowboys-and-Indians in real life. As Malcolm reminded us, \"whites idolize fighters.\" So while I'm sure many Americans are appalled at the senseless loss of life, there is also the sense that this is just \"those wild Texans\" doing the kind of thing they do.\n\nWhite Americans might also deny the attempt to \"lump them in\" with this unsavory element. But the point is that being seen as an individual is a privilege. Not having to interrogate the ways in which white violence is always viewed as exceptional rather than regular and quotidian is white privilege. White people can distance themselves from their violent racial counterparts because there is no sense that what these \"bikers\" did down in Texas is related to anything racial. White Americans routinely ask Black Americans to chastise the \"lower\" elements of our race, while refusing to do the same in instances like this. Yes, white people will denounce these crimes, but they won't shake a finger at these bikers for making the race look bad. It won't even occur to them why Black people would view such incidents as racialized.\n\nSuch analyses are patently unacceptable. And they are possible because white bodies, even those engaged in horrendously violent and reckless acts, are not viewed as \"criminal.\" Yes, some police officers referred to the acts of these killers in Waco as criminal acts and them as criminals, but in popular discourse, these men have not been criminalized. Criminalization is a process that exists separate and apart from the acts one has committed. It's why street protestors in Baltimore are referred to as violent thugs for burning buildings, but murderers in Waco get called \"bikers.\" And if thug is the new n-word (and I'm not sure that's precise), then \"biker\" is the new \"honky\" or \"cracker,\" which is to say that while the term is used derisively and can communicate distaste, it does not have the devastating social effects or demand the same level of state engagement to suppress such \"biker-ish\" activity as we demand to suppress the activities of alleged \"thugs\" and \"criminals.\"\n\nHow we talk about and understand the problem of violence is actually critical to our ability to make any progress on solving the problem of racism in this country. We have turned the word \"criminal\" into a social category that acts a site of cultural refuse, where we can toss all of our anger, hatred, and resentment, on a group of people, disproportionately people of color, for abhorrent acts that they commit against us and the state. We get to view them as less than human and treat them as such, while acting as though our indignation is pure, righteous, and without hypocrisy. None of this is true.\n\nWith white citizens, officers feel it is their duty to protect the unsafe and de-escalate the situation. With Black citizens, officers, acting out of their own fear, escalate conflicts, antagonize citizens, and move swiftly to the use of tanks, tear gas, and billy clubs to subdue, even lawful and peaceful protests. What Malcolm X pointed to, and what we would do well to recapture on this week, as we, if we are brave enough, choose to remember his life, is that there is something fundamentally dishonest about a society that revels in the violence of one group while demanding non-violent compliance from another. That kind of thinking is unjust, unfair, and unproductive. And for those of us who are not white, white ignorance on these matters is not bliss."

      "text": "United States of Amnesia: What White America Doesn't Understand About the Baltimore Protests\n\nBaltimore's young people responded to the police theft of Freddie Gray's life with protests that eventually grew into a spasm of violence. While the direct motivator, Gray's death is not the only direct cause of the uprising. The protests and violent exhalations by Baltimore's black youth (and others) are the result of a long pattern of police abuse, harassment and violence toward that city's African-American community in the context of systemic class inequality, custodial citizenship and mass incarceration.\n\nThe causes of black urban unrest in the United States are not \"unknown unknowns.\" Rather, they were described in great and compelling detail by the 1968 Kerner Commission, which was tasked by President Johnson with determining the causes of the urban riots during the 1960s.\n\nThe reasons young people in Baltimore and other parts of the United States have been moved to street protests in response to police violence are only mysteries to those American policymakers and members of the public who choose to live in a state of denial.\n\n(White) America is a country with a limited historical perspective and a very short-term memory. As Gore Vidal famously said, \"We live here in the United States of Amnesia. No one remembers anything before Monday morning. Everything is a blank. They have no history.\"\n\nThus, the American people are robbed of any meaningful social or historical context for the police abuse in Baltimore, Ferguson, and the many other locales where police thuggery and state violence are routinely visited upon black and brown Americans, as well as the poor and the mentally ill, with relative impunity.\n\nWhite riots and pogroms against Black Americans are a fixture of American history. But the corporate news media enables many white Americans' intentional forgetting and mass amnesia.\n\nHere, the uprising and righteous anger of black young people in Baltimore (and elsewhere) is almost by default described as a riot. Deeper questions about class inequality and racism are removed from the dominant media frame and replaced by tired, trite and profoundly unsophisticated claims that the uprising in Baltimore was caused by absent black fathers, broken homes and an urban culture of poverty and violence. In everything but name, Baltimore's black youth have been branded by the news media and American opinion leaders as feral street urchins: this is the language of racialization and dehumanization.\n\nMany Americans in the news media and elsewhere are reluctant to acknowledge how the angry and violent response by Baltimore's young people against the illegitimate, cruel and repeated acts of police brutality and killings in their community could be logical and wholly reasonable-and solidly within the American political tradition.\n\nThe White Racial Frame-a system of belief that legitimizes and normalizes white dominance and privilege in North American society-has produced the language of \"riots,\" \"black pathology,\" \"thugs,\" and \"criminals\" that is commonly used to describe the Baltimore uprising. The White Racial Frame does the work of white supremacy and helps to maintain political, social and economic systems of white privilege and unearned advantages. The White Racial Frame also distorts historical fact by erasing America's long tradition of white-on-black violence across the colorline.\n\nThe language of \"riots\" to describe \"urban unrest\" as something unique to black Americans is a relatively recent phenomenon, one that can be traced back to iconic images of burning cities in the aftermath of Dr. King's assassination and the tumult of the 1960s. But the use of phrases such as \"riot\" or \"mob\" can also be seen in the latter part of the 19th and early 20th centuries to legitimize mass white racial violence against black Americans during the era of Jim and Jane Crow. Newspapers such as the New York Times featured headlines such as \"Mobs of Blacks Retaliate for Riots\"; \"Negro Mob Terrorizing the Citizens of Jacksonville\"; \"Negro Mob in South Shouts for Lynching\"; and \"Negro Mob Killed Sheriff.\"\n\nThe racist news narrative continues in the present, where the urban uprising against police violence and brutality in Baltimore has been described by right-wing propaganda sites such as the Drudge Report and other media outlets as a \"race war\" and/or \"anti-white\" violence.\n\nIn fact, in the United States, \"rioting\" and \"race wars\" against people of color are almost exclusively the domain of white Americans.\n\nDuring the 1863 New York City draft riots, white people ran amok, killing black Americans and destroying the African-American community's churches, orphanages, businesses and schools.\n\nIn 1921, over a 24-hour time period, whites destroyed the prosperous black community in Tulsa, Oklahoma. White rioters used machine guns and dropped bombs (in what may be one of the first recorded uses of a plane for that purpose) on the black community. Conservative estimates suggest that at least several h undred black people were killed.\n\nIn East Saint Louis, whites engaged in a pogrom against the bl ack community . Like Chicago, this was part of the \"Red Summers\" in which whites attempted to reassert their control and dominance over the black community in the aftermath of World War I.\n\nScholars such a s James Loewen estimate that as many as 3,000 black communities were \"ethnically cleansed\" by white violence and other means of intimidation\n\nHistorian Gregory Downs has suggested that as many as 50,000 black Americans were killed by white racial terrorism in the 30 years following the end of the American Civil War. This total may not even include at least 4,000 blacks who were victims of lynchings by whites across the South and other parts of the United States.\n\nAs the late Joel Olsen described in The Abolition of White Democracy, white riots against black Americans and other people of color were a way of creating a sense of communal identity across lines of class and ethnicity. Thus, \"whiteness\" was nurtured and in many ways created by white violence against non-whites generally, and African Americans in particular.\n\nWhite riots and other types of mass violence against the black community enriched white Americans through land theft, the destruction of black businesses and as a way of enforcing a regime of racial terrorism that economically and politically oppressed the black community in such as a way as to directly (and indirectly) fill white America's coffers.\n\nBy most empirical measures (land taken, people killed and number of occurrences-there were 26 white-on-black race riots during the year 1919 alone) white Americans are the country's most successful, adept and skilled rioters. White America is an expert on rioting and race wars; black America is a neophyte amateur with little to no experience in such matters by comparison.\n\nNevertheless, the corporate news media has recycled Ronald Reagan's and the Republican Party's language of \"law and order\" and \"black pathology,\" and obsess over images of black young people \"rioting\" against the Baltimore police. Many in the corporate news media will also emphasize what they believe is wrong with the \"black family,\" \"black culture,\" and the black community's supposed inability to \"control\" young black people in the aftermath of the Baltimore uprising.\n\nThe right-wing media and its politicians will heavily emphasize this narrative. Fox News host Bill O'Reilly told his viewers that:\n\n\"The facts then dictate that racial persecution really isn't the problem in Baltimore. Something else is in play. And that something else is personal behavior...These idiotic thugs who are rioting and looting are hurting their own people, and because the entire world sees pictures of blacks rampaging, all African Americans are affected...It is long past time for police agencies in America to have a no tolerance policy towards brutality on the part of officers...But it is also long past time for African-American communities across America to begin to police themselves.\"\n\nRepublican 2016 presidential candidate Rand Paul suggested that the Baltimore uprising was caused by absent black fathers:\n\n\"The thing is that really there's so many things we can talk about, it's something we talk about not in the immediate aftermath but over time: the breakdown of the family structure, the lack of fathers, the lack of sort of a moral code in our society. And this isn't just a racial thing, it goes across racial boundaries, but we do have problems in our country.\"\n\nPaul's and O'Reilly's comments are part of what is known as the Southern strategy, which was created by the Republican Party in the aftermath of the civil rights movement with the goal of using white racial resentment and anti-black and brown bias to win over white working- and middle-class voters.\n\nHowever, much more important questions will not be asked by pundits and politicians.\n\nHow are America's police pathological in their violence, racism and brutal killings of black people?\n\nAre America's police deranged in how they imagine unarmed black and brown people as some type of imminent threat to be dispatched with due haste and extreme prejudice?\n\nIs America's police culture sick and pathological in how citizens have been tortured to death, sexually assaulted and otherwise violated and abused by police officers?\n\nIf there are only a few bad apples in America's police departments, why don't the good cops throw them out en masse?\n\nAre America's police more like a street gang than public servants?\n\nIt is easy for the mainstream news media to opine and lecture about \"pathological\" black communities that are supposedly plagued by \"bad culture.\" It is far more difficult to talk about America's broken police and its culture of violence and disrespect toward non-whites and poor people that led to the killing of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, and so many other black men and women across the United States of America."

      "text": "Tucker Carlson's sending a loud and clear message to white nationalists\n\n\"Stochastic terrorism\" is the strategic repeated use of language and other means of communication intended to encourage violence while still maintaining some level of plausible deniability. The advantage of this tactic is that the individual or group that practices it can then claim innocence and accept no responsibility for the behavior of others. The most sophisticated uses of stochastic terrorism will result in a type of moral inversion - not to mention an inversion of reality - in which the aggressor can then claim they are somehow the \"real victims.\"\n\nThis has been one of the dominant strategies of the American right since at least the 1980s, with liberals, progressives, nonwhite people and other designated groups deemed to be the enemy Other targeted as \"socialists\" or \"communists,\" anti-American or anti-Christian, \"politically correct\" snowflakes, \"parasites,\" \"losers\" and \"takers,\" along with other demeaning language intended to provoke or legitimate violence.\n\nThis language both reflects political polarization in the United States and fuels it. Moreover, Democrats and Republicans are not equally polarized: Since the 1990s it is the Republican Party that has become increasingly extreme, rejecting any pretense of \"normal politics\" and seeking to undermine democracy . It now more closely resembles right-wing extremist political parties in Europe than more mainstream or \"centrist\" political organizations .\n\nThe Trump regime and its larger neofascist movement (which now includes virtually the entire Republican Party) escalated the use of stochastic terrorism to extreme levels.\n\nThe result was a record increase in hate crimes and political violence against nonwhite people, Muslims, Jews, immigrants and other targeted groups. This wave of right-wing violence and terrorism included mass shootings and other lethal actions. In the wake of the Trump regime's coup attempt and the Capitol attack , law enforcement and other experts are warning that white supremacist and other right-wing violence remains the greatest threat to America's domestic safety and security.\n\nThe spiral of escalation continues: Right-wing stochastic terrorism is increasingly being replaced by direct public threats of violence against those deemed to be \"the enemy\".\n\nLast week a host on the One America News Network (OANN), which can better be described as a right-wing propaganda outlet than a news network, appeared to endorse mass executions of Trump's enemies who supposedly tried to \"carry out a coup\" against him. By implication, the host also suggested killing Americans who voted for Joe Biden:\n\nThese are not implied threats of violence. They are direct commands to right-wing violence.\n\nHealthy democratic societies have a political culture in which public policy disputes and other disagreements are resolved without using force. What OANN and other elements of the right-wing movement desire is a form of anti-politics, where they are able to assert their will over others without consequences, and where to dissent from the right-wing agenda is a crime to be punished by violence. Ultimately, today's Republican Party and \"conservative\" movement have embraced a fascist logic in which political ideology becomes religious dogma and heretics are to be driven out.\n\nThis is just one of the many examples of how far Donald Trump normalized right-wing political violence. Granting permission for violence and other anti-social and anti-human behavior was a core element of Trump's fascist appeal for his followers. Trumpism is a political cult: Violence is one of its rites and a way of bonding the leader to the followers. To that end, the attraction to violence and the collective longing to act out violent impulses against \"enemies\" or \"outsiders\" with impunity represents a type of cathartic freedom for Trumpists and other fascists.\n\nFor stochastic terrorism and other commands to violence to achieve maximum impact, they must be repeated and reinforced by various sources in an echo chamber effect. Fox News has long been the epicenter of that echo chamber , with Tucker Carlson as one of its most powerful voices.\n\nLast Thursday, Carlson continued with his campaign to defend (white) \"civilization\" against its \"enemies\" by somehow connecting a supposed controversy about scholar Michael Eric Dyson to 19th-century pseudoscience and then to \"critical race theory\" as somehow part of a nebulous and nefarious plot to \"oppress\" white people in \"their own country.\"\n\nAt the crescendo of his performance, Carlson said this, specifically attacking Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff:\n\nThis was accompanied by an image on the screen that read \"Anti-White Mania.\"\n\nCarlson and his writers are masters of mainstreaming white supremacist talking points and narratives. Through a process known as \"narrative laundering,\" profoundly racist arguments are massaged into something more palatable for the millions of people (predominantly white) who watch his program every evening.\n\nThose who are not familiar with the white supremacist movement and its set of imaginary narratives likely did not grasp the deeper meanings and allusions that summoned by Carlson in his claims about Rwanda and \"anti-white\" violence. Most obviously, Carlson's reference to Rwanda was an attempt to invoke the inter-ethnic genocide that occurred there in the 1990s as a way of provoking racial paranoia and anxieties about the supposed possibility of \"white genocide\" in America.\n\nThrough that rhetorical move, Carlson was also directly signaling to decades-old, if not centuries-old, fears and fantasies about a \"race war\" in which white people would finally subjugate and then exterminate or exile Black and brown people, \"cleansing\" North America and Europe and driving such perceived outsiders back to their \"homelands\" in Africa or elsewhere. The not-quite-articulated result of this apocalyptic conflict would be a \"white nation\" and white global empire, also involving a second Holocaust against the Jewish people, who are viewed by white supremacists as part of a global cabal that is somehow \"controlling\" Black people to do their bidding. It is no coincidence that much of the QAnon conspiracy theory - an updated version of the \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" - is structured in a similar manner.\n\nCarlson was also channeling white supremacist obsessions with supposed large-scale anti-white violence in South Africa and Zimbabwe, especially reports of attacks by Black people against white farmers. Such incidents have been a source of compulsive fascination in the white supremacist community in recent decades.\n\nIn an effort to put Carlson's allusions to race war and genocide into broader context, I asked Texas A&M communications professor Jennifer Mercieca , an expert on rhetoric and author of \" Demagogue for President: The Rhetorical Genius of Donald Trump ,\" for her insights. She responded by email:\n\nThese threats of political violence and terrorism should not be understood as a joke, as a \"gaffe,\" as \"strong language\" or hyperbole or with some other euphemism intended to downplay their intent and meaning. Violence is one of the main weapons used by fascists in their assault on democracy. In response to these escalating threats, the Democrats, the mainstream news media, and other elites prefer to continue their set of self-delusions about a return to \"normalcy\" and a naive belief that widespread political violence cannot happen in the United States in the 21st century.\n\nMany of these elites and other influentials - like the American people at large - have been exhausted, intimidated and traumatized by the Age of Trump and its perfidy. Their response, however, is unacceptable: a state of denial about the existential threat to American democracy and society embodied by Trumpism and ascendant neofascism.\n\nDonald Trump, the Republican Party and their followers consistently, transparently and directly continue to show the world who and what they really are. Denial of this reality is not salvation. It is only a pathway to doom. Unfortunately, too many Americans are wrapping themselves in denial as if it were armor - or, more properly, a security blanket - instead of facing a worsening situation and rising to the challenge."

      "text": "A paradoxical view of Black people emerged as a defense for the killing of George Floyd\n\nIn the trial of former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin , the defense mounted a perplexing account. Mr. Floyd, we were told, had an enlarged heart and inelastic lungs. Mr. Floyd was so weak that his death was all but inevitable. Had Mr. Floyd been healthier, he might have survived the relentless pressure of a knee upon his neck. But, then, the defense's narrative seemed to change: Derek Chauvin's use of lethal force was, in fact, necessitated by Mr. Floyd's purported superhuman strength.\n\nWas Mr. Floyd so physically weak he succumbed to an innocuous use of force? Or was he so strong that restraining him required extraordinary force? One defense witness offered a unifying explanation: perhaps Mr. Floyd's terrifying strength was caused by heart disease itself. Or, perhaps, a tumor triggered a fight-or-flight response that elevated his blood pressure. In this narrative, Mr. Floyd died because his underlying fragility triggered superhuman strength which, in turn, triggered fatal weakness.\n\nIt may be tempting to attribute this illogical argument to desperation on the part of the defense. This would be a mistake. Chauvin's defense was sadly rational. The prejudice it sought to exploit is pervasive and longstanding. In American society, Black people are viewed as both preternaturally strong as well as uniquely weak.\n\nWhite people must fear Black people and use extraordinary measures to protect themselves. Except, of course, when white violence or negligence triggers Black illness or death. Then, it is the fragility that precipitates the demise of Black bodies. Either way, one thing is clear: In American consciousness, Black people can rarely be victims. This notion-that Black people are at once too strong and too weak-has deep roots in American history, beginning in slavery and continuing in modern medical racism.\n\nDuring slavery, doctors postulated that Black people were especially susceptible to Tuberculosis and malaria. That this susceptibility was produced by the conditions of slavery was not seriously considered. Rather, vulnerability to disease was identified as a feature of Blackness. Enslaved Black people were also, according to doctors, uniquely resistant to pain, even as they suffered disproportionately of all manner of disease. Doctors used these false premises-inherent medical fragility paired with pain resistance-as justifications for the use of Black bodies in horrific medical experiments, ranging from intentional infection to gynecological mutilation to the boiling of flesh. The purported frailty and strength of Black bodies made Black human beings, in the eyes of many doctors, a perfect specimen for scientific exploration.\n\nEven today, health outcomes for Black Americans, by virtually every measure, and at every stage of life, are comparatively poor. Some of this disparity can be explained by socioeconomic and environmental factors. Black people are disproportionately struck by poverty . They are more likely to live in segregated neighborhoods afflicted by pollution and nutritional deprivation . They suffer from inadequate access to healthcare . These factors matter. But they do not tell the whole story. Disparities persist even when socioeconomic or environmental differences are controlled for.\n\nIndeed, researchers are finding that racism itself is an environmental variable that crosses socioeconomic barriers and induces life-long health complications. From diabetes to reproductive care , the evidence is converging. The chronic stress of anti-Black racism, independent of other variables, ravages Black American bodies. Little is spared. From brains to kidneys to bones, Black American bodies endure trauma, misdiagnosis and neglect. These patterns begin at birth and persist until death.\n\nFor example, Black babies are less likely than white babies to have early hearing loss identified and treated . Black children are less likely to receive tubes to treat otitis media , a crucial intervention that correlates with language development . In school, Black children are under-diagnosed with ADHD and over-diagnosed with conduct disorder, compared to their white peers, even when their symptomology is similar .\n\nAs Black Americans enter adulthood, health disparities become even more stark. Black men, for instance, are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and less likely to be diagnosed with depression than their white male peers. Diagnoses of dementia-critical for early intervention-are also chronically delayed for Black Americans.\n\nRacial disparities are especially stark in reproductive outcomes. Black women are more likely to experience miscarriages, preterm birth and stillbirth when compared to white women of the same socioeconomic status . Black women are less likely to get breast cancer, but they are 43 percent more likely to die after diagnosis. Black women are also more likely to undergo hysterectomy . In cases of heart disease, Black people are less likely to receive diagnostic angiography and preventative catheterization. 1\n\nBlack people are also often blamed for health outcomes, in both subtle and overt ways. The most obvious examples are in the right-wing media, as well as in specific cases such as the criminal defense of Derek Chauvin. However, we can also see examples throughout even ostensibly unbiased sources, such as the medical literature.\n\nType II diabetes has long been blamed on the \" African American Diet .\" Differential success of diabetes treatment has been attributed to poor \" medical literacy .\" Poor medical literacy is cited as a factor in the delayed diagnosis of Black infants' hearing impairment. Note the explanatory variable of \"medical literacy\" places responsibility on Black patients, not their doctors. This is in spite of research indicating that racial disparities in doctor-patient communication results from doctors' behavior , such as reduced listening, personal interaction and devotion of time to outpatient care.\n\nThe blaming of Black people has, in some cases, extended beyond \"poor medical literacy\" or \"bad diets\" to the nature of Black bodies themselves. One literature review went so far as to state \"variation in obesity and body-fat distribution\" may be a primary factor in the late diagnosis and poor prognosis of breast cancer in Black women. Similarly, doctors have explained that the systematic late diagnosis of Lyme disease in Black people is attributable to early signs of disease being difficult to detect on dark skin, to which one Black doctor responded : Is it actually that hard to identify on Black skin, or have doctors just been exclusively trained to treat white people?\n\nAnd then, finally, we must address Black pain. Multiple studies have shown that Black patients are under-diagnosed and under-treated for pain. Black patients are less likely to receive pain treatment for almost any diagnosis, even in the case of visible physical harm, such as a broken bone. Even Black children with appendicitis are less likely to be given pain treatment than white peers are. Research has shown white medical workers endorse racist stereotypes related to pain. One study demonstrated that an astonishing number of white medical workers endorsed a variety of racist myths , such that they believed Black patients' skin is thicker and their blood coagulates more quickly. These judgments most certainly correlate with treatment decisions.\n\nThe clearest example of racial disparities in medicine is in kidney disease. Here, we can see a trajectory beginning with negligence and ending with tragedy. We all learn that Black people suffer from disproportionate rates of kidney disease. We are told this is the fault of Black Americans. But we do not learn that Black people are:\n\nLet that sink in: This country does not only deny life-saving organs to Black Americans, but we also lop off their toes, feet and legs at disproportionate rates.\n\nThe treatment of Black bodies and minds in medicine reflects broader societal biases about Black pain. Physiological research indicates that white people exhibit decreased physiological responses to the emotional and physical pain of Black people. To put this plainly: if a white person witnesses a Black person experiencing pain, their neuronal responses remain close to baselines. They sweat less. Heart rates barely budge. And, although diminished responses to Black people in pain do correlate with overt racism, they also persist in white people who score very low on cognitive measures of racism.\n\nThis history-the rejection of Black pain and dehumanization of Black bodies-was the clear pretext for the criminal defense of Derek Chauvin. Mr. Floyd was to blame for his own death, because he was weak. However, his body could also be abused, because he was so strong. Chauvin's defense team was not unreasonable to attempt this, because they must have known, intuitively, as we all know, that a Black man's body is not viewed as the same as a white man's body. That a Black man's pleas for his mother or even oxygen will never be as worthy as a white man's same suffering.\n\nThese societal biases-and the cruelty they facilitate-were clear in our country's response to COVID-19. As the pandemic struck, it became apparent that Black people would be hit especially hard. And thus the frame shifted to a constant repetition of \"Well, the only people who suffer will be those with pre-existing conditions.\"\n\nThe more we heard a right-wing refrain about diabetes, obesity, asthma and other ailments, the clearer it was: if you're Black and you die from COVID, it is your fault. We need not take extraordinary measures to protect you. The Trump administration itself admitted it was not compelled to relieve those who were not \" [their] people .\"\n\nHere, as in the murder of George Floyd, Black bodies were on trial. Black people were, again, to blame for their own suffering. In law enforcement, Black bodies induce white violence. In medicine, Black bodies deserve nothing more than white negligence.\n\nIn the case of Derek Chauvin, the defense placed George Floyd's body on trial. The jury rejected this argument in a verdict we should celebrate. But the problem is much bigger than this single case. Black bodies and minds are abused from birth until death. Before we can adopt policies that might fix the problem, we need to appreciate its scope and history. We must recognize our society characterizes Black people as too strong as well as too weak. Above all, we need to recognize our society's systematic abuse of Black bodies, and our almost pathological denial of Black victimization."

      "text": "I'm Scared That a White Person Will Shoot Me -- What If Black Men Shot First?\n\nThe Prisoner's Dilemma is one of the most written about and studied \"games\" in the social sciences. It explores how \"players\" will choose to cooperate (or not) with one another. Economists have used it to model how buyers and sellers behave in the market. Experts in international relations use the Prisoner's Dilemma to explore how state actors could potentially respond to one another in a conflict or during negotiations. Social psychologists have studied the Prisoner's Dilemma in order to model human behavior and our propensity to cooperate with or betray one another.\n\nStand Your Ground Laws, and the legal murder of young black people such as Jordan Davis and Trayvon Martin by Michael Dunn and George Zimmerman, are a \"real life\" example of the Prisoner's Dilemma in action. Do two parties with limited to no information about one another choose to cooperate, defect, engage in \"tit for tat\" retaliation, or do they attack preemptively?\n\nDunn and Zimmerman were not acting in an information vacuum: they had two important data points. Their victims were black and male. Stand Your Ground empowered Dunn and Zimmerman to shoot first and ask questions later because they knew that the law would legitimate their murderous deeds.\n\nIn thinking through the Prisoner's Dilemma, there is an additional implication of the use of Stand Your Ground laws by white people (and those overly identified with Whiteness and White Authority). Should black and brown people, men in particular, apply a similar standard, acting preemptively based on the learned assumption that they will likely be shot dead by white men who claim \"self-defense\"?\n\nStand Your Ground laws have created a feedback loop of escalating violence .\n\nTo point.\n\nAs a black man living in the aftermath of the Dunn and Zimmerman trials (and the data suggesting the racial bias of Stand Your Ground in practice), I am afraid that a white person will use said defense to \"reasonably\" decide to shoot me because of the color of my skin. A rational actor who is a person of color would choose preemption and \"winning\" the \"game\" over \"losing\" and being shot dead.\n\nThere is a very limited issue space in the mainstream news media. The approved discourse does not include any acknowledgment of how black and brown people should for reasons both historic and contemporary be terrified of white violence. Whiteness imagines itself as neutral and benign. Consequently, white privilege blinds most white folks of the ability to critically self-reflect on such matters.\n\nAnd because the mainstream media operates through, and is empowered by the white racial frame, it is unlikely--if not impossible--that it will entertain the following and obvious question: Should black people be reasonably afraid of white people given Stand Your Ground laws and a frightening rise in white racial animus and hostility in the Age of Obama?\n\nThe mainstream media will most certainly not ask if black men, when faced with a threatening situation across the colorline, should shoot white people first under the reasonable assumption that the latter means them serious harm under the Stand Your Ground laws.\n\nDuring the Black Freedom Struggle's counter-insurgency campaign against Jim and Jane Crow and American Apartheid, there was a group of men known as the Deacons for Defense and Justice . These African-American military veterans provided armed security for Freedom Riders and other civil rights activists. They made it clear that they would shoot back if fired upon by white racial terrorists and their allies.\n\nStand Your Ground laws will force African-Americans to make a similar pronouncement if we are to be safe and secure in our person from white vigilantism. Such a claim would not be \"black racism\" or \"reverse racism\" as Right-wing bloviators and race-baiters would inevitably crow and announce to their low-information, propagandized, public.\n\nSelf-defense is in keeping with the basic citizenship rights of all Americans, in a liberal democratic polity, and can be traced back to the writings of the Framers, as well as foundational political philosophers such as Locke, Hobbes, Burke.\n\nStand Your Ground Laws, the concealed and open carry of weapons, and the court's protection of white street vigilantes are creating an explosive mix where civic virtue, self-interest, and common sense demand that people of color win the Prisoner's Dilemma of their lives by acting preemptively.\n\nBlack self-defense is the inevitable result of white violence. Ultimately, Stand Your Ground laws may have a consequence that is very different from the one imagined by its supporters on the White Right."

      "text": "Bill O'Reilly's Making This Up: His Latest Racial Bloviating Is Just Plain Fiction\n\nFrom the end of the Civil War to the first few decades of the 20th century, white mobs killed many thousands of black Americans across the United States.\n\nWhite newspapers played a key role in encouraging white mob violence, racial pogroms, and other acts of white racial terrorism.\n\nFor example, in 1906, Atlanta's newspapers incited anti-black violence with stories and headlines such as:\n\n\"Extra! Third Assault on White Woman by a Negro Brute!\"\n\n\"Extra! Bold Negro Kisses White Girl's Hand!\"\n\n'Extra! Bright Mulatto Insults White Girls!\"\n\n\"Vigorous Appeal for White Supremacy\"\n\nPriming the white residents of Atlanta to kill black people en masse, these newspapers also including demands for vigilante justice:\n\n\"Men of Fulton, what will you do to stop these outrages against the women? ... Shall these black devils be permitted to assault and almost kill our women, and go unpunished?\"\n\nIf transported to an earlier era, Fox News' Bill O'Reilly would have been a perfect fit for such publications.\n\nOn Wednesday's edition of his show, O'Reilly drew inspiration from his racist journalism ancestors when he sounded the cries of alarm about \"a violent subculture in the African-American community that should be exposed and confronted\":\n\nFirst, the stats, and they are stunning. Since the Ferguson chaos, murders in the USA's 15 largest cities are up close to 17 percent. And much higher in cities with large black populations. In Chicago, for example, this year alone, shootings up around 80 percent.. Why? Because Chicago police have stopped stopping suspicious people.\n\nSo-called pedestrians stops are down 90 percent in the windy city. When you fail to police people proactively, people commit more crimes. The media will not spotlight that much of the violent crime in America is being committed right now by young black men. In fact, Black males between the ages of 14 and 17 commit homicide at a rate 10 times higher than White and Hispanic male teenagers combined. And Blacks of all ages commit homicide at a rate of eight times higher than Whites and Hispanics combined.\n\nConclusion? There is a violent subculture in the African-American community that should be exposed and confronted. Enter the Black Lives Matter crew which roams around the country promoting a false narrative that American police officers are actively hunting down and killing blacks. Here's the truth. Police shot Whites at a rate of 50 percent in 2015. Police shot blacks at a rate of 26 percent. In addition, Black Lives Matter is now infringing on freedom of assembly and freedom of expression...\n\nSo, summing up, thousands more Americans are being murdered because police are being more passive. Since the Ferguson situation and the Black Lives Matter protests. Talking Points believes every American should know that, should know the truth. Sympathetic media and many race hustlers are backing Black Lives Matter and the final indignity, members of the group have even been invited to the White House. And that's \"The Memo.\"\n\nInstead of fears and rumors of \"negro uprisings\" and \"black beast rapists\", O'Reilly has chosen to focus on the imagined bogeyman \"Black Lives Matter.\"\n\nThis is not the first time that Bill O'Reilly has trafficked in anti-black animus. Scaring the viewers of Fox News with tales of black thuggery and anti-white violence is central to his gimmick and shtick.\n\nOf course, Bill O'Reilly's claim that \"Black Lives Matter\" is \"killing\" \"Americans\" is fantastical and untrue. His \"logic\" is desperate and bizarre: he conflates black college students protesting a conservative propagandist with street violence by drug dealers and gang members. And based on his use of \"statistics\" about \"black crime,\" it is also apparent that Bill O'Reilly does not understand the difference between correlation and causation.\n\nIn all, O'Reilly most recent act of racist bloviating is a hodgepodge of white supremacist talking points and fictions pulled from the Right-wing \"news\" echo chamber. It is also proof of the harm that white racial paranoiac thinking can do to both a person's understanding of empirical reality and personal ethics.\n\nBill O'Reilly's fixation on Black Lives Matter is based on a belief that it is a violent organization. In reality, Black Lives Matter is a loose umbrella coalition of individuals of all colors who believe that police thuggery and other state sponsored abuse and killings of African-Americans must end. Based on their own statements and other material, the Black Lives Matter movement rejects violence.\n\nO'Reilly's argument on Wednesday's edition of his TV show pivots on a belief in the \"Ferguson effect\". This is the erroneous idea that the uprising against a racist and out of control police force in Ferguson, Missouri, one that was operating a de facto debt peonage collection racket against the black community in that area, has spread across America and has made the country's police afraid to do their jobs. Of course, there is no such data to support such an assertion ; the claim of a so-called Ferguson effect has been repeatedly exposed by criminologists and other experts as a lie . If anything, America's police are refusing to do their jobs in an act of protest against being held to be basic standards of professional accountability.\n\nThere is a deeper ugliness in O'Reilly's and other members of the Right-wing news disinformation entertainment media's fixation on the \"Ferguson effect.\" It is based on a belief that America's police are unable to do their jobs properly unless they can beat, abuse, harass, and kill African-Americans and other people of color with impunity. In this worldview, black and brown Americans are not allowed the same civil liberties and constitutionally protected rights as white people. This is the logic of the infamous Dred Scott decision and Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney's decision that \"black people \"have no rights that the white man is bound to respect\" into the Age of Obama.\n\nBill O'Reilly's claims about a dramatic increase in \"black crime\" as spurned on by \"Black Lives Matter\" represent a failure in inference. There is no evidence of the \"Ferguson effect\". Consequently, his basic causal claim is incorrect.\n\nHis worries and panic about \"black crime\" and \"black violence\" lacks context and are simply a recycling of white supremacist talking points that embody the Right-wing shift from outright bigotry rooted in old fashioned claims of black biological inferiority to the more modern argument that African-Americans possess \"bad culture.\"\n\nMost importantly, violent crime in the United States is at record lows. If there has been an increase in violent crime in America's central cities it is likely caused by a seasonal cycle where warmer months bring more people on the streets and into contract with one another.\n\nIn his effort to gin up a panic about \"black crime\", O'Reilly conveniently ignores how most crime in the United States is intraracial. This is a function of segregation and racially homogeneous social and other inter-personal networks. Moreover, most violent crime is committed by a relative, friend, or acquaintance.\n\nBill O'Reilly enthusiastically recites statistics about \"violent\" \"black men\".\n\nIt is a given that O'Reilly also does not include how the vast majority of blacks are incarcerated for non-violent drug offenses. He also does not comment on how black and brown Americans (as well as people who live in working class and poor communities, more broadly) are subjected to \"over-policing\" which inflates arrest rates as compared to whites, and racist sentencing practices where blacks and Latinos are punished more severely than whites for the same crimes.\n\nO'Reilly's racist screed about a war on \"good\" and \"law-abiding\" (white) Americans by \"black criminals\" also conveniently ignores that a very small percentage of black people will ever commit a violent crime. As professor Jody Armour argues in his book Negrophobia, O'Reilly and other Right-wing \"black crime\" provocateurs and hate merchants willfully choose to not understand that one cannot generalize from aggregate data to make reliable predictions about the probability that a given person-in this case an African-American-will commit a criminal act.\n\nUltimately, social scientists and other researches have repeatedly demonstrated that in these discussions of \"black crime,\" race is just a proxy variable for poverty, housing segregation, income and wealth disparities, broken schools, and other social dynamics. When those problems are alleviated, the life chances and outcomes of black Americans vastly improve and thus become much more similar to those of white families in the same economic cohort.\n\nThere is a base hypocrisy in Bill O'Reilly and other conservatives feigned concerns about bad \"black culture\" in the United States' \"inner cities\": the Republican Party and the White Right have no interest in fixing America's broken social safety net, fighting racial discrimination in housing and jobs, correcting income and wealth inequality, restricting easy access to guns, confronting the problem of mass incarceration, or stopping the War on Drugs through legalization.\n\nUnpacking Bill O'Reilly's efforts to incite a Jim and Jane Crow style white racial panic (and yes, preemptive violence) against black Americans points to an uncomfortable truth that Bill O'Reilly and other white conservatives are loathe to publicly discuss.\n\nAs I have written about repeatedly here at Salon, there are whole categories of crime such as right-wing domestic terrorism, treason, cannibalistic serial killing, and spree shootings in high schools and other places that are dominated by white men and boys.\n\nIf Bill O'Reilly is really concerned about crimes that are killing the American people, many more people have been harmed and had their lives stolen both directly and indirectly by the actions of huge corporations and the banking and financier class-a group that is almost exclusively comprised of white men-than by \"Black Lives Matter\" or \"black crime.\" While the American corporate news media is momentarily fixated on what it has identified as a \"trend\" of white suffering and the deaths of despair (suicide; drug and alcohol abuse; opiate addiction) among the \"white working class\" it has, of course, failed to discuss how it is white men who have created this perilous situation and not black Americans or other people of color.\n\nIf there is a \"culture\" that is \"killing\" Americans, it is one that on a macro and elite level is led, created, and directed by a group of people who look like Bill O'Reilly.\n\nFox News and Bill O'Reilly most certainly will not do a feature on that problem."

      "text": "Historian explains the choice facing white Americans: Social democracy - or follow Trump into the abyss\n\nDonald Trump's coup attempt - and especially the Jan. 6 attack he incited on the U.S. Capitol - were a type of \"white riot\" and insurrection against multiracial democracy. Sociologist Bart Bonikowski recently offered this analysis to Thomas Edsall of the New York Times:\n\nThe lethal violence by Trump's followers at the Capitol was not the end but rather another stage of escalation in right-wing extremism and terrorism against multiracial democracy . Law enforcement officials and counter-insurgency experts are warning that the United States will likely experience an increasing amount of white supremacist and other right-wing extremist terrorism and other political violence in response to the country's changing racial demographics. The symbolic power of Joe Biden's presidency, and especially of Kamala Harris, the first woman, first Black person and first Asian American to serve as vice president, will only fuel more right-wing terrorism and other violence.\n\nTrump's neofascist movement has given permission for such violence, and has provided a space for radicalization into political extremism as well as the material and other resources to sustain an armed insurrection against American democracy. Trump has signaled that he hopes to be a \"shadow president\" commanding this movement through stochastic terrorism.\n\nIn total, the power of Donald Trump's appeals to white supremacy, racial authoritarianism , white victimhood and white violence were so powerful for his voters and other followers that despite a ruined economy and a pandemic that has already killed more than 440,000 people in the United States, Trump received millions more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016.\n\nThe rise of Trumpism and its enduring appeal for tens of millions of white Americans also reflects a phenomenon described by social scientists and other researchers: Many people in that population feel a growing sense of alienation and loneliness as well as feelings of obsolescence and declining social value. This gives rise to widespread resentment, a disregard for death (and in some cases a literal death wish) and an increasing attraction to conspiracy theories, fantasies of violence, apocalyptic right-wing Christian extremism and other anti-social values and beliefs among Trump's followers and other white Americans.\n\nWhiteness appears to be in a state of crisis. To discuss that dynamic, I recently spoke with David Roediger, a professor of history and American studies at the University of Kansas. He is the author of such notable books as \" Working Toward Whiteness ,\" \" How Race Survived U.S. History \" and \" Towards the Abolition of Whiteness .\" His new book is \" The Sinking Middle Class: A Political History .\"\n\nIn this conversation, Roediger explores the perils of increased public focus on the \"white working class\" and why that language should be used much more carefully. He also addresses such questions as how public discussions about \"structural racism\" often distort and misrepresent the concept and its implications, and what many liberals and leftists misunderstand about the relationship between race and class.\n\nAt the end of this conversation Roediger warns that white America may be at a historical crossroads, facing a choice between embracing a more inclusive social democracy or instead becoming more reactionary and dangerous.\n\nThis conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nHow are you feeling?\n\nHopeful, in a way. The George Floyd rebellions, which were some of the largest sustained protests in the history of the United States, really changed things in some fundamental ways. On that note, I believe that we could have thought differently about the Trump administration. We could have had a strategy that envisioned bringing Trump down through popular protests. In most European countries, a figure such as Donald Trump would have been protested out of office as much as he was voted out of office, and earlier probably.\n\nLanguage does political work. It shapes reality and the limits of our collective imaginations, and how we think about political society and our role in it. For example, in the Age of Trump, and especially in the moment of the George Floyd uprising, there were more public discussions of \"structural\" or \"institutional racism.\" Joe Biden is also using this language. I worry that most people, both in the news media and on the day-to-day, do not have a real understanding of what those words mean in practice.\n\nStructural racism is a very important concept, but it is now becoming an empty signifier. I believe that it is very hard to know what politicians mean when they say \"structural racism.\" And to hear police departments and law enforcement talking about structural racism particularly begs for a serious discussion of the concept as related to redress of grievances. The structures in this country are such that white working people have learned that their racist claims and desires will be listened to. Black people have learned that those white working people have to be placated in their racism or Democrats cannot be elected. If there can be a change where poor whites can be brought together in an alliance with antiracism, that would be an interesting moment.\n\n\"Working class\" is a term that has come to dominate American political discourse during the Trump regime and now beyond. But it is emptied of all content and meaning. \"Working class\" is too often used in a superficial race- and gender-neutral way by the mainstream news media and other political elites. In many ways, \"working class\" is just another way of saying \"white men.\" That assumption is so deep it goes unremarked upon by most.\n\nTo talk about the \"white working class\" is really to fight on the terrain that the likes of a Trump or a Steve Bannon or Breitbart could occupy.\n\nIf one goes down the road of talking about the \"white working class,\" inevitably the emphasis ends up on \"white.\" With the Bannons and Trumps that \"white\" is emphasized, as in the full-blown white nationalism that they gravitate towards.\n\nEven with the Democrats there is an emphasis on the \"white\" in \"white working class,\" because they do not have anything as a party to offer in terms of class or the specifics of trade policy that would actually appeal to the people in Macomb County, Michigan. The Democrats are not for trade union rights in any fundamental way. The Democrats are not for reorganizing the working class. The Democrats are very much in favor of disastrous trade deals such as NAFTA.\n\nWhen political leaders and pundits say \"middle class\" they mean the white middle class - what is imagined to be the middle of the class structure. But for African Americans, the 50th percentile has about one-ninth of the wealth of the middle of the white class structure.\n\nThe term \"middle class\" obscures racial differences and related inequalities. I believe this has been true since at least the 1980s. Some of us on the left are implicated in this too, because there is a kind of left politics that argues, \"Oh, we should advance these middle-class economic demands, which in turn would mean we do not have to talk about race so much. Our economic agenda helps everyone, so we can avoid these challenging conversations about race\".\n\nThese types of approaches to class and race in America mean that there is very little space in the public discourse to seriously consider what would bring poor people together across the color line, while also being attentive to the specific grievances that African Americans and immigrants have in the United States.\n\nRace and class should not be discussed as being separate and apart from one another in America, or the West more generally. Where do you think the impulse to talk in simple terms, to decouple the two concepts, comes from?\n\nFor some of us who are materialists and apply Marxist analyses, part of our worst impulses are when we argue that class concerns should submerge concerns about racial justice.\n\nFor all his experience with the Black Freedom Struggle, there have been too many moments when Bernie Sanders was also guilty of that type of class reductionism.\n\nThe fact that the Sanders 2016 campaign introduced the word \"socialism\" into the national vocabulary was a big achievement. Given that, many people were willing to allow certain problems to go uncommented upon. In 2020, it seemed to me that Bernie Sanders had been given better advice about how to talk about race.\n\nI believe that Sanders was most comfortable in both 2016 and 2020 speaking about things that are important for Black and brown people in the United States such as Medicare for All. Sanders was also advocating economic policies that did not have a specifically important racial dimension to them, such as college tuition for all.\n\nSystems of white supremacy and white racism also hurt white people. How can we do a better job of explaining that to white folks?\n\nThe willingness to accept dehumanization never ends at the color line. As an example, America's prison system is essentially an extension of Jim Crow that disproportionately targets young Black men. But that same system, from the 1980s forward also vastly increased the number of white people who are incarcerated. Using America's Jim Crow prison system as an example, we can highlight the racism at work there against black men - but then, at the same time, call attention to how white people, in particular poor white people, are also being hurt by mass incarceration. Another example is how the number of white women incarcerated has gone through the roof in the same period.\n\nHow do you think whiteness is doing at present in America?\n\nA majority of whites in the United States still support Trump. We often get confused by these extraordinarily close elections. In fact, these elections are so close because African Americans vote overwhelmingly for the Democratic candidate. The same is true for Latinos and Hispanics. This gives the appearance that there is all this resistance against Trump and what he represents, but in reality white Americans are generally supportive of him. We do not gain much in this country by denying that fact.\n\nThese political and cultural problems have been going on for a long time in white America. Those problems continued and maybe even accelerated under Donald Trump.\n\nMoreover, there are huge numbers of eligible voters who do not participate. Poor people are much less likely to vote. There is something wrong with America's culture and politics that is larger than Donald Trump.\n\nAn example of the many problems in white America - not exclusively found among the so-called white working class - is shown through the response to COVID and refusing to wear a mask. This a literal embrace of death by large numbers of white people in America. The mindless embrace of death by refusing to wear a mask also represents a type of widespread malaise.\n\nThere is much evidence of this from the studies about the opioid crisis and the so-called deaths of despair among certain segments of the white public. In total, that data and other examples point to a type of psychological emergency among some whites.\n\nIs whiteness in some form of crisis as shown by the Age of Trump, which was at its core a white supremacist and neofascist backlash against multiracial democracy?\n\nI do not subscribe to the argument that in the next few decades white people will somehow not be the largest group and that therefore means the end of whiteness as we know it in America.\n\nAt present there is a re-examination of the assumptions that undergird whiteness in America. That could result in a type of social democracy, or whiteness could be refurbished by admitting into its ranks groups who are now considered \"people of color.\" There are real possibilities of a reactionary move as well.\n\nWhat is a crisis? Something that we do not know where it leads. Lots of white Americans are experiencing such a crisis.\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nView Non-AMP Version"

      "text": "What Is a Black Professor in America Allowed to Say?\n\nOne Thursday morning in May, Tommy J Curry walked through the offices of the philosophy department at Texas A&M University with a police officer at his side and violence on his mind. The threats had started a few days earlier. \"Since you said white people need to be killed I'm in fear of my life,\" one person had written via email. \"The next time I see you on campus I might just have to pre-emptively defend myself you dumb fat nigger. You are done.\" Curry didn't know if that person was lurking on the university grounds. But Texas is a gun-friendly state, and Texas A&M is a gun-friendly campus, and he took the threat seriously.\n\nCurry supports the right to bear arms. It was part of how he ended up in this situation. In 2012 he had appeared on a satellite radio show and delivered a five-minute talk on how uneasy white people are with the idea of black people talking about owning guns and using them to combat racist forces. When a recording of the talk resurfaced in May, people thought the tenured professor was telling black people to kill white people. This idea swept through conservative media and into the fever swamps of Reddit forums and racist message boards. The threats followed.\n\nAnonymous bigots weren't the only ones making Curry feel unwanted. Michael K Young, the president of Texas A&M, had called the professor's comments \"disturbing\" and contrary to the values of the university. Curry was taken aback. His remarks on the radio were not a regrettable slip of the tongue. They were part of why the university had hired him.\n\nA police officer met Curry inside his academic building and rode with him in the elevator to the philosophy department, on the third floor. In a hallway, the professor pointed to photos of his graduate students so the police officer would know who was supposed to be there. The officer told him to keep an eye out for unfamiliar faces. Curry picked up his mail. There were a few angry letters, and also an envelope marked with a Texas A&M logo. He put the hate mail into a folder and carried the whole bundle downstairs. Back in the car with his wife, he opened the university envelope. Inside was a copy of a letter from a campus official that he had received a few days earlier by email - before his inbox was flooded with racist messages.\n\n\"I am delighted to offer my congratulations on your promotion to Professor at Texas A&M University effective September 1, 2017,\" said the letter. \"This measure of your achievement is an indicator of the very high esteem in which you are held by your peers. We are honored to have you on our faculty.\"\n\nAs the car pulled away from the campus, Curry reread the letter and rolled his eyes. He has not been back since.\n\nThe drama that unfolded at Texas A&M is about a scholar who was welcomed by a public university because of his unusual perspective, and who became estranged from the university for the same reason. It is a story about what a university values, how it expresses those values under pressure, and how that pressure works. It is about freedom and control, reason and fear, good faith and bad. Mostly, it is a story about a black man in America who did exactly what he said he set out to do, and who became a cautionary tale.\n\nIt starts in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where Curry grew up in the 1980s and 90s. His family lived in a mostly black neighbourhood on the east side of the city. The white folks lived on the other side of the highway. At the Woolworth store downtown, he saw the faded outline of letters that remained visible on the window glass: \"No Coloreds\". Curry's father sold insurance. He told his son stories about how white people used to break into black people's homes and terrorise them. The family kept a shotgun behind the couch, and Tommy Sr owned a pistol as well. \"He constantly told us that there is a very real threat of white violence,\" said Curry. \"The idea of black people having a right to defend themselves is just something I grew up with.\"\n\nHis mother, a social worker, told him to arm himself with an education. Curry was a serious child who hoarded information. He joined his high school's debate team, where he learned how to arrange information into arguments and recite them at breakneck speed. He became accustomed to being the only black voice in the room, although he occasionally met other black boys in the debating scene. One was Rob Redding, a preacher's son from Atlanta who was going to college in Lake Charles. Redding, who was a few years older, was struck by the high-schooler's confidence. \"I remember him coming to the debate room, and a lot of people thinking he was very bright, but maybe a little too self-confident, too self-assured,\" said Redding. \"Even some black people, who should know better, would think he was too cocky.\"\n\nCurry used debate scholarships to attend Southern Illinois University, where he won an award for his prowess as a cross-examiner. After getting his master's degree in Chicago, he went back to Southern Illinois to work on a doctorate in philosophy. He showed little deference to the canon, often challenging the universal claims that western philosophers made in their work. That annoyed a lot of people in the department, but Curry's adviser, Kenneth Stikkers, considered Curry a model student who \"inhaled\" the texts he recommended, reading them closely even if he disagreed with them. \"It was always a delight when he'd come to see me,\" said Stikkers, \"because I was always going to learn something.\"\n\nStikkers, who is white, understood that not everybody would find Curry's iconoclasm as energising as he did. Philosophers consider themselves open-minded, he said, but the department was still a white neighbourhood with expectations of how a black guest should behave. Curry was not interested in playing that game. In comments on Curry's papers, Stikkers found himself repeating a refrain: \"Don't unnecessarily antagonise your audience.\" Curry's patience for that advice was limited. \"He would say at times that he liked nothing more than pissing white people off,\" said Stikkers. \"I think he did get a certain thrill from that.\"\n\nIn 2004, while Curry was studying at Southern Illinois, the people of that state elected a young, mixed-race law professor to the US Senate. Liberals at the university had high hopes for Barack Obama as a unifying political figure, and a symbol of how far US race relations had come. Curry did not share their optimism. In the days after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, he heard that the police had opened fire on a group of unarmed black families on the Danziger Bridge in New Orleans. It would take years for courts to determine the guilt of the officers , but Curry didn't need an official judgment to convince him it was true. The aftermath of the hurricane bolstered his belief that anti-black racism in the US was a storm that would never end.\n\n\"The evidence of the last 50 years has convincingly demonstrated the failure of multicultural coalitions, civil rights legislation and integration,\" he wrote in a 2007 paper . \"The current task of radical Black thought now rests in the development of alternatives in light of this disappointment.\" Those alternatives might include violence: \"Historically, the use of violence has been a serious option in the liberation of African people from the cultural tyranny of whiteness,\" he wrote, \"and should again be investigated as a plausible and in some sense necessary political option.\"\n\nIt was a provocative thesis, and Curry knew it. He did not consider himself a violent person. Even when he was a teenage socialist, his revolutionary vision had been passive: white capitalism would collapse under its own weight, and black unionists would help build a more egalitarian society in its ruins. Anyway, philosophy was supposed to be about asking hard questions without fear or prejudice, and Curry was not interested in steering clear of topics just because they made his white colleagues uneasy.\n\nStikkers urged him to pre-emptively defend himself against charges that he wanted to incite violence. In the paper, Curry explained that he wanted to raise violent resistance in the context of US racism \"not as a call to arms, but as an open-ended political question\". Still, the young philosopher knew he was treading on dangerous ground. \"To some,\" he wrote, \"for a black scholar to even ask if violence should be used to combat racism is a career faux pas.\"\n\nThe paper was published in Radical Philosophy Today, and Curry put it on his curriculum vitae . Two years later, he earned his doctorate from Southern Illinois, and Texas A&M brought him on as a \"diversity hire\", he said. The university's philosophy department, like philosophy departments everywhere, was all white. \"They sold it to me based on the idea that they were trying to change,\" he said.\n\nBlack philosophers are rare in academe. In 2013 a study counted 141 black professors, instructors and graduate students working at US colleges, accounting for about 1% of the field. At Texas A&M, Curry turned heads almost immediately. In 2010 he taught a course that used hip-hop as a lens for philosophical ideas. The rapper 50 Cent was on the syllabus alongside Thomas Hobbes.\n\nCurry didn't want to confine his teaching to the classroom. In 2012 he reconnected with Redding, the acquaintance from his debating days in Lake Charles, who had gone on to become a radio host. His show, the Redding News Review, played online and was broadcast in several cities. Redding began featuring Curry in a segment called Talking Tough With Tommy . Every Thursday the professor would call in and lecture about race, fear and complacency during the Obama years. He warned listeners of what might happen as white America began to feel the levers of power slipping from its grasp. \"We despise black people who are pessimistic about the political situation,\" he said in one episode, \"as if history hasn't already borne out what happens when black people make progress, even if it's illusory.\"\n\nEarlier that year, grim news from a Florida suburb had reminded the nation of how precarious the political situation was, no matter who was in the White House. Trayvon Martin , an unarmed black teenager, had been stalked and killed in a gated community where his father's girlfriend lived. George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer, had seen Martin and assumed he was up to no good. He grabbed his gun and followed Martin. There was a confrontation. Martin broke Zimmerman's nose and injured the back of his head; Zimmerman then shot Martin in the chest. The case brought attention to \"stand-your-ground\" laws , which gave the residents of some states, including Florida, the right to use lethal force rather than retreat if they fear they might be in serious danger. (In court, Zimmerman was later acquitted.)\n\nThat December, Django Unchained was released in cinemas. The film starred Jamie Foxx as a black gunslinger in the antebellum south who frees his wife and murders her white slavers. In a Saturday Night Live monologue, Foxx joked about how great it was that he got to \"kill all the white people in the movie\", prompting some white pundits to accuse him of racism.\n\nCurry made plans to talk about Django on Redding's show. He wanted to place the film in the context of Nat Turner's slave revolt of 1831, the writings of the civil rights leader Robert F Williams, and the history of black people taking up arms. Once again, conjuring visions of black-on-white violence would be risky. The audience this time was not just the subscribers of Radical Philosophy Today. Curry's words would go out on the public airwaves and the internet. \"He knew that saying that would be controversial,\" said Redding. They decided the professor should focus on self-defence.\n\nWhen it came time to record the segment, Curry spoke without a script. \"When we have this conversation about violence or killing white people, it has to be looked at in these kinds of historical terms,\" he said. \"And the fact that we've had no one address, like, how relevant and how solidified this kind of tradition is, for black people saying, 'Look, in order to be equal, in order to be liberated, some white people may have to die.' I've just been immensely disappointed, because what we look at, week after week, is national catastrophe after catastrophe where black people, black children, are still dying.\"\n\nWhite conservatives speak reverently of gun rights, said Curry. \"But when we turn the conversation back and say, 'Does the black community ever need to own guns? Does the black community have a need to protect itself? Does the black individual have a need to protect himself from police officers?', we don't have that conversation at all.\"\n\nThe segment aired, and nothing happened. Redding posted Curry's piece on YouTube in December 2012 with the title \"Dr. Tommy Curry on killing whites\", then forgot about it.\n\nUntil Rod Dreher found it.\n\nDreher, too, is from Louisiana. Born 12 years before Curry, he grew up in St Francisville, a small town 160 miles north-east of Lake Charles. Only a few years before he was born, white vigilantes there had stalked and terrorised black men who had tried to register to vote in the town. In 1963, a tenant farmer named James Payne told a justice department official that a white mob had showed up at his house a day later. The intruders disarmed him, threatened to burn his family alive, and fired a bullet from his own pistol into the ground between his legs.\n\nDreher had a fling with progressive politics during his college years, at Louisiana State University, but his ideology took a right turn and he moved to the north-east, where he became a writer, cultivating an urbane Christian conservatism. Personal experience made him wary of vigilantism. In a 2001 column for the New York Post, Dreher bemoaned an elaborate funeral procession that black mourners had arranged for Aaliyah , the 22-year-old R&B artist who had died in a plane crash. \"A traffic-snarling, horse-drawn cortege in honor of a pop singer most people have never heard of?\" he wrote. \"Give us a break!\"\n\nDreher has vivid memories of what happened next. Callers flooded his voice mailbox with messages. They cursed him out, hurled antisemitic slurs (Dreher was raised Methodist and had converted to Catholicism), called him racist and said he should be fired. All of the callers had \"black accents\", he later recalled. Dreher tried to brush it off. He recorded a cheeky voicemail greeting that instructed his critics to press 1 to leave a death threat, 2 to leave a bomb threat, 3 to get him fired, and so on. Still, the outrage scared him. \"Every time a black man got within 10 feet of me, I thought: 'Could this be one of the people who made the death threat?'\" he wrote in a blogpost years later.\n\nDreher came to regret the Aaliyah column, admitting that it was \"insensitive\", but he nevertheless saw himself as a victim of racial venom coursing through parochial networks. He blamed black radio hosts for using their influence to mark him as the enemy of a race. He eventually moved back to Louisiana and cultivated an online following as a blogger for The American Conservative magazine. His take on the Trayvon Martin case was that Martin had \"overreacted\" to Zimmerman confronting him with a gun, and that black people had overreacted to Zimmerman's just acquittal. Dreher didn't see Django Unchained, he said, because revenge fantasies were corrupting. His audience eventually grew to about a million readers a month.\n\nBy the time Dreher learned about Curry earlier this year, he was writing regularly about campus politics, which he thought had grown more toxic since he was in college. The racial terrorism of the 1960s was in the past, as far as he was concerned, but the \"social-justice warriors\" remained on the warpath. Worse, college administrators indulged those students' petty outrages.\n\nIn spring, a reader sent Dreher an email, telling him that a black professor at Texas A&M was saying racist things about white people, and the university was letting it happen. (The tipster used a pseudonym, according to Dreher, but he guessed it was a student.) He Googled Curry and soon found the \"killing white people\" YouTube clip that Redding had posted. He also found the professor's 2007 paper on \"violence against whiteness\". To his ears, Curry sounded like a bully. \"That rat-a-tat-tat way of talking reminded me of people I've encountered in the past who are so busy talking at you that they don't actually listen,\" said Dreher. \"He reminded me of political and religious extremists I've run across in my life in that way. That stuff sets me on edge.\"\n\nSo he decided to expose Curry on his blog. Dreher embedded the YouTube clip and quoted from other radio appearances in which the professor had talked about how white people would never voluntarily surrender their advantages. \"What does any of this racist bilge mean?\" wrote Dreher . \"To prove his own human worth to Tommy Curry, a white person has to despise himself? Good luck with that, Tommy Curry.\"\n\nHe published it on Monday 8 May at 8.30am.\n\nDreher's post sent the professor's words racing across a network primed for racial outrage. The internet's rightwing news belt had expanded during the Obama presidency. Websites such as Infowars and Breitbart , once on the fringe, had found a champion in Donald Trump, who seemed passionate about defending white America's borders and voting rolls from usurpers such as Muslim refugees, undocumented Latinos and poor blacks.\n\nOne of the first online hubs to notice Dreher's article about Curry was a Reddit forum devoted to the lionisation of President Trump. \"'When Is It OK To Kill Whites?'\" somebody wrote there, posting a link to Dreher's article on The American Conservative. \"THE HELL?!?! This guy teaches at Texas A&M!! Liberalism at Universities as [sic] gotten completely out of hand!!\" Cristina Laila, a writer for The Gateway Pundit , a blog devoted to exposing \"the wickedness of the left\", also saw Dreher's post about Curry. \"This is more proof that rasicsm [sic] is ok,\" she wrote, \"as long as the attacks are against whites.\"\n\nInfowars was next. Then, on 10 May, somebody posted a link on the neo-Nazi website Stormfront. Some of the people who responded seemed to welcome the thought of a race war. They liked their chances. \"My West Point and 82nd Airborne cousins are more than happy to accommodate those of us who may need a little help in just such an emergency,\" wrote one person. \"So please, oh pretty please, do TRY to initiate hostilities sooner rather than later.\"\n\nCurry had succeeded in getting people across the country to talk about racial violence in the name of self-defence. Now they were talking about how Texas A&M University needed to defend itself from Curry. To hundreds of people on the forums of TexAgs, an A&M community site, the answer was clear. \"Can we not fire him?\" wrote one person. \"What an embarrassment to Texas A&M,\" wrote another. \"Waiting on a response from President Young, knowing it will never come.\"\n\nMichael Young, a lawyer, was hired to run Texas A&M in 2015 after a four-year stint as president of the University of Washington. At his new university, Young had swiftly earned a reputation as an able navigator of public-relations crises relating to racism. In 2016, white students had taunted a group of black and Latino high-school students who were visiting the campus from a Dallas preparatory school. One A&M student reportedly asked the prospective students what they thought of her Confederate flag earrings; other students told the high-school visitors to go back where they came from.\n\nYoung responded by announcing an investigation and then travelling to Dallas to personally apologise to the students who had been harassed. He was later praised widely for making a heartfelt response without rushing to judgment.\n\n\"Kneejerk responses have to be avoided at all costs,\" Young said a few weeks after the incident. The key to beating the outrage machine, he said, is to know exactly what your university stands for. If you do that, \"even if it doesn't play out the way the Twitter world initially thinks it should, you never have to back away or apologise\".\n\nTexas A&M officials quickly realised that Dreher's article might become a problem. Amy Smith, senior vice president for marketing and communications, advised the head of the philosophy department, Theodore George, on how to respond to inquiries about Curry. \"Barring direct threats by him to others, Dr Curry has a first-amendment right to offer his personal views on this subject,\" she advised him to say, \"no matter how incendiary and inappropriate others may consider them to be.\"\n\nIt soon became clear that would not be enough.\n\nEven before Curry's comments were covered in the mainstream press, Porter Garner III, head of the Texas A&M Association of Former Students, an influential fundraising body, began receiving angry calls from donors. They thought Curry was encouraging violence against white people. Many of the callers might not have been \"fully informed\" of the context of Curry's words, said Garner, but some of them were longtime donors, volunteers, and friends of the university, and their concerns were \"pretty rational\" and \"very respectful\".\n\nYoung said he disagreed with the idea that Curry was inciting violence. But as president of the university, he felt an obligation to take the concerns seriously. Public outrage can be perilous for a public university, especially when race is involved. After black students and their allies caused a national stir by protesting racism at the University of Missouri in 2015, the university's fundraising efforts took a big hit, and it became a punching bag for the conservative state legislature. Two years later, freshman enrolment has dropped by 35%, and the university has temporarily shuttered seven dormitories.\n\nYoung said that finances were not on his mind as he weighed what to do about Curry, but also that he acknowledged the importance of staying in the good graces of constituencies beyond the campus. \"People send their children to A&M, and students come to A&M, because it's a very special place,\" he said in an interview. \"I didn't want anybody to doubt what they believe it stands for is what it stands for.\"\n\nOn the morning of 10 May, Curry was asked to meet with university administrators. The professor agreed, but told them he wanted another person of colour in the meeting. He didn't want to feel surrounded by people who didn't get it. At the meeting, Curry said, he got the impression that university officials wanted to draw a distinction between his radio commentary and his work for Texas A&M. But Curry told the university officials there was no difference. Earlier in the year, a panel of judges from the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy had honored Curry's radio work by giving him an award for public philosophy. His radio commentary wasn't some offbeat rant, the professor told his bosses. This is part of what you hired me to do.\n\n\"They backed down a little bit,\" Curry said. He said they told him to put his defence in writing, so they could use it to respond to people who were contacting the university to complain. Curry wrote in the third person, assuming that his bosses would adopt his voice as their own.\n\n\"The inflammatory phrase 'When is it OK to kill white people,'\" he wrote , referring to Dreher's headline, \"deliberately misconstrues Dr Curry's distinction between revolutionary violence and self-defense.\" He continued: \"Dr Curry, drawing from the Second Amendment tradition, suggests that the law's failure to protect the lives of Black, Latino, and Muslim Americans requires new conversations which may require self-defense and more radical options than protest. In no way does his work promote or incite violence toward whites or any other racial group.\" The professor sent the text to his department chair that evening. Two hours later, Curry was sitting in his apartment, at his computer, when a message arrived from President Young. It was addressed not to Curry, but to all faculty, staff and students.\n\n\"As you may know, a podcast interview by one of our professors that took place approximately four-and-a-half years ago resurfaced this week on social media, seen for the first time by many of us,\" wrote Young. \"The interview features disturbing comments about race and violence that stand in stark contrast to Aggie [Texas A&M] core values - most notably those of respect, excellence, leadership and integrity - values that we hold true toward all of humanity.\"\n\nCurry read the email, the text of which was later posted on the university's website , with dawning anger. He's throwing me under the bus, the professor thought. Young continued: \"As we know, the First Amendment of the US Constitution protects the rights of others to offer their personal views, no matter how reprehensible those views may be. It also protects our right to freedom of speech, which I am exercising now. We stand for equality. We stand against the advocacy of violence, hate and killing. We firmly commit to the success, not the destruction, of each other.\"\n\nHave no fear, the president assured them: Texas A&M's core values remained intact.\n\nSmith, the communications vice president, immediately sent Young's statement to the presidents of all the non-profit organisations that help fund Texas A&M. She felt good about the statement. Fair was fair: in December 2016, when the white nationalist Richard Spencer visited Texas A&M, Young made it clear that the university did not share his values, either. After trying and failing to bar Spencer from speaking on campus, university leaders organised a unity-themed rally in the football stadium. \"If you're a purveyor of hate and divisiveness,\" said John C Sharp, the chancellor, \"and you want to spew that kind of racism, this is the last campus on earth that you want to come to to do that.\"\n\nIn light of the situation with Curry, Smith found herself moved by the chancellor's words. \"It is even more meaningful now,\" she wrote to the president the next morning, \"as we articulated our core values again yesterday in a new-but-related situation that shows we mean this equitably.\"\n\nBut the statement did little to slow the momentum of the story. The outrage machine was just warming up. Conservative writers struggled to square their love of free speech with their horror at Curry's words. \"Certainly, no one should be stopped for sharing and debating ideas; the country has seen too many prohibitions of speech in past years,\" wrote Ron Meyer, editor of Red Alert Politics, a Washington-based blog. \"However, paying a professor to share radical ideas on behalf of a university has nothing to do with free speech.\"\n\nGarner, of the Association of Former Students, was still getting calls from alumni who thought Young had not gone far enough. Some said the president should have condemned Curry more forcefully. Others were upset that the professor hadn't been fired. A petition was started encouraging alumni to withhold all donations to Texas A&M and its affiliated fundraisers until the board took action against Curry and Young. The alumni were not the only ones who were upset. Young's attempt to get ahead of a national story created another outrage closer to home.\n\nTo some of Curry's colleagues , the statement the president sent out to mollify the professor's critics was not an affirmation of the university's core values. It was a betrayal of the sacred privilege of academic freedom. Joe Feagin, a long-serving sociology professor, wrote to Young the next morning. \"Michael,\" he wrote, \"I wish you had contacted me about the Curry matter.\" In a separate email to a student newspaper reporter, Feagin argued that Curry's 2012 radio piece was, in fact, based on good research.\n\nNandra Perry, an associate professor of English, also wrote to the president. Previously, she had assumed the university would have her back if anybody used a classroom recording to attack her. Now she wasn't so sure. \"To call this incident a blow to academic freedom,\" Perry told Young, \"doesn't begin to do justice to the chill it will have on my teaching, and indeed the teaching of almost everyone I know.\"\n\nPerhaps the most scathing rebuke to the president came in a letter signed by every faculty member in the Africana Studies department, where Curry also holds a faculty appointment. The history of black thought, they said, includes more than Martin Luther King Jr's crossover hits. By dismissing Curry's comments on violent resistance as \"personal views\", they said, Young had delegitimized the professor's expertise and dismissed centuries of history.\n\n\"Blacks in the United States live with the daily fear that a traffic stop, or a trip to the store or the park, could be the end of their lives,\" wrote the professors. \"Yet we cannot talk about black resistance? Historically or contemporaneously?\" They demanded an apology.\n\nWhen Dreher heard that Curry was getting death threats, he wrote a follow-up blogpost. Anyone threatening violence against Curry, he said, should be ashamed and, if possible, arrested. \"I hope Dr Curry is armed,\" he added, \"so that if anybody shows up at his house threatening him, he defends his home and family by any means necessary.\" Still, Dreher stuck by his interpretation of Curry's 2012 radio commentary. \"I don't believe Tommy Curry is encouraging black people to go out today and cut throats,\" he wrote. \"I think he is entertaining dangerous thoughts here, same as far-right white radicals.\" (He later would write a third post, which was removed, comparing the professor to Emperor Palpatine, the Star Wars villain who encourages morally complex characters to \"give in to the dark side\".)\n\nCurry read the second blogpost somewhat differently from how Dreher had meant it. That evening the professor wrote an email to Young with a headline that was provocative, if a bit misleading: \"Rod Dreher retracts\".\n\nDespite the title of Curry's email to Young, Dreher has not changed his views on Curry's ideas. Dreher believes the only practical solution to racial resentment is the power of forgiveness. In 2015, Dreher marvelled at the \"Christ-like love\" of the teenage children of Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, one of the nine black parishioners killed by the white supremacist Dylann Roof at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Roof shot her five times. The next night, at a vigil for their mother, Chris and Camryn Coleman-Singleton told an interviewer that they had already forgiven Roof .\n\nDreher saw their gesture as both inspiring and necessary. \"There will always be haters, of all kinds, and sometimes those haters will murder in service of the hate that consumes them,\" he wrote at the time. \"But to deny that things have changed for the better, and can change for the better if we work at it, is to deny to ourselves the hope that inspired Martin Luther King and the civil rights heroes.\"\n\nCurry is no hero, Dreher said. He thinks the professor's talk of racial violence is reckless, and that he should cut it out before he inspires somebody to do real harm. \"Tommy Curry's big fat radical mouth gets to me,\" he wrote in an email, \"because of the consequences of the things he believes and says. It's not a joke.\"\n\nBack in America, Curry was more worried about the consequences of what Dreher believed and said about him. For two weeks, Curry rarely left his apartment, as messages arrived by email warning him of what might happen if he did. \"You and your entire family of low-IQ, affirmative-action herpes-infected african monkeys might need to be put to death.\" There were dozens like that. The professor forwarded them to the campus police department. Curry said a detective told him some of the messages appeared to have been sent from within the county. Police officers made a point of regularly driving past his apartment building for several weeks. But Curry worried about whether his six-year-old was safe at her elementary school. Driving her home at the end of the day, he would circle the block a few times to make sure they had not been followed.\n\nNobody came to his door, knocked him down, disarmed him, fired a bullet between his legs or made him beg for his life. The mob that came for Curry was digital and diffuse, everywhere and nowhere. The goal, however, was the same as ever: fear. And it worked. The Currys left town. They had already been planning to move, but Curry and his wife decided to leave early to stay with family. His daughters thought they were going on vacation. He does not plan to bring them when he returns to Texas A&M in the autumn.\n\nIn the course of his life, Curry has embodied both the promise of racial progress and its limitations. He was able to study at an integrated school, but his hometown remained divided by the legacy of segregation. He was hired by a university that wanted more black professors, then was mocked by conservative students who assumed his insight was worthless. He earned honours from his colleagues, then anger from strangers and a tepid defence from his bosses.\n\n\"If that's the American dream,\" said Curry, \"then I'd hate to see what the actual nightmare is.\" He plans to return to Texas A&M in the fall as a full professor. He knows there are people there who want him gone. He no longer trusts the university to defend him. He only hopes he can defend himself."

      "text": "How I Overcame My Soul-Crippling, Deep-South Addiction to Whiteness in 5 Steps\n\nI am a Mississippian as well as my family's most notorious drunk. But six years into sobriety, I discovered that alcohol wasn't my only addiction. Even more insidious was my soul-crippling dependence upon whiteness. I couldn't get through the day without seven or eight stiff shots of feeling superior. That began to change when I decided to write novels about Mississippi. I knew very little outside the white-bubble in which I was raised, and therefore was blind to the story of nearly half the population. Only after interviewing hundreds of black Mississippians, listening to their stories, did I begin to fathom the immensity of the lie behind my superiority and the real cost of my addiction.\n\nWill my home state, which I dearly love, ever overcome its addiction to racism? The recent nasty fight that gave Sen. Thad Cochran a narrow victory in the GOP primary runoff election over tea party favorite Chris McDaniel was fueled with accusations by Cochran that his opponent had ties to the KKK. That's just the latest indication that the Deep South is still sick with racial bile.\n\nIt's not that we haven't had our share of interventions. I was thirteen in 1964 during Freedom Summer. That's when hundreds of Yankee college students intent upon registering blacks to vote showed up at our door uninvited to let us know how far our disease had progressed. They kept after us even after we murdered three of them, Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney. But like the Civil War, Reconstruction, Brown Vs. Board of Education, and the Ole Miss riots with the Federal Troops, we chose denial over recovery.\n\nOf course we attempt to appear in control of our racism by following the law. On paper, blacks can vote, live where they like, have better shot at jobs, run for office and get elected, go to school with whites (at least the few whites who haven't fled to segregated private academies), and they can't be refused service for the color of their skin. They can live mostly without the fear of white violence.\n\nBut white superiority lives on, because our hearts were never committed to recovery.\n\nUnlike the rest of the former Confederacy, these changes didn't come because we saw reason or had a change of heart or even acted out of our own economic best interests. The Federal Government had to intervene, sometimes with guns, to force us to change our ways-we would never have done so voluntarily. This only increased our resentment and our commitment to get even.\n\nIt shows itself today in any measurement of public or individual welfare. Mississippi is fiftieth at anything that has to do with quality of life-income, health, lifespan. education, public services-you name it. If we're not last, it's only because Alabama put in overtime that year.\n\nWhy, after centuries living side by side with black folks, can't we get it right?\n\nTo defeat any effort aimed at the welfare of the general public in Mississippi, all one has to do is claim that the effort is going to dilute one's stash of whiteness by disproportionately benefiting blacks. It's the easiest way to get poor whites to vote against their own self-interest. During the depression era, Mississippi refused funds to train farm workers to operate tractors because blacks would be allowed to develop those same skills. Today, it's health coverage, educational initiatives, voting rights, public services of any sort. The objections offered are frequently couched in terms of economics, fraud or local autonomy. But those aren't the real reasons. Just like the Civil War, it's about protecting the purity of our drug of choice, whiteness.\n\nIt will be a while before the majority of Mississippi whites see blacks as true \"fellow citizens,\" deserving of the same kind of government patronage and quality of life we ourselves feel entitled to. I don't think this attitude is limited to Mississippi, of course, but if there's a skid row of racism, it's us. Everything in Mississippi is seen through the lens of race. We can't approach the simplest of questions without knowing who's white and who's black. And whatever the question, more often than not, blacks are viewed as the problem, the burden or the threat. Always have been, since that day they were brought over in chains. I believe there will be a polygamous gay marriage officiated by the head of the Mississippi Southern Baptist Convention before the average white Mississippian admits that the Civil War had anything to do with the evils of slavery or that things weren't better under Jim Crow.\n\nI'm not saying that breaking an addiction is easy. It's tough, especially with so many enablers like the GOP, right-wing media, and the history textbook editors over in Texas telling students that our cravings are justified-even virtuous.\n\nBut, if you happen to hit bottom, there is hope. Recovery is possible. I'm not the best example, I still struggle. But I'll share my first five steps with you:\n\n1) I came to believe that I am powerless over my racism . I'll always be a racist, and might as well stop pretending otherwise. Voting Democrat or watching Oprah won't cure me. It goes too deep.\n\n2) I came to accept that racism was a gift of love . No evil person made me a racist. Racism was given to me by those whom I love the most, because they wanted me to feel special. Nor am I evil because I accepted the gift. But today I will be responsible.\n\n3) I admitted that it feels good. I enjoy the privileges of whiteness. As soon as I stop pretending otherwise, then I can begin spreading it around.\n\n4) I seek out other recovering whites and listen to their stories. It's important to find a way out of the right-wing noise machine. Stop listening to those who try to incite the anger and fear that drives my craving.\n\n5) I continually share my story. Not about how I used to be a racist, but how I still struggle with racism, day by day.\n\nDenial will be your biggest enemy. Become familiar with common rationalizations, such as: Yankees are just as bad. Blacks are worse racists than whites. It's about heritage, not hate. Slavery wasn't so awful. I loved our maid like a mother. I read The Help .\n\nYou will develop your own list. Mine's inexhaustible. But remember, even if they were all true, that doesn't change the fact that I'm an addict. I crave whiteness every day.\n\nWhy should you change? A lot of reasons: emotional healing, creating a stronger nation, increased capacity to love, ensuring a brighter future for our children.\n\nMississippi may be last in many things, but we're first in one: we're the most religious. It would seem, then, the most important reason to get sober is for the eternal state of our souls."

All Rights Reserved.\n\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - The horrific beating of a mentally disabled white man in Chicago by four black assailants broadcast on social media is highlighting anti-white hate crimes at a time of increased racial strife in the United States.\n\nBut federal statistics and experts say anti-white incidents remain a smaller percentage of overall hate crimes. Anti-black hate crimes are still the largest number of cases.\n\nAccording to the 2015 FBI hate crime statistics, the latest available, there were 613 anti-white-related crimes out of 5,850 total cases. That's around 10.5 percent of all reported hate crimes, and within the yearly average, federal numbers show.\n\nBy comparison, the FBI reports there were 1,745 anti-black hate crimes or about 30 percent of all reported incidents. Jews were the most targeted religious group that year and were victims of 11 percent of all hate crimes. It's not clear how many anti-Jewish hate crime victims also may have been attacked because of their race.\n\nThat data also suggested that blacks and Jews remain disproportionally targets of hate crimes compared to their population as opposed to whites. African-Americans are only 13 percent of the U.S. population, while non-Hispanic whites are 61 percent.\n\nThe FBI defines a hate crime as a \"criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.\" Filing reports for the federal count is voluntary, but guidelines call for reports to be submitted even if they list zero hate crimes.\n\nEven then, experts say the FBI data on hate crimes isn't a full picture since anti-black cases are skewed lower by the lack of reporting participation by some southern law enforcement agencies.\n\nSome large Florida cities, like Miami, reported no hate crimes to the FBI in 2015, said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State University. \"I doubt that cities as diverse as those had no hate crimes,\" he said.\n\nIn Chicago, two men and two women - all black - are facing hate crime charges in connection with the brutal beating of a mentally disabled white man that was streamed on Facebook Live. The video shows the victim is tied up and the suspects are making racial slurs and references to his mental capacity, Chicago Police Commander Kevin Duffin said.\n\nThe suspects are accused of forcing the victim to drink toilet water and kiss the floor, stuffing a sock into his mouth, taping his mouth shut and binding his hands with a belt.\n\nThe 18-year-old victim, who is from a Chicago suburb, suffers from schizophrenia and attention-deficit disorder, authorities said.\n\nThe victim also was taunted with profanities against white people and President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nEighteen-year-olds Brittany Covington, Tesfaye Cooper and Jordan Hill, and 24-year-old Tanishia Covington also face kidnapping and battery charges in connection with the attack.\n\nThe case heightened political tensions on social media and opened yet-to-be healed wounds from a nasty presidential election campaign. Some conservatives suggested the attack highlighted growing anti-white violence and was linked to the Black Lives Matter movement, although police said there was no indication of any connection.\n\nThe FBI does classify attacks based on disability as a hate crime. Federal numbers show 88 incidents related to attacks on disability in 2015.\n\nIn addition to underreporting, Levin said strong federal data of the race and ethnicity of assailants is incomplete because of the lack of consistent reporting.\n\nThe 2015 FBI data showed that of the 734 total reported offenses committed against whites - a single incident could have multiple offenses like assault or theft - 46 percent of those were committed by blacks.\n\nIn contrast, of the 2,125 reported offenses committed against blacks, 58 percent of those who committed by whites.\n\nStill, despite the data, Levin said the Chicago beating is resonating because it was shown via social media and racial relations are tense following the November election. Live streams and 140 Twitter characters inflame the fires.\n\nLevin described the situation as \"a logjam of motivations\" for conflict, saying it's like nothing he's ever seen.\n\n\"We are seeing the coarseness that exists in society generally, those embers, have crossed the fire lines to all parts of the racial, ethnic and ideological spectrum,\" Levin said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Christina A.

(John Clanton/Tulsa World via AP File)\n\nTULSA, Okla. (AP) - Oklahoma began a centennial remembrance Friday of a once-thriving African American neighborhood in Tulsa decimated by deadly white violence that has received growing recognition during America's reckoning over police brutality and racial violence.\n\nEmmy Award-winning actress and Tulsa native Alfre Woodard and U.S. Sen. James Lankford both delivered remarks via video to a small crowd that gathered in chilly, snowy weather at the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park.\n\nState Sen. Kevin Matthews, who represents the North Tulsa area where the massacre happened 100 years ago said the park, named in honor of Oklahoma native and noted American historian John Hope Franklin, provided the perfect backdrop for a message of reconciliation.\n\n\"We can be a beacon of reconciliation around the world,\" Matthews said. \"And ultimately, we can revive the spirit of Black Wall Street and cooperative economics that once lived here and that we want to see in a greater way in the future.\"\n\nViolence erupted May 31 and June 1 in 1921, when a white mob killed an estimated 300 people and wounded 800 while burning 30 blocks of Black-owned businesses and homes and neighborhood churches in the Greenwood neighborhood, also known as \" Black Wall Street .\" Planes were even used to drop projectiles on the area, burning it to the ground.\n\nA renewed search for bodies in 2020 found at least 12 in an unmarked mass grave in a Tulsa cemetery. A team led by Oklahoma's state archaeologist has not been identified the bodies or confirmed they are victims of the massacre. But they were found in an area adjacent to two gravestones of victims and where old funeral home records show both identified and unidentified victims were buried.\n\nTulsa and the race massacre received new national interest over the summer when President Donald Trump picked the city for the first of his signature campaign rallies of the coronavirus era. His initial plan to hold the rally on Juneteenth - the day the last enslaved African Americans learned they had been freed in 1865 - also sparked interest in Tulsa's turbulent racial legacy, although Trump later changed the date of his rally.\n\nThe 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Commission has more centennial events planed throughout the year.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki)\n\nTULSA, Okla. (AP) - In the real world, 74-year-old Donald Shaw is walking on the empty, parched grass slope by Tulsa's noisy crosstown expressway. He's on the other side of the city's historical white-black dividing line from where President Donald Trump will hold a rally Saturday with his overwhelmingly white supporters.\n\nBut Shaw can conjure stories and images of so much more - the once-thriving black community that stood on this same ground, destroyed nearly a century ago by white violence and ensuing decades of repression.\n\n\"Just imagine, in your mind, all these homes,\" Shaw said one morning this week, describing the black-built, black-owned houses and churches that once covered dozens of blocks where he's walking, the site of Tulsa's 1921 race massacre . \"Just picture that.\"\n\n\"Hotels, movie theater, roller rink,\" said Shaw, a retired man who spends his mornings sitting in the shade of an engraved stone memorial to the Home Style Café, A.S. Newkirk photography studio, and literally hundreds of other African American-owned bakeries, barber shops, attorney offices and businesses razed in the massacre.\n\nBurned bricks and a fragment of a church basement are about all that survive today of the more than 30-block historically black district. On May 31 and June 1 in 1921, white residents and civil society leaders looted and burned Tulsa's black Greenwood district to the ground, and used planes to drop projectiles on it.\n\nThe attackers killed up to 300 black Tulsans, and forced survivors for a time to internment camps overseen by National Guard members.\n\nHistorians say the trouble began after a Tulsa newspaper drummed up a furor over a black man who allegedly stepped on a white girl's foot. When black Tulsans showed up with guns to prevent the man's lynching, white Tulsa responded with overwhelming force. A grand jury investigation at the time concluded, without evidence, that unidentified agitators had given Tulsa's African Americans both their firearms and what was described as their mistaken belief \"in equal rights, social equality and their ability to demand the same.\"\n\n\"Everything they had downtown,\" Shaw said of the white-owned business district where Trump will rally, \"we had here.\"\n\nTrump's choice to resume his giant rallies in Oklahoma, a loyal Republican state, and in Tulsa, an oil center, has brought a surge of national interest in the Greenwood district once called Tulsa's \"Negro Wall Street.\" His rally at the 19,000-seat BOK Center will be Trump's first since the coronavirus pandemic shut down much of the U.S. by late March.\n\nTrump's initial plan to hold the rally on Friday - Juneteenth - also sparked interest in the turbulent racial legacy here, although he later pushed back the rally date to Saturday. So has a spring of nationwide street protests over police killings of George Floyd and other black Americans.\n\nDespite the Oklahoma heat, visitors of all races drive up to the site of the destroyed black community. They take photos of themselves in front of the inscribed memorials to what's now called Black Wall Street. They raise a defiant fist in the air for other photos in front of a mural to Black Wall Street painted on the side of the overpass.\n\nFor Shawn-Du Stackhouse, a barber from the Washington, D.C., area and one of those visiting the Tulsa massacre memorials, the proof that cellphone videos provide of killings of African Americans today somehow make the killings of the past, like Tulsa's, more real as well.\n\nFor black Americans, the cellphone videos \"show what they have already known,\" Stackhouse said. \"It gives more confidence\" to speak up about all the killings, past and present, he said.\n\nThe Tulsa rampage was part of a surge of white attacks on black communities - from Washington, D.C., to Chicago to the Pacific Northwest - at the time, said Scott Ellsworth, a historian who has worked for decades to bring the Tulsa massacre to light. The Ku Klux Klan was surging as well, putting many of its members in public office and other influential positions.\n\nIn 1915, President Woodrow Wilson gave a White House screening and praise to \"The Birth of a Nation,\" a tremendously influential and viciously racist film on the South.\n\nToday, opponents say Trump's statements and actions embolden white supremacist sentiment in the country. That includes Trump's opposition to renaming military bases named after Confederate Civil War figures, and his emphasis on a tough \"law and order\" response to recent protests. Trump denies any racism, and said his administration has been beneficial to African American citizens.\n\nAsked Monday about any concerns that Trump's rally may fan racial tensions in Tulsa, Oklahoma Republican Party chairman David McLain said, \"I would like to invite all nationalities into the Republican Party. ... We are a party of great opportunity for anybody, race, creed or color.\"\n\nBlack community groups are organizing a Juneteenth ceremony and justice rally for Friday on the grounds of the memorial district. The Rev. Al Sharpton will speak alongside family members of Terence Crutcher, a black motorist killed by Tulsa police in 2016 while unarmed, Sharpton's publicists said.\n\nTulsa's Republican mayor, G.T. Bynum, has formed a commission for marking the 100th anniversary of the massacre next year. Although expressing doubts about calls for reparations to Tulsa's African Americans, Bynum has supported the search for unmarked burials of victims of the massacre.\n\nNext month, experts plan painstaking examination and excavations of an existing Tulsa cemetery to look for such unmarked graves, said Ellsworth, who teaches African American history at the University of Michigan.\n\nAfter generations of determined public silence on the massacre - long referred to by white Tulsans dismissively as a race \"riot\" - black and white Tulsans increasingly are trying to tell the story of Black Wall Street, including its fiery, deadly end.\n\nTeaching about the massacre is being added to state and city school standards, so that this fall third graders will learn about it. Even preschoolers in some districts are being told about Black Wall Street - not about how it ended, but what it was, said Danielle Neves, deputy chief of academics for Tulsa public schools.\n\n\"Four-year-olds can understand that people like them once owned movie theaters and hotels and ... had a thriving community,\" Neves said.\n\nAt the area's Greenwood Leadership Academy school, classrooms are named after the Dreamland movie theater and other black businesses that white Tulsans burned down, said Kristi Williams, operation manager at the school. Williams' great aunt fled with her date from one theater when the armed whites came to destroy the black part of town in 1921.\n\nWilliams, whose family descended from African Americans enslaved by the Oklahoma-based Muscogee (Creek) Indian nation, emphasizes to pupils the joint power and financial resources that communities like Tulsa's Black Wall Street once embodied.\n\n\"I just always imagine - what would Greenwood look like if the massacre never happened? We had an economy within an economy,\"\n\n___\n\nFollow @knickmeyerellen on Twitter. AP Writer Sean Murphy contributed from Oklahoma City.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Racism and talk of religious war: Trump staff's online posts\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Donald Trump's paid campaign staffers have declared on their personal social media accounts that Muslims are unfit to be U.S. citizens, ridiculed Mexican accents, called for Secretary of State John Kerry to be hanged and stated their readiness for a possible civil war, according to a review by The Associated Press of their postings.\n\nThe AP examined the social media feeds of more than 50 current and former campaign employees who helped propel Trump through the primary elections. The campaign has employed a mix of veteran political operatives and outsiders. Most come across as dedicated, enthusiastic partisans, but at least seven expressed views that were overtly racially charged, supportive of violent actions or broadly hostile to Muslims.\n\nA graphic designer for Trump's advance team approvingly posted video of a black man eating fried chicken and criticizing fellow blacks for ignorance, irresponsibility and having too many children. A Trump field organizer in Virginia declared that Muslims were seeking to impose Sharia law in America and that \"those who understand Islam for what it is are gearing up for the fight.\"\n\nThe AP's findings come at a time when Trump is showing new interest in appealing to minority voters, insisting he will be fair in dealing with the 11 million people in the U.S. illegally and explicitly pitching himself to African-Americans, saying \"what do you have to lose?\"\n\nSince Trump declared his candidacy last summer, he has paid about 120 people on his campaign, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Over the weekend, the campaign reported about 70 people drawing salaries, a number that did not include a few dozen more working as consultants. A slew of hires in early August were not yet reflected in Trump's filings.\n\nThe AP was able to review the accounts of only a minority of Trump staffers: Others set their accounts to private, some could not be found or identified with confidence as Trump campaign employees.\n\nThe AP also reviewed the public social media accounts of more than three dozen employees of Hillary Clinton's far larger campaign staff and found nothing as inflammatory. One staffer said Trump's style of speaking reminded him of a roommate who had taken too many hallucinogenic mushrooms. AP also reviewed images attached to more than 19,000 stolen internal emails from the Democratic National Committee for racially or religiously inflammatory memes, finding nothing of note.\n\nThe Clinton campaign declined to comment on its procedures for vetting staff. It employs more than 650 people, according to its FEC filings.\n\nOne month ago, the AP sent written questions to the Trump campaign with examples of the posts. The campaign has not commented, despite several requests since.\n\nVeteran Republican campaign operatives said keeping an eye on staffers' social media postings has long been a standard practice.\n\n\"In vetting a prospective staffer, I'm not sure where the line would be for not hiring someone or simply asking them to take something down from social media, but there is a line,\" said Beth Myers, a former top Mitt Romney campaign aide.\n\nDuring Myers' work for Mitt Romney in the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, she said, social media was newer, so indiscrete or embarrassing photos were more often concerns than inflammatory views. Even outside social media, she stressed to the campaigns' staffers that what they said and did would reflect on the candidate who employed them. \"Don't put anything in an email that you wouldn't want on the front page of The New York Times,\" she recalled telling staff. \"The same thing I told my kids, I told my staffers.\"\n\nThe AP found little questionable content in the ranks of Trump's top officials. The campaign's social media director, Dan Scavino, tweets prolifically but avoids discussing race and religion. Field organizers representing Trump's campaign around the country, however, have had no such reservations, either before or during their employment with the campaign. Their judgment matters beyond the campaign because the paid staff of winning presidential candidates often receives jobs in the next administration.\n\nBefore being tapped as statewide director of coalitions, Craig Bachler of Bradenton, Florida, posted jokes in 2015 about Mexican accents superimposed over pictures of an overweight man wearing a sombrero. Bachler was named by the campaign as official staff in November, though there is no record he has been paid for his work. Bachler did not respond to a request for comment via Facebook or a message left at his office voicemail. After AP's inquiries, Bachler blocked access to an AP reporter, and his Facebook account - which included a photo of Bachler with Trump - was scrubbed to remove the offensive post.\n\nTeresa Unrue, a field organizer and graphic designer in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, for Trump's advance team, shared a video on her Facebook account July 11 - the week before the Republican National Convention - of a black man eating fried chicken while shaming fellow black people.\n\n\"Why are you mad about slavery?\" the man asks. \"Y'all weren't no damn slaves.\"\n\n\"Had me crack'n up!! Thank you!\" Unrue wrote of the video. \"Please share this with people.\"\n\nIn a short phone conversation, Unrue said she tried to keep her personal social media comments positive and referred questions to the campaign.\n\nSome posts fixated on stories of black-on-white violence with claims that news about such crimes was being suppressed.\n\n\"How about this little white boy being murdered by a black man,\" grassroots organizer Annie Marie Delgado of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, wrote in December 2014 post, one of a number highlighting crimes against white people before Trump declared his candidacy. Delgado also shared a discredited, hoax photo of the State Department's Kerry with Jane Fonda, and commented: \"I say hang them!\" She was paid $11,146 through April, according to campaign records.\n\nFear or dislike of Muslims was a recurring theme. Though Trump at one point proposed temporarily barring foreign Muslims from entering the country and scrutinizing the activities of mosques, he has sometimes distinguished Islamic extremists who pose a risk and those who don't. \"I love the Muslims,\" Trump said in September, expressing willingness to appoint one to his Cabinet.\n\nOn Facebook, Mark Kevin Lloyd of Lynchburg, Virginia, who has been paid $36,000 as Trump's field director in the state, shared a post June 30 calling Islam \"a barbaric cult.\" He shared a meme June 16, four days after the Orlando nightclub shooting by a heavily armed Muslim who professed allegiance to the Islamic State group. The meme said people should be forced to eat bacon before they can purchase firearms.\n\nLloyd declined to talk to the AP without the Trump campaign's permission, citing his nondisclosure agreement with the campaign.\n\nOther campaign staffers also singled out Muslims for special scrutiny.\n\nUnrue shared the statement, \"We need Islam control, not gun control.\"\n\nDuring her time with the campaign, Delgado deplored the appointment of a Muslim-American judge in New York.\n\n\"Step by step... this is how American culture will end,\" she wrote Feb. 27, saying it was only reasonable to believe that the judge would implement Sharia law.\n\nDelgado said in a telephone interview she stopped working for the campaign in April. She said she did not recall making some of the posts the AP asked her about and does not stand by others.\n\n\"If I read the whole thing, I probably wouldn't have posted it,\" she said of one post she shared, a short essay declaring that Muslims are inherently incapable of being good Americans.\n\nPhillip Dann, a field organizer in Massachusetts who recently relocated to Florida, was paid $6,153 between January and March. He shared a meme mocking \"Muslim sympathizers.\" He also shared an article about Trump threatening to bring back waterboarding \"or worse,\" and added \"where is the gasoline?\" Dann told the AP in a phone interview he had no antipathy against Muslims in general.\n\nDann attributed inflammatory comments of other Trump staffers to the fact that the campaign had drawn on people inexperienced in politics. While he has been politically active for decades - originally as a leftist, he said - he described the field staff Trump acquired in the primary as unfamiliar with traditional campaign rules.\n\n\"We get hired because there was no one left,\" Dann said. In a later email, he acknowledged some of his and other staff postings were \"clearly over the top\" - but said that criticism of the posts would amount to intimidation.\n\nScott Barrish, who earned $12,250 as Trump's political director for the Tampa Bay, Florida, region, took his views beyond social media posts. In 2011, he drew local press coverage for writing to the head of the nonprofit Council on American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy group for Muslims in the U.S., saying he was wise to its plans to establish a totalitarian theocracy in the United states.\n\n\"This is us vs. you,\" wrote Barrish. \"In the great words of the late President Ronald Reagan, 'I win, you lose!'\"\n\nSeparately, Barrish tweeted in 2013 that he hoped America wasn't headed for civil war, but \"if our freedoms must be defended against a tyrannical government, so be it.\"\n\n\"Those comments at that time were made by me and were my own personal view,\" Barrish said in a brief interview with AP. He said he stopped working for Trump's campaign after the Florida primary. \"I don't want to detract anything from the campaign.\"\n\nBarrish separately complained to editors at AP about its review of publicly accessible material on Trump employees' social media accounts, saying \"the liberal media, yellow journalists are really grasping at straws with their ad hominem circumstantial logical fallacies!\"\n\nMany accounts AP reviewed embraced conspiracy theories. Lloyd, the Virginia field director, said Obama is aiding the Iranian nuclear program as part of the president's \"'final solution' to the Israel problem,\" a phrase evoking the Holocaust.\n\nDelgado, the Florida organizer, circulated a theory that the company Edible Arrangements LLC is funneling money to Hamas, a claim that the Anti-Defamation League, a U.S. Jewish organization, has repeatedly dismissed as false.\n\nUnrue posted a link to a website that alleged that the U.S. government assassinated Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died earlier this year after a history of heart trouble.\n\nRacially charged social media posts from Trump campaign employees and associates have already been a repeated source of embarrassment. Trump fired one adviser who had used a racial slur to describe Obama's children, and the campaign denounced Trump's longtime Mar-a-Lago butler for saying he would support dragging Obama from the White House and hanging him.\n\nKatie Packer, a 2012 Romney deputy campaign manager who opposes Trump, said the social media posts AP reviewed would have all been immediate disqualifiers for anyone who had applied for a campaign job - even if the postings weren't visible to the public.\n\n\"A comfort level with people who think this is OK is indicative of what you think is OK,\" Packer said. \"Maybe the campaign just doesn't know about this, but that's malpractice.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Chad Day and Ted Bridis in Washington and Nick Riccardi in Denver contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nExcerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:\n\n___\n\nJan. 12\n\nThe Miami Herald on \"blue lives matter\" and the deaths of two police officers after the U.S. Capitol riot:\n\nDo blue lives only matter when Black lives are perceived as the threat to them?\n\nUp until the weekend, when videos began to receive wide circulation, we had heard more about that idiot Adam Johnson - a Floridian of course - accused of stealing Nancy Pelosi's lectern than we did about the law enforcement officers whom a frenzied mob of white extremists were allowed to bash, beat, slur and kill during their rampage through the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. And, not so shockingly, some white police officers from across the country proudly stepped over that thin blue line and joined the lawless mobs.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nWe know why, and anyone who has been paying attention knows why, too.\n\nPolice officers are revered by many racist whites whenever equally racist rogues on the force bash, beat, slur and kill African Americans. But police themselves became the enemy last week, and the deafening silence over how - and by whom - they were battered is telling.\n\nWe know why.\n\nONE BY SUICIDE\n\nNever let it be forgotten that Brian Sicknick, a military veteran and member of the Capitol Police was struck in the head with a fire extinguisher. The bloodied man was rushed to the hospital and placed on life support. He died the next day.\n\nNever forget, either, Capitol Police Officer Howard Liebengood. He, too, put his life on the line during the assault on the Capitol. Days later, off duty, he took his life. How could the two events not be connected?\n\nWhite terrorists beat another officer bloody with a pole bearing the American flag - no, seriously. It's on video. Black officers were predictably called the n-word.\n\nAnd never let it be forgotten that one of those Black officers, Eugene Goodman, who, by sheer guts alone took on a white mob, which gave chase as he lured them away from the entrance to the Senate chambers and into a group of police who withstood the assault. Innocent black man, angry white mob. It is an shamefully enduring American story, and Goodman is an American hero.\n\nFIRST LADY'S LAMENT\n\nThe law-and-order Trump administration's only comment was to lower the White House flag to half-staff on Sunday. On Monday, first lady Melania Trump released a tone-deaf and self-serving statement on WhiteHouse.gov: \"Most recently, my heart goes out to: Air Force Veteran, Ashli (Babbitt), Benjamin (Phillips), Kevin Greeson, (Roseanne) Boyland, and Capitol Police Officers, Brian Sicknick and Howard Liebengood. I pray for their families comfort and strength during this difficult time,\" she said.\n\nNotice to whom she gave priority, the traitors unleashed by her husband. She then lamented in her statement that she, too, was a victim - a target of \"salacious gossip and unwarranted personal attacks.\" Again, those blues lives, dead at the hands of whites, were almost an afterthought.\n\nWe live in a country where Blacks' quest for justice is un-American, and white violence is as American as apple pie.\n\nWe know why.\n\nOnline: https://www.miamiherald.com/\n\n___\n\nJan. 12\n\nThe Los Angeles Times on President Donald Trump, social media and the open internet:\n\nThanks to the 1st Amendment, government in the United States has little power to stop people from speaking their minds. But the Bill of Rights doesn't constrain Facebook, Twitter and other Big Tech companies, which decided in the wake of last week's attack on the U.S. Capitol that the world has heard enough from President Trump.\n\nOn one level, it's understandable that private companies would not want their services and platforms used to foment violence and undermine democracy. On another, their actions show just how much power over global speech we've ceded to a handful of companies whose primary incentive is profit, not free expression.\n\nThe simple fact that they have such power may be more troubling than what they're doing with it. Trump crossed a bright line when he started using social media networks not just to bemoan the results of the 2020 election but to try to overturn them. Having spent two months spouting an endless stream of false allegations about a stolen election, he summoned his followers to Washington, D.C., to pressure lawmakers to throw out the certified votes of the states' electors. And after they stormed the Capitol, he called them \"great patriots\" on Twitter and urged them to go home \"with love.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Facebook banned Trump indefinitely, according to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, because \"we believe the risks of allowing the president to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.\" Other networks took similar steps, with Twitter suspending his account permanently on Friday.\n\nTwitter's explanation for its action was laudably detailed. The company looked beyond what Trump was tweeting to see how his words were being interpreted online, and it found that Trump's seemingly conciliatory words were being interpreted in some quarters as an invitation for more violence - perhaps as early as next week. It was an impressive and disturbing bit of forensics that justified sidelining Trump at least until his followers' energy dissipates.\n\nNevertheless, Big Tech's shift from amplifying the president's comments to censoring them opens a Pandora's box. As Emma Llansó of the Center for Democracy & Technology noted, there's an awful lot of politically motivated violence around the world.\n\n\"Do we want companies to be really on the watch for potential incitements to violence by political leaders?\" Llansó asked.\n\nThe answer is that we want them to respond quickly when the connection between words and deeds is clear, as was the case last week, and to explain themselves fully. But most of the time, the circumstances will be murkier. Moderating a network is hard, and when the user is a major public figure whose utterances are newsworthy, the job is that much harder. The most we can expect is that the companies impose the same rules on presidents that they do on peons and take a hard line against harassing, defamatory or injurious speech by any user.\n\nThere's a bipartisan push in Washington to reconsider the latitude online companies have to moderate their own networks, and the events of last week could make lawmakers more receptive to some ham-handed and counterproductive proposals that have been circulating. We continue to believe that it's better to have tech companies police themselves than to have government tell them how to do it. But part of the problem is that these platforms appear too big to be moderated effectively; more competition would help matters by reducing the size and power of these dominant networks.\n\nThe crackdown on Trump extended over the weekend to Parler, a social messaging service popular with conservatives that bills itself as \"Free expression without violence and no censorship.\" Google and Apple removed Parler from their app stores, and Amazon cut off its bandwidth, all ostensibly because they didn't approve of the way Parler policed its network.\n\nAgain, that's understandable, given that some members of last week's mob reportedly used Parler to organize and promote the violent takeover. Such comments are seditious and horrifying. But in squelching Parler, Big Tech is muzzling all of its users, not just the ones plotting insurrection. And as Parler noted in an antitrust lawsuit it filed against Amazon, Twitter has seen plenty of tweets threatening violence recently, yet no one is threatening to pull the plug on Twitter.\n\nParler insists that it doesn't tolerate threats or incitement to violence and that it's no worse at enforcing its rules than any other social network is. Clearly, it needs to do a better job than it has. But the idea of Big Tech gatekeepers deciding how other companies should police their networks is troubling. Simply put, it grants those companies too much power to shape the free and open internet in the name of excluding unwelcome guests.\n\nOnline: https://www.latimes.com/\n\n___\n\nJan. 11\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the possibility of impeaching President Donald Trump:\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi is barreling ahead on a vote to impeach President Trump this week-days before a new President takes office, and with the outcome and timing of a Senate trial uncertain. This is a moment for Joe Biden to establish his leadership by calling off the House impeachers in service of his vow that this is a \"time to heal.\"\n\nWe explained Friday why Mr. Trump's actions last Wednesday were impeachable offenses, and that the best outcome would be his resignation. It appears he won't resign. But that doesn't mean impeachment now is wise or good for the country if the goal is get past the Trump era. It may do more harm by letting Mr. Trump play the victim than good by stigmatizing behavior that most Americans already find unacceptable.\n\nThe first obstacle is timing. In eight days Mr. Trump will be gone from the White House. A House vote this week means no fact-finding or time for a presidential defense. The Senate isn't scheduled to reconvene until Jan. 19, the day before Mr. Biden is inaugurated. Even if Senators convene earlier, Republicans aren't likely to hold a trial without giving Mr. Trump a chance to mount a defense, as other impeached officials have been able to do.\n\nThat leaves a trial to take place when Mr. Trump is no longer President. Views differ on whether the Constitution allows impeachment after a President leaves office, though this would be a first. Alan Dershowitz, the law professor and one of Mr. Trump's impeachment lawyers in 2019, made a compelling case Sunday that this constitutional point would be part of Mr. Trump's defense.\n\nThis assumes Democrats even want a Senate trial and the risk of a potential acquittal. Jim Clyburn, the third-ranking House Democrat, said Sunday the House might vote to impeach but then wait weeks or months before sending an article to the Senate.\n\nIf the goal is a quick rebuke, that makes no sense. It keeps the focus on Mr. Trump for months into Mr. Biden's term, and to what end? Is the goal to hold a trial over the head of Republicans in case they oppose too much of the Democratic agenda?\n\nMrs. Pelosi says one of her goals is to sanction Mr. Trump so he can't run again for President in 2024. But that requires a Senate conviction, which means a two-thirds majority, and an explicit declaration that he is barred from running. That goal is defeated without a conviction.\n\nMrs. Pelosi seems to know this because on Sunday she asked in a letter to her Members for thoughts on barring Mr. Trump from future office under Section 3 of the Constitution's 14th Amendment. That language bars anyone from holding office who has \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion\" against the United States.\n\nThat language was aimed at members of the Confederacy after the Civil War. Courts up to the Supreme Court had ruled against Southerners who committed acts of war against the Union, such as raiding ships at sea.\n\nNo court has made a finding of insurrection against President Trump, so Mrs. Pelosi would be asking Congress to do that on its own. She'd essentially be hijacking the 14th Amendment to create another path to bar Mr. Trump from running again, and perhaps with a mere majority vote, not two-thirds as required by the Impeachment Clause. That would violate the Constitution in the name of defending it.\n\nAdd all this up, and impeachment now with a trial continuing into the Biden Presidency looks like political excess. It could let Mr. Trump compete with Mr. Biden for public attention, and give the then-former President a platform to rally his supporters. It makes more sense to let him repair in new irrelevance to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nWhich brings us to Mr. Biden's leadership opportunity. One worry about the President-elect is whether he is strong enough to lead his party or will instead be led by the progressives on Capitol Hill. His statement last week that he is deferring to Congress on impeachment reinforced that concern, and he added Monday that he thinks the Senate can hold a trial and pass his agenda at the same time.\n\nPerhaps, but a Trump impeachment and trial aren't in Mr. Biden's political interest. They would do nothing to calm partisan divisions and might turn off moderates who voted for Mr. Biden because they want the tumultuous Trump era to be over. It would make the first drama of his Presidency an act of retribution.\n\nMr. Biden can better set the stage for his inaugural by telling the public that he'd prefer if the impeachers stood down. He can say he thinks Mr. Trump's behavior is impeachable, and that had it taken place earlier he'd support his ouster. But on the eve of the transfer of power and going into a new Presidency, it is needlessly divisive. He could say his goal as President is to move past the politics of polarization and annihilation, not to escalate it for another four years. Most Americans would welcome it.\n\nOnline: https://www.wsj.com/\n\n___\n\nJan. 11\n\nThe Toronto Star on the COVID-19 vaccine rollout:\n\nIf governments don't pick up the pace on vaccinations - by a lot - they're simply not going to get most Canadians inoculated against COVID-19 by the end of this year.\n\nIt's simple math, as set out over the weekend by the Star's Kenyon Wallace. The current pace of about 23,400 vaccinations a day has to be increased by 6.5 times in order to get a critical mass of the population their shots by Dec. 31.\n\nIn fact, the federal government's goal is more ambitious: it has committed to vaccinating every adult Canadian who wants a COVID-19 shot by the end of September. For that to happen, the pace will have to increase even more.\n\nThat's challenging enough, but the real problem is that neither goal is good enough. Waiting until the end of 2021, or even until the end of September, for enough people to be inoculated to defeat this disease is just not ambitious enough.\n\nWhen the first vaccines appeared ahead of schedule in December, there was so much public relief at this unexpected sign of hope that it seemed churlish to push for more. Canada was among the very first countries to get doses of the precious Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.\n\nBut three weeks later the situation is much darker, and it's clear the federal government must do absolutely everything in its power to advance the target date for getting vaccines to most Canadians.\n\nThe second wave of COVID-19 is bad - very bad. On Tuesday we expect to get a more precise idea of just how bad when Ontario releases new projections for the future course of the pandemic.\n\nBut already the province is seeing well over 3,000 new cases a day (Monday's seven-day average was 3,555 - up a staggering 90 per cent in the past month). Hospitals warn they soon may not be able to treat everyone who gets critically ill. And we're facing even more restrictions on working, shopping and moving around.\n\nWe are, to be blunt, losing the fight right now against COVID-19. All the pleading in the world from public health officials for people to stay home, wear masks, wash hands, etc., etc. hasn't worked. The numbers are off the charts and the only weapons left in the public health arsenal are the blunt instruments of lockdown and closure.\n\nCan we really wait nine full months, until the end of September, for enough Canadians to be vaccinated to give confidence that the pandemic is under control? Under current trends, no.\n\nThe federal government's plan calls for just six million doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to be delivered in the first three months of this year - enough to inoculate three million people in the most exposed groups, such as long-term care residents and health workers. That's to be followed by a greatly expanded program starting in April, reaching up to half the population.\n\nBut that lags well behind some other countries, including Israel, Britain, Denmark and the United States. Canada now ranks 11th in a global comparison of doses administered per 100 people.\n\nTo put things in perspective, though, it's just ahead of Germany and miles ahead of France - but the point isn't to win some theoretical battle among nations. It's to get the job done as soon as possible so we can get back to normality.\n\nOttawa may have been slow off the mark last summer in striking deals with pharmaceutical companies for delivery of vaccines, as some critics have charged. But that's water under the bridge. The key thing now is to do everything possible (including paying more, if necessary) to advance the delivery schedule for existing vaccines and clear the way for others that still haven't been approved.\n\nProcurement Minister Anita Anand appears to understand this. She says \"the sky's the limit\" on what she's prepared to do to get more vaccine doses into the country, more quickly.\n\nThat's good to hear, and we look forward to hearing details of a new and improved plan very soon. At this point the country simply can't afford any delay on getting vaccines into arms.\n\nOnline: https://www.thestar.com/\n\n___\n\nJan. 10\n\nThe Washington Post on anti-vaxxers and the COVID-19 vaccine:\n\nFifty-seven vials containing more than 500 doses of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine were removed from a pharmacy refrigerator by an employee in a Wisconsin medical center last month - inadvertently, officials said at first, and then they revised their statement. The act was intentional.\n\nThe inoculations against the coronavirus rolling out around the country are the targets of intense disinformation campaigns that have spurred concerns about safety and efficacy, even among health-care workers. Leaders of long-standing anti-vaccine groups see this pivotal moment as a prime opportunity to leverage the rumor-mongering infrastructure they've built over the course of years. The Post reports that members of the National Vaccine Information Center are coordinating a \"master narrative\" that the virus isn't a threat and that the safeguards against it are. They're ballooning isolated instances of side effects into proof of general dangerousness; homing in on prominent online health influencers to spread their propaganda; and targeting African American communities whose fraught history with the medical community has primed them for skepticism.\n\nThe best antidote to bad information is good information. Trickier is figuring out how to administer it. Removing false claims is nigh impossible for platforms to do at scale without too much slipping through the cracks, and studies show the practice sometimes only makes people more eager for what they start to see as suppressed knowledge. Applying fact checks and reducing algorithmic spread can help. Yet at the core of this conundrum is the question of trust. Experts suggest \"pre-bunking,\" or anticipating lies and filling the void before their arrival with facts. They also emphasize the need for honesty about where the vaccine is imperfect, such as with adverse reactions, unanticipated side effects and imperfect efficacy. Members of the public need to be assured ahead of time that these issues do exist, that they aren't evidence of widespread harm and that no one is trying to hide anything from them.\n\nThe public also needs to hear all this in the right places, from the right people. That means responsible reporting from media outlets, whether it comes from a national newspaper's editorial page or a local daily's lead story. The messenger can matter as much as the message, especially in insular communities suspicious of vaccines in particular or the government generally. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can probably do much less to persuade an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community to get its shots than can a nearby synagogue with whom the agency might partner. Physicians should be trained in how to assuage patients' fears; individuals should be taught how to assuage the fears of their loved ones. The forces that seek to sow doubt are determined and disciplined. Those who hope to build faith in these lifesaving vaccines must be similarly committed.\n\nOnline: https://www.washingtonpost.com/\n\n___\n\nJan. 8\n\nThe Baltimore Sun on former Georgia House minority leader Stacey Abrams:\n\nGeorgia's Senate runoff race offers important lessons for political campaigns around the country on old school, grassroots organizing of voters. Democrats flipped two seats in the historically red state, upending a Republican stronghold and practically ensuring President-elect Joe Biden an easier ride as president. So badly was the status quo thrown off kilter that Republican lawmakers are already talking about trying to restrict absentee voting, as mail-in voting helped to mobilize throngs of new voters. We know the state is no stranger to such voter suppression tactics. The runoff system itself, held when no candidate gets a majority of the vote, was created in the '60s to dilute the Black vote and give white candidates an edge. But it didn't work this time around.\n\nThank Stacey Abrams, Georgia's former House minority leader, and the dozens of churches and other community and activist groups that held massive registration drives and rallied people to the polls. Ms. Abrams kept her word not to go away quietly after losing a 2018 gubernatorial bid because of what she called outright voter suppression, including the purge of voter rolls and denial of new registrations. She started the voter organization Fair Fight, and Republicans soon didn't know what hit them. What do they say about a scorned woman? She comes back with a vengeance and turns a red state blue - at least in the U.S. Senate.\n\nMs. Abrams and other already entrenched groups, such as Black Voters Matter, canvassed the state searching for unregistered voters, including large swathes of people who had never registered, or those who might have been on the voter rolls, but didn't participate in the process all that often. In the age of social media, when Facebook and Instagram pages fill up with political ads during election season, activists used more traditional methods, like door hangers, and focused on issues to engage potential voters, such as systemic racism. They made people see how government could be meaningful to them.\n\nThe result: a record breaking 4.5 million people voted in the runoff elections and Black voters led the way in solidifying a Democratic victory. We're all better off because of it, too. With Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in the Senate, it will end the Republican majority, the tyrannic reign of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the political gridlock that made it hard to get anything done. The country will, we hope, get a meaningful stimulus plan that will help people through the financial hardships caused by COVID-19. Reams of legislation that passed in the House, only to stall in the Senate, may finally see life. We hope desperately that it also means the country can began to restore faith in our democracy.\n\nBaltimore ought to take some tips from Georgia's playbook on engaging an electorate. People often complain about the status quo, saying it's time for new blood and that certain candidates, say former Mayor Sheila Dixon, have their core group of supporters, and it's hard to break the voting cliques. That may be true sometimes. (Though newly elected Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott appears to have attracted a diverse group of voters in the last election). Maybe the answer, then, is for political campaigns to step up their ground games and mobilizing efforts and do a better job of reaching new voters and exciting those who have become disengaged. Mail-in voting, which has resulted in increased voter participation by making it easier to cast a ballot, will only help the cause. Yeah, voting is supposed to be a civic duty. But we know too many people who don't think the political process works for them, and so they stay home. That is the reality whether we like it or not.\n\nThe good thing is that Ms. Abrams and Georgia have proven that mindset can be changed with a boots to the ground mentality. They reinvigorated an old formula for modern times. So we say congratulations to them. And we can't wait to see what Ms. Abrams plans to do next. We certainly don't think this is the last we have seen of her. Perhaps there is another gubernatorial run in her future?\n\nOnline: https://www.baltimoresun.com/\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

      "text": "White Power, White Violence\n\nA manifesto is not something to be ignored; it's a playbook for the next attack.\n\nThe mass shooting of Black grocery shoppers in Buffalo, New York, on Saturday follows a string of similar attacks. Gunmen have targeted worshippers at synagogues and mosques and temples and Bible study; they have opened fire on summer camps and people at festivals. We know the names of these places: Charleston; El Paso; Poway; Pittsburgh; Oak Creek; Christchurch, New Zealand. We know the names of the shooters, too, although I won't list them here, because adding to their notoriety deepens the problem.\n\nSome of us also know by now that although we might think these are attacks on specific victim groups-and they are attacks on Black, Jewish, Islamic, Sikh, Latino, and immigrant populations-the aforementioned examples have all been part of one movement. In each event, a white-power activist was the perpetrator. Several of the assailants wrote extensively about their motivations in manifestos that outlined a coherent political ideology. And in the United States, they have been backed by a broad social movement that our legislators have failed to condemn, that our court system has failed to prosecute, and that our society has not stopped.\n\nThis means that these are not \"lone wolf\" attacks even when they may appear to be, and certainly not just because a shooter has claimed to have been operating alone. The white-power movement has, since the early 1980s, organized the disparate groups of the militant right (Klansmen, neo-Nazis, militiamen, and others) around cell-style terrorism. Activists deliberately obscure their connections with one another. Yet the historical record reveals an interwoven tapestry of people on the militant right who have united in common cause to target minority communities and to undermine American democracy, and who ultimately hope to provoke race war.\n\nJuliette Kayyem: A 'lone wolf' shooter has an online pack\n\nThe recent litany of places hit is only the latest record of the white-power movement's most craven acts of violence since its coming-out party at the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. There is a longer list of sites of violence, including Oklahoma City , where in 1995 a white-power bomber killed 168 people in the nation's largest act of domestic terrorism. There is also a longer list of smaller acts of violence, people killed in ones and twos, and a longer list of communities where this violence and intimidation still resonate.\n\nBut all of this violence represents only half of the urgent threat we must now confront. The other half of white nationalism is in our halls of governance and on our televisions, claiming ignorance of its most violent outgrowths. Think for instance of the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021: Although white-power and militant-right activists represented a small group of the participants, they were the most organized, the ones with tactical gear and advance planning. They were the ones with intergroup communication and battle readiness.\n\nThe crucial difference is that January 6 was meant to be not an act of mass-casualty violence but rather a piece of performative activism. We know this because of the symbology of the attack and its deep roots in white-power-movement texts such as The Turner Diaries , which-amid plans for many mass-casualty attacks and for genocide-set out an attack on the Capitol as something very different. It was meant to strike the seat of power and thus awaken others to the cause. It worked, too. Despite increased surveillance and deplatforming in the immediate aftermath, researchers have documented a regrouping: upticks in web traffic in white-power spaces, local organizing, and online radicalization . We may yet find that the alleged shooter in Buffalo, only 18-who wrote that he became radicalized in January 2022-was propelled by that latest wave in this cresting sea.\n\nIn white-power ideology, mass violence is seen as a tool rather than an end point. Here we need look no further than the manifestos that are now routinely shared online from gunman to gunman, imparting instructions for future mass shooters as well as explaining how the attack itself is meant to provoke race war and civil unrest. The Buffalo document includes long sections of text pasted from the manifesto connected to the Christchurch shooting; the El Paso document did the same.\n\nAll of this is much too important to ignore as a disconnected string of events or to set aside as simply inexplicable acts of hate and prejudice. The alleged shooter in Buffalo is said to have written that boredom, isolation, and internet radicalization led him to his act. When we imagine how many others like him are in front of their screens, alone but together, we might summon an appropriate level of concern to move us to action. Every person should demand accountability from our elected officials for these events, whether January 6 or yesterday's mass shooting. The death toll is still mounting, and the threat to our democracy grows."

      "text": "The Crunchy-to-Alt-Right Pipeline\n\nThose living on the fringe of the left and the right share more in common than you might think.\n\nThis article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from The Atlantic , Monday through Friday. Sign up for it here.\n\nO n Twitter and TikTok over the past few weeks, scores of users have become alarmed about the uncomfortable coziness between the natural-food-and-body community and white-power and militant-right online spaces-the \"crunchy-to-alt-right pipeline.\"\n\nCrunchy , coined as a pop-culture reference to granola, has come to refer to a wide variety of cultural practices, including avoiding additives and food dyes, declining or spacing out childhood vaccinations beyond what pediatricians recommend, and more extreme actions in pursuit of health, independence, and purity. Back-to-the-land living and alternative medicine are hallmarks of \"crunch.\" Much of this subculture is benign, a declaration of anti-modernism or slow living. But this largely white cultural space shares some preoccupations with right-wing organizations, which have used it for recruitment.\n\nIn the 1970s and '80s, women in the emergent white-power movement, which gathered Ku Klux Klan members, neo-Nazis, skinheads, Christian Identity members, tax resisters, and other militant-right activists, deployed what we would now call \"crunchy\" issues as part of a wider articulation of cultural identity.\n\nKathleen Belew: White power, white violence\n\nThese bits of crunchiness included organic farming, a macrobiotic diet, neo-paganism, anti-fluoridation, and traditional midwifery. All of these are often thought of as leftist or \"hippie\" issues, but they appeared regularly in the robust outpouring of women's publications in the white-power movement.\n\nThe surprise at the crunchy-to-alt-right pipeline, or at the closeness between the radical right and the radical left, reveals a problem with common ideas about left, right, and center in American politics. In general discourse, and too often in historiography, we use a measure that harkens back to World War II, with the left (aligned with the Communist U.S.S.R.) on one end, a flat line running through a political center (democracy and the United States), and the right on the other (where fascism and Nazi Germany reside). This idea of a political spectrum implies that left and right share little in common, and that they are diametrically opposed. It also positions fascism as far away from American politics, when recent history shows us quite the opposite.\n\nThe archive of the white-power movement-a vivid repository of letters, newspapers, personal correspondence, images, FBI files, news reports, and court records collected across decades-suggests that the reality is much more complex. Left and right not only grew close to each other in the '70s and '80s, but they sometimes shared much more with each other than with the political center.\n\nSome political scientists have suggested a \"horseshoe theory,\" with the center as the rounded top of a horseshoe and the two fringes on either end, but inclined toward one another. This image, while evocative, isn't quite right. In the archive, it looks more like a circle.\n\nIn the 1980s, for instance, white-supremacist compounds and hippie communes could exist in the same rural communities. Consider Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, the home of the white-separatist compound Aryan Nations. Coeur d'Alene also attracted other survivalists and people who wanted distance from the state, as well as environmentally inclined leftists attracted to the scenic lakes and mountains. Scholars have spent ample time on other alliances between neighbors in this period-such as the way the white-power movement radicalized its rural neighbors affected by the farm crisis of the 1970s.\n\nBeginning in the '70s, the alternative-lifestyle publication Mother Earth News ran articles on organic gardening and other issues championed by the left. Though the publication itself was not an organ of the white power movement, and indeed often espoused leftist positions, in at least one high-profile case, white power activists used its classifieds section to find one another. Robert Mathews, the leader of the white-power terrorist group the Order, met his first wife through the magazine's personal advertisements. Mathews would lead the Order on a spree of racist and anti-Semitic assassinations, robberies, and infrastructure attacks that in many ways laid the foundation for the violent strategies used by white-power and militant-right activists today. (His wife, Debbie Mathews, had a movement career of her own that lasted long after her husband's death at the hands of pursuing federal agents, and traded on his martyrdom.) The Mathews family lived in Metaline Falls, Washington, and commuted to nearby Hayden Lake, Idaho. In addition to the Aryan Nations compound, Hayden Lake and nearby Coeur d'Alene hosted tepee-dwelling hippie communities, alternative-lifestyle followers, northwestern outdoorsmen, fundamentalist Mormons, and survivalists unaffiliated or loosely affiliated with white supremacy.\n\nRead: The women making conspiracy theories beautiful\n\nIssues common to these groups accorded with ideas of purity, an interest in survivalism, and a deep distrust of the government. To be sure, the meaning of each of these issues would have been different to activists of different political persuasions, even in the same communities. Homeschooling, for instance, could be used in the white-power movement and as part of an intentional community or cult on the left. Midwifery might be powered by anti-feminism and strict gender divides on the right, or by women's liberation and ideas of empowerment on the left. Anti-technology might be only selectively applied in a right-wing compound, such as the Covenant, the Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, whose residents eschewed modern conveniences but manufactured land mines and automatic weapons in their remote Ozarks compound.\n\nAnother part of the Venn diagram is anti-fluoridation, the movement to oppose the government's addition of fluoride to drinking water to reduce dental decay. This cause was taken up from an individual-rights perspective by libertarians, who argued that public-infrastructure needs should not outweigh people's ability to make decisions about their own dental health. It was also treated by members of the right-wing John Birch Society as a communist conspiracy to undermine American public health. This alliance-between anti-communists and libertarians-is well documented in the history of American conservatism, and one can easily imagine how these two concerns could also be translated to social conservatives and survivalist evangelicals, to name a few other right-wing constituencies. Communism, after all, was seen as a threat to Christianity, and the individual-decisions argument resonated with social conservatives interested in other issues that depended on individual choice.\n\nAnti-fluoridation was also taken up by a former executive director of the Sierra Club, among other environmentalists who argued that fluoride was a risk to ecosystems and a pollutant. Alexandra Minna Stern's 2005 book, Eugenic Nation , documents the intersections between eugenics, hereditarianism, and other forms of white-supremacist pseudoscience on the one hand, and environmentalism in general and the Sierra Club in particular on the other. But such work has largely focused on the early 20th century, and it leaves out a main thread that connected the left and the right in the 1980s and '90s: the idea of a looming apocalypse. White-power activists worried that fluoride would make people docile, such that revolution against the state and race war would be harder to accomplish.\n\nIn the white-power movement, anti-fluoridation and the fear that the state would contaminate the water (or allow communists to do so) is particularly significant, given that they were also interested in water contamination as a warfare strategy. In the early 1980s, one white-power group planned to poison Chicago, New York, and Washington, D.C.'s water supply with 30 gallons of cyanide in order to foment revolution. By making this nightmare about fouled water come true, these activists believed, they could awaken the public, revealing the state as the enemy and bringing people to the cause.\n\nThe cyanide plan, luckily for Chicago, was prevented when the poison was seized during the bust of a white-power compound. But like poison in the water, extremism has spread.\n\nT he crunchy-to-alt-right pipeline brings up another problem, one that is very real and dangerous: the attempts of the white-power movement and the militant right to find recruits. Yet another factor shaping what's going on here is opportunism. White power is built around the movement's ability to understand where our mainstream culture is vulnerable, and to use those vulnerabilities for its own purposes.\n\nThe second-era Klan, of the 1920s, was anti-Black and anti-Semitic, but it also used local tensions to galvanize recruits. Where Mexicans and Mexican Americans lived on and near the border, the Klan was anti-Mexican and had members in the Border Patrol. In the Northwest, where labor unions threatened profits in the timber industry, it was anti-union. In the Northeast, where immigrants were arriving in large numbers from Eastern and Southern Europe, it was anti-immigrant. And in Indiana, especially near Notre Dame University, it was anti-Catholic. In each instance, Klan leaders married their knowledge of local public opinion and the group's broader objectives. They did so effectively, and the second-era Klan grew to some 4 million members , some of whom marched through the nation's capital with their face uncovered.\n\nFrom the July 1922 issue: The modern Ku Klux Klan\n\nThis scapegoat-driven opportunism has long appeared alongside a sort of cultural opportunism. In the 1920s, as Kathleen Blee has shown , you could buy a women's Klan auxiliary uniform in a fashionable cut that showed the right amount of ankle. In the 1980s, people in the white-power movement donned camouflage fatigues in part because they were a paramilitary formation interested in tactical readiness-but also because camouflage fatigues were cool in the '80s, the age of paintball and Soldier of Fortune magazine and a panoply of Vietnam War movies.\n\nIn opportunistic movements, we have to ask real questions about earnestness. Are the activists using local scapegoats and camouflage fatigues in a shrewd and craven way to manipulate possible recruits? Or do they believe what they're peddling? In the historical archive, there are examples of both kinds of behavior.\n\nThe pipeline is real; individual people are indeed being recruited into the militant right. Some of them make this journey through \"crunchy\" online spaces into white-power content, as the sociologist Cynthia Miller-Idriss has documented in Hate in the Homeland .\n\nBut the crunchy-to-alt-right-pipeline conversation gives us a chance to see something crucial that is often lost in depictions of right-wing formations. The white-power movement is not just men marching in the street. It's also women sharing cultural materials through social networks. Women, and the cultural materials upon which they exert their most intense influence, are where we can see that this is a social movement.\n\nSo if you come across \"crunchy\" content that clicks through to \"trad wives,\" for instance-women who appear to simply be canning and making their own cleaning supplies, but who embrace \"trad\" (traditional aesthetics) as part of a broader white-power ideology and quickly move you along to more radical content-you're encountering both a fluidity of belief and opportunism. Many people who advocate for \"crunchy\" issues expressed horror and surprise at the pipeline conversation because they felt manipulated-and yes, this is manipulation. It's direct recruitment.\n\nAnd let's not be confused about the endgame. White-power activists, then and now, envision an all-white ethnostate or world achieved through profound violence, and no macrobiotic diet or apple-cider-vinegar remedy can ameliorate that message."

      "text": "The Mantra of White Supremacy\n\nThe idea that anti-racist is a code word for \"anti-white\" is the claim of avowed extremists.\n\nB elow a Democratic donkey , the Fox News graphic read ANTI-WHITE MANIA . It flanked Tucker Carlson's face and overtook it in size. It was unmistakable. Which was the point.\n\nThe segment aired on June 25-the height of the manic attack on, and redefinition of, critical race theory, which Carlson has repeatedly cast as \"anti-white.\" It was one of his most incendiary segments of the year. \"The question is, and this is the question we should be meditating on, day in and day out, is how do we get out of this vortex, the cycle, before it's too late?\" Carlson asked . \"How do we save this country before we become Rwanda?\"\n\nDavid A. Graham: Tucker Carlson, unmasked\n\nSome white Americans have been led to fear that they could be massacred like the Tutsis of Rwanda. CRT=Marxism, Marxism→Genocide Every time , read a sign at a June 23 Proud Boys demonstration in Miami. Other white Americans have been led to fear America's teachers- 79 percent of whom are white-instructing \"kids to identify in racial terms,\" as Blake Masters, a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Arizona, said in May. \"You are good or bad, depending on what you look like. At this point it is straight up anti-white racism. I don't think we're allowed to say that. But let's call it what it is.\"\n\nEven when GOP politicians and operatives don't openly \"call it what it is,\" they end up echoing Masters nonetheless, saying without saying that \"critical race theory is explicitly anti-white,\" to use the words of Christopher F. Rufo, a travel-documentary filmmaker turned leading critic of CRT. At his final campaign rally, in Loudoun County, Virginia, Governor-elect Glenn Youngkin said , \"What we won't do is teach our children to view everything through a lens of race where we divide them into buckets and one group is an oppressor and the other is a victim and we pit them against each other and we steal their dreams.\"\n\nRepublicans provoked a backlash against CRT, which they also call anti-racism or wokism. Their backlash won 2021 elections. \"But it wasn't a backlash of parents,\" William Saletan found in his close study of polling data. \"It was a backlash of white people.\"\n\nHow many Americans know that the claim that anti-racism is harmful to white people is one of the basic mantras of white-supremacist ideology? Americans are familiar with white-supremacist movements like the Klan, skinheads, neo-Nazis, and the Proud Boys. But they don't seem to recognize white-supremacist ideology -the most venomous form of racist ideology. I suspect that many Americans don't know how much white-supremacist ideology shapes their political thought and America's political discourse, and allows juries to exonerate racism and convict anti-racism.\n\nW ith his ANTI-WHITE MANIA graphic, Tucker Carlson yet again presented the most dangerous mantra in American politics: Attacks on racism are really attacks on white Americans that lead to white people being harmed. \"Anti-racism is anti-white\" is the old and explosive mantra of avowed white supremacists. It has been their organizing vehicle, fueling their rage, fueling their backlashes, fueling their delusions .\n\nAll year long, this white-supremacist mantra has been fueling what Martin Luther King Jr. once called the \"white backlash\" against last year's racial reckoning. It is inciting voter-suppression policies and insurrections (to protect white political supremacy). It is inciting swarms of lies, insults, threats, and simulated killings of anti-racist Americans (who are branded as anti-white). It is inciting the false claim that anti-racist books and education are harmful to white children. It is inciting bans of those books and lessons. It is inciting the second assassination of King to justify those bans.\n\nIbram X. Kendi: There is no debate over critical race theory\n\nSome Democrats have predictably made it a bipartisan affair. As Nikole Hannah-Jones, the creator of the 1619 Project, recently told the Los Angeles Times , \"This idea that racial reckoning has gone too far and now white people are the ones suffering is the most predictable thing in the world if you understand American history.\"\n\nCentrists told abolitionists that they'd gone too far and provoked the backlash (causing southern secession). Centrists told King and other civil-rights activists that they'd gone too far and provoked the backlash (causing Democrats to lose elections in 1966 and 1968). Some centrist Democrats today say \"woke\" politics have gone too far and provoked the \" wokelash \" (causing Democrats to lose elections in 2021). \"Some of these people need to go to a 'woke' detox center or something,\" the Democratic political strategist James Carville said after the 2021 elections. \"They're expressing a language that people just don't use and there's backlash and a frustration at that.\" Actually, GOP operatives are expressing (or whistling) an anti-white language that anti-racists just don't use-and there's a backlash and frustration at that .\n\n\"Anti-racism is anti-white\" is the mantra dividing the Democratic Party, especially since the 2021 elections. It is the mantra unifying the Republican Party, especially since the 2020 election. There are numerous variations on this mantra. \"Wokeism\" or anti-racism or critical race theory or the 1619 Project or \"cancel culture\" or Black Lives Matter or anyone challenging racial inequity is said to be anti-white or racist or an anti-white racist. And variations on this mantra have become so ubiquitous in the American political discourse that people can easily dismiss or deny its origin in white-supremacist thought.\n\nW hen Robert Whitaker, 76 , died in June 2017, white supremacists reflected on his legacy online. \"Perhaps his most important, and most lasting, legacy is that his incessant promotion of the term 'anti-white' is now slowly but surely going mainstream,\" someone named \"Bellatrix\" said on Stormfront, the prominent white-supremacist website. \"A very important corner to turn indeed, as it is the rebuttal of the accusation of racist.\"\n\nWhitaker, a former economics professor and Reagan appointee to the Office of Personnel Management, had been radicalized as a young man in opposition to the civil-rights movement. He was a propagandist for more than half a century. But Whitaker's fame among the most extreme white supremacists came toward the end of his life, when he wrote a screed called \"The Mantra.\"\n\n\"Everybody says there is this race problem. Everybody says this race problem will be solved when the third world pours into every white country and only into white countries,\" Whitaker wrote in \"The Mantra,\" which he first posted on his blog and the websites of a neo-Nazi organization in 2006. \"But if I tell that obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide against my race, the white race, Liberals and respectable conservatives agree that I am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews.\"\n\n\"The Mantra\" ends with what has become the new mantra in American politics: \"They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-white. Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white.\"\n\nOver the next decade, and particularly after Barack Obama's election, a self-identified \" swarm \" of online trolls posted quotes and reprinted \"The Mantra\" online wherever they could, and attacked anti-racists as \"racist\" whenever they could.\n\nWhitaker's mantra has been linked to some of the deadliest acts of white-supremacist terror over the past decade. Anders Breivik murdered 77 people in Norway in 2011. On the day of his terrorist attack, the leader of the swarm, identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as Michigan anti-Semite Timothy Gallaher Murdock, was among some 1,000 people to whom Breivik sent his 1,500-page manifesto. The manifesto raged against \"anti-racist witch hunts\" and how \"the slightest excuse to label whites as 'racist' is continually sought\"; it railed against the \"quasi-religious undercurrent to the anti-racist movement\"; it seethed against the \"ridiculous pursuit of equality.\" And, again and again, Breivik numbered himself among the real victims. \"I consider myself to be an anti-racist, anti-fascist and anti-Nazi,\" he wrote. \"That's the main reason why I oppose Cultural Communism/European multiculturalism. THEY are the Nazis, they are the fascists and they are the racists! I have witnessed much racism in my time but 90% of it has been against Europeans.\"\n\nFrom the April 2019 issue: White nationalism's deep American roots\n\nDylann Roof, who in 2015 murdered nine Bible-studying African Americans in Charleston, South Carolina, posted his manifesto on a website named The Last Rhodesian. He included photographs of himself wearing a jacket patched with an old flag of Rhodesia, a former white-supremacist colony in southern Africa. Whitaker lived in Roof's hometown of Columbia, South Carolina, but there's no evidence Roof and Whitaker had any direct contact. But Roof might have had contact with Whitaker's ideas.\n\nMany Americans have had contact with Whitaker's ideas, likely without knowing it. In the days after Roof's massacre, Morris Dees and J. Richard Cohen, the founder and president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, pointed this out. \"In recent years, extremists have distilled the notion of white genocide to 'the mantra,' parts of which show up on billboards throughout the South, as well as Internet chat rooms,\" they wrote in June 2015. \"It proclaims 'Diversity = White Genocide' and 'Diversity Means Chasing Down the Last White Person,' blaming multiculturalism for undermining the 'white race.'\"\n\nWhite supremacists were quietly organizing elements of what's now Donald Trump's base. From the earliest days of Trump's presidential campaign in 2015, his support has been most concentrated among white Americans who think anti-whiteness is ascendant. Trump voters typically considered racism against white people to be a bigger problem than racism against people of color. Among white Americans who don't think there's much anti-white racism, support for Republican presidential candidates has actually fallen over the past decade.\n\nW hitaker did not create the mantra. He reproduced it. Since the very first Civil Rights Act, white supremacists have cast anti-racist bills as racist toward white people. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 defined citizenship, granted it to African Americans, and affirmed that all citizens are equally protected by the law. But President Andrew Johnson vetoed it, arguing that \"the distinction of race and color is by the bill made to operate in favor of the colored against the white race.\" In an address to Congress in 1867, Johnson opposed voting rights for Black men, fearing \"the dread of Negro supremacy\" and the \"subjection\" of \"white people of the South.\" In his best-selling 1874 book, the journalist James S. Pike described South Carolina's interracial legislature as denying \"the exercise of the rights of white communities, because they are white.\" When an anti-lynching bill came before the U.S. Senate in 1938, Senator and lifelong Klansman Theodore Bilbo of Mississippi said its passage \"will open the floodgates of hell in the South.\"\n\nWhen a new civil-rights plank was added to the Democratic Party's platform, southern segregationists walked out of the Democratic National Convention in 1948. They formed the States' Rights Democratic Party, known popularly as the Dixiecrats, running Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina for U.S. president. \"We affirm that the effective enforcement of such a [civil-rights] program would be utterly destructive of the social, economic and political life of the Southern people,\" their platform stated .\n\nThomas Abernethy, the Jim Crow segregationist and U.S. representative from Mississippi, feared that the Civil Rights Act of 1957 would create \"nothing short of an assemblage of powerful Federal meddlers and spies created for the purpose of tormenting, abusing, and embarrassing southern white people.\" During his 24-hour-long filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Thurmond cited a newspaper article that warned of the \"persecution\" that white people could face under the law.\n\nWhen the Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed, opponents of racial equity largely stopped openly claiming that anti-racist measures were harmful to white people. They instead claimed that anti-racist efforts to remedy racial inequality constituted \"reverse discrimination\" or \"reverse racism\" (against white people). They weaponized the very Civil Rights Acts they had long opposed against the policies and programs leading to integration, enfranchisement, racial equity, and racial justice. When the medicine is rebranded as the disease, the disease will inevitably persist-and it has.\n\nAllen J. Ellender, the Jim Crow segregationist and senator from Louisiana, framed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as \"discrimination ... being practiced to wipe out discrimination.\" In a televised presidential-campaign speech in 1976, Ronald Reagan said , \"If you happen to belong to an ethnic group not recognized by the federal government as entitled to special treatment, you are a victim of reverse discrimination.\" In 1995, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas said , \"You cannot give somebody preference over somebody else without discriminating against the person who is not receiving the preference.\" Or, as Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in 2009, \"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"\n\nF or five decades since the civil-rights movement, Republicans (and many non-Republicans) have expressed two conflicting racial mantras: (1) racism no longer exists, and (2) racism is spreading against white people. Since Joe Biden's election, this second mantra has overtaken the first.\n\nWhite-supremacist ideology lives on what Heather McGhee calls the \"zero-sum myth,\" the idea that progress for people of color necessarily comes at white folks' expense. This zero-sum myth erases the past and present of abolitionist and anti-racist movements, which have aided ordinary white people. It fearmongers about the future: If white people are not worshipped in schools, then they will be demonized; if white people don't reign supreme, then they will be subjugated; if white people don't hoard resources and opportunities, then they will be starved; if white people cannot kill at will, then they will be killed at will. White violence is presumed to be self-defense. Defending yourself against a white supremacist is presumed to be a criminal act.\n\nRead: The language of white supremacy\n\nExtreme fear perhaps breeds this extreme fear. White supremacists probably fear revenge, retaliation, the tables turning-as they wipe the blood of democracy, of equality, of the dying and dead off their hands. Like the enslavers of old sleeping with guns under their pillows, they know the level of brutality they have leveled against people of color and their white allies. They probably can't imagine that Indigenous anti-racists just want their land back and aren't genocidal; that Black anti-racists just want reparations and don't want to enslave; that Asian anti-racists just want to be visible and don't want to render white people invisible; that Latino and Middle Eastern anti-racists just want to flee violence and don't want to invade predominantly white nations. White supremacists are mobilizing against an anti-white army that isn't mobilizing, that isn't coming, that isn't there. Then again, if there is an army that is mobilizing, that is coming, that is here-it is made up of white supremacists. Their carnage is here. Their ideology, too.\n\nI n 1956, 19 senators and 77 representatives issued a manifesto . \"Parents should not be deprived by Government of the right to direct the lives and education of their own children,\" the legislators wrote . They decried \"destroying the amicable relations between\" the \"races\" and the planting of \"hatred and suspicion where there has been heretofore friendship and understanding.\" They feared that \"if done, this is certain to destroy the system of public education in some of the states.\"\n\nThese Jim Crow congressmen expressed \"the gravest concern\" for this \"dangerous condition.\" These avowed segregationists cast their ilk as \"the victims.\" These white supremacists commended all who \"have declared the intention to resist\" the desegregation of schools. Sixty-five years ago, they did their best to redefine desegregation and racial equality as anti-white mania.\n\nHistory reproduces itself. But when people don't know history-or are barred from learning it-how can they ever recognize its reproduction?"

      "text": "Conservatives Are Defending a Sanitized Version of 'The Great Replacement'\n\nTheir reaction to the Buffalo shooting shows that the racist theory has now entered the Republican mainstream.\n\nUpdated at 10:54 a.m. ET on May 19, 2022.\n\nThree years ago, when a white-supremacist fanatic killed dozens of people in El Paso, Texas, the reaction from the right was unreserved condemnation . When another white-supremacist fanatic killed 10 people at a supermarket in a Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York, last week, the reaction from some figures on the right was to acknowledge that the guy had a point about this whole \"replacement\" thing.\n\nLarge sections of the manifesto attributed to the Buffalo shooter were plagiarized from the writings of the perpetrator of another racist massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand . Both share the premise that violence against nonwhite people is justified to prevent \"white genocide\" or the \"replacement\" of white Americans by nonwhite immigrants. As the alleged Buffalo shooter put it, he carried out the attack because \"all black people are replacers just by existing in White countries.\" I would offer to explain how Black people got to the United States , but who knows if \"critical race theory\" remains legal where you're reading this.\n\nIn recent years, Fox News has consciously amplified the same line of argument, with popular hosts such as Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham echoing its logic. Carlson, for example, has said that \"the Democratic Party is trying to replace the current electorate, the voters now casting ballots, with new people, more obedient voters from the Third World,\" while Ingraham has maintained that Democrats \"want to replace you, the American voters, with newly amnestied citizens and an ever increasing number of chain migrants.\" Having promoted the conspiracy theory for years, Carlson told his audience recently that \"we're still not sure what it is,\" before reaffirming its veracity.\n\nThis noxious ideology is now too popular on the right to isolate without risking bitter intraconservative conflict, and so, as the New York writer Jonathan Chait notes, right-wing media figures have taken to defending and rationalizing the claims that motivated the shooter, while condemning the violence itself.\n\nHelen Lewis: The intersectionality of hate\n\n\"So just to get this straight, the Left argues that demographics are destiny, that demographics change in America will inevitably lead to a progressive majority-and it's Republicans who are echoing the Great Replacement Theory?\" huffed the conservative pundit Ben Shapiro . National Review 's editor in chief, Rich Lowry, posited that it was true that \"Democrats want higher levels of immigration to change national elections.\"\n\nAt the core of the idea of American democracy is a promise of civic equality, initially extended just to a chosen few. The key political conflicts of American history have been over expanding that promise. The \"white genocide\" or \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy theory rests on the ideological principle that certain people should be excluded from that promise, or that extending it to them would constitute a form of bondage for those to whom the promise was originally kept. Because the threat of the interlopers-whether religious, racial, or ethnic-is existential, it justifies violence, in the form of murder, disenfranchisement, or dispossession. The ideology of the Great Replacement is a particular threat to democratic governance because it insists that entire categories of human beings can or should be excluded from democratic rights and protections. Any political cause can theoretically inspire terrorism, but this one is unlike others in that what it demands of its targets is their non-existence.\n\nIn 1916, the American immigration restrictionist Madison Grant published The Passing of the Great Race, which argued that immigration was destroying America's traditional \" Anglo-Saxon \" population and along with it the tradition of self-governance. Grant's ideas were popular and influential. They provided the impetus for racist immigration laws passed in the 1920s , which sought to limit not only African and Asian immigration but also that of Eastern and Southern Europeans, who were deemed genetically inferior to their Northern European counterparts. Adolf Hitler cited these racist laws as an inspiration , but some ascendant nativist intellectuals on the right now commonly refer to their repeal as a great catastrophe .\n\nThere are two versions of the \"replacement\" conspiracy theory, but both of them share the same basic premise. The first version is the idea that a secret cabal (typically one that is composed of Jews) is fostering demographic change in the United States through immigration in order to replace its white population-the motive of mass murderers in Pittsburgh , El Paso, and now Buffalo. The second is that liberals are fostering demographic change in the United States through immigration in order to replace its white population. Both conceive of America as fundamentally white and Christian, and in so doing posit not only a racial conception of citizenship but a racial hierarchy, one that must be maintained if America's true nature is to endure. That these theories are now embraced by the descendants of some of the very European immigrants whom Grant considered racially inferior might have shocked him, but that just shows how arbitrary and socially determined such categories are.\n\nKathleen Belew: White power, white violence\n\nThis conspiracy theory has grown so popular among key GOP figures that the conservative elite can no longer condemn it unreservedly. Instead, some prominent conservatives have chosen to defend it in sanitized form, arguing that the Democratic Party's support for immigration reform is a plot to, as Representative Elise Stefanik of New York put it in an ad last year , \"overthrow our current electorate and create a permanent liberal majority in Washington.\" Note the notion that an \"electorate\" can be \"overthrown\" by being outvoted, as though Republican electoral defeat is by definition illegitimate-especially if that victory is enabled by the wrong kind of voters .\n\nBut all versions of this conspiracy theory are not only racist; they are also false. Democrats and Republicans alike have, at various times, sought comprehensive immigration reform as a way to win over Latino and Asian American voters-and implicit in this is the idea that they need to be won over . George W. Bush tried to do it in 2006 and was foiled by a talk-radio revolt ; Barack Obama tried to pass an immigration reform bill and failed because his ramping up of immigration enforcement and deportation did not bring Republicans to the negotiating table. Republicans briefly reconsidered the idea after losing the 2012 election, and instead walked the path of Trumpism. As with Obama, Biden's decision to leave many of Trump's immigration policies in place has done nothing to quiet conservative hysteria about \"open borders.\"\n\nThe argument that the growing nonwhite population is intrinsically advantageous to Democrats is itself absurd, because racial identities are no more fixed than political ones , the migration of mid-20th century \"white ethnics\" from the Democratic column to the Republican column being an object lesson. If any Democrats or Republicans believe that demographic change inherently advantages one party over the other , they are tremendously foolish. For any conservative worried that immigrants will lead to permanent Democratic rule, I've got some wonderful news: History has shown that will never happen.\n\nThe 2020 election, if anything, illustrated the persuadability of such voters, as Donald Trump amassed historic margins with Latino voters in Florida and along the Rio Grande valley. That communities in Texas, for example, where policing the border and extractive industries employ large numbers of residents, would choose Trump over Joe Biden should not be surprising . These voters are no less rational or independent than white people, and Republican nativism is clearly insufficient to make them reliable Democratic stalwarts. They are not mystically immune to conservative arguments about religion, culture, economics, or even immigration; in fact, many immigrants arrive in the United States sharing such premises. The hypothesis that immigration reform would be an overwhelming boon among such voters has been disproved; Trump won many of them over while enacting immigration policies that were both cruel and counterproductive .\n\nNevertheless, the conspiracy theory of a Great Replacement is now part of the Republican mainstream , as I warned it would become four years ago . During the Trump administration, conservative elites could distance themselves from Trump as an individual while still supporting his policies. But now that so many important Republicans have embraced the idea, the conservative elite must find a way to make the sanitized version of this genocidal nonsense respectable. A strain of self-implicating paranoia underlines the entire concept, the fear that once they are a minority, white people will be subject to revenge for the dark chapters of American history , a past that Republican-controlled states are attempting to erase .\n\nGraeme Wood: Why Tucker Carlson should want the Buffalo manifesto made public\n\nLiberals can do nothing to prevent conservatives from embracing this conspiracy theory, beyond forcing Republicans to pay a political price at the ballot box. It would be better, by far, if prominent conservatives persuaded their comrades to reject this perverse ideology, rather than attempt to sanitize it for mainstream consumption. If their recent reaction to the Buffalo shooter is any guide, though, they have chosen a different path.\n\nThis article originally stated that the Buffalo shooter plagiarized his manifesto from the perpetrator of a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas; it was in fact from the manifesto of the man who attacked Muslim worshippers in Christchurch, New Zealand."

      "text": "The Intersectionality of Hate\n\nWhy an anti-Black shooter's manifesto is also steeped in anti-Semitism\n\n\"The idea is if we don't look out the white race will be-will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff; it's been proved.\"\n\nThese are not the words of the teenager who walked into a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, on Saturday to hunt down Black Americans, although they might as well be. These are the words of Tom Buchanan, a rich, repugnant character in the 1925 novel The Great Gatsby.\n\nShortly before the massacre in Buffalo, authorities say, the shooter published a 180-page document that is an unpleasant mixture of the disconcertingly new and the horribly familiar. Underneath the superficial novelty of the suspect's alleged actions (livestreaming the atrocity on Twitch, publishing the manifesto on Google Docs) and his vocabulary (his complaint about buying a \"cucked\" assault rifle that he had to modify, for example) is a sprawling, discredited ideology that was once entertained by respectable people and has now crept back toward the mainstream.\n\nGraeme Wood: Why Tucker Carlson should want the Buffalo manifesto made public\n\nThe manifesto is steeped in early-20th-century scientific racism -which motivated Gatsby 's Buchanan-and the anti-Semitism that so often accompanied it. The document contains pages of memes about Jewish control of the world, plus scientific-looking scattergraphs of IQs broken down by racial group. Call this the intersectionality of hate: Just as academics have pointed out that marginalized identities (race, class, sex, disability) can overlap and reinforce one another, so too can old hatreds. Far-right movements are flexible about identifying the \"other\" from which their adherents are supposedly under threat. Many fascists see liberated women as a symbol of social decadence and decline. The KKK also targeted Jews. That an anti-Black racist like the Buffalo shooter would also be in thrall to anti-Semitic tropes might seem surprising, but intersectional hate is a totalizing ideology. Every new talking point is woven into the same tapestry, in which white men are at the center, protecting \"their\" women, and everyone else is at the margins.\n\nThe Buffalo shooter is open about the source of his radicalization. It was the internet, and specifically an anonymous discussion board on 4chan. \"There I learned through infographics, shitposts, and memes that the White race is dying out,\" he writes. He distributes the blame among Black Americans-whom he depicts as violent and lazy-and \"the Jews and the elite\" who control them.\n\nAlthough he doesn't mention them by name, the shooter's grievance also lies with white women, through his invocation of falling birth rates and the \"Great Replacement,\" a conspiracy theory that accuses left-wing politicians of encouraging immigration to undermine majority white, Christian societies and create new, obedient voter bases. In his mythology, Black Americans are among \"the replacers\"-a dehumanizing term repeatedly invoked in the document-while the masterminds of the replacement are Jews. This is one example of how hatreds amplify one another: If Black Americans are so inferior, how can they be a threat to the glorious white race? Ah, because they are being directed by shadowy puppet masters. And which group has been cast in this role throughout history? The Jews.\n\nYair Rosenberg: Why so many people still don't understand anti-Semitism\n\nAlthough the American strain of white supremacy is distinctive, recent terrorists have been influenced by many overlapping ideas. The man who massacred 51 people at a New Zealand mosque in 2019 subscribed to the European version of Great Replacement theory, in which the demographic attack comes from Muslims, and Jews do not prominently feature. The gunman who killed 23 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, the same year released a manifesto warning of a \"Hispanic invasion.\" The man who set fire to a mosque and shot four people in a synagogue in Poway, California , insisted in his own screed that Jews deserved to die \"for their role in feminism which has enslaved women in sin.\"\n\nThe ideology might be flexible, but it always returns the same answer: The West is in decline; the white race is under threat, and it must be protected by violence. In place of the messy truth that migration is a continuous churn driven by war, famine, and individuals' desire for a better life, the Great Replacement suggests a coherent plan controlled by knowable forces. Such theories thrive in hard times, because they offer themselves as an antidote to chaos.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Francis Galton and other then-respected scientists talked earnestly about classifying humans into \"superior\" and \"inferior\" races. Galton's heirs used the new technology of the IQ test, originally developed to identify children struggling at school, to collect proof of the alleged superiority of Europeans. Their work depended on definitions of whiteness, and rigid racial categories, that have since been debunked. (At various times in American history, Polish, Irish, and Italian immigrants would not have been considered white in the same way as those of \"Nordic stock.\") Today's geneticists know better than to build their work on such shifting sands.\n\nNevertheless, the blithe assertions of early eugenicists and scientific racists are now being recast, a century later, in the clunky visual style of the modern internet, with its homemade cut-and-paste jobs of text overlaid on graphics. The anti-Semitic tropes in the Buffalo shooter's manifesto could come straight from The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , a fabricated text about a minority with disproportionate powers to control the world, or Henry Ford's Dearborn Independent . But these ideas are presented in picture form. Page after page identifies people who hold important jobs as Jews; readers are left to form their own (predestined) conclusion. Also included are tables of supposedly Jewish facial features that could have come straight from a 19th-century phrenology handbook. \"He's saying something that I've never seen so clearly expressed before,\" Adam Rutherford, a British geneticist who writes about scientific racism, told me. \"He was radicalized by infographics.\"\n\nKathleen Belew: White power, white violence\n\nThe slapdash, collage style of the manifesto is the true novelty here; the author discusses his underwear, his lunch plans, and his Myers-Briggs profile alongside his murderous hatred of Black Americans, Jews, and other races. This format underscores how today's terrorists tend to radicalize themselves, alone, at home. They are technically \"lone wolves\" but are in constant dialogue with the internet's bleakest corners. The blizzard of facts and figures on far-right websites flatters them into thinking they have followed a trail of clues and arrived at the truth themselves, unlike the blinkered herd. It is a narcissistic fantasy that casts the young radical as the hero of his own quest-a detective story in which he is an active participant. Many mass shooters have a sense of grievance in search of a mythology. The manifesto's author claims that he found communism at age 12 but rejected it when he found something more useful to his psychological needs.\n\nRutherford, the author of the book How to Argue With a Racist , studies how academic research into intelligence and population genetics is laundered for use on white-supremacist websites. He cites the example of a mainstream paper on inheritance that featured a scatterplot on characteristics of people of Jewish descent, and ended up in racist internet posts. The simple addition of group labels such as \"quadroon Jews\"-a term repurposed from Jim Crow-era America-transformed a careful scientific study into a piece of racist propaganda. \"This is using science to prop up a preexisting ideology. It's exactly what happened in the 1900s with the [genetics] work of Gregor Mendel-the eugenicists seized on it,\" Rutherford said. \"It's the same as it ever was. New techniques, old story.\"\n\nPeople drawn to intersectional omni-hatred can find multiple on-ramps online. One way into this mindset is through tasteless jokes-many users of sites such as 4chan see mocking the Holocaust as thrillingly transgressive. But ironic anti-Semitism expressed for shock value can shade into overt, unironic anti-Semitism expressed as a genuine belief. Another on-ramp is the debate, now simmering for more than a century, about the supposed connection between race and intelligence . Modern geneticists are reluctant to make sweeping statements about populations, but their nuanced disputes about the influence of environment versus heredity are presented instead by the far right as the left-wing suppression of obvious but unspeakable facts. (The resurgence of scientific racism as a political force poses a challenge to genetics researchers, many of whom would prefer to dodge these controversial questions altogether but risk leaving the field clear for cranks.)\n\nAdam Serwer: Demography is not destiny\n\nAnti-feminism is also a route to the far right . Nearly all mass shooters are men, and the tone of many far-right sites assumes that all their readers are male. White women mainly exist in this ideology to be protected from rape by \"invaders\" or from their own desire to have children with nonwhite men. Feminism is a threat because it frees women from men's economic control and might encourage them to pursue careers at the expense of motherhood. The Buffalo shooter invoked a white-supremacist slogan: \"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\" The \"we\" are white men, framed as soldiers and martyrs, posing as the heroic defenders of the weak. A power fantasy is baked into this ideology, but so is fear-a clammy horror of becoming redundant and obsolete.\n\nIn the 1920s and '30s, a prominent man could voice his discriminatory thoughts about \"inferior\" races and \"the international Jew\" out loud, in public; Gatsby 's fictional Buchanan had real-life counterparts in Ford and Father Coughlin . In the century since, pseudoscientific racism has been driven to the margins of society and appears instead in watered-down forms, in allusions, winks, and dog whistles. (Especially after the Buffalo shooting, the Fox News host Tucker Carlson has been widely criticized for promoting the Great Replacement theory. But as my colleague Graeme Wood notes, Carlson could not keep his job if he presented it in the grotesque terms expressed in the shooter's manifesto.) Yet the banishment of overt scientific racism from the public square has given it a new glamour online, where it marinates alongside other forms of hatred and draws adherents who convince themselves that urgent truths are being suppressed. That mindset allows young men to brick themselves inside a mental castle of half-truths and old lies, fed by their own sense that they deserved better, and they could be remembered as a hero, if only they picked up a gun."

      "text": "The Double Terror of Being Black in America\n\nStructural racism killed Black people in east Buffalo, and then a gunman killed the survivors.\n\nI loved strawberry shortcake as a child in New York City. The sliced strawberries, the juice, the softest of cake, that whipped cream. I loved it all individually. And together? Pure bliss.\n\nCelestine Chaney loved strawberry shortcake too. A 65-year-old mother and grandmother of six, Chaney took strawberry-shortcake making to another level. She'd buy \"those little cake cups,\" her son, Wayne Jones, told The Buffalo News . \"You cut the strawberries up, sprinkle sugar over them, and leave in the refrigerator overnight. The juice from the strawberries is poured in the cup, and you put whipped cream on top.\"\n\nChaney went to Tops grocery store on Saturday afternoon to purchase the ingredients for her strawberry shortcake. I'm picturing how Chaney must have intended to take her little cakes out of the refrigerator on Sunday after attending Elim Christian Fellowship. I'm picturing this grandmother closing her eyes and swaying her head as she bites into her cake. Moments feel like minutes as she swallows. Bliss suspends time-especially strawberry-shortcake bliss.\n\nOn Saturday, though, Chaney was one of 10 people whom an 18-year-old white supremacist allegedly murdered with an assault rifle. She survived the lethality of racist policy; survived breast cancer like my mother and partner, at a time when Black women are the most likely to die of that disease. But Chaney wasn't able to survive racist violence. For Black people to survive both racist policy and racist violence is grueling. To live as a Black American is to be a survivor.\n\nEsau McCaulley: America isn't ready to truly understand the Buffalo shooting\n\nChaney's killer denied all this. Racist theories deny the racist structure of American policies, the ubiquity of racist violence, and the obvious and ongoing structural violence revealed by racial disparities. The heartbeat of being racist is denial. The deeper the denial, the more diabolical the racist theory.\n\nThe most diabolical of all racist ideas operating today-the theory reaching the very depths of denialism, the theory that replaces reality perhaps more than any other-is the \"Great Replacement\" theory , or GRT, a white-supremacist conspiracy theory cited in a screed linked to the Buffalo shooter. But versions of GRT have also been spread by Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump, and many other powerful political and media figures in the United States today. GRT denies the greatest white privilege : life itself. It denies the greatest Black deprivation: life itself.\n\nGreat Replacement theorists believe that Democrats, liberals, progressives, immigrants, Black people, Asians, Latino people, Muslims, \"abortionists,\" and Jews are trying to replace the \"native\"-born and \"original\" white populations in their countries. \"No longer would I just accept our replacement,\" the author of the Buffalo screed said. \"No longer would I just accept our genocide. No longer will I willingly serve the people who are trying to end me and my race. I would have to take the fight to the replacers myself.\"\n\nWhat group did the Buffalo shooter choose to target? He selected \"an obvious, visible, and large group of replacers.\" He chose Black people, he explained, because \"all black people are replacers just by existing in White countries.\"\n\nImagine how much a white supremacist has to replace reality in order to believe that white people-who remain on the higher end of nearly every racial disparity-are being killed off, that they are being replaced, that they are being harmed, and that to protect themselves, they need to attack the very Black people who are actually on the lower end of nearly every racial disparity. The Great Replacement theory wholly replaces reality, presenting the dying as the living, and the living as the dying.\n\nBlack people are more likely than white people to die in pregnancy , before their first birthdays , and from heart disease , cancer , unintentional injuries , strokes , diabetes , influenza and pneumonia , kidney disease , and COVID-19 -eight of the 10 leading causes of death in the United States.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the overall life expectancy in the United States fell by a year and a half, the steepest decline since World War II. Latino Americans and Black Americans saw the largest drop in life expectancy (three years and 2.9 years, respectively), while white Americans faced the smallest decline (1.2 years), according to a report from the CDC.\n\nFrom the July/August 2018 issue: Being Black in America can be hazardous to your health\n\nThe racial disparities in life expectancy had been narrowing for decades. In 1993, white Americans expected to live 7.1 more years than Black Americans. In 2019, the gap was 4.1 years. But the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black people reversed the trend. In 2020, white Americans were expected to live 5.8 years longer than Black Americans.\n\nAccording to a preliminary analysis , life expectancy in the United States continued to decline in 2021, while bouncing back in other wealthy countries. This continued U.S. decline was almost entirely driven by deaths among white Americans, according to estimates-not because people of color are replacing them but, in part, because white people accounted for a larger share of people opposing COVID vaccines and the policies that reduce the spread of the disease, according to researchers . Some of the very people pushing the Great Replacement theory were convincing their white viewers, readers, and constituents to resist shutdowns, to not wear masks, to not get vaccinated. Why? As my Atlantic colleague Adam Serwer observed back in May 2020: \"To restrict the freedom of white Americans, just because nonwhite Americans are dying, is an egregious violation of the racial contract.\"\n\nTragically, white people are still dying of racist whiteness and blaming their deaths on Black and Latino people, who are dying at even higher rates from the same racist whiteness-its structural violence, its unending terror, its vicious neglect. The most prominent Great Replacement theorists, who claim to care about white lives, don't seem to care about white lives as they pour toxic disinformation and racist ideas into white communities, causing many white people to hardly care about people of color. If there's anything white people should have learned from the pandemic, it is this: To not care about people of color is to not care about people.\n\n\"Before I begin I will say that I was not born racist nor grew up to be racist,\" the screed said. \"I simply became racist after I learned the truth.\"\n\nKathleen Belew: White power, white violence\n\nThe Buffalo killer started to be racist when he learned to deny the truth. The historical truth is that racist policy has allowed white Americans to enjoy remarkable unearned privilege. Efforts to roll back racist policy, to create equity, are not an attack on white people but an attack on racism. As white privileges are rolled back, the privileges of living in a democratic, healthy, safe, equitable, and just society are rolled forward for everyone in the society, including white people.\n\nBut no: Great Replacement theorists refuse to acknowledge all the porous conditions and policies causing white people to die at high rates from all the leading causes of death-and people of color to die at even higher rates. They refuse to discuss racial disparities in mortality, in life expectancy.\n\nBut if communities of color are particularly vulnerable, they have also responded to death and harm and disease by caring for others. Latino Americans (21 percent), African Americans (20.3 percent), and Asian Americans (19.7 percent) have a higher reported prevalence of caregiving than White Americans (16.9 percent). African American caregivers are more likely to experience high burdens from caregiving than their white peers, and on average, spend 10 more hours per week on caregiving.\n\nRuth Whitfield, the 86-year-old mother of a retired Buffalo fire commissioner, visited her husband at a nursing home, a visit she made every day without fail. After her visit on Saturday, she stopped by Tops for groceries. She was killed. Roberta Drury, 32 years old, shopped all the time at Tops for her brother and his family. \"We don't really have family in the area, so it was just a great help that she could do something for us like that,\" her brother, Christopher Moyer, told NPR . Moyer needed this help because he is recovering from leukemia. His sister was killed too.\n\nBlack and Latino people with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are more likely to die of the disease than white people. \"Structural racism assessed by census tract variables accounts for nearly all Black-White and Hispanic-White disparity in AML survival,\" researchers found in a recent study in Blood .\n\nStructural racism killed Black people in east Buffalo and then the gunman killed the survivors. In 2018, a local report found the Buffalo-Niagara region to be one of the most segregated in the nation. \"Segregation imposes a wide range of costs on people of color, impairing their health, education, job access, and wealth,\" the Partnership for the Public Good concluded . \"Individuals living in segregated neighborhoods tend to have less access to services that allow adequate standards of living, and their economic mobility is severely impaired.\" The neighborhood that the white supremacist targeted had long experienced food apartheid; the Tops grocery store was the \"only nearby source of fresh, nutritious food,\" reported The Buffalo News .\n\nThe victims of this white supremacist had been striving to address the effects of racist policy and make up for the lack of goods and services in this Black community. Deacon Heyward Patterson often drove people to this sole grocery store and had gone to the soup kitchen before going to Tops on Saturday. The white supremacist killed Patterson as he helped someone put packages in their car.\n\nHelen Lewis: The intersectionality of hate\n\nPearly Young-Miss Pearly, as the 77-year-old was known-ran a food pantry in the area for 25 years. At church, she taught Sunday school, worked with youth, and often cooked large pots of vegetable soup for everyone. Katherine Massey, a 72-year-old member of a group called We Are Women Warriors, had written several letters to Buffalo publications calling for stricter gun-control measures to keep her community safe. She was killed by a man armed with an assault rifle and the lethal idea that Black people like her were the replacers. The horror is unspeakable, like when enslavers cast themselves as benevolently paternal, and cast the enslaved, who they tortured, as violent beasts.\n\nIt is one thing to deny the racist policy structure harming and killing Black people and other people. But the depths of racist denial are reached when white supremacists frame Black people as the primary perpetrators and white people as the primary victims of racial harm. This ideology stirs and justifies white-supremacist terror (and the terrible veiling of lethally racist policy structure). Black people are facing the double terror of racist policy and racist violence. Victims of racism are being mass murdered again and again.\n\nBut through it all, through all the pain and mourning, through all the Great Replacement theories replacing reality, Black people have been like the victims of this latest mass murder: finding bliss with strawberry shortcakes, caring for the sick and shut in, and never wavering in our anti-racist resistance. Black people have never wavered in our efforts to abolish the double terror, have never wavered in our struggle to live, have never wavered in allying with other people facing similar racist terrors, have never wavered in the human pursuit of joy, of peace, of beauty. And we never will."

      "text": "Trump Is Too Thin-Skinned to Protect the United States\n\nThe president's aides are reluctant even to broach the dangers of white racist violence in his presence.\n\nStop me if you've heard this one: There's a dangerous threat to United States security. It's widely acknowledged by many top officials in the Trump administration. But the government remains stuck in neutral, paralyzed by a fear of offending the president.\n\nThis is the story of Russian electoral interference, but it is also the story of white racist violence. In the face of a verified-and lethal-threat, President Donald Trump has been slow to deal with the threat of domestic extremist violence inside the U.S., The New York Times reports , because aides are nervous about bringing it up. The problem of domestic terror has new relevance now, after the massacre in El Paso, Texas, but already the president's attention has wandered to other topics.\n\nThe problem is, at heart, political correctness. Although that epithet is most often lobbed at the left by conservatives, it fits Trump's behavior. Discussion of domestic terrorism and white violence has become politically incorrect within the president's vicinity. The problem is not factual inaccuracy-it's that bringing the issue up triggers Trump's sensitivities so seriously that speaking the truth becomes taboo.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump refuses to defend the United States\n\n\"Officials at [DHS] have felt they could not broach topics like domestic terrorism and white supremacist violence with Mr. Trump because he was not interested in those concerns,\" the Times reports. Aides are right to be nervous. Trump has shown in the past that he has little patience for aides who tell him hard truths he doesn't want to hear.\n\nFollowing the August 3 shooting in El Paso, the president briefly acknowledged the alleged shooter's motivation. \"The shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online consumed by racist hate,\" Trump said at the White House . \"In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated.\"\n\nYet within days, the president had moved on to fuming about coverage of his trip to El Paso, spreading conspiracy theories about the death of Jeffrey Epstein, and picking fights with the comedian Bill Maher. He has also gestured toward the possibility of expanding background checks for gun ownership, but dropped talk about white supremacy.\n\nDespite a long record of racist remarks and actions , Trump is infuriated by any suggestion that he might be a racist. He seems to believe that acknowledging a serious problem of white racist violence during his presidency would reflect poorly on his leadership, just as acknowledging Russian interference in the 2016 election would call the legitimacy of his victory into question. In both cases, he is correct. But ignoring the problems will not make either go away, so the president's thin skin is preventing him from dealing with a genuine threat to the nation.\n\nThe federal government's inadequate response to white racist violence predates Trump. Early in the Obama administration, a Department of Homeland Security report warned about a rise in the phenomenon. But Barack Obama's team bowed to pressure from conservatives who accused the government of political correctness. Trump was among the right-wing figures who complained that the Obama administration wouldn't name \"radical Islamic terror\" as a threat. DHS withdrew the report.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the government has remained flat-footed, now because of Trump's antipathy to the topic of domestic terrorism and white supremacy. In effect, he is guilty of a mirror image of the accusation he made against Obama. Trump said Obama wouldn't name \"radical Islamic terror\" out of fears of political correctness, but his own sensitivities mean his administration has looked away from the threat of domestic terror out of its own sense of what is politically correct.\n\nRead: An oral history of Trump's bigotry\n\nWhite racists were an important part of Trump's winning coalition in 2016, although by no means all of it, and Trump has signaled that exacerbating racial tensions will be a central part of his 2020 reelection campaign, too. The president has downplayed the threat posed by white nationalists and white supremacists. After a violent white-supremacist march in Charlottesville, the president focused on what he insisted were \"good people on both sides.\" After a white-supremacist shooter killed 51 people in New Zealand, Trump said he was not worried about the threat posed by the ideology, saying, \"I think it's a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.\"\n\nThe FBI disagreed. In testimony in July , Director Chris Wray, a Trump appointee, said that his agents had made nearly as many domestic-terrorism arrests as global-terrorism arrests over the previous nine months, with most of them related to white supremacy. That number may obscure more than it tells, too: Since the federal government has been more focused on global terrorism, it stands to reason it would have made more arrests in that area as well. But Trump doesn't trust the FBI, even after cleaning out its previous leadership-another legacy of the president's fury about the Russia investigation.\n\nOne part of the problem is insufficient resources and attention. As I have written , Trump tends to view DHS as almost exclusively an immigration-enforcement agency, which means that other concerns of the kludgy department, including cybersecurity, election safety, and domestic terrorism, get scant attention. But the Justice Department has still managed to find resources to investigate supposed \"black-identity extremists.\"\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump's border obsession is courting disaster\n\nThis reluctance to confront white racist violence occurred before 22 people were killed in El Paso. Could that prove a turning point for Trump on domestic terror? Sure-but it probably won't be. That's just not Trump's style. The president has refused to even acknowledge the fact of Russian interference, let alone respond to it, despite unanimity among his aides-a refusal that would be slapstick were it not so dire.\n\nWhite racist violence is a real political liability for Trump. A large majority of Americans say that white nationalism is either an important or a critical threat, and a majority also say that Trump's actions and behaviors have encouraged white supremacists. A typical politician, faced with such a situation, would take some steps to inoculate himself, ranging from the largely symbolic (a blue-ribbon commission) to the more substantial (major new programs or funding). For Trump, even acknowledging the problem is anathema. In this White House, protecting the president's feelings comes before protecting citizens' lives."

      "text": "Inner-City Violence in the Age of Mass Incarceration\n\nHarsh criminal-justice policies have thrown America's poorest urban communities into chaos.\n\nOver the summer, media outlets across the country fixated on the mounting death toll of young people in inner cities across America. \"11 shot, including 3-year-old boy, as Chicago gun violence worsens,\" read the large headline of one major U.S. newspaper , while another, the Chicago Tribune , published a painfully graphic photo essay that chronicled the degree to which gun violence in particular had shocked and destabilized entire neighborhoods in 2014.\n\nThis fall, television reporters still stand nightly outside of dimly-lit apartment buildings and row houses, telling yet more stories of children felled by bullets and showing new heartbreaking scenes of mothers wracked by sobs. And yet, other headlines suggest that this nation is far safer and much less violent than it used to be. They note that gun violence has plummeted a startling 49 percent since 1993 and, aside from some brief spikes and dips in the last few years, most policymakers seem to feel quite good about America's overall crime rate, which is also at a noticeable low.\n\nWhy is it then that some American neighborhoods, from the south side of Chicago to the north side of Philadelphia to all sides of Detroit , still endure so much collective distress? Might there be something about these particular neighborhoods, pundits wonder, that make them more prone to violence?\n\nAccording to one well-respected scholar , \"high rates of black crime\" continue to exist despite declining crime rates nationally because African Americans live in highly segregated and deeply impoverished neighborhoods. Not only does his work suggest that both segregation and poverty breed violence but, more disturbingly, that the ways in which poor blacks decide collectively and individually to protect themselves seems only to \"fuel the violence,\" and gives it \"a self-perpetuating character.\"\n\nSegregation and poverty are indeed serious problems today, and too many of America's poorest all-black and all-brown communities also suffer a level of violence that, if one disregards the horrific killing sprees in places like Columbine , Seattle , or Sandy Hook , is largely unknown in whiter, more affluent neighborhoods. Whereas the violent crime rate in the mostly black city of Detroit was 21.23 per 1,000 (15,011 violent crimes) in 2012, that same year the virtually all-white city of Grosse Point, Michigan nearby reported a rate of only 1.12 per 1,000 (6 violent crimes).\n\nNotwithstanding such seemingly damning statistics, though, we have all seriously misunderstood the origins of the almost-paralyzing violence that our most racially-segregated communities now experience and, as troublingly, we have seriously mischaracterized the nature of so much of the violence that the residents of these communities suffer.\n\nTo start, locating today's concentrated levels of gun violence in hyper-segregation and highly concentrated poverty is quite ahistorical. As any careful look at the past makes clear, neither of these social ills is new and, therefore, neither can adequately explain why it is only recently that so many children of color are being shot or killed in their own communities.\n\nIndeed, throughout the twentieth century, racially-segregated communities have been the norm . Everything from restrictive covenants to discriminatory federal housing policies ensured that throughout the postwar period, neighborhoods in cities such as Detroit or Chicago would be either all white or all non-white and, until now, none of these segregated spaces experienced sustained rates of violence so completely out of step with national trends.\n\nTo suggest, as both scholars and the media have, that the violence experienced by all-black or all-brown neighborhoods today stems in large part from their residential isolation is problematic for other reasons as well. It leads some to suspect that if people of color simply spent more time with white people, lived next to them, and went to school with them, they would be less violent-they would perhaps learn better ways to resolve disputes and deal with stress and anger. Again, though, history belies this logic.\n\nWhite Americans also have a long history of violence-not only when asked to share residential space with African Americans or even to treat them as equals in schools or on the job, but also when nary a person of color is near. From the lynching of blacks in the Jim Crow era to the crimes committed against African Americans every time they tried to move onto a white block after World War I and World War II, ugly incidents of white violence were both regular and unremarkable. Even among those who look just like them, whites historically have engaged in a variety of violent behaviors that would make many shudder-from their propensity to engage in brutal duels and to \"eye gouge\" their fellow whites in the decades before the Civil War, to their involvement in mass shootings in more recent years.\n\nJust as hyper-segregation doesn't explain the violence that so many have to endure today in America's inner city communities while still raising children, attending church, and trying to make ends meet, neither does highly-concentrated poverty. Because of their exclusion from virtually every program and policy that helped eventually to build an American middle class, non-whites have always had far less wealth than whites. From the ability to maintain land ownership after the Civil War, to the virtual guarantee of welfare benefits such as Social Security and FHA loans during the New Deal , to preferential access to employment and housing in the postwar period, white communities have always had considerably more economic advantage than communities of color. And yet, no matter how poor they were, America's most impoverished communities have never been plagued by the level of violence they are today.\n\nBut if neither racial segregation nor the racial poverty gap can account for the degree to which poor communities of color are traumatized today, then what does? What is altogether new is the extent to which these communities are devastated by the working of our nation's criminal justice system in general and by mass incarceration in particular.\n\nToday's rates of incarceration in America's poorest, blackest, and brownest neighborhoods are historically unprecedented . By 2001, one in six black men had been incarcerated and, by the close of 2013, black and Latino inmates comprised almost 60 percent of the nation's federal and state prison population. The numbers of incarcerated black women are also stark.  According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics , young black women ages 18 to 19 were almost five times more likely to be imprisoned than white women of the same age in 2010.\n\nWhen President Lyndon B. Johnson passed the Law Enforcement Assistance Act in 1965-legislation which, in turn, made possible the most aggressive war on crime this nation ever waged-he was reacting not to remarkable crime rates but to the civil rights upheaval that had erupted nationwide just the year before. This activism, he and other politicians believed, represented not participatory democracy in action, but instead a criminal element that would only grow more dangerous if not checked.\n\nNotably, the national policy embrace of targeted and more aggressive policing as well as highly punitive laws and sentences-the so-called \"War on Crime\" that led eventually to such catastrophic rates of imprisonment- predated the remarkable levels of violence that now impact poor communities of color so disproportionately.\n\nIn fact, the U.S. homicide rate in 1965 was significantly lower than it had been in several previous moments in American history: 5.5 per 100,000 U.S. residents as compared, for example, with 9.7 per 100,000 in 1933. Importantly, though, whereas the violent crime rate was 200.2 per 100,000 U.S. residents in 1965, it more than tripled to a horrifying 684.6 per 100,000 by 1995. Though mass incarceration did not originate in extraordinarily high rates of violence, mass incarceration created the conditions in which violence would surely fester.\n\nThe quadrupling of the incarceration rate in America since 1970 has had devastating collateral consequences . Already economically-fragile communities sank into depths of poverty unknown for generations, simply because anyone with a criminal record is forever \"marked\" as dangerous and thus rendered all but permanently unemployable. Also, with blacks incarcerated at six times and Latinos at three times the rate of whites by 2010, millions of children living in communities of color have effectively been orphaned .  Worse yet, these kids often experience high rates of post-traumatic shock from having witnessed the often-brutal arrests of their parents and having been suddenly ripped from them.\n\nDe-industrialization and suburbanization surely did their part to erode our nation's black and brown neighborhoods, but staggering rates of incarceration is what literally emptied them out . As this Pew Center of the States graphic on Detroit shows, the overwhelmingly-black east side of the Motor City has been ravaged by the effects of targeted policing and mass incarceration in recent years with one in twenty-two adults there under some form of correctional control. In some neighborhoods, the rate is as high as one in 16.\n\nSuch concentrated levels of imprisonment have torn at the social fabric of inner city neighborhoods in ways that even people who live there find hard to comprehend, let alone outsiders. As the research of criminologist Todd Clear makes clear, extraordinary levels of incarceration create the conditions for extraordinary levels of violence. But even mass incarceration does not, in itself, explain the particularly brutal nature of the violence that erupts today in, for example, the south side of Chicago. To explain that, we must look again carefully and critically at our nation's criminal justice system.\n\nThe level of gun violence in today's inner cities is the direct product of our criminal-justice policies-specifically, the decision to wage a brutal War on Drugs. When federal and state politicians such as New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller opted to criminalize addiction by passing unprecedentedly punitive possession laws rather than to treat it as a public health crisis, unwittingly or not, a high level of violence in poor communities of color was not only assured but was guaranteed to be particularly ugly. This new drug war created a brand-new market for illegal drugs-an underground marketplace that would be inherently dangerous and would necessarily be regulated by both guns and violence.\n\nIndeed, without the War on Drugs, the level of gun violence that plagues so many poor inner-city neighborhoods today simply would not exist. The last time we saw so much violence from the use of firearms was, notably, during Prohibition. \"[As] underground profit margins surged, gang rivalries emerged, and criminal activity mounted [during Prohibition],\" writes historian Abigail Perkiss , \"the homicide rate across the nation rose 78 percent...[and] in Chicago alone, there were more than 400 gang-related murders a year.\"\n\nAs important as it is to rethink the origins of the violence that poor inner city residents still endure, we must also be careful even when using the term \"violence,\" particularly when seeking to explain \"what seems to be wrong\" with America's most disadvantaged communities. A level of state violence is also employed daily in these communities that rarely gets mentioned and yet it is as brutal, and perhaps even more devastating, than the violence that is so often experienced as a result of the informal economy in now-illegal drugs.\n\nThis is a violence that comes in the form of police harassment, surveillance, profiling, and even killings-the ugly realities of how law enforcement wages America's War on Drugs. Today, young black men today are 21 times more likely than their white peers to be killed by the police and, according to a recent ProPublica report , black children have fared just as badly. Since 1980, a full 67 percent of the 151 teenagers and 66 percent of the 41 kids under 14 who have been killed by police were African American. Between 2010 and 2012 alone, police officers shot and killed fifteen teens running away from them; all but one of them black.\n\nThis is the violence that undergirded the 4.4 million stop-and-frisks in New York City between 2004 and 2014. This is the violence that led to the deaths of black men and boys such as Kimani Gray, Amadou Diallo, Sean Bell, Oscar Grant, and Michael Brown. This is the violence that led to the deaths of black women and girls such as Rekia Boyd, Yvette Smith, and 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones . And this is the violence that has touched off months of protests in Ferguson, Missouri just as it also touched off nearly a decade of urban rebellions after 1964.\n\nA close look at the violence that today haunts America's most impoverished and most segregated cities, in fact, fundamentally challenges conventional assumptions about perpetrators and victims. America's black and brown people not only don't have a monopoly on violence, but, in fact, a great deal of the violence being waged in their communities is perpetrated by those who are at least officially charged with protecting, not harming, them. As residents of Ferguson well know, for example, in the same month that Michael Brown was shot to death by a police officer, four other unarmed black men were also killed by members of law enforcement.\n\nIndeed, the true origins of today's high rates of violence in America's most highly segregated, most deeply impoverished, and blackest and brownest neighborhoods-whoever perpetrates it-are located well outside of these same communities. Simply put, America's poorest people of color had no seat the policy table where mass incarceration was made. But though they did not create the policies that led to so much community and state violence in inner cities today, they nevertheless now suffer from them in unimaginable ways."

      "text": "How Black Americans Kept Reconstruction Alive\n\nThe federal government abandoned Reconstruction in 1877, but Black people didn't give up on the moment's promise.\n\nListen to more stories on curio\n\nThe Civil War produced two competing narratives, each an attempt to make sense of a conflict that had eradicated the pestilence of slavery.\n\nBlack Americans who believed in multiracial democracy extolled the emancipationist legacy of the war. These Reconstructionists envisioned a new America finally capable of safeguarding Black dignity and claims of citizenship. Black women and men created new civic, religious, political, educational, and economic institutions. They built thriving towns and districts, churches and schools. In so doing, they helped reimagine the purpose and promise of American democracy.\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nFor a time after the war, Black Reconstructionists also shaped the American government. They found allies in the Republican Party , where white abolitionists hoped to honor freedpeople's demands and to create a progressive country in which all workers earned wages. Republicans in Congress pushed through amendments abolishing slavery, granting citizenship, and giving Black men the ballot. Congress also created the Freedmen's Bureau, which offered provisions, clothing, fuel, and medical assistance to the formerly enslaved, and negotiated contracts to protect their newly won rights. With backing from the Union army, millions of Black people in the South received education, performed paid labor, voted in presidential elections, and held some of the highest offices in the country-all for the first time.\n\nBlack Reconstructionists told the country a new story about itself. These were people who believed in freedom beyond emancipation. They shared an expansive vision of a compassionate nation with a true democratic ethos.\n\nThose who longed for the days of antebellum slavery felt differently. Advocates of the Lost Cause-who believed that the South's defeat did nothing to diminish its moral superiority-sought to \"redeem\" their fellow white citizens from the scourge of \"Negro rule.\" Redemptionists did more than offer a different story about the nation. They demanded that their point of view be sanctified with blood. They threatened the nation's infrastructure and institutions, and backed up their threats with violence.\n\nThe Redemption campaign was astoundingly successful. Intimidation and lynchings of Black voters and politicians quickly reversed gains in turnout. Reprisals against any white person who supported Black civil rights largely silenced dissent. This second rebellion hastened the national retreat from Reconstruction . Federal troops effectively withdrew from the Confederate states in 1877. White southerners soon dominated state legislatures once again, and passed Jim Crow laws designed to subjugate Black people and destroy their political power.\n\nThe official Reconstruction timeline usually ends there, in 1877. But this implies that the Reconstructionist vision of American democracy ceased to exist, or went dormant, without the backing of federal troops. Instead, we should consider a long Reconstruction-one that stretches well beyond 1877, and offers a view that transcends false binaries of political failure and success.\n\nThis view allows us to follow the travails of the Black activists and ordinary citizens who kept the struggle for freedom and dignity alive long after the Republican Party and white abolitionists had abandoned it. Black institutions, including the church, the schoolhouse, and the press, kept public vigil over promises made, broken, and, in some instances, renewed during the long march toward liberation. Their stories show that freedom's flame, once boldly lit, could not be extinguished by the specter of white violence.\n\nThe concept of a long Reconstruction recognizes that a nation can be two things at once. After 1877, freedom and repression journeyed along parallel paths. Black Americans preserved a vision of a truly free nation in an archipelago of communities and institutions. Many of them exist today, and continue their work. This, perhaps, is the most important reason to resist the idea that Reconstruction ended when the North withdrew from the South: In a sense, the work of Reconstruction never ended, because the goal of a multiracial democracy has never been fully realized. And America has made its greatest gains toward that goal when it has rejected the Redemptionist narrative.\n\nThat the work of Reconstruction continued well after 1877 is illustrated by the life of Ida B. Wells, a woman who witnessed the death of slavery and fought against the beginning of Jim Crow. Wells kept alive the radical ideals of the Reconstructionists and punctured, through her journalism, the virulent mythology peddled by the Redemptionists. When Wells was born-in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862-her parents, Jim and Lizzie Wells, were enslaved. Later that year, the Union army took control of the town while staging an attack on Vicksburg. As they did elsewhere across the dying Confederacy, enslaved people in and around Holly Springs fled plantations for Union lines and emancipated themselves. But freedom proved contingent. Even when Union General Ulysses S. Grant made his headquarters in the town, Black refugees feared reprisals from their former enslavers. Their vulnerability to white violence, even under the watch of Union troops, foreshadowed the coming era.\n\nAfter the war, Jim and Lizzie Wells chose to stay in Holly Springs. Jim joined the local Union League , which supported Republican Party politics and was committed to advancing Black male suffrage. In fall 1867, when Ida was 5 years old, her father cast his first ballot. Ida remembered her mother as an exemplar of domestic rectitude whose achievements were reflected in her children's perfect Sunday-school attendance and good manners.\n\nIda grew up in a Mississippi full of miraculous change. She attended the first \"colored\" school in Holly Springs, a remarkable opportunity in a state that had been considered the most inhospitable to Black education and aspiration in the entire Confederacy. As a young girl, Ida read the newspaper aloud to her father's admiring friends; just a few years earlier, it would have been illegal in Mississippi to teach her the alphabet.\n\nIn 1874, when Wells was 12, 69 Black men were serving in the Mississippi legislature, and a white governor, Adelbert Ames -placed in office partly by the votes of the formerly enslaved-promised to commit the state to equality for all. Around that time, Mississippi's secretary of state, superintendent of education, and speaker of the House were all Black men.\n\nThe world around Ida was full of fiercely independent and economically prosperous Black citizens. These attainments buoyed her optimism for the rest of her life.\n\nBut the idyll of her childhood was brief. Redemptionist forces in Mississippi struck back against Black political power with naked racist terror. In December 1874, a white mob in Vicksburg killed as many as 300 Black citizens after forcing the elected Black sheriff, Peter Crosby, to resign. Massacres and lynchings continued unabated across the state through 1875. By 1876, the number of Black men in the state legislature had fallen by more than half. Following the contested election that year, the new president, the Republican Rutherford B. Hayes, ordered the remaining active northern troops in the South to return to their barracks. Without the protection of federal troops, and with the symbolic abandonment by the president, Black people were on their own, completely vulnerable to voting restrictions, economic reprisals, and racial violence.\n\nFor Wells, the collapse of Reconstruction came at a moment of profound personal struggles. In 1878, her parents and one of her brothers died in a yellow-fever outbreak that killed hundreds in Holly Springs, leaving her, at 16, to care for five siblings, including her disabled sister, Eugenia. After Eugenia died, Wells moved to Memphis at the invitation of an aunt.\n\nWells's escape from Mississippi did not protect her from the indignities of racism. In 1883, after a visit to Holly Springs, Wells purchased a train ticket back to Memphis, riding first class on a segregated train. She moved to the first-class car for white ladies after being bothered by another passenger's smoking, and refused to go back to Black first class. Though barely five feet tall, Wells stood her ground until the white conductor physically removed her. She promptly filed suit and, initially at least, won $700 in damages before her two cases were reversed on appeal by the Tennessee State Supreme Court.\n\nThe defeat spurred Wells to find another means of fighting Jim Crow. She longed to attend Fisk University, and took summer classes there. By the end of the decade, she had become the editor and a co-owner of the Memphis Free Speech and Headlight , the newspaper founded by the Beale Street Church pastor Taylor Nightingale.\n\nWells took over editorial duties amid a surge of anti-Black violence, which had remained a feature of the South even after the Redemptionists achieved their goal of removing federal troops from the region. In the 1880s, the incidents began to intensify. In 1886, at least 13 Black citizens were lynched in a Mississippi courthouse, where free Black men were testifying against a white lawyer accused of assault. Attacks on Reconstructionists continued from there. The more that Black men and women engaged in political self-determination-choosing to own homes and businesses, to defend their families-the more thunderbolts of violence struck them. The bloodshed of Redemption was intended to touch the lives of all Black people in the South.\n\nOn March 9, 1892, that violence came to Wells's life, when a mob of 75 white men in Memphis kidnapped three Black men: Thomas Moss, Calvin McDowell, and Will Stewart. Moss was an owner of the People's Grocery, an upstart Black cooperative that competed with the local grocery owned by William Barrett, who was white. The rivalry between the stores had escalated into a larger racial conflict, and Moss, McDowell, and Stewart had been sent to jail after guns were fired at a white mob that had attacked the People's Grocery. Wells knew Moss and his wife, Betty, whom she considered one of her best friends. She was godmother to their daughter Maurine.\n\nMoss, McDowell, and Stewart were given no due process or trial. Another mob took the men from jail and shot each to death, refusing Moss's plea to spare his life for the sake of his daughter and pregnant wife. Their bodies were left in the Chesapeake & Ohio rail yard. The white-owned Memphis Appeal-Avalanche documented the horrors as fair justice for the troublesome Black men who had dared to fight white men.\n\nIn the Free Speech , Wells wrote a series of editorials decrying the killings and the constant threat of violence that Black Americans faced in the South, and urged northerners to renew their support for full Black citizenship. In one of those editorials, Wells called out the \"threadbare lie that Negro men rape white women,\" which was the justification for many lynchings. She filed the editorial shortly before a trip to the North. While she was gone, a group of men went to the Free Speech 's offices and destroyed the printing press, leaving a note warning that \"anyone trying to publish the paper again would be punished with death.\" She chose not to return to Memphis, and continued her campaign from New York.\n\nThat June, Wells wrote an essay, \"The Truth About Lynching,\" in the influential Black newspaper The New York Age . Wells reasoned that most anti-Black violence claimed its roots in economic competition, personal jealousy, and white supremacy. She also dispelled, again, the myth of Black-male sexual violence against white women. Wells pointed instead to the number of mixed-race children in the old Confederacy-evidence of the sexual violence that white men had inflicted on Black women.\n\nWells's activism was more than a crusade to end lynching. She traveled the country and Great Britain to describe her vision of multiracial democracy. Frederick Douglass, who had escaped slavery and become the foremost civil-rights activist and journalist of the antebellum and Reconstruction eras, admired Wells and characterized her contributions as a \"service which can neither be weighed nor measured.\"\n\nWells first met Douglass in the summer of 1892, when he was 74; Douglass had written a letter to her saying he was inspired by her courage. The two developed a close friendship. \"There has been no word equal to it in convincing power,\" Douglass wrote of Southern Horrors , a pamphlet Wells published in 1892 based on her groundbreaking anti-lynching essay. The pair corresponded and worked together for the rest of Douglass's life. With his death, in 1895, a torch was passed.\n\nWells's efforts, in a period of racial fatigue among white audiences, helped continue the central political struggle of Reconstruction. She delivered hundreds of speeches, organized anti-lynching campaigns, and worked to galvanize the public against the Redemptionists. Wells told America a story it needed, but did not want, to hear.\n\nWells's work also intersected with that of W. E. B. Du Bois, the scholar, journalist, and civil-rights activist who took a forceful stand against lynching. Their relationship was sometimes collegial, sometimes contentious; Wells never found with Du Bois the same rapport she'd had with Douglass. But she supported Du Bois's then-radical view of the importance of Black liberal-arts education, and Du Bois was shaped by Wells's advocacy and critiques.\n\nDu Bois viewed the legacy of Reconstruction as crucial to understanding America. At the behest of another Black intellectual and scholar, Anna Julia Cooper, he published in 1935 his monumental Black Reconstruction . The book traced the origins of the violence that Wells denounced. He wrote that \"inter-racial sex jealousy and accompanying sadism\" were the main basis of lynching, and echoed Wells's argument that white men's violence against Black women had been the true scourge of the South. Du Bois also wrote that the Reconstructionists were engaged in \"abolition-democracy,\" which he defined as a broader movement for social equality that went beyond political rights.\n\nDu Bois's scholarship paved the way for a reconsideration of the era . He challenged the Redemptionist narrative of venal corruption and Black men who were either in over their head or merely served white northern puppet masters and southern race traitors.\n\nRead: What if Reconstruction hadn't failed?\n\nDu Bois's work is a starting point for contemporary histories. Eric Foner's magisterial Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877 , published more than half a century after Black Reconstruction , added texture to the story of the period, then largely untold. Foner's work reframed the era as an unfinished experiment in multiracial democracy.\n\nIn this tradition of expansion, the historian Steven Hahn's Pulitzer Prize-winning A Nation Under Our Feet , published in 2003, widens earlier historical frameworks by looking beyond Reconstruction's constitutional reforms. Hahn sought out the Black men and women who shaped Reconstruction at the state and local levels. More recently, the historian Kidada E. Williams's I Saw Death Coming focuses on the daily lives of Black men and women during Reconstruction-witnesses to the violence of Redemption.\n\nAll of these works expand our conception of what Reconstruction was, and challenge the notion that the era came to an abrupt ending in 1877. They portray the era as a contested epic, where parallel movements for Reconstruction and Redemption rise, fall, and are recovered.\n\nI first learned about Reconstruction from my late mother, Germaine Joseph, a Haitian immigrant turned American citizen whose love of history could be gauged by the crammed bookcases in our home in Queens, New York. My first lesson on Reconstruction came in the form of a story about Haiti's revolution. Mom proudly informed me that Haiti had been the key to unlocking freedom for Black Americans: The Haitian Revolution , she explained, led to revolts of the enslaved, frightened so-called masters, and inspired Frederick Douglass.\n\nLater, I found my way back to Reconstruction through an interest in the Black radical tradition, especially post-World War II movements for racial justice and equality. My mentor, the late historian Manning Marable, described the civil-rights movement, and the age of Black Power that followed, as a second Reconstruction. During this time, with a renewed interest in slavery and its aftermath, scholars rediscovered Du Bois's work.\n\nMy research and writing of late has revolved around interpreting the past 15 years of American history, from Barack Obama's ascent to the White House in 2008, to the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2013, to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election, to the events that followed George Floyd's murder in 2020. In my 2022 book, The Third Reconstruction , I argued that we might be living through another era filled with the kind of dizzying possibility and intense backlash that whipsawed the South during Wells's life.\n\nToday's Reconstructionists have a vision for multiracial democracy that might astonish even Douglass, Wells, and Du Bois. Black women, queer folk, poor people, disabled people, prisoners, and formerly incarcerated people have adopted the term abolition from Du Bois's idea of abolition-democracy, and now use it to refer to a broad movement to dismantle interlocking systems of oppression-many of which originated in Redemption policy. They have achieved important victories in taking down Confederate monuments; sharing a more accurate telling of America's origin story and its relationship to slavery; and questioning systems of punishment, surveillance, and poverty.\n\nBut today's Redemptionists have had their victories as well. Their apocalyptic story of the present, one in which crime and moral decay threaten to destroy America, rationalizes a return to a past America and aims to dismantle the Reconstruction amendments that underpin fundamental civil rights. Redemptionists promote a regime of education that reverses the gains historians have made since the revival of Black Reconstruction .\n\nThe health of American democracy continues to rest upon whether we believe the Reconstructionist or Redemptionist version of history. Reconstruction, as a belief, as an ideal, outlasted the federal government's political commitments by decades. Black people, the country's most improbable architects, continued to make and shape history by preserving this rich legacy, and bequeathing it to their children. Their story has remained the heart of the American experiment both when the country has acknowledged them-and, most especially, when it has not.\n\nThis article appears in the December 2023 print edition with the headline \"The Revolution Never Ended.\" When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "'Anti-White Watch' Is the Racist Answer to Surging Hate Crimes\n\nViolence against people of Asian descent is exploding in America. According to a recent analysis of police records , reports of anti-Asian hate crimes in the largest U.S. cities shot up 169 percent in the first quarter of 2021 versus the same time last year. This spike in vitriol and violence is especially disheartening, as it followed a well-documented surge in anti-Asian hate across the country last year, triggered at least in part by blatantly racist reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. And even before 2020, America had already witnessed several years of well-documented growth in bigoted bile and violence against numerous non-white communities.\n\nBut stark and grim as these trends are, a small yet vocal group falsely insists that they pale in comparison to another form of supposedly widespread, growing, and under-reported bigotry: hate crimes targeting white people.\n\nWhite nationalists have launched a handful of initiatives over the last few years in flailing bids to prove this ludicrous point. But perhaps the most notable among them is something called Anti-White Watch, a platform \"dedicated to documenting bias, policies, hate, and violence directed at ethnic-European people worldwide.\" Its main web portal maintains a heat map and database of alleged anti-white incidents-focusing on accounts of brutal violence supposedly enacted by non-white perpetrators, pulled from across the web by admins and readers. It also catalogues numerous alleged hate-crime \"hoaxes,\" incidents that many on the right believe malicious actors-often assumed to be liberal elites-either inflate or fully fabricate in order to stoke racial tensions for their benefit, and to slander white people as racists.\n\n\"They try to both minimize the apparent threat from the far right,\" Kurt Braddock, an expert on white-supremacist communication and radicalization strategies at American University, told The Daily Beast, \"and to make it seem like the real threat to America is minorities.\"\n\nThe overarching goal behind these sites-collect and spin stories of violence perpetrated by non-white people to gin up a sense of white peril-is far from new. And Anti-White Watch and other sites like it, though widely linked and referenced within white nationalist silos, are still small and buggy. But these sites do take a novel approach to gathering and presenting such stories at a time of increased focus on hate crimes.\n\nAnd many of these approaches have seemingly been modeled on actual hate-crime monitoring systems-a disturbing development experts fear could prove alarmingly effective at radicalizing white racists.\n\n\"The creation of a definitive database that has a veneer of legitimacy is particularly concerning,\" Robin O'Luanaigh, a consultant with the anti-disinformation and anti-extremism solutions shop Moonshot, told The Daily Beast.\n\nWhite bigots started fabricating accounts of violence allegedly committed by non-white people, especially Black men, at least as far back as the antebellum era. Initially, these tales served as a justification for America's uniquely brutal form of slavery, and wider racist legal framework. After the Civil War, the same sort of fear-mongering anecdotes were repurposed to support segregation and other forms of oppression, as well as brutal reprisals against any non-white person who ( literally ) so much as looked at a white person wrong.\n\n\"Just as the blood libel was historically used to justify horrific crimes against Jews, this type of propaganda in the United States has led to lynch mobs, among other forms of extrajudicial punishments against minorities, such as fire bombings, vandalism, and kidnapping,\" said Josh Lipowsky, a research analyst at the Counter Extremism Project, a non-profit organization that monitors and attempts to disrupt the operations of all sorts of violent radical groups.\n\nThis tradition never really vanished, even as America supposedly progressed as a nation. It just evolved.\n\n\"When I started working in this field in the '80s, Black-on-white crime listings were still a major feature of Klan periodicals, and similar literature,\" Brian Levin of the California State University-San Bernardino's Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism-which compiled the recent report on anti-Asian hate crimes-told The Daily Beast. And when white supremacist internet forums like Stormfront cropped up in the late '90s, people quickly started to compile and expand these lists on dedicated threads. New Nation News , launched in 1998, has developed a small stable of \"reporters\" who find accounts of \"black-on-white\" violence online, then repost them with a focus on race. They often post mugshots, victim injury photos, and blunt warnings about the supposed dangers of interacting with Black people-like their standard tag for domestic violence stories: \"Dangers of interracial dating * MISCEGENATION KILLS.\"\n\nSometimes, they throw in shots of apes and monkeys, just in case their old-school racist messages weren't clear enough.\n\nThese forum-lists can have dire real-world impacts: Stumbling upon these sorts of curated and explicitly dehumanizing lists reportedly played a key role in the radicalization of convicted neo-Nazi mass murderer Dylann Roof.\n\nEven in the mainstream, right-wing provocateurs and outlets still craft lists of crimes committed by non-white people against white victims, usually projecting motives of racial grievance onto assailants without any clear basis for doing so. There are entire ( actual ) books cataloguing supposed instances of \"the knockout game,\" an alleged early 2010s fad in which young Black men supposedly socked random white people in the head for sport. Although rooted in a tiny seed of reality, coverage of the game quickly developed into a racial-moral panic, so these books are accordingly and predictably full of misrepresentations and false associations.\n\nBut Levin notes that more mainstream right-wing lists take pains to avoid old tropes about inherent violence or sub-human status. Instead, they're usually offered as so-called evidence that racial justice initiatives are just creating a culture of division and animus. Or as an ostensible antidote to what far-right eyes see as a liberal tendency to cry racism left and right when white perpetrators are involved in an incident, and refusal to report on-or even acknowledge the existence of-anti-white sentiments and violence.\n\nThis strand of spurious whataboutist, two-sides deflection of meaningful racial dialogue plays a major role in modern right-wing politics, noted Michael King, a criminologist at Bridgewater State University who has studied this sort of list-making . Notably, he explained, it laid the groundwork for the rise of Donald Trump and Trumpism.\n\nStill, these lists are often piecemeal and poorly constructed-both in terms of their sloppy layout and presentation of facts. Their promoters often abandon them in favor of a few shorthand case studies or statistics. And the charged framing around them almost always reeks of overt political posturing and conspiracy theories about liberal plots that alienate many uninitiated viewers.\n\nAnti-White Watch and its ilk, on the other hand, appear to be part of a recent trend among overt white nationalists to appeal to broad audiences by stripping away clear signs of racism and conspiratorial thinking. This crowd places a premium on sleek design, efforts to dispassionately convey seemingly innocuous information, and often attempts to co-opt the language of social-justice movements to convey a sense of high-minded morality.\n\n\"These new efforts seem to be modeling themselves on the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center's hate incident monitoring system structures and aesthetics,\" Braddock told The Daily Beast. Joanna Mendelson, associate director of the ADL's Center on Extremism, agrees with this assessment: Anti-White Watch's name seems to directly reference the SPLC's Hatewatch project, and it organizes its information using a system eerily similar to the ADL's Hate, Extremism, Antisemitism, and Terrorism (HEAT) map and wider databases.\n\nWhite supremacist mass murderer Dylann Roof, who may have been radicalized in part by racist propaganda about crime\n\nThe choice to mimic these organizations makes sense, argued O'Luanaigh, the disinformation and extremism expert. \"The ADL and SPLC's work has helped many people realize the extent to which hate and extremism towards minority groups in the U.S. still very much exists,\" she said. So, their style is a useful shorthand for apparent data collection rigor and legitimacy-for mainstreaming efforts. \"White nationalists also very much hate the ADL and SPLC\" because of their very visible and effective anti-hate work, O'Luanaigh added. \"In a way, I see this as almost a way to troll these two organizations, as well.\"\n\nAnti-White Watch uses a mélange of social-justice buzzwords in its social-media posts, too: \"We stand with #EthnicEuropean (White) students against the systemic racism, Replacism and bigotry deployed against them at every level of academia and media,\" the project tweeted last month.\n\n\"They want you to think of social justice and equality when looking at their materials and thus think they also must be a legitimate monitor of hate,\" Lipowsky told The Daily Beast.\n\nViolence motivated by anti-white sentiment is, in truth, not entirely fictional. The FBI's crime tracking systems have monitored official reports of expressly anti-white violence for decades, and publish their stats regularly, in highly visible and accessible places, always to widespread media coverage.\n\nTheir figures are far from authoritative , thanks to inconsistent definitions of hate crimes across the U.S., enforcement of existing anti-hate statutes, and reporting from local officials to the feds-as well as citizens' well-documented reticence to report many types of hate crimes to the authorities. But their data shows that anti-white hate crimes in general, and violence motivated by anti-white sentiments, are exceedingly rare compared to other forms of hate. Far-right voices attempt to twist this data , and its clear limitations, to insist explicitly racist violence against white people is far more common than it seems at face value. Yet analyses of anti-white hate crime reports have made compelling cases that these types of incidents are likely in fact over-reported.\n\nThe media does report on well-substantiated instances of expressly anti-white violence. It just does not dwell on them. Meanwhile, the social context and criminological trends around other forms of violence-especially hate crimes against non-white people-speaks clearly to the importance of digging into those stories. They are highly salient to pressing national conversations, and have historically been marginalized in favor of an over-emphasis on crimes against white victims, who have long had overwhelming power to shape popular discourse around crime in general.\n\n\"Unfortunately, crime rates remain high in the United States overall,\" explained Sophie Bjork-James, an expert on white nationalism and hate crimes at Vanderbilt University.\n\nThat makes it all too easy for projects like Anti-White Watch and their communities to find instances of violence involving non-white perpetrators and white victims, cherry-pick or distort details from those cases while stripping out wider context, and file them as instance of hate-just like earlier list-makers have done. \"When you examine the cases on these sites, a lot of them have nothing to do with race,\" stressed Sanford Schram, an expert on white nationalist mainstreaming efforts at Hunter College. \"Pages like Anti-White Watch are very misleading at a bare minimum.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast was unable to reach the individuals behind Anti-White Watch and similar projects. But an administrator of a white nationalist resource hub that directs readers towards Anti-White Watch misleadingly defended the practice of scrambling to label incidents expressly anti-white crimes.\n\n\"It doesn't take a great leap in logic to suspect anti-white hatred as a strong motivating factor for many, if not most interracial crime involving white victims and non-white perpetrators,\" the administrator, who did not reveal their identity, told The Daily Beast. \"When the roles are reversed-non-white victims and white perpetrators-racial hatred is almost always at the top of the list as the suspected criminal motive. Nobody has a problem believing white people are capable of racial hatred and acting on it. But suggest the same thing about non-whites, and brains begin to melt.\"\n\nThis fallacious reasoning misrepresents the context around most reports of racist motives in attacks against non-white individuals and groups. It also functionally acknowledges the fact that these projects are little more than exercises in creating false equivalencies in the name of misdirection.\n\nBut even if the cases reported to Anti-White Watch and similar sites are largely misrepresented in ways that do not accord with established criminological facts and trends, experts worry that the way these platforms present information could be highly effective gateways for radicalization.\n\nLike other compilations of supposed anti-white hate incidents, they speak to a well-documented belief shared by many white Americans that they face as much discrimination as any non-white American community. (It should go without saying that they do not .) This belief stems at least in part from fears that minority groups will gradually replace white people, then turn around and attempt to punish them and destroy their culture-a baseless concern currently being amplified by the the Great Replacement conspiracy theory and its public promoters, like far-right blowhard Tucker Carlson . It predisposes them to think that they should see equivalent levels and types of hate crimes against them as they see documented in the news targeting Asian, Black, or other non-white groups. These platforms, like prior lists, also bombard people with brutal highlights from crimes, which create a visceral reaction-a sense of personal racial peril-that can override critical thought.\n\nBut unlike other compilations of alleged anti-white hate crimes, the apparent sterile formality of the data collection and presentation on these platforms may make them seem more credible. And the co-opted language of social justice may lend them a bogus sheen of the erudite and moral. \"This allows them to attract new followers who might believe the dressing and not immediately realize the core is rotten,\" Lipowsky explained. \"Only with a deeper dive will many discover that these platforms' goal is more in line with 'separate but equal' policies rather than true racial equality.\"\n\n\"Their strategy also allows them to case those in disagreement with their positions as immoral,\" Lipowsky added, which presents a major challenge to fact checkers who could otherwise help people break down and analyze the fallacy of their reports, and reveal the ideology behind them.\n\nFortunately, Anti-White Hate is unlikely to pop up on many vulnerable, uninitiated readers' radars, noted Rick Eaton, a longtime digital extremism watcher at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Holocaust education and hate-monitoring group with a history of Nazi hunting. Despite its flashy surface, the site-and many others like it-is hard to navigate beyond its front page. Its social media presence is also sporadic at best, and often tips its hand a little too hard towards egregious conspiracy and hate rhetoric to escape its white nationalist silo. Take, for example, the recent Anti-White Watch tweet: \"We are #Nationalists, conservatives roll over, we want separation.\"\n\nOn the same day, their account tweeted out the following explicitly bigoted hot take on the conviction of Derek Chauvin, the cop who murdered George Floyd in public and on camera: \"Thug Floyd OD while resisting arrest and him and his people are destroying our country.\"\n\nBut even if Anti-White Watch probably won't convince the average American that the country is suffering from a secret wave of anti-white hate and violence, it represents a growing sophistication in the way racist groups are making their cases. In more competent hands, and with more resources behind them, these tactics and future tweaks to them could have disturbing spillover effects, far beyond the weird world of white nationalism.\n\n\"Far-right, white supremacist groups are paying attention to the messaging being used to challenge them,\" Braddock noted. \"And they're adapting to it in a way that attempts to neutralize the facts on the ground about where the racial threats really are in America.\"\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "White Violence Links Black Lives From Emmett Till to George Floyd\n\nPhilonise Floyd, speaking after his brother George's murderer was found guilty by a jury, called Emmett Till \" the first George Floyd .\" Members of Till's family, including his cousin Deborah Watts and her daughter - who attended Floyd's memorial service - were reportedly on hand to support the Floyd family as they awaited a verdict for George's killer that Emmett's never received. Floyd also said the name of Daunte Wright, noting that history is present, justice is still not done, and we still have to demand that the system offer something approximating accountability.\n\n\"He should still be here,\" Floyd said of Wright . \"We have to always understand that we have to march. We will have to do this for life.\"\n\nIt's not a coincidence that Wright, a Black 20-year-old who was killed by a Minnesota police officer, was once a student of a woman who dated George Floyd, who was also killed by a Minnesota police officer. Similarly, do not chalk up to inexplicable chance that a Black Army lieutenant whom police held at gunpoint and roughed up in December, Caron Nazario, was a relative of Eric Garner, who was choked to death by a cop in 2014. And don't consider it a fluke that the mother of Fred Hampton, killed at age 21 by state-backed police executioners in 1969, had babysat Emmett Till, a Black child lynched in 1955 .\n\nWhether it's state agents or self-deputized vigilantes, there are no isolated incidents where white American violence against Black folks is concerned, and the historical ubiquity of white terror is evidenced by the devastation and loss it has wreaked in Black families otherwise separated by time and distance. A staggering number of Black American family trees have branches that have been abruptly severed by brutal white terror-a forest of Black lives splintered by white American violence. Nearly every Black person in America knows the danger of weaponized whiteness intimately, through personal experience or its impact on friends and relatives, in the form of years stolen, trauma inflicted, lives taken.\n\nThere are, consequently, so many more names that could be added to the social media lists demonstrating how white violence connects so many Black lives. The father of late blues guitarist Louisiana Red was lynched by the Ku Klux Klan when the musician was 5 years old, and the night-riding Black Legion murdered Malcolm X's father-who had already had three brothers \" killed by white men , including one by lynching.\" As a child, Angela Davis knew three of the four little Black girls murdered by the white terrorists who in 1963 bombed the Birmingham 16th Street Baptist Church. Rayshard Brooks, fatally shot in the back last year by Atlanta cops-as he ran in a direction that made him a distinct non-threat-was the cousin of This Is Us actor Niles Fitch . Ta-Nehisi Coates has repeatedly spoken and written about the police murder of his college friend, Prince Carmen Jones.\n\nActor Keith Powell was the cousin of the late Rodney King . In 2017, TLC singer T-Boz tweeted that Peoria, Illinois, police murdered her cousin , \"a sweet harmless young man with mental issues,\" with 18 shots from their guns. And earlier this month, Pharrell Williams called for a federal investigation into the police killing of his cousin, 25-year-old Donovon Lynch. The cousin of black NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace-murdered in 2003 by a cop as he \" went to grab his phone to call his mom because he was scared\"-never served a day in jail, and Wallace's family lost a wrongful death lawsuit.\n\nOf course, Black victims of white violence are connected to one another, because white violence has always been-and remains-a constant, enduring feature of so much Black existence. For so many others, the names of lost loved ones will never appear in headlines.\n\nNumbers further attest to this. A Gallup survey released about three months after the murder of George Floyd found 71 percent of Black adults reported knowing someone who had been mistreated by police. For Black adults between the ages of 18 and 44, that figure skyrockets to a staggering 83 percent. The same poll found \"half of Black adults report knowing 'some' or 'a lot of' people who were unfairly sent to jail or who stayed in jail because they didn't have enough money for bail.\" Seventy percent of Black folks responding to a June 2020 Tufts University survey said they knew \"someone who has been unfairly stopped, searched, questioned, physically threatened or abused by the police.\" For 43 percent of those polled, that experience had been firsthand, \"with 22 percent saying the mistreatment occurred within the past year.\" Another study released the same month found nearly half of Black respondents had at least once felt like their life \"was in danger because of their race.\" During the same period, a Harvard study found \"Black Americans are 3.23 times more likely than white Americans to be killed by police.\" (Oh, and that 2019 study stating there is no racial bias in police killings-the one conservatives keep citing when Black people demand that cops stop killing them? It's since been debunked and retracted by its authors .)\n\nOn the heels of the police murders of George Floyd, rates of anxiety and depression among Black Americans increased by 26 percent and 22 percent, respectively . The researchers behind a 2018 study wrote that \"mental health burden from police killings among black Americans is nearly as large as the mental health burden associated with diabetes.\" We're only starting to learn about intergenerational trauma, meaning the way that enslavement, racism, Jim Crow, and ongoing discrimination create epigenetic changes that literally alter our genes. And the long-term impact of quotidian encounters with anti-Black racism-even when there's no viral looped footage of Black folks being killed by police-takes a toll on Black folks' physical and mental health .\n\nBut what is personal and tangible for folks indelibly touched and shaped by white violence fails to be conveyed through anti-racist summer reading lists and listening series. Turns out, per a 2018 study, that white Americans demonstrate \"no negative health effects\" from unstinting reports about Black folks being killed by police. White America has always been incredulous of Black testimony about white violence, but the tree recalls what the axe forgets: that the shared burden of white violence in black life is never just a coincidence.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "White Nationalists Are Tearing Each Other Apart Over Ukraine\n\nIn the days since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine , a vast majority of Americans have rallied in support of the beleaguered nation, and many have condemned Vladimir Putin and his allies. This rare moment of national unity reflects the blatant injustice of Russia's unprovoked military aggression, and the clear, senseless pain and suffering the Kremlin's offensive has caused.\n\nBut no matter how open and shut this crisis seems to most people, a small yet vocal subset of Americans are still torn over how to interpret and react to it: white nationalists.\n\n\"They have responded unevenly\" to the crisis, David Lawrence of HOPE Not Hate, an advocacy group that combats racism and fascism and monitors far-right chatter, told The Daily Beast. \"It's a divisive issue for them.\"\n\nThese virulent racists are all scrutinizing the conflict through the same \"framework of antisemitism [and] pro-authoritarianism,\" explained Alexandra Stern, one of a dozen experts who monitor and analyze white nationalist groups The Daily Beast spoke to for this story. Yet they're reaching radically different conclusions about it. In the process, they're laying bare long-simmering fault lines within their twisted movement-and sparking petty conflicts that may create serious fractures within key far-right alliances and organizations.\n\n\"The division within the movement is pretty stark,\" a spokesperson for one niche-but far from innocuous-white nationalist group told The Daily Beast.\n\nHowever, experts caution that this chaos will likely not put a damper on white nationalism in the United States. Instead, it may serve mostly to get conspiratorial bigots riled up as they retrench into ill-informed hot takes about a global conflict-potentially making them more dangerous than ever.\n\n\"It may make some people feel the need to double down and perhaps even act out on their beliefs,\" explained Amy Cooter, a sociologist who studies white nationalists in America.\n\nChatter in far-right forums, social media posts, and expert analyses show that some of these white nationalists claim to stand with Ukraine because they see Russia's actions as a threat to the idea of national self-determination. (This is an important concept for racists who dream of self-determining their way to the creation of all-white states.) Some have also taken Putin's stated-and highly dubious - goal of \"demilitarizing and denazifying \" the nation as a direct attack on their ideals. In predictably conspiratorial and bigoted fashion, some have even denounced Putin as a secret Jew or member of a shadowy Jewish cabal that allegedly controls Russia and wants to use this war, as one recent post in a large, American-led, white nationalist forum put it, to \"divert the attention [sic] from the plans of the big globalist cliques, great reset plans.\" (That phrase refers to a notorious and long-debunked conspiracy theory about an elite plot to manipulate the pandemic.)\n\nRather than throw their weight behind Ukraine's Jewish president, however, this sect has largely thrown its lot in with the Azov Battalion , a militia absorbed into the Ukrainian National Guard in 2014 to help fight Russia. Despite its official status, the Battalion was and is a far-right extremist group with well-documented neo-Nazi leanings.\n\nOthers stand with Russia because they believe Putin is a bulwark against Western liberal ideals and alleged \"globalist\" (read: Jewish) plots that supposedly threaten white Christian civilization. And because they like the cut of his performatively hypermasculine jib. As one prominent American white nationalist put it in a recent and especially ugly post, they hold \"faith that Vladimir Putin is a Christian King sent by God to free Christendom from the clutches of the Jewish homo agenda.\"\n\nGulping down Kremlin propaganda, this set applauds Putin for supposedly saving his ethnic kin from what they falsely claim is a corrupt, NATO-puppet government . And at times for starting a war that some of them believe will devolve into a global conflict with \"the potential to upend the 'liberal global order' that they so despise,\" noted Stern.\n\nYet another faction favors neutrality. Some of these people just believe this conflict has nothing to do with their own Amero-centric missions. A representative for one KKK group told The Daily Beast that they didn't want to comment on this topic in part because they don't engage with the press and in part because the conflict \"is a continent away and if it doesn't pertain to America, then we don't have any interest in it.\"\n\nBut many more falsely argue that Jewish elites in both states, and NATO, supposedly cooked up this conflict to advance uncertain global goals at the cost of white male lives. As another poster in that white nationalist forum argued, \"This war was provoked by the Jews and the Jews will be the beneficiaries and the Whites the losers.\"\n\n\"Which of these two... factions... should Whites support?\" yet another poster asked rhetorically. \"None, they're both as bad as each other....\"\n\nCalum Farley, a researcher with the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, told The Daily Beast that one of the most common refrains of late in channels he monitors has been \"No More Brother Wars.\" That slogan references the supposedly unique tragedy of what racists see as manufactured, senseless white-on-white violence.\n\nExperts who monitor white nationalist chatter disagree about how common each of these positions is within the loathsome movement. But there's certainly been a fair amount of infighting among the bigots over whose skewed view is the right one.\n\nOn one of the largest American-led, white nationalist forums, a user recently argued that \"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a Jew. That's all you need to know.\"\n\n\"No,\" another responded. \"The correct perspective is that Putin is ... a Jew lover.\"\n\nElsewhere on that forum, a user started a thread to ask the community, \"Why there [sic] are so many putin lovers\" on the site these days. He elaborated, \"How can many members support a tyrant dwarf, soviet nostalgic lover and anti-white jewish puppet like putin?\"\n\n\"You seem to be brainwashed by jews beyond repair,\" another user snapped back.\n\nOn a white nationalist blog, the same figure who lauded Putin as \"a Christian King sent by God\" slapped at the Russian strongman's detractors, saying they were just \"triggered by any insult to Nazism.\"\n\nIn response to his pro-Putin rhetoric, another American white nationalist blog published a post calling him out by name. \"It is disgusting to see so many ignorant or malicious people in our movement... take the side of Putin and specifically citing how Putin is this great and wonderful man and how he's going to save the White race and stop the Jews,\" they spat. \"When in reality the Russian Federation is just as against our race and very much a Jewish controlled [state].\"\n\nA spokesperson for that blog told The Daily Beast that they believe pro-Putin views are in some cases a byproduct of contrarianism by critics of the American government within the white-nationalist movement. In others, they suggested pro-Kremlin stances are a direct result of American white nationalists taking money from or developing \"suspicious links to the Russian Government.\"\n\n\"They're just straight up State Actors,\" they argued.\n\nThis internal turmoil has led a few white nationalist groups to waffle in their public messaging on the conflict. Joshua Fisher-Birch, a researcher at the Counter Extremism Project, recounted how one notable Telegram channel made a pro-Russian post on Feb. 21, \"claiming that they were fighting against Jews, liberalism, and globalism.\" But the channel soon deleted it, and days later issued a wishy-washy statement about supporting white people rather than a nation.\n\nFisher-Birch pointed out that the founder of the group behind that channel and several of his associates had worked with Ukraine's far-right, anti-Kremlin Azov movement in the past, making the initial post awkward and inconsistent.\n\nOutsiders often talk about white nationalism-and white nationalists often present themselves -as one cohesive movement. But every expert The Daily Beast spoke to pointed out that there are actually tons of sub-movements and sub-currents within the ugly space, each with its own precise vision of what white ethnostates should look like, how to relate to governments and wider society, and the level of focus they put on antisemitism specifically, or on individual conspiracy theories.\n\nThese splits lead to squabbles anytime the movement latches on to a big event. Cooter, the sociologist, said by way of an example that, \"in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder, some group members viewed his death as an opportunity to challenge police authority, while others believed it evidenced the need to support police to avoid damage.\"\n\nBut as Lawrence of HOPE Not Hate pointed out, \"The crisis in Ukraine was particularly primed for controversy among white nationalists.\"\n\nThat is to say, it's a conflict framed, at least in part, around national self-determination and Western liberal values, key issues for these groups. And it involves a lot of direct rhetoric about Nazis and far-right extremism. Yet the sides in the conflict don't align easily with the childish, black-and-white narratives about cosmic forces of (white) good and (Jewish, multicultural) evil they thrive on.\n\nUkraine has a Western-aligned government and a Jewish president. But it's also home to the Azov movement, the Nazi-tinged militia currently fighting alongside forces loyal to that Jewish president. (Although Azov gets hyped on the far right, the overall Ukrainian neo-Nazi movement doesn't appear to be any larger or more active than similar movements in other nations.) Putin has spent years framing himself as a key supporter of the Western far right, and works with his nation ' s own white supremacist militias . But he also purports, however absurdly, to be waging a war against Nazism in Ukraine, and has reportedly deployed Muslim Chechen troops to fight (white) Ukrainians . He has a history of at least voicing support for minority groups within Russia, of working with folks the far right consider evil Jewish elites, and of cracking down on certain forms of far-right activity and hate speech in Russia, as well.\n\n\"A lot of white nationalists have pre-packaged narratives that leave them unsure how to interpret this,\" said Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an organization dedicated to fighting antisemitism-and named after a famous Nazi hunter. \"This is a totally confusing picture for a lot of them to look at.\"\n\nOr, as a white nationalist put it in a recent post on one forum, \"We live in strange times indeed. A country with a jewish president will need to rely on an antisemitic batallion [sic] of capable pro-White soldiers to repel the invasion let by another White traitor (Putin).\"\n\nHowever, rather than admit that maybe geopolitics aren't as simplistic as their bigoted narratives might suggest, white nationalists jump through wild hoops to explain away seeming paradoxes.\n\nKurt Braddock, an expert on far-right rhetoric, noted that groups interested in QAnon-type conspiracy theories and Trumpian MAGA rhetoric tend to side with Russia. Some of these people don't specifically consider themselves neo-Nazis, and so can just brush aside Putin's claims about denazification. Others claim he was just talking about the Azov Battalion, which they assert is actually an Israeli-run and -funded goon squad-based largely on observations about their \"suspicious physiognomy,\" their weapons, and a few stray comments in obscure articles. Any other apparent contradictions between Putin's actions and their beliefs get explained away as a necessary evil, or brilliant three-dimensional chess moves.\n\n\"Publicly Putin glorifies Stalin and evil Jews,\" one supporter wrote in a white-nationalist forum recently. \"However, I suspect that is a cover to buy him 22 years to prepare for what will happen next.\"\n\nThat is to say, a hoped-for fundamental overturning of the world order.\n\nGroups whose members consider themselves firm neo-Nazis and put antisemitism front and center in their agendas, however, have a harder time forgiving Putin's denazification rhetoric and past anti-Nazi actions within Russia. Some white nationalists also take serious issue with the prospect of Putin using Chechen troops in Ukraine. (Adding to the confusion, some Chechens have fought on behalf of Ukraine against Russian influence in the past.)\n\n\"We are aware that the current Ukrainian Government sucks shit,\" one such white nationalist group wrote in a recent blog post. \"It's a bad government run by a literal Jewish Clown... However this doesn't mean we should just go support Putin flushing Ukraine with a bunch of non-White Mongoloids who will most certainly pillage and rape the White population of Ukraine.\" (This is a racist reference to Chechen troops.)\n\n\"We support Ukraine National Socialist groups such as the Azov Regiment and we support the people of Ukraine currently fighting against non-white muslim\" people the post continues. (The original post used a Russian slur specifically for people from the Caucasus region, including Chechens.)\n\nIn other words, they stand with Ukraine-just not its government. In fact, some of these groups hope that the Azov Battalion's supposed heroism in the conflict will inspire a white nationalist revolution once the conflict ends, turning Ukraine into a bastion for far-right extremists like them.\n\nThe tension between these conspiratorial reinterpretations of reality have led to a surge of backbiting and accusations across the white nationalist web between proponents of different views on the Ukraine conflict. Posters on movement forums call each other brainwashed morons or controlled opposition, attempt to debunk each other's claims and call for more rigorous sources, and accuse each other of having white blood on their hands. \"You are so obvious, tell your handler you need a refresher course,\" one poster on a prominent forum said to another advancing a pro-Ukraine argument.\n\n\"Are you referring to yourself in the third person?\" that individual retorted, third-grader-style (while misidentifying the second-person voice), adding, \"I hear the Russian embassy in Tel Aviv is hiring.\"\n\nModerators on that forum in particular are now regularly pleading with their members to stop calling each other names and picking fights. The site \"exists to help solve problems, not to squabble incessantly,\" one admin wrote in a recent post, threatening mod action against users.\n\nThis confusion and infighting, as well as conspiratorial tendencies and hardline bigotry, may explain why many white-nationalist groups and individuals have basically decided to stay out of the whole thing. \"Russia is a ZOG. Ukraine is a ZOG,\" one cynical poster wrote, using white nationalist slang for a state supposedly secretly controlled by malicious, shadowy, Jewish elites, summing up this stance.\n\n\"That kind of conspiracy theory simplifies an intrinsically complicated situation, allowing people to maintain ideologies without the cognitive dissonance\" of taking a side, Braddock argued.\n\nRather than a trivial pissing match between ill-willed and ill-informed actors limited to the confines of their own little dystopian universe, experts suspect that this bizarre squabble between racists may have worrying implications for the wider world.\n\n\"This kind of split in opinion can lead to enormous infighting in, and the dissolution of, certain groups,\" according to Cooter, based on her observations of the far-right space throughout history.\n\nSome white nationalists certainly seem worried about the damage division over how to read and react to the Ukraine conflict could do to them. \"People are liable to pick a favorite one way or another,\" a poster in a white-nationalist forum recently wrote. \"But can we PLEASE NOT ALLOW THIS TO POLARIZE WHITE NATIONALISTS AGAINST THE OTHER?\"\n\nNone of the experts or white nationalists The Daily Beast spoke to for this story had a sense of how deep or far the cracks in the movement triggered by this conflict will spread. That likely depends on how the war progresses, according to Sophie Bjork-James, an anthropologist who studies white nationalism.\n\nHowever, even if this disorder does lead to shake ups in the movement, Cooter cautioned, that's not necessarily a positive outcome for the rest of society. After all, if a group disintegrates, its members won't stop being white nationalists, she noted-they'll just flee elsewhere. And the groups that remain may just double down on their most extreme, conspiratorial beliefs in response to internal criticism.\n\n\"We could see extreme elements radicalize even further,\" she said, \"becoming more dangerous.\"\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "The Sickening History of Marjorie Taylor Greene's Hometown\n\nWhen Marjorie Taylor Greene, the new congresswoman known for her racist and anti-Semitic rants, was a senior at South Forsyth County High School in 1992, a few dozen Black marchers made their way through the Georgia county's rain-slicked streets singing old protest songs and carrying signs reading \"We Shall Overcome\" and \"Black and White Together.\" The route was flanked by hundreds of snarling white racists waving Confederate flags and shouting ′′Go home, n---ers.\"\n\nThe marchers had been marking five years since the 1987 \"Walk for Brotherhood\" drew international condemnation to all-white Forsyth County. Newspaper accounts describe protesters being pelted with so many \"rocks, bottles and mud thrown from a crowd of Ku Klux Klan members and their supporters\" that they were forced to abandon the two-and-half mile route. Forsyth County had maintained an unwritten whites-only policy dating to 1912 , when white vigilantes lynched a black man and drove out nearly all of the African American residents. The county's reputation as too dangerous for Black folks to even drive through-a courthouse lawn sign in the 1950s and '60s warned \" N---er, Don't Let the Sun Set on You \" - was well earned. ''I have been in the civil rights movement for 30 years,\" Hosea Williams, an acolyte of Martin Luther King Jr and organizer of the Forsyth County march, told the New York Times in 1987. \"I'm telling you we've got a South Africa in the backyard of Atlanta, Georgia.''\n\nAfter the 1987 protest, many of Forsyth County's white residents lashed out at the media for supposedly shaming them, including one local who told the Atlanta Constitution that \"we should have busted every camera down there and kicked every reporter's ass.\" Thirty-three years later, before the Jan. 4 vote when a handful of Republicans joined Democrats to strip Greene of House committee seats , she gave a speech blaming her most outrageous comments on \"cancel culture,\" \"Facebook posts\" and \"big media,\" which she described as wanting to \"crucify me in the public square for words that I said.\" But while the internet and the media made me do it may be a convenient, if stupefying, excuse, it seems more likely that Greene's existing views, perhaps developed during her time in Forsyth County, found affirmation in Trumpist corners online.\n\nForsyth County today is nearly one-quarter Asian and Hispanic. But only 4 percent of its denizens are Black , in a state where one-third of the people are Black. The county was recently ranked one of the richest counties in Georgia, its grand houses and country clubs obscuring a history of Black bloodshed and standing on sites once occupied by Black churches and homes. That land was long ago stolen from Black folks during a campaign of terror that has been called \"the most successful racial cleansing in U.S. history.\"\n\nBefore 1912, Black folks made up roughly 10 percent of Forsyth County 's population of nearly 11,000. Elliot Jaspin, author of Buried in the Bitter Waters: The Hidden History of Racial Cleansing , estimates that local Black residents \" owned or rented 109 of the county's farms and paid over $30,000 in local taxes.\" Many of the area's Black occupants had generations of antecedents who had been enslaved in the area. Their lives would change almost overnight after Mae Crow, an 18-year-old white girl, was found unconscious in a wooded area roughly a mile from her Forsyth County home on Sept. 9, 1912.\n\nCrow had been raped and beaten bloody, left for all but dead by her assailants. (News of her assault came just days after another local white woman, Ellen Grice, alleged that she had been \"awakened by the presence of a Negro man in her bed.\" White vigilantes horsewhipped Grant Smith, a prominent Black preacher, to within an inch of his life after he publicly named Grice a \" sorry white woman \" who had lied about having consensual interracial sex. Notably, the Black men arrested for the crime later saw the charges dropped .) Crow spent two weeks in a coma, then succumbed to death.\n\nSheriff William W. Reid-who would go on to co-found a Forsyth County KKK \"klavern \" in the 1920s-hastily arrested a 24-year-old Black man named Robert Edwards for the attack on Crow. Reid abandoned his post long enough for a white mob to descend upon the county jail , where they \"shot Edwards as he cowered in his cell, then bashed in his skull with crowbars,\" author Patrick Phillips recounts in Blood at the Root: A Racial Cleansing in America . \"Edwards emerged alive, pleading for mercy, and died while being dragged from the back of a wagon, a noose cinched tight around his neck.\" After lynching Edwards, the white mob \"took turns with pistols and shotguns, and each time a load of buckshot spun the mutilated corpse, the crowd of hundreds roared.\"\n\nTwo more Black boys-16-year-old Ernest Knox and 18-year-old Oscar Daniel -were also arrested for the crime, their confessions coerced through violence. Both were convicted and sentenced to hanging by an all-white jury in two separate trials held the same day . More than 5,000 people turned up to watch the lynchings of those two Black children, a grotesque portrait of Forsyth County's white citizens' unquenchable thirst for Black death and endless need for white power. Phillips writes that the throngs of white onlookers brought \"their quilts, their children and their picnic baskets\" with them to the local hillsides, from which they had a clear view of the execution.\n\nThe lynchings of Knox, Daniel and Edwards-killings that used their Black presence as evidence of guilt-took place against a backdrop of rampant white violence and terror against all of Forsyth County's Black citizenry. In the two months between the September attack on Crow and the end of October, an estimated 1,098 Black folks were chased out of Forsyth County limits, their schools and churches firebombed, their lives threatened by night riders in hoods and cloaks. Nearly 1,900 acres of farmland were sold or, more often, simply seized by whites in land grabs. \"White neighbors harvested abandoned crops without apology or compensation, stole what horses, cows, and hogs were left unattended, and plundered property for fence posts, house timbers, and barn boards with impunity,\" Casey Cep writes in The New Yorker . \"Even the dead were run out of town: headstones from Black cemeteries were taken and made into flagstones for white property owners, their inscriptions erased with every step.\"\n\nPhillips writes that white folks in Forsyth County were deeply invested in the notion that \"\"racial purity\" was their inheritance and birthright.\" Every conceivable manifestation of white racist terror, including lynchings, was commonplace across the South, but Forsyth County retained the dubious distinction of keeping its whiteness intact for decades upon decades.\n\nDuring the Jim Crow era, the county did not require signs delineating \"white\" and \"colored\" spaces, because there were no Black residents to keep separate. In 1968, a group of 10 Black kids and their adult chaperones on an overnight trip from Atlanta were told by locals to leave the Lake Lanier campgrounds or be removed \"feet first.\" Throughout the 1970s, Black delivery truck drivers making stops at Forsyth County's Tyson chicken plant had to be escorted by agents from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to ensure their safety.\n\nIn 1980, a Black Atlanta firefighter attending his Black girlfriend's company picnic in a public park was shot by a local man who later reportedly told police , \"Somebody has got to keep the n---ers out of Forsyth County.\" That same year, the U.S. Census reported one Black person among Forsyth County's population of 30,000. A Southern regional newspaper from the era wrote that \"even county leaders think that must have been someone playing a joke with the questionnaire.\"\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene's most outlandish quotes-about fire-starting Jewish space lasers and 9/11 fakery -have gotten endless pickup, perhaps because they make her seem like a newfangled breed of far-out crackpot. But Greene's ideas about Black folks aren't innovative or creative, they're just garden-variety, old-school racism. Greene is, of course, a birther who has claimed Barack Obama is a secret Muslim. In a video unearthed this January, she claims that \"being in gangs and dealing drugs is what holds\" Black and Hispanic men back, concluding \"it's not white people.\" She once stated that there are \"white people that are as lazy and sorry and probably worse than Black people,\" an assessment she probably considers a generous concession. Greene has called Black voters \"slaves to the Democratic Party\"-racists always love a slavery allusion-and suggested African Americans should be \" proud\" of monuments to Confederates because they're supposedly a reminder of how far Black folks have come.\n\nIt's unlikely that Greene's Forsyth County high school taught her the history of white terror that would have explained the overwhelming whiteness of her classes. Her textbooks also likely omitted Forsyth County's history dating to 1829, when the discovery of gold drew thousands of white miners to what was then Cherokee territory . The rapaciousness of those white gold seekers led to the cruel forced removal of Creek and Cherokee people westward along the Trail of Tears . Perhaps her ignorance of this long history of ethnic cleansings-and its connection with America's larger legacy of white supremacy-explains Greene's videotaped insistence that \"the most mistreated group of people in the United States today are white males.\"\n\nBut it is nearly impossible that Greene is ignorant about Forsyth County's more recent racist history. The 1987 civil rights march that made international news just five years before the commemorative protest, itself a big news event, took place during her senior year of high school. At a press conference one day ahead of the event, intended to mark the celebration of the new federal holiday celebrating Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, Hosea Williams called for all \"those who support the non-violent philosophy of Dr. King\" to march together through Forsyth County in a statement of interracial solidarity.\n\nThe group of protesters, numbering about 50, could not have anticipated the rage of the racists they encountered, who outnumbered them by scores. Newspaper accounts describe Williams and other marchers being pelted with so many \"rocks, bottles and mud thrown from a crowd of Ku Klux Klan members and their supporters\" that they were forced to abandon the two-and-half mile route and return to the chartered buses that delivered them from Atlanta. (Footage of the march, and there is plenty , shows the white racists being barely restrained by police.) Even Williams, the veteran civil rights organizer, was astonished. \"I have never seen such hatred,\" he told the Times after the march. \"There were youngsters 10 and 12 years old screaming their lungs out, 'Kill the n---ers.' ''\n\nA week later, Williams returned to Forsyth County in an attempt to finish what he started. By then, images from the first protest had been beamed around the country and internationally, and \"Forsyth County\" had become  a stand-in for the kind of violent white racism this country fallaciously insists is \"not who we are.\" The number of anti-racist marchers at the second protest ballooned to somewhere between 12,000 and 20,000 , and included Jesse Jackson, Rep. John Lewis, Coretta Scott King, Senator Gary Hart, and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young.\n\nOne week later, Oprah Winfrey brought her new talk show to town, filling the audience with local Forsyth County residents, whom she earnestly asked at one point, \"Do you not even watch The Cosby Show ?'' (Asked after the taping if she felt comfortable in Forsyth County, the host stated, \"Not very comfortable at all. I'm leaving.′′) The self-identified head of the Committee to Keep Forsyth County White took his  turn at her mic to boast that the angry white mob represented \"the largest white people's protest against communism and race-mixing in the last 30 years.\"\n\nThose words hew awful close to a post Greene shared more than 30 years later , which declared, \"Zionist supremacists have schemed to promote immigration and miscegenation.\"\n\nThe mantra of every white racist is that racism is just something that Black folks made up. Naturally, Greene is an adherent of this idea.\n\n\"Guess what? Slavery is over,\" she stated in one video , rejecting the idea that discrimination is a real problem. \"Black people have equal rights.\"\n\n\"I understand [Blacks] weren't run out,\" one white Forsyth County resident said on national television in 1987, exhibiting the same kind of racist denial. \"I understand that they left over a period of time.\"\n\nBefore she picked up stakes and relocated to a more winnable Georgia district for her 2020 congressional run, Greene lived in Alpharetta , a tony suburb of Atlanta under 20 miles south of Forsyth County. Since winning her election, Greene has continued to label Black Lives Matter a \" domestic terrorist \" organization, and recently signed onto a bill that would ban BLM flags, which she labels \"hate America\" banners, from being flown atop diplomatic outposts. Greene has been far less critical of the treasonous white supremacist terrorists that she egged on to attack the Capitol in early January during an attempted coup she referred to as a \" 1776 moment .\"\n\nBack in Forsyth County, there have been vague gestures toward tallying the land reparations owed to Black families whose lands were stolen , though the issue, as in the rest of the country, remains unresolved and mostly unacknowledged. The 1912 lynching of Robert Edwards is finally being acknowledged in Forsyth County with a historical marker that went up in January . On its face, the marker describes the horrific treatment endured by Edwards and the despicable actions of the white crowd that took sick pleasure in carrying out his murder.\n\n\"Forsyth County would remain essentially all white until the 1990s,\" the plaque states. \"No one was held accountable for Edward's lynching or the racial cleansing that followed. Like all victims of racial terror lynchings Rob Edwards died without due process of law.\"\n\nGreene should pay a visit sometime.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Shattering the Hollywood Myths of the Tulsa Race Massacre\n\nConjuring a picture of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre proves to be a struggle without a fictional re-creation. These days, it's the mint green childhood home of fictional WWII veteran Montrose Freeman from HBO's Black fantasy phantasmagoria Lovecraft Country that immediately comes to mind, as if some seafaring monstrosity molded by H.P. himself spat it out onto the Greenwood block that would ultimately be ablaze by the end of the night. The ninth episode saw the show's leads-Atticus Freeman ( Jonathan Majors ), Leti (Jurnee Smollett), and Montrose ( Michael K. Williams )-rewinding the timeline to that fateful day, knowing what would take place on the 35 blocks of Greenwood lovingly termed Black Wall Street. They carry the knowledge of the killing, the pillaging, the joyous savagery of white police and laymen on their faces, their shoulders slumped in discomforting remembrance while staring into the green.\n\nIt's difficult to imagine another singular Black event referenced in fiction, in documentaries and in half-hour TV specials like the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921. By now, the story is rock-solid in our historical frame. On June 1, 1921, in the Black business district of Greenwood, the arrest of a Black teenager, Dick Rowland-who was accused of assaulting a White woman, Sarah Page, in a hotel elevator-led to local papers calling for a lynch mob. In response, Black folks took up arms and peacefully vowed to defend Rowland's right to a fair trial. The image alone of Black people protecting one another in what was understood as a Black town so infuriated white people that they grabbed their guns to protect themselves. From what? Who knows. Needless to say, shit hit the proverbial fan fairly quickly and Greenwood became a mass killing-an exhibition of virulent white terror executed by both police and deputized white people.\n\nSo then, it was fairly predictable that a historic spectacle like this one hitting 100 years without truly being excavated in the mainstream would necessitate a reassessment by popular culture. But the centennial celebration kicked off a bit early. Damon Lindelof's wildly successful 2019 superhero remix, Watchmen , ripped off the historical Band-Aid, opening its tale with the white homicidal chaos of the riot. A year later, another HBO show, Lovecraft Country , would dip back into the well, portraying the slaughter as a time-traveling scavenger hunt for a magical book that would save a Black family. Both depictions are truly riveting and accentuate, in glossy panache, the intense, gruesome nature of unhinged white fascism. The History Channel and ABC followed suit with their non-fiction excavations, speaking directly to descendants of the massacre about the bodies buried underneath the soil, the emotional and psychological toll it took on the land and their families, and what they're demanding from the local and state government as restitution.\n\nThe work of recognizing those affected by the massacre has largely been carried out by well-known white-run studios, which begs inquiry into their intention, meanings, and messaging. Over its two hour-long episodes, Tulsa Burning: The 1921 Race Massacre , directed by the prolific Stanley Nelson and executive produced by NBA superstar Russell Westbrook, provides a multidirectional lens on the tragedy and residual harm that the attack on Black life had on its citizens; while historians like Hannibal B. Johnson, who's work on what he terms \"Black Main Street\" in Tulsa Burning , gave life to the idea that these 35 blocks encompassed some of the more innovative and distinguished Black businesses in the country.\n\nHistorian Michelle Mitchell notes that in this early part of the 20th century, in the wake of Reconstruction-and around the time the Ku Klux Klan was formed-Oklahoma was generally a place that \"Black people wanted to be.\" Illegitimate land grants made the \"Indian Territory\" of Oklahoma primed for white resettlement. The residents understood Tulsa's history of vigilante violence. The Tulsa Outrage of 1917-when a founder of Tulsa and Ku Klux Klan member W. Tate Brady led the tarring and feathering of a dozen members of the Industrial Workers of the World, who were charged for vagrancy-was a signal to many that the link between police and deputized white people was cemented. When they made community for themselves, it was clear that poor whites' animosity toward \"economically liberated\" Black people could froth over to real anti-Black violence. All they needed was the right moment.\n\nThe exact number of deaths and injuries has always been up for debate-early, largely propagandist, reports found that only 36 people died, but a 2001 commission found that the realistic number was between 150-300 people killed with over 800 people injured. And that doesn't even measure the toll it took on the psyche of people like Brenda Nails Alford, whose grandparents were surviving victims. In both History Channel's and ABC's retelling, she remembers rolling past the site of the violence as a child, sitting in the back of cars, and listening to the haunting whispers of friends and family revealing that's where the victims are  buried. The scale of the massacre became a ghost story that residents would share over dinner tables, but real excavation and recognition from the local government wouldn't take place until two generations later.\n\nWhen considering what was lost in the war zone Greenwood became, the documentaries Tulsa Burning and Tulsa's Buried Truth deem the event the single worst incident of racial violence in American history. But that wasn't the only messaging being presented here. What was lost wasn't just the buildings, the businesses, and the confidence-it was the accumulated wealth. That loss, and the construction of a museum, called Greenwood Rising: Black Wall Street History Center, have amplified local demands for reparations. While those constructing the facility put forth the notion that Greenwood Rising may lead to a case for financially compensating descendants of the massacre, Tulsa's mayor G.T. Bynum has reiterated on numerous occasions that reparations through taxing individuals who themselves were never a part of the racist attack was out of the question. Instead, as both docs seem to bear out, the government believes that the discovery of the bodies underneath the soil-and the recognition that this tragedy did happen-would bring solace to the families. Recognizing the political conundrum, one of those descendants, L. Joi McCondichie, mentions that \"reparation is taboo\" and that \"the core of what we're talking about is generational wealth.\"\n\nFar be it from any of us to tell the victims of a tragedy what is truly important; everyone has a different stake in the game. For some, the catharsis of recognition alone is enough, but for others who've seen the destruction of homes, businesses, and communities, it seems that both parties are misreading the realities that the Tulsa residents of 1921, who armed themselves to protect Dick Rowland, understood quite well: that economic freedom for Black people in the U.S. has never translated to actual political power. The idea that it does is part and parcel to the myth of Black capitalism and buying power that Black thinkers like Morgan State University Prof. Jared A. Ball seeks to dismantle.\n\nThe Tulsa Race Massacre as featured in HBO's Lovecraft Country\n\n\"There is a desire to, as much as possible, despite the histories involved, project capitalism and more specifically Black capitalism for Black people as a solution,\" Prof. Ball explains to The Daily Beast. \"What's drawing pop-cultural depiction [of Tulsa], whether it's Lovecraft Country or more traditional writing, journalism and documentary work, the narrative is narrowly reduced to: Black people were doing well and jealous racists burned it down and went on a killing rampage. And that's what killed Black Wall Street. When the narratives are framed to those limits then looking back from today, the argument can be projected to fit an already existing need to tell Black people that after that kind of vigilante violence, all you can do is re-create Black Wall Street wherever you are.\"\n\nThe myth that Black business can free Black communities from racial oppression has been rooted in Black political thought both radical and traditional-from Marcus Garvey and W.E.B Du Bois to the Urban League, the NAACP, Booker T. Washington and, more recently, talk show host Tavis Smiley and legendary radio host Tom Joyner. In Ball's book, The Myth and Propaganda of Black Buying Power , the African and African-American Diaspora professor sources the myth back to bootstrapping 20th century political and sociological titans, but its more recent iteration is \"propelled by misreadings and poor (false) interpretations of Nielsen surveys and marketing reports produced by the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the Terry College of Business housed by Bank of America Financial Center in Athens, GA.\" Prof. Ball homes in on the oft-referenced and unfounded claim that \"African America has roughly $1 trillion in 'buying power'\" that has been \"both friendly and hostile to the Black community\" and \"is unparalleled anywhere in political, economic, or media analyses.\"\n\nA simple perusal of how buying power is measured will immediately dispel any notion that Black people's \"power\" can fundamentally change their position in our economic order. \"For example,\" Ball writes, \"the median income for Black America was reported in 2018 at $40,258, and there are roughly 40 million African Americans in the United States. For there to be what is popularly understood as more than $1 trillion in buying power, this would mean each and every single Black person would have to spend at least every single penny earned. Every woman, and man, regardless of age, would have to spend it all to amass the acclaimed number.\"\n\nFor, Ball, the idea of Black buying power has been \"raised in defense of reparations where it was argued that Black people need another Black Wall Street, citing an article entitled, \"#BuyBlack Reinforces Efforts from Civil Rights,\" which mentions \"an allusion to traditions of Black political struggle which emphasized more conservative notions of self-help, Black business, and Black capitalism.\"\n\nFor some descendants of the massacre, the idea that wealth had been built and concentrated in Greenwood, spectacularly disassembled in 1921 and never repaired has been a driving force for the claim to reparations. But, as Ball explains to The Daily Beast, that idea isn't totally historically accurate. \"What really happened was a handful of Black people doing well in the business district, probably no more than five percent of the population, were Black bourgeoisie business owners who were benefiting from the wealth of white oil owners in surrounding Oklahoma. They were able to drive relationships and employ Black people... but ultimately only benefitted a handful of Black elites.\"\n\nBut the real ahistorical reading of Black Wall Street comes in the fact that residents were indeed able to rebuild the area. \"After this event in 1921, Black people rebuilt Black Wall Street and by the 1940s, it was even bigger and more affluent. But this part of the story doesn't get told because what fully destroyed Black Wall Street wasn't vigilante white violence but organized policy-federal government public policy-which included driving a major highway right down the middle of the Black Wall Street district, dividing it, weakening it, shattering it, etc., which has been done to Black communities all over the country for at least a century. Instead of mythologies about buying power or Black capitalism in Tulsa, what we need to understand is it's not the lack of business acumen, financial literacy, or effort, but the lack of political power.\"\n\nIndeed, Du Bois himself remarked that by 1926, \"Black Tulsa is a happy city. It has new clothes. It is young and gay and strong.\" But the push for urban renewal in the area manifested into the federally- funded highway program, nominally the Federal Highway Acts of 1965 and 1968, which established the construction of four different highways to create a loop. Carlos Moreno, a Tulsa-based graphic designer and author who wrote A Kid's Book About the Tulsa Massacre , posited, in a Next City essay earlier this year that, \"The north (I-244) and east (U.S. 75) sections of the IDL were designed to replace the dense, diverse, mixed-use, mixed-income, pedestrian, and transit-oriented Greenwood and Kendall-Whittier neighborhoods.\" What this did, according to Tulsa residents, was a second, more permanent, killing. Moreno cites Tulsa survivor Mabel Little, \"whose family lost their home and businesses in the 1921 massacre, rebuilt and lost them both again in 1970. Little told the Tulsa Tribune in 1970, 'You destroyed everything we had. I was here, and the people are suffering more now than they did then.'\"\n\nSo, while the fictional universes of Watchmen and Lovecraft Country do have separate content goals-for Watchmen as narrative thrust and Lovecraf t as magical goose-chase-neither they nor their documentarian contemporaries speak to the real culprit of Tulsa's destruction.\n\nTo be sure, pop culture isn't necessarily meant to be educational in that way. But with such a failed system of education-especially as it relates to race-in this country, people often turn to fictional works for understanding the history of places and people. The problem, as Ball notes, is that many of these narratives are narrowly constructed and serve advertisements and escapism. While Watchmen and Lovecraft may have unlocked a fascination, they're incapable of retelling the destruction of a region through public policy. It's just not entertaining enough.\n\nAs Black August-the month-long celebration of freedom fighters complete with reading lists, fasting, and renewed commitments to Black liberation-and the centennial recognition of Tulsa 1921 comes to a close, the myths targeting Black audiences and histories that press the idea of Black economic reparation and capitalism still serve white interests, while the reality of political power falls to the back-burner. And there is no fantastical re-creation that can change that.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Tim Scott Goes on 'The View,' Rails Against Hosts' 'Offensive' Comments About Him\n\nSenior Media Reporter\n\nDuring his Monday appearance on The View , GOP presidential hopeful Tim Scott blasted the hosts' recent \"dangerous\" and \"offensive\" comments about Black Republicans like himself.\n\nThe impact of his forceful rebuttal, however, was somewhat blunted by the fact that co-host Joy Behar-who claimed last month that Scott doesn't \"get\" systemic racism, wasn't actually on the broadcast. The longtime View host is generally off on Mondays.\n\nLast month, Behar sparked outrage-especially from conservatives-when she compared Scott to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas while dismissing their views on racism.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"He's one of these guys who, you know, he's like Clarence Thomas,\" she said at the time. \"Black Republican who believes in pulling yourself by your bootstraps, rather than, to me, understanding the systemic racism that African Americans face in this country-and other minorities. He doesn't get it. Neither does Clarence. And that's why they're Republicans.\"\n\nDuring that same broadcast, co-host Sunny Hostin added that Scott \"seems to think because I made it, everyone can make it , ignoring again the fact that he is the exception and not the rule.\" Whoopi Goldberg, meanwhile, argued that the South Carolina senator was using a \"dog whistle\" of victimhood and suffered from \"Clarence Thomas Syndrome.\"\n\nAhead of his scheduled appearance on The View , Scott lashed out at the hosts. \"I think it's time for a conservative with a backbone to look those ladies in the eyes and say you do not have to be an exception to succeed in America,\" he exclaimed at a campaign event last week.\n\nIt didn't take long for the fireworks to start during Monday's interview, which spanned half of the hourlong talk show. Referencing Scott's own impoverished upbringing, Hostin-who is Black and Latina-noted that she was also raised in the \"projects amidst a lot of poverty and violence.\"\n\nAfter pointing out that Scott was the first Black senator elected from the South since Reconstruction, Hostin wondered why the lawmaker claims his life story \"disproves leftist lies\" when it appears he is the \"exception,\" by definition.\n\n\"And my question to you is, I'm the exception, right? You're the exception. Maybe even Miss Whoopi Goldberg is the exception. But we are not the rule,\" she continued, adding, \"At nearly every turn, these achievements were fought, threatened, and erased, most often by white violence. You have indicated that you don't believe in systemic racism. What is your definition of systemic racism?\"\n\nWith Hostin wondering if he even believes systemic racism exists, Scott fired back that the host's question itself was reckless.\n\n\"One of the things I think about and one of the reasons why I'm on the show is because of the comments that were made, frankly, on this show, that the only way for a young African-American kid to be successful in this country is to be the exception and not the rule,\" the presidential candidate stated. \"That is a dangerous, offensive, disgusting message to send to our young people today that the only way to succeed is by being the exception.\"\n\nThe two went back and forth over whether or not he actually was an exception, with Scott arguing that the nation has already experienced an African-American president and vice-president, along with two Black secretaries of state. When Hostin pushed back by referencing the high rate of Black homelessness, Scott reminded the host that \"you like people to be deferential and respectful\" before asking her to allow him to finish answering her question.\n\nElsewhere in the lengthy interview, Goldberg once again chastised the live in-studio audience for booing their guest, echoing a similar moment last month when she scolded the crowd for jeering Gov. Chris Sununu (R-NH) over his pro-gun stance.\n\n\"No, no, no,\" she exclaimed after several audience members groaned over Scott's suggestion that Disney is \"radical left\" and \"indoctrinating\" young children.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" Goldberg continued. \"Do not boo. This is The View . We accept-we don't have to believe everything people say, but you cannot boo people here, please. You cannot do it.\"\n\nYet, while Scott believed that Disney had become \"woke\" and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \"started off on the right foot\" by making the entertainment behemoth a centerpiece of the right's culture wars, he disagreed with DeSantis \"weaponizing\" his state's government against the company.\n\nI think the fact of the matter is that the First Amendment-every single person should exercise their First Amendment rights,\" he concluded. \"If they don't like what's happening with a corporation, stop shopping there.\"\n\nSenior Media Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "'The United States of Lyncherdom' Didn't End With Tulsa\n\nLast week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a blanket memo warning that \"upcoming commemoration events associated with the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre in Oklahoma probably are attractive targets for some racially or ethnically motivated violent extremist-white supremacists to commit violence.\" The bulletin didn't cite specific threats, but the mere fact that officials considered the warning warranted proves some things never change in these United States.\n\nA century ago, everyday white Oklahomans deputized by Tulsa's police to \"get a gun and get a n---er\" indiscriminately shot, burned out, and dropped bombs on Tulsa's prosperous \"Black Wall Street\" District, dumping an unknowable number of bodies in mass graves after they killed at least 300 Black Americans. Like so much racist violence in this country-from the murder of Emmett Till to the Charleston Mother Emmanuel Massacre -the killers justified their murders with a lie of the white imagination. Today, the mere acknowledgment and remembrance of that act of white terrorism, the current gravest threat to national security , is considered a potential provocation to yet more white violence.\n\nTulsa was far from the only thriving Black community of the early 20th century-in fact, Oklahoma had several all-Black towns -destroyed by white violence. Even in the shadow of enslavement, Black folks built sites of political autonomy, economic opportunity and relative safety from the unstinting threat of white American terror. As early as 1738, under the reign of Spain's King Philip V, enslaved Black folks escaped plantations in English Carolina and established the Florida town of Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose, the first free Black settlement in the colonies , while the 18th and early 19th centuries saw the foundings of Maryland's \" The Hill \" community, Indiana's \" Lyles Station ,\" Illinois's \" New Philadelphia \" and the Wilberforce Settlement in Ontario, Canada. But most freedmen's towns were founded after Reconstruction, when the U.S. government pulled troops from former Confederate states and left emancipated Black folks to deal with white supremacist vengefulness in the form of Jim Crow.\n\n\"Reconstruction after Destruction by Fire caused by Race Riots, Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA, American National Red Cross Photograph Collection, 1921\"\n\nThe \"Exoduster\" movement, led by Henry Adams and \" Pap\" Singleton -a coffin-maker whose vocation made him intimate with the wages of white racist violence-brought multiple Black settlements to Kansas (\"It is better to starve to death in Kansas than to be shot and killed in the South,\" one Black news outlet wrote in 1879 ), which had been preceded by towns such as Shankleville, Texas, and rural Black homesteading settlements across Indiana and Ohio. By the late 1880s , at least 200 freedmen's towns had been founded across the country, including Eatonville, Florida, described by native daughter Zora Neal Hurston in Of Mules and Men as a \"city of five lakes, three croquet courts, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, plenty guavas, two schools, and no jailhouse.\" Some of those towns-the Tenth Street Historic District of Dallas, Texas; Langston , Oklahoma; and Eatonville among them-survive.\n\nBut a significant number of freedmen's towns were abandoned in the 1920s, casualties of racist lending and credit practices during the Great Depression, Black political disenfranchisement under Jim Crow, and white racial terror violence. Rosewood, Florida, among the most well-known, was mostly reduced to cinders in 1923 as its Black residents were forced to flee mobs of murderous white vigilantes who beset the town when a local white woman lied about being attacked by a Black man. As many as 100 residents of Leflore, a majority-Black county in Mississippi, were lynched and fatally shot in 1889 because local agrarians dared establish a Colored Farmers' Alliance. In 1901, white mobs armed themselves with guns taken from a Missouri military armory and murdered at least three Pierce City Black men after a white woman was found dead; more than 200 other Black residents who were forced to abandon their homes \"left by the trains, in wagons, horseback and on foot, taking whatever of their property it was possible and leaving anything which would in any way prove an impediment,\" according to a newspaper article at the time. Mark Twain penned The United States of Lyncherdom in response to the murders, but did not publish it during his lifetime, reportedly out of fear of losing Southern friends.\n\nThe Slocum Massacre in East Texas deserves recognition here. The 1910 anti-Black pogrom was rumored to have roots in a debt dispute between a white farmer named Reddin Alford and Marsh Holley, son of a formerly enslaved local Black landowner and prosperous businessman named Jack Holley. Other stories mention Jim Spurger , who after learning a Black farmer named Abe Wilson was the boss of an all-white road construction crew, roused local whites. The late East Texas politician Jerry Sadler, grandson of an enslaver in the area, wrote in his 1984 memoir that \"the whites wanted the land that the Blacks owned, and they had decided finally that there was only one way to get it. The Blacks had some of the most desirable farmland in the county.\"\n\nOn July 29, armed white men from Slocum and surrounding areas reportedly went \"road to road and cabin to cabin, shooting down African Americans in their tracks.\" Charlie Wilson, a Black Slocum resident who was wounded but survived, later told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that white terrorists using \"shotguns and Winchesters... did not say a word when they fired on us.\" The county sheriff told reporters that the mobs also cut telephone wires , then began \"killing Negroes as fast as they could find them. And, so far as I was able to ascertain, without any real cause. These Negroes have never done anything that I could discover. There was just a hot-headed gang hunting them down and killing them.\" He lamented that \"we won't find some of the bodies until the location is revealed to us by the buzzards.\"\n\nThe death toll was given at the time as somewhere between eight and 20 , but Black survivors estimate as many as 200 of their friends and neighbors were killed , and as in Tulsa, many of the dead were tossed in mass graves . \"In many cases relatives of the Negroes discovered the whereabouts of a body and dragged it to a secluded spot during the hours of the night,\" a Houston newspaper reported at the time. \"On account of the fact that several bodies have been thus disposed of, the exact number of Negroes killed will never be known... No white man was injured during the trouble.\" Nor was any white man ultimately prosecuted for the murders.\n\nMarsh Holley and his surviving relatives, like nearly all of their Black neighbors, fled Slocum and resettled in nearby towns. The Holley family, still fearing for their lives, changed the spelling of their surname to \"Hollie .\" In 2016, largely due to the efforts of Constance Hollie-Jawaid, Marsh's great granddaughter and E.R. Bills, author of The 1910 Slocum Massacre: An Act of Genocide in East Texas , an historical marker was erected in Slocum to honor the victims and recognize the massacre. This happened despite obstruction from some local officials who seemed to suggest descendants of those murdered should just get over it.\n\n\"It's a sad situation, but I feel like we're all past it and other ones carry the burden on their shoulders,\" then-County Commissioner Greg Chapin told a local news outlet in 2015. \"Their ancestors dealt with it years and years ago, but some of them don't let it go.\"\n\n\"The citizens of Slocum today had absolutely nothing to do with what happened over a hundred years ago,\" County Historical Commission chair Jimmy Odom wrote at the time , calling the idea \"blackmail by shame.\"\n\nHe complained that \"this is a nice, quiet community with a wonderful school system. It would be a shame to mark them as racist from now until the end of time.\"\n\nThe Slocum Massacre, like the massacre in Tulsa, \"was kept alive for decades in the Black community long after whites had erased it from the official record,\" as Charles M. Mills writes . Sadler noted in his memoir that three years after the Slocum massacre, the \"county courthouse was burned by an arsonist\" and, quite conveniently, \"the records were destroyed.\" Ed Wheeler, a white Tulsan who in 1970 began researching the murders in his hometown, has recounted the threats received when he began digging into the history. (\"Black folks were anxious to tell the story, but every interview was at their church with a minister present,\" Wheeler told a Tulsa news outlet this year. \"And they refused to allow me to use their names.\") The resulting article, Profile of a Race Riot , was published by a Black Tulsan news outlet. Local white publications had refused to carry the story, complicit in the effort to maintain a selective and untrue Oklahoma history.\n\nThat same effort, on a national level, is being carried out by those trying to legally ban teaching of the full history of slavery, racism, and ongoing anti-Blackness in this country. In the face of these efforts to sanitize the truth in deference to white supremacy, truth-telling is all the more critical. Viola Fletcher, a 107-year-old survivor of the Tulsa massacre who testified before Congress last week-along with her 100-year-old brother, Hughes \"Uncle Red\" Van Ellis, and 106-year-old Lessie Randle-emphasized the importance of why white supremacy should not be allowed to succeed in scrubbing the timeline clean of its deeds.\n\n\"Ruins of Greenwood District after Race Riots, Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA, American National Red Cross Photograph Collection, June 1921\"\n\n\"I will never forget the violence of the white mob when we left our home,\" Fletcher said . \"I still see Black men being shot, Black bodies lying in the street. I still smell smoke and see fire. I still see Black businesses being burned. I still hear airplanes flying overhead. I hear the screams. I have lived through the massacre every day.\"\n\n\"Our country may forget this history,\" Fletcher added, \"but I cannot.\"\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Dylann Roof's Racist Manifesto Is Chilling\n\nA manifesto written by Dylann Roof sheds light on his twisted logic and bubbling hatred for non-whites-and his resentment towards blacks most of all.\n\nIn the manifesto-which was discovered Saturday morning by Internet sleuths -Roof says he was not raised to be racist, though he made racist jokes growing up. He says it was the Trayvon Martin killing-and his feeling that George Zimmerman was right to shoot the unarmed black teen-that awakened him to \"black on white violence,\" which he subsequently read about on the website of a South Carolina-based hate group called the Council of Conservative Citizens.\n\nThe writer of the manifesto says he found the \"same things\" happening in Europe, which he describes as the white homeland. \"As an American we are taught to accept living in the melting pot, and black and other minorities have just as much right to be here as we do, since we are all immigrants,\" he wrote. \"But Europe is the homeland of White people, and in many ways the situation is even worse there.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHis most virulent hatred was reserved for black people.\n\n\"N**gers are stupid and violent. At the same time they have the capacity to be very slick,\" he wrote. \"Black people view everything through a racial lense [sic].\"\n\nRoof added, \"I wish with a passion that n**gers were treated terribly throughout history by Whites, that every White person had an ancestor who owned slaves, that segregation was an evil an oppressive institution, and so on,\" he wrote, adding that it would make it easier for him to understand what is now happening. \"But it isnt true. None of it is.\"\n\nRoof, who dropped out of high school before finishing the 10th grade, apparently never took a course on American history. He wrote that America's history of slavery was based on myths and lies, using the fact that not all Southern whites owned slaves to downplay the malevolence of the institution. He also claims to have read slave narratives that were overwhelmingly positive towards the slaveowners, without naming the texts or pausing to consider whether they had been coerced.\n\nRoof's manifesto claims segregation \"existed to protect us from them\"-both in terms of violence and supposed cultural purity. \"Integration has done nothing but bring Whites down to level of brute animals,\" he wrote. \"The best example of this is obviously our school system.\"\n\n\"Anyone who thinks that White and black people look as different as we do on the outside, but are somehow magically the same on the inside, is delusional,\" he wrote. \"How could our faces, skin, hair, and body structure all be different, but our brains be exactly the same?\"\n\nThe author wrote dismissively of the Northwest Front, \"a political organization of Aryan men and women who recognize that an independent and sovereign White nation [exists] in the Pacific Northwest.\" That, to him, was akin to \"white people running to the suburbs.\"\n\nThat would be a sign of defeat, especially for someone who believes that \"white culture is world culture.\"\n\nRoof's manifesto also addresses other minority groups, including Latinos and Jews.\n\nRoof's main problem with Jews is that he thinks they are denying their own whiteness-which leads him to wish he could \"destroy the Jewish identity.\"\n\n\"The problem is that Jews look White, and in many cases are White, yet they see themselves as minorities,\" he wrote. \"I dont pretend to understand why jews do what they do. They are [an] enigma.\"\n\nLikewise, he believes there are \"good hispanics and bad hispanics,\" but says their elites are generally white and many \"have respect for White beauty.\"\n\n\"There is good White blood worth saving in Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and even Brasil,\" he wrote before adding: \"But they are still our enemies.\"\n\nThe one group Roof seems to like? East Asians, he says, \"could carry something on\" even if whites were to go extinct. \"They are by nature very racist and could be great allies of the White race. I am not opposed at all to allies with the Northeast Asian races.\"\n\nMany of the photos found on the site with Roof's alleged manifesto show him with Confederate flags, as well as stomping on-or burning-the Stars and Stripes. In the manifesto, he clarifies that modern patriotism \"is an absolute joke,\" and that he doesn't know why veterans are so proud of protecting the country.\n\n\"How about we protect the White race and stop fighting for the jews,\" he wrote.\n\nThe most chilling section comes at the end: An explanation of what led to the horrific Wednesday night attack.\n\n\"To take a saying from my favorite film, 'Even if my life is worth less than a speck of dirt, I want to use it for the good of society,'\" he wrote, quoting a Japanese film about a dystopian society where teens kill \"bad\" people.  \"I have no choice. I am not in the position to, alone, go into the ghetto and fight. I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country,\" he wrote. \"We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.\"\n\nHis signoff: \"Please forgive any typos, I didnt have time to check it.\"\n\nGot a tip?

Following the rape, she refused to be silenced and spoke up with help from the NAACP's chief rape investigator Rosa Parks. When Parks went to interview Taylor, the local sheriff kept driving by the house and eventually burst in, threatening Parks with arrest if she didn't leave town. Parks left and then launched the Alabama Committee for Equal Justice for Mrs. Recy Taylor, triggering a movement to seek justice 11 years before Parks became a civil rights hero for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man, launching the Montgomery bus boycott. We speak with the film's director, Nancy Buirski, and with Yale historian Crystal Feimster, author of \"Southern Horrors: Women and the Politics of Rape and Lynching.\"\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: We turn now to a new film that looks at what happened in 1944 when a 24-year-old black mother and sharecropper was gang-raped in Alabama and refused to be silenced. This is a clip from the trailer of the documentary, The Rape of Recy Taylor .\n\nRECY TAYLOR : I saw the car pull up behind me. Some white boys. I mean, they didn't say nothing about what they were going to do to me. They put me in the car, then went blindfold me. I was begging them to leave me alone, don't shoot me. I've got to go home to see about my baby. They wouldn't let me go. I can't help but tell the truth, what they done to me.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: That was Recy Taylor herself, describing what happened the night six white boys abducted and brutally raped her as she walked home from a church service in Abbeville, Alabama. After the men raped Taylor, they left her on the side of a deserted road, where she was found by her father.\n\nThis is another clip from the film The Rape of Recy Taylor . This starts with her brother, Robert Corbitt, followed by her sister, Alma Daniels. They explain what happened to Recy Taylor the night she was raped.\n\nALMA DANIELS : What they did to her-and, you know, my sister didn't have any more kids after that and never got pregnant after that. And they didn't only just have sex with her. After they got through mutilating her, they played in her body.\n\nROBERT CORBITT : I don't know if she was feeling pain or what. That was-that was after they kept her about four or five hours down in the woods. Seven guys, one night. They said they wanted her to act just like she was going to be with her husband.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The boys had warned Taylor repeatedly that they would kill her if she spoke out. But despite the threats, Recy Taylor identified her rapists, though few women spoke up, in fear for their lives. In fact, the rape of black women by white men was so common in Jim Crow South that the NAACP had a chief rape investigator. That person was none other than Rosa Parks. When Rosa Parks went to interview Recy Taylor-we're talking 11 years before the Montgomery bus boycott-the local sheriff kept driving by the house and eventually burst in, threatening Rosa Parks with arrest if she didn't leave town. Parks left and then launched the Alabama Committee for Equal Justice for Mrs. Recy Taylor, triggering a movement to seek justice-again, 11 years before Rosa Parks became that civil rights hero for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man, launching the Montgomery bus boycott.\n\nFor more, we're joined by Nancy Buirski, the producer and director of The Rape of Recy Taylor , and we're joined by Professor Crystal Feimster. She's an associate professor of African American studies at Yale University, interviewed in the film, and author of the book Southern Horrors: Women and the Politics of Rape and Lynching .\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Nancy Buirski, let's begin with you, why you took on this film. What an amazing moment for it to be shown, in the midst of the #MeToo movement. And, again, amplify this story of Recy Taylor and what ultimately happened to her.\n\nNANCY BUIRSKI : You know, Recy Taylor is amazingly courageous for speaking up. As you mentioned, very few women did that. They were afraid for their lives. Their families would be threatened, and their friends' livelihoods would be threatened. So, what she did was extraordinary. And, you know, we made this film before this #MeToo movement. We had no idea that this would all erupt. But now, as I look back on it, I realize that Recy Taylor's story is the first link in a long chain. It may-not even the first link. It really goes back to slavery. But it is a very pivotal link in a chain that goes right through the civil rights movement, right up through Black Power, and obviously is resolved today.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And Recy Taylor, what happened? What was-what were the investigations? You have Rosa Parks, this amazing-\n\nNANCY BUIRSKI : Right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -story of Rosa Parks going to Abbeville. This is what motivated Rosa Parks, what propelled her.\n\nNANCY BUIRSKI : You know, they had a grand jury investigation soon after the rape. I think that took place in October. The rape took place in September. She did not get any justice. You know, she identified her rapists, but, to no one's surprise, these guys were not indicted. And that's when Rosa Parks steps in and says, \"We have to put more pressure on the governor. We have to get some kind of justice.\" So she comes to Abbeville. She interviews Recy Taylor. She gets kicked out of the-Abbeville by the sheriff. She comes back. She interviews her again. And she takes her up to Montgomery, where she forms this Committee for Equal Justice for Mrs. Recy Taylor. And what this-what this does, basically, is it triggers the black newspapers to write about this story. And black newspapers were the only newspapers that were writing these stories in those days. The white newspapers, they didn't suppress it, they just ignored it. It wasn't important.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, the film highlights the role of the black press, that it played in documenting and publicizing what happened to Recy Taylor. This clip begins with journalist and activist Esther Cooper Jackson, followed by Danielle McGuire. McGuire is the author of At the Dark End of the Street , the book that inspired the film.\n\nESTHER COOPER JACKSON : The only place we really were able to publish articles about Recy and others was through The Chicago Defender , the Pittsburgh Courier , the Amsterdam News , the Baltimore , etc.-through the black press.\n\nDANIELLE McGUIRE: It's part of the kind of infrastructure of injustice, where the white press ignores these kinds of crimes, and then-and then there's no record of them happening, which gives judges and juries plausible deniability of any knowledge, and maybe this is a rumor. You know, it's not even in the newspaper. And that's why it's so important that the black press publishes these stories.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: That was historian Danielle McGuire. We're also joined by Crystal Feimster, associate professor of African American studies at Yale University, author of Southern Horrors: Women and the Politics of Rape and Lynching . Professor Feimster, could you talk about the role of the African-American press, papers like The Chicago Defender , the Pittsburgh Courier , the Baltimore Afro-American , that were really exposing a lot of what was happening in the Jim Crow South, because they were in the North and were able to do that?\n\nCRYSTAL FEIMSTER : Right. The African-American press, of course, played a huge role in exposing white violence, particularly against African-American women and men throughout the Jim Crow South. Most often those stories were-stories about rape were told through the stories about lynching, right? And that's what my work has focused on, that sort of longer history. And we can't think about the press and not think about Frederick Douglass's newspaper or Ida B. Wells's anti-lynching campaign and how black folks have mobilized the press. I mean, we can think about, in this current moment, how folks mobilize social media as an outlet, but, yes, African Americans in the black press were key, not just to Recy's case, but to all the work that black organizations, like the NAACP , were doing in the early 20th century. So, yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about what happened to her, what happened to Recy Taylor, the astonishing fearlessness? After she's raped, and they tell her, \"We will kill you unless you promise not to say a word,\" she immediately spoke out. And talk about the investigations that that led to over the decades. This story haunted Alabama for decades. And then what happened in 2011 in the Alabama state Legislature?\n\nCRYSTAL FEIMSTER : Right. So, much of what we know about Recy Taylor and her case comes from Danielle McGuire's research for The Dark End of the Street and also from what Robert Corbitt tells us, what Recy continues to tell us and continues to testify about even today. And we get to hear her voice in Nancy's beautiful film.\n\nBut we know that Recy comes home. We know that she tells her husband, her father what happens to her. She goes before two grand juries-right?-to testify and identify the young boys who gang-raped her that night. As we know, Esther Cooper comes in and does an investigation. There's a letter-writing campaign, right? There are unions that organize. As we've already mentioned, the black press picks up the story. And it's there that the story moves. It becomes not just a national story, but an international story, right? And the campaign for Recy continues, right?\n\nBut, ultimately, after those two grand juries refused to indict on behalf of Recy's case, as Danielle McGuire's work reveals, is that the movement moves on, in some ways. And that's not to say that they're no longer invested in-investigating rape cases of black women, but the cases keep coming. They keep-there are new cases every day of black women being assaulted by white men. And so they take on new cases, and they try to push those cases forward.\n\nAnd Recy, you know, goes back to her life and her family and continues to live, but has a hard life. We know that her daughter dies in a tragic car accident. We know that her marriage falls apart. But she continues to live, to live her life, and to speak about-speak out about what happened to her. She never shies away from that story or backs down. And I think she says it eloquently in the film, that she had to speak the truth about what happened to her. And just because there wasn't justice in the case, she wasn't silenced. And many women who spoke up after her refused to be silenced. I think there is a long tradition of black women speaking to sexual assault and sexual violence, even when justice isn't an option.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Nancy Buirski, in the film, you also include a letter from Rosa Parks, where she talks about an attempted rape against her by someone in 1931, much earlier.\n\nNANCY BUIRSKI : Correct. She is a nanny in a white home. And, of course, this happened frequently to nannies, where, you know, the caretaker-I mean, she was the caretaker. So she is approached by a person in the neighborhood, and she persuades him not to rape her. This is what's extraordinary. She actually talks him out of it. And that letter reflects her ideology and what she basically says to him.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let's go to that letter.\n\nNANCY BUIRSKI : OK.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Rosa Parks herself. The man, whom she called \"Mr. Charlie,\" had come into the house where she worked while the family was out for the evening. He has a drink, puts his hand on her waist, propositions her. This is the film.\n\nROSA PARKS : [read by Cynthia Erivo] I knew that no matter what happened, I would never yield to this white man's bestiality. I was ready and willing to die. But give any consent, never.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So that's Parks, who goes on to write, \"If he wanted to kill me and rape a dead body, he was welcome but he would have to kill me first.\"\n\nNANCY BUIRSKI : You know, it's extraordinary when you think that even she didn't speak up immediately. This letter is written years after that incident took place. And she used it as an essay, to convey what had happened to her to many more people, and, ideally, empower other people to speak up finally. But that's an example, to me, of how difficult it was to speak up in those days. One of the reasons that we know so little about this entire, what I consider an epic history is that the few women who spoke up, if they did speak up, it was often not reported. We didn't find out about it.\n\nYou know, when lynching took place in the Deep South, that was meant to be visible. It was a tool of terrorism, and it was meant to tell people where their place was-black-African Americans. But women weren't treated the same way. They were raped also as a tool of terrorism, but it was also a rite of passage for a lot of these guys. And, I mean, they had been brought up with a mentality that you have a right to do this, you have a right to take advantage of a black woman's body. And so, not only did the women not speak up, but neither did their husbands, because if their husbands fought back, they'd be lynched.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I want to go to another-\n\nCRYSTAL FEIMSTER : I also think-\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.\n\nCRYSTAL FEIMSTER : No, I was going to say that I also think that, you know, what Rosa Parks' letter reveals and, I think, what the film reveals and the sort of longer history on sexual violence against black women reveals is that while black women may not have had a public platform in which to speak out and to have an audience, that black women resisted sexual assault. And the way that they spoke out often was in their behavior, in the way that they fought back. And we see that resilience and that outspokenness in Rosa Parks' words to Mr. Charlie, right?\n\nAnd I think that that's where historians find a wealth of sources-right?-around how black women protested, because they didn't have traditional outlets-the white press, right?-or an audience that was favorable or interested in sexual assault and violence against black women. They had to find alternative ways to fight back and to speak back. And sometimes that was through the way that they resisted the violence. And sometimes it was taking those cases to the local sheriff, and oftentime with little or no result, right?\n\nSo, I think there may be a way to kind of think about the sort of spectrum in which-in ways that women do speak out, even though it doesn't sort of fit how we think women should be speaking out in kind of this #MeToo moment, because I think we all know that these things happen-right?-and that there is a silence, but there is a way that that silence often speaks volumes. So I think it's important. And I think that both Danielle and Nancy's work kind of reveals the kind of diverse ways in which women speak out in protest.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Nancy, what kind of pushback did you get when you went to the Alabama town where this all occurred to try to interview people about it, who were-people who were still alive?\n\nNANCY BUIRSKI : We tried to interview many more people who end up in the-than who you see in the film. There were white businessmen that we wanted to speak with, and they shut us out, basically. You see in the film a few relatives of the rapists, who speak to us. And frankly, I was surprised they did. I think that, on some level, they're in some kind of denial, because they use euphemisms to talk about what their brothers had done. So I'm not sure they quite-either they don't accept what they did, or they don't how to talk about it.\n\nBut in terms of the African Americans, they were more than happy to speak. And I just want to draw attention to the incredible courage of Robert Corbitt, the brother of Recy Taylor, who has made it his mission to expose this story even today.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what happened in Alabama Legislature in 2011?\n\nNANCY BUIRSKI : They issue an apology. And-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's it?\n\nNANCY BUIRSKI : That's it. And, you know, the Corbitt family, Corbitt and Taylors, they believe that's a little too little, too late, but they will accept it. I mean, there's a tremendous amount of dignity in that family. And they will continue speaking of this. They will continue sending this message that this kind of thing should not happen. One of the things that's really important to know is that no one felt any shame. Recy Taylor felt no shame. There was no reason to. She knew there was a legacy to this kind of behavior.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And she is alive today, Recy Taylor in Alabama.\n\nNANCY BUIRSKI : And she is alive today. She's still here.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to thank Nancy Buirski, director and producer of The Rape of Recy Taylor , and Crystal Feimster, associate professor of African American studies at Yale University, author of Southern Horrors: Women and the Politics of Rape and Lynching .\n\nAnd we'll end again on the headline that came out this week: Tarana Burke, the woman who founded the #MeToo movement, will be ringing in the new year in New York. She'll be there at midnight as a woman who has spoken out.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Mobs of white Americans unwilling to accept multi-racial democracy have successfully overturned or stolen elections before: in Wilmington, North Carolina , in 1898, in Colfax, Louisiana, in 1873 and New Orleans in 1874, and, in Hamburg, South Carolina, in 1876.\n\nO'Bryant, who lives just five miles from the ruins of Hamburg, once a center of Black political power in South Carolina, has become an expert on the 1876 massacre. He has relatives on both sides of the attack: one of his ancestors, Needham O'Bryant, was a Black Hamburg resident who survived the violence, while another, Thomas McKie Meriwether, was a young white man killed while participating in the mob.\n\nO'Bryant has spent years researching how the Hamburg massacre unfolded, and how, despite national media coverage and a congressional investigation, the white killers were never held accountable. Now, he is watching history repeat itself. The attack on the Capitol, he said, was \"almost identical\" to the way white extremists staged a riot in Hamburg during the high-stakes presidential election of 1876.\n\nThe Hamburg attack and other battles successfully ended multi-racial democracy in the south for nearly a century. Black Americans, who had filled the south's state legislatures and served in Congress after the civil war, were forced out of power, then barred from voting almost altogether, as white politicians reinstituted a full system of white political and economic rule. The south became a one-party state for decades.\n\nIt would take Black Americans until the 1960s to win back their citizenship.\n\nNow, as Republicans have shut down any attempt to hold Trump and other politicians accountable for inciting the attack, historians like O'Bryant are warning of the known dangers of letting white mob violence go unchecked, and about the fragility of democracy itself.\n\nThe effects of the white terrorism of the 1870s lasted into O'Bryant's own childhood: he vividly remembers the day his great-grandmother, grandparents and mother voted for the first time. It was in Charleston in 1968, and he was eight years old.\n\nThe reason American history is marked by repeated incidents of white mob violence is because the violence works, O'Bryant, 60, said.\n\n\"When you adopt a political strategy and you're successful at it, you might as well continue.\"\n\nBy the summer of 1876, a presidential election year, some white citizens in South Carolina had reached a crossroads: they realized they would never again hold power in a state with fair elections.\n\nBenjamin Tillman, one of the leaders of South Carolina's white mob attacks, identified the \"arithmetic\" problem for white supremacists: \"In my State there were 135,000 negro voters or negroes of voting age, and some 90,000 or 95,000 white voters,\" he said later. \"With a free vote and a fair count, how are you going to beat 135,000 by 95,000? How are you going to do it?\"\n\nSince they did not have the votes, white supremacists decided to take control of the South Carolina government through terrorism. There were white terror attacks across the southern US that year, all aimed at preventing Black citizens from casting their votes in national and state elections.\n\nThe first major attack in South Carolina came in July, in Hamburg, a growing center of Black political power. In Hamburg, the mayor was Black. The sheriff was Black. Most of the city officials were Black. Several prominent Black lawmakers elected to the state legislature also lived in Hamburg.\n\n\"These same slaveowners that once told you what to do - they might ride through Hamburg, and you might be the sheriff, and you might tell them to pick up their trash off the street,\" O'Bryant said.\n\nThe rise of Black politicians such as Prince Rivers - a man who had liberated himself from slavery, served as a sergeant in the Union army and gone on to be a mayor, state representative and judge in Hamburg - undermined white supremacists' arguments that Black Americans were unready for political power.\n\nOn the Fourth of July in 1876, two white men staged a confrontation with Black soldiers outside of Hamburg. The white men then went to court and tried to get a judge to take away the Black soldiers' guns.\n\nWhen the Black soldiers refused to disarm, they were attacked by a crowd of hundreds of white men, who even wheeled in a cannon to fire at the Black soldiers as they took refuge in a government building. Some Black residents were killed in the initial attack, and others were captured later and then executed in cold blood.\n\nHamburg's Black sheriff was also killed and mutilated, according to some accounts: the white men cut out his tongue. In all, one white man and seven Black men died during the massacre.\n\nAs with the 6 January attack at the Capitol, the rioting in Hamburg in 1876 appeared spontaneous, but had been carefully planned in advance by white extremist groups, O'Bryant said. The South Carolina groups called themselves \"Red Shirts\" or members of local \"rifle clubs\". O'Bryant said he saw them as the equivalents of the Proud Boys or Oath Keepers militia today.\n\nThe violence sparked national outrage, O'Bryant said. There were official investigations of the massacre and in-depth coverage from the New York Times. Ninety-four white men, including a former Confederate general and other veterans and prominent citizens, were indicted for murder for their roles.\n\nWorried that jailing the white defendants might spark another attack, court officials let all of the men out on bail, O'Bryant said, and the decision was made to postpone the trial until after the 1876 election, because of the \"climate of violence\".\n\nAs the November election approached, white violence in South Carolina escalated: two months after the Hamburg massacre, another series of white terror attacks in Ellenton, South Carolina, killed dozens of Black citizens, by some estimates as many as a hundred.\n\nOne of O'Bryant's own ancestors, Needham O'Bryant of Hamburg, later testified before the Senate about the constant attacks and threats, describing a white man firing shots at his house, and having to flee and hide when posses of armed white men rode by.\n\nIn the 1876 election, one marked by murder and outright fraud - the county where Hamburg was located ended up logging 2,000 more votes than it had registered voters, O'Bryant said - white Democrats took control of the South Carolina government.\n\nThe continuing violence also \"wore down northern commitment to enforcing the law in the south,\" the historian Eric Foner said. \"In the beginning, President Grant sent troops into South Carolina in order to crush the Ku Klux Klan. But over time, the willingness to intervene to protect the rights of Black people waned.\"\n\nAfter political negotiations over the contested presidential election of 1876, the federal government ended Reconstruction and withdrew federal troops from the south.\n\nWith white supremacists once again in control of the state government, Rivers, like other Black politicians, was accused of corruption and quickly forced out of public office. He ended up working once again as a carriage driver at a white hotel, the same work he had done when he was enslaved.\n\nO'Bryant has records of one of his ancestors on the South Carolina voter rolls in 1868, and a record of another relative serving as an elections manager in 1876. After that, there is no record of them voting for 92 years. His family members, a long line of educators and academics, worked hard and were deeply involved in their communities. They faced the risk of being fired, he said, if they even tried to participate in an election.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the men indicted in the Hamburg murders, Benjamin Tillman, rose to a position of national power, continuing to brag about having \"shot negroes and stuffed ballot boxes\" on his way to becoming South Carolina's governor, and then serving for nearly a quarter-century as a US senator.\n\nNone of the perpetrators of the Hamburg massacre was ever prosecuted or convicted.\n\n\"We took the government away from them in 1876. We did take it,\" Tillman said in a speech in the Senate in 1900. \"If no other senator has come here previous to this time who would acknowledge it, more is the pity.\"\n\nWhat Tillman and others had won through terrorism they later codified into law, writing a new South Carolina constitution explicitly designed to keep Black citizens from voting.\n\n\"We are not sorry for it,\" Tillman said. \"We of the south have never recognized the right of the negro to govern white men.\"\n\nAnti-democratic beliefs, white nationalism, and the glorification of violence have always been a \"powerful strand\" in American history, Foner, one of the most influential historians of America's post-civil war period, said.\n\nIt is time to push back against the shocked statements of television pundits on 6 January \"saying, 'This is not America,'\" Foner said. \"It is America, actually. Not the whole picture of America, but it is part of the American tradition. And we need to face that fact.\"\n\nIn the footage from the 6 January invasion - a giant Confederate flag being paraded through the halls of Congress, a gallows and noose being set up outside, furious white crowds chanting about hanging politicians - the echoes of post-civil war violence are unavoidable.\n\n\"Whether or not these men and women [who broke into the Capitol] are aware of how their actions replicated what has already happened in history, it's so present - the past is so present,\" Kellie Carter Jackson, an American historian who studies 19th-century political violence, said.\n\nThat does not mean that the violence is at the same level as it was directly after the civil war, Carter Jackson said. In 1895, Robert Smalls, a Black army veteran who became a South Carolina congressman, estimated that 53,000 Black Americans had been killed by white terrorists since the end of the civil war.\n\n\"That's 1,766 murders annually, or five per day,\" Carter Jackson said. \"I don't think we are at those levels of such open racial violence and hostility.\"\n\nIn the the wake of the Capitol invasion, the problem facing the United States is often framed as one of \"disinformation\": how were so many Americans convinced to attack the government based on claims that simply were not true?\n\nMuch of the media and political reaction has taken the invaders' claims at face value: they believed the lies of Trump and Republican politicians that the election had been stolen. They sincerely thought Democrats were undermining democracy. Some had been radicalized by the lurid claims of the QAnon conspiracy theory about a cabal of powerful pedophiles torturing children.\n\nBut some experts argue the insurrection should be labeled a white supremacist attack, even if many of the attackers themselves did not talk explicitly about race. Trump's evolving web of claims about election fraud, which were rejected by judges in lawsuit after lawsuit his supporters brought, revolved around the idea that the vote counts for Joe Biden in cities like Detroit, Philadelphia, and Atlanta, which all have large Black populations, were somehow fraudulent.\n\nThe former president's repeated claims that he got the majority of \"legitimate\" votes suggested that the African Americans who cast decisive votes for Biden were inherently illegitimate.\n\nTrump's big lie about the stolen election was built from the same lies propagated by the white supremacists in the south: that majority-Black cities were corrupt, that Black politicians could not be trusted.\n\nSouth Carolina's white supremacists not only put up giant statues of the murderers who had stolen the state government, they also wrote history books for school children that described the state's brief era of Black political participation as \"the darkest days in the state's history\", an era of rampant corruption and mismanagement, O'Bryant said. Those were the books he grew up studying.\n\nAfter the victories of the civil rights movement, many Americans were taught a more triumphant version of their own history, with the arc of American democracy redrawn as a slow but inevitable march towards racial equality.\n\nO'Bryant is proud of the legacy of the civil rights movement: he met Martin Luther King as a small child, attended marches in diapers, sat in the background at movement meetings in his home and at church. But he has also spent years spreading public awareness about the flourishing multiracial democracy that was ended through violence in the 1870s.\n\n\"If they had prosecuted and punished the perpetrators of the Hamburg massacre, they would have set a precedent that we won't stand for these types of crimes,\" O'Bryant said. \"There would have been no need for me to have marched if they had done the right thing in Hamburg.\"\n\nToday, the site of the Hamburg massacre is part ruin, part golf course. There is no marker there to the seven Black men who were murdered in 1876, just neatly maintained turf, fences and a few disintegrating buildings in the woods.\n\nAmerica's civil war battlefields are the sites of intense, even obsessive, memorialization: hundreds of thousands of people visit the site of the battle of Gettysburg every year, and the government and private donors annually spend millions of dollars to maintain the town's thriving complex of statues and museums. Gettysburg is remembered as the bloody turning point, the moment where the north, at great cost, began to win the war.\n\nBut the battlefields where America's multi-racial democracy was lost just a decade later have not been preserved in the same way. Most of the memorials that exist were erected by white supremacists to mark their victory.\n\nThere is massive statue of Ben Tillman at the South Carolina statehouse, and an obelisk dedicated to Meriwether, the one white man killed during the Hamburg massacre, at the heart of North Augusta, the town closest to Hamburg.\n\nHamburg itself had been built next to the Savannah River, in an area prone to flooding, and while the army corps of engineers built a levee to protect Augusta, the white town on the other side of the river, the government left the Black town unprotected, O'Bryant said. After a particularly devastating flood in 1929, the town was abandoned. Today, all that is left on the site are a few ruins deep in the woods.\n\nBut Hamburg has survived in other ways. Forced out by flooding, the town's Black residents moved to higher ground and built a new town, Carrsville.\n\n\"They didn't have the money to buy lumber,\" O'Bryant says, citing interviews with elderly residents who could recall the move. \"They took their houses apart, brought the wood uphill, and reconstructed them.\"\n\nIn 2016, after advocacy by O'Bryant and other local residents, North Augusta finally dedicated a historical marker and memorial to all eight people killed at Hamburg, including the seven Black victims. The place they chose for it was not the empty ground in Hamburg, but in Carrsville.\n\nO'Bryant does not see it as an accident that Black primary voters in South Carolina, led by Jim Clyburn , a veteran of the civil rights movement, picked Joe Biden as the safest choice for the Democratic presidential nominee, or that Black voters in Georgia and other swing states turned out to help secure Biden's victory.\n\nBlack voters fully understood the dangers of a second Trump term, O'Bryant said.\n\n\"It felt to us like it was life or death, not just for African Americans. It felt like it was life or death for the country.\""

      "text": "How racist propaganda inspired riots in America's biggest cities - 360 video\n\nAnti-Black racism in school curriculums, newspapers and film set the scene for a week of racial violence in Chicago and Washington DC\n\nHundreds of miles apart, two of the worst instances of racially motivated attacks in American history occurred within days of each other during the 1919 Red Summer.\n\nTwenty-two-year-old Elsie Stephnick, the spouse of a white, US navy aviator was allegedly assaulted by two Black men near 15th Street NW and New York Avenue on 19 July in Washington DC. At the time, the four major white-owned newspapers, including the Washington Post, were publishing increasingly sensationalistic articles framed to instigate white violence against Washington's Black community. White veterans and civilians began randomly beating and detaining Black residents in the street and on public transportation. Carter G Woodson, founder of \"Black History Month\" and Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Howard University, witnessed a mob grab a Black pedestrian and shoot him to death. \"They had caught a Negro and deliberately held him as one would a beef for slaughter, and when they had conveniently adjusted him for lynching, they shot him,\" Woodson recounted.\n\nRefusing to declare martial law to stop the riot, President Woodrow Wilson eventually relented and activated troops stationed nearby. In the interim, Black people took control of their safety, buying $14,000 worth of weapons to repel white invaders. Guns and ammunition were bought in DC stores, pulled from closets where they had been stored after the first world war, and covertly transported from Maryland. Sharpshooters positioned themselves on rooftops watching for white drivers entering Black neighborhoods, and civilians remained on alert behind partially drawn curtains. By the time troops, and heavy summer rain, stopped the fighting on 24 July, an estimated 15 people were killed - 10 of them white - and 50 people were critically wounded.\n\nThree days later on 27 July, the death of 17-year-old Eugene Williams in Chicago at the hands of George Stauber, a white European immigrant, led to what many historians considered the worst racial unrest of the Red Summer. Floating in Lake Michigan on a 14ft x 9ft raft built with a group of friends, Williams inadvertently drifted into a swimming area near 29th Street unofficially considered to be \"whites only\". Stauber spotted Williams in the white swimming area and threw stones in his direction, striking the teen and causing him to drown. The responding police officer, Daniel Callahan, refused to arrest him, despite the protestations of Black beachgoers and onlookers. When a Black officer attempted to do so other white officers prevented him and instead detained the Black witnesses, lighting the spark for mass violence .\n\nDays before the unrest, the lauded poet and journalist Carl Sandburg traveled throughout the city for the Chicago Daily News, noting \"where Black people saw opportunity, white Chicagoans saw a threat. Here and there, slowly and by degrees, the line of color discrimination breaks.\" The so-called \"Black Belt\", a cluster of Black communities on Chicago's south side, emerged on the border of European neighborhoods. Irish immigrants were resentful of Black workers as they had arrived earlier in the city, firmly establishing themselves politically and economically. As white-Black clashes spurred by Eugene Williams's death spread beyond the beach areas into residential neighborhoods, \"athletic clubs\", which were fundamentally ethnic Irish gangs, were the primary source of violence over the week-long unrest. Future mayor Richard Daley, a president of the Hamburg Athletic Club, allegedly participated .\n\nThe first three days of the Chicago riot are considered to have been the most devastating. Black passengers were pulled off streetcars, sidewalks and corners and beaten with pipes and bricks while mobile white assailants, including uniformed soldiers, attacked Black passersby and shoppers in the \"Loop\" district downtown, killing and severely injuring victims. There was Black resistance as there had been the week before in Washington DC but it was drastically overwhelmed. The violence ended on 3 August when the Illinois governor, Frank Lowden, deployed 6,000 national guard soldiers to the Black Belt to protect Black Chicagoans from white attackers. The human cost was severe: 38 people died, including 23 Blacks and 15 whites, approximately 537 people were injured and between 1,000 and 2,000 families lost their homes, primarily Blacks.\n\nFollowing the unrest, Governor Lowden convened the \"Chicago Commission on Race Relations\" to study the roots of the violence and propose solutions. The commission published its findings three years later in \"The Negro in Chicago: A Study of Race Relations and a Race Riot\", from the University of Chicago Press. Despite clearly documenting Chicago's pervasive bias and discrimination against Black residents across housing, criminal justice and education, its suggestions were largely dismissed. And despite the participation of many hundreds of Chicagoans in the 1919 riot, only 47 were eventually indicted.\n\nRed Summers is a 360 video project by the artist and film-maker Bayeté Ross Smith on the untold American history of racial terrorism from 1917 to 1921. The project is funded by Black Public Media, Eyebeam, Sundance Institute, Crux XR and the Open Society Foundations."

      "text": "The Wilmington massacre of 1898: a shocking episode of racist violence\n\nNorth Carolina city marks 125th anniversary of the white-supremacist attack with a week of memorial events\n\nThe Equal Justice Initiative is a non-profit organization committed to ending mass incarceration and excessive punishment in the United States, to challenging racial and economic injustice, and to protecting basic human rights for the most vulnerable people in American society. Guardian US has partnered with EJI to reprint this special feature , originally titled The Wilmington Massacre of 1898 .\n\nIn the late 1890s, Wilmington, North Carolina , a port city between the Atlantic's barrier islands and the banks of the Cape Fear River, became an island of hope for a new America.\n\nResidents of the city's thriving Black community made themselves a political force, exercising the rights of citizenship guaranteed to them after the civil war by the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments. Across the south, such activity had triggered deadly white violence against Black voters, organizers and officeholders in the decades since the war. But in Wilmington, a city of 20,000, the votes of 8,000 Black men helped a rare biracial \"Fusion\" alliance elect candidates of both races.\n\nThree of the 10 aldermen were Black. The city had Black health inspectors, postmasters, magistrates and policemen, albeit under orders not to arrest anyone white. The county coroner, jailer and treasurer were Black, as was the register of deeds. Black businesspeople pooled their money in three Black-owned banks. Families a generation removed from enslavement owned their homes and read a local Black newspaper.\n\nAs modern-day Wilmingtonian Tim Pinnick, a genealogist, put it: \"Things functioned the way they were meant to function as a result of Emancipation.\"\n\nBut if Wilmington looked to some Americans like a model for the south, powerful white leaders, including the president of Wilmington Cotton Mills Company, the editor of the Raleigh News & Observer and the chairman of the state Democratic party, could not abide it. They set out to topple what the newspaper editor labeled \"Negro rule\".\n\nOne hundred and twenty-five years ago, on 10 November 1898, a shocking coup d'état was executed.\n\nThe plotters had set the stage by creating what they called the \"white supremacy campaign\". They printed falsehoods about Black men preying on white women and stockpiling guns. They targeted the Fusion officeholders and the Black newspaper, summoned militias and white vigilantes known as Red Shirts, and terrorized Black voters at the polls.\n\n\"If you see the negro out voting tomorrow, tell him stop,\" one of the leaders, former Confederate colonel Alfred Moore Waddell, told a gun-waving white audience on the eve of Wilmington's 1898 election. \"If he doesn't, shoot him down. Shoot him down in his tracks.\" Waddell vowed to \"choke the current of the Cape Fear River\" with Black bodies if he had to.\n\nOn 10 November, Red Shirts, militiamen and white mobs surged through Wilmington's streets and massacred 60 or more Black men. \"They gave their lives to vote,\" said Hesketh \"Nate\" Brown, a retired New York City transit manager whose great-great-grandfather, Joshua Halsey, tried to flee the militiamen.\n\nThe Red Shirts torched the Black newspaper's office, posed for pictures in front of its smoking ruins, installed Waddell as mayor, and sent hundreds of Black residents fleeing into the woods. Some ran west toward the river; others, east to the Black cemetery. Athalia Howe was 12 when her family and others took refuge in Pine Forest, a cemetery that dated back to the period before Emancipation. It was said that families sheltered next to graves of their loved ones.\n\nFor years no one in Howe's family said much about those events, as her great-granddaughter, Cynthia Brown, told the Washington Post. But one day, when she was about eight years old, a distant look filled her great-grandmother's eyes and she grabbed Brown's wrist.\n\n\"If it ever happens again, run!\" Brown remembered her shouting. \"Don't let it happen to you!\"\n\nBrown set out to discover what \"it\" was.\n\nSo did Pinnick, the genealogist and Black schoolteacher from Illinois who learned of the coup in recent years when he retired to Wilmington. And Nate Brown, the retired transit manager who found his great-great-grandfather's name in an 1898 newspaper clipping about the \"race war\". (The article blamed Black \"aggressors\".) And Sonya Patrick-AmenRa, who counts among her ancestors four soldiers of the United States Colored Troops who helped win the civil war.\n\nNow, Brown, Brown (they are not related), Pinnick, AmenRa and other Wilmingtonians, along with ministers, activists, authors, educators and a documentary film-maker whose ancestor aided the plotters, are helping change the historical narrative.\n\nOver the last two decades, a school and park named after leaders who directed the murder of dozens of Black people have been renamed. Community activists have set out to learn the names of everyone who was killed and every Black Wilmingtonian who survived the 1898 massacre. They are marking the coup's 125th anniversary, 10 November, with a week of events that include \"racial-equity and trauma training\", documentary film showings and descendants' stories.\n\n\"There is a need to focus on that horrible day to understand it,\" Pinnick said. \"And yet, it's a testimony to surviving that the story should be told.\"\n\nFor nearly a century the story was told falsely - in textbooks, clippings and memoirs that cast the horrific violence as a spontaneous \"riot\" and the plotters as heroes who restored racial order to Wilmington.\n\nIn 2006, a state-commissioned report debunked the longstanding false narratives about Wilmington's history.\n\nEven so, Deborah Dicks Maxwell, president of the county's NAACP chapter, said many local residents still don't know about it. \"This is Wilmington,\" she told USA Today last year. \"There's a distance to progress.\"\n\nThat was evident in the unguarded words of three white Wilmington police officers in 2020, weeks after George Floyd's killing. A routine audit of patrol-car videotapes revealed the longtime officers discussing killing \"f-ing n-s\".\n\nA civil war was coming, Officer Michael Piner said: \"We are just gonna go out and start slaughtering them f-ing n-s.\" The officers told investigators they had been \"venting\" and blamed the \"stress of today's climate in law enforcement\".\n\nWilmington's first Black police chief fired them in his first week on the job.\n\nTheir words were \"painful, hurtful\", Chief Donny Williams, a Wilmington officer for nearly three decades, told NPR . \"Being from this community, and then working alongside these people for so long, so just hurt - and not just me.\"\n\nThe full toll of the 1898 massacre and the political legacy it created is still not known.\n\nEstimates of the number of Black people killed range from dozens to hundreds. The state's 2006 study described the coup in detail and blamed all levels of government for not intervening; it said Black merchants and workers \"suffered losses after 1898 in terms of job status, income, and access to capital\". Black businesses moved or closed. Some 2,100 Black residents fled. Black literacy rates plunged.\n\nBy the turn of the century, southern states were using poll taxes, literacy tests and grandfather clauses to deny Black men the right to vote, which the 15th amendment had guaranteed them since 1870. Between 1896 and 1902, the number of Black voters registered in North Carolina fell from 126,000 to 6,100. Wilmington did not elect another Black candidate until 1972.\n\nThe violence in Wilmington was not unique. Historians and EJI researchers have documented at least 34 instances of mass violence during Reconstruction where scores of Black people were murdered by white mobs intent on re-establishing white supremacy and resisting Black political participation. It is a history that is not well-known but critically relevant for understanding the continuing struggle for racial justice and the many obstacles that still remain."

      "text": "The war that never ended: the fight to remove America's racist statues\n\nIn new documentary The Neutral Ground, the attempts to remove Confederate statues is explored along with a troubled history of culpability\n\n\"I was just happy somebody else had to go put their ass on the line instead of me,\" deadpans Roy Wood Jr, a correspondent on Comedy Central's The Daily Show . \"I do it enough for Trevor Noah.\"\n\nThe somebody else was CJ Hunt , a Daily Show field producer and person of colour who puts his \"ass on the line\" by taking part in a white people's re-enactment of the American civil war. It makes for a jaw dropping scene in Hunt's nimble new film, The Neutral Ground , about the struggle to remove monuments to the slave-owning Confederacy and understand why the war never really ended.\n\nHunt brings a caustically comic eye that sees things other documentary makers do not. Every time someone utters a myth of the Lost Cause - \"the majority of the slaves were not abused even though they didn't have the freedom to go to San Francisco if they wanted to, or whatever\" - he adds a playful ding to the soundtrack.\n\nCities with the biggest African American populations, Hunt notes, also have the highest concentration of Confederate monuments, which are constant reminders of generational slavery, murder, rape and torture.\n\n\"Right now, so much of how white Americans define racism is that it's about hate in your heart, and you have to hate Black people to be a racist, when that's not the case,\" he says by phone. \"To be a racist, you only have to consistently disbelieve Black people when they tell you what has happened to them.\"\n\nWood , who is executive producer of the film, chimes in: \"That's what this doc really nails down. It shows just how much people are willing to hold on to their own lies because it comforts them, instead of acknowledging other people's pain and their need to heal. It's the ultimate in selfishness.\"\n\nThe film starts before the Donald Trump presidency, the deadly neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville and the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. It is 2015 and an effort is under way in New Orleans to remove four Confederate monuments, including a statue of Gen Robert E Lee on the city's highest pedestal.\n\nDebates at city council meetings, including fierce objections from white residents, gained national attention after a white supremacist gunned down nine worshippers at a historic African American church in South Carolina.\n\nBut Hunt, the son of an African American man and Filipino woman, points out: \"It's important to remember that Black people have always thought that these monuments were weird - that's a polite word - and have always pushed back against them.\"\n\nA monument in New Orleans literally inscribed with the words \"white supremacy\", for example, which was a rallying point for the Ku Klux Klan, drew protests from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) back in the 1970s.\n\n\"But one of the things I was able to realise in the film, and I think a tragedy, is that when it feels like the statue issue is flaring up or is on folks' radar, it is almost always in the aftermath of a heinous, undeniable national act of white supremacist violence. It's like this one window of consensus where white violence gets so bad that the rest of the country can hear us for a second and is like, 'Wait, that's what you've been saying?'\"\n\nNew Orleans, a majority Black city led by a white mayor, Mitch Landrieu , voted to remove the monuments in December 2015, but it took more than two years to actually topple them. Absurdly, Landrieu recalls in the film, he could not find a local contractor able or willing to do the job.\n\nHunt reflects: \"It almost feels like a fable. They had to go to a city Blacker than New Orleans in order to find a crew to take them down. That crew was from Atlanta and they had to have military contractors and snipers on the roof. It's like that is what is required to take down white supremacy from the public square in America, or was then.\"\n\nThe civil war of 1861-1865 is often portrayed as a heroic victory for the north, led by Abraham Lincoln. But a fascinating aspect of the documentary is how the north became complicit in the south's redemption, casting statues, publishing books and generating films that portrayed Dixie as noble, genteel and romantic . As one interviewee puts it, the reconciliation of north and south was actually a reconciliation of white people.\n\nHunt's narrative voiceover says: \"With the help of the nation's brightest stars, the Lost Cause finally became immortal, not as a fringe piece of propaganda but as the story that reunited a nation. A lie born in the south, bronzed in the north.\"\n\nHe elaborates by phone: \"We tell ourselves a story that, oh my God, the south just got away with building thousands of monuments somehow; they must have done it sneakily. No. The Lee monument [in Richmond, Virginia], the first giant public monument to the Confederacy in public space, was bronzed in New York. That comes from the north. There's ads in Confederate magazines: 'Do you want a Confederate statue? Call us. We're in Boston and we'll make one for you.'\n\n\"These events are part of how the nation tells itself we're back, baby, we're back together. These are white northerners and southerners together at these events, putting these things up together, and that spillover is really important for us in the film to be like: Yo! New York is instrumental in this. What do you think our banks were financing? Who do you think was buying all this cotton?\"\n\nWood, an African American man who grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, adds: \"Having the south as a villain has given the north a way to absolve themselves of their own complicity in the whole experience of slavery. Because the Confederacy is seen as the bad guy, at no point do we ever take stock of the north's role in feeding the Confederacy, so many of these slaves that ended up needing to be free. So in a way it's like throwing a stone and hiding your hand.\"\n\nThe Daily Show provides biting commentary by having Wood host focus groups where participants share mind-blowing opinions and by sending the comedian Jordan Klepper to interview Trump fans at campaign rallies. Now it was Hunt's turn to do shoe-leather satiric reporting in bizarre and potentially dangerous situations, including the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville during Trump's presidency, ostensibly in defense of yet another Lee statue.\n\nHe recalls: \"The terror of Charlottesville was not hey, are they going to kill us? The terror of Charlottesville is seeing this white army and knowing that they are on the ascendancy, feeling emboldened and protected by a president who will excuse them - that none of them will face consequences.\"\n\nHunt also ventured into the lions' den by camping for two nights with civil war re-enactors in Kentwood, Louisiana, and dressing in period military uniform. When he engages them in conversation, their surface civility is all the more chilling when it comes wrapped in an insistence that slavery was not such a big deal.\n\n\"I'm dying inside because I'm having to swallow it down,\" Hunt says. \"Some of us take a week to rebound from a microaggression that happens in the office - 'Love the durag.' or whatever - but the feeling of having to purposely place yourself in that situation and spend time with folks who are saying to your face actually slavery wasn't that bad and a lot of the slaves enjoyed it? As a documentarian, you have to not pass judgment.\n\n\"You have to nod and smile and be like, 'Great, now, explain this to me.' There's a process of swallowing it down that I think any person of colour is used to as a condition of being in white spaces where you are one of the only ones. But I've also got to admit it felt pretty cathartic to be on a battlefield battling the army that would have had us enslaved. There was the strange Westworld aspect to it.\"\n\nThe battle for history goes on. After Floyd's death last year sparked racial justice protests across the US, dozens of statues of figures who fought for the Confederacy were removed or are set to be taken down . Last month the House of Representatives voted to remove all Confederate statues from public display in the US Capitol in Washington.\n\nWhen Hunt was a schoolboy, his father gave him printouts of stories about police brutality and a book of photos of lynchings. In the film, his father tells him: \"It is not possible to be a Black person in America and not be angry.\" Hunt replies that he keeps coming back to the conviction that it must be possible to change bigots' minds. His father laughs and asks: \"Why do you think that? Why do you hold that hope out? That illusion?\"\n\nWood is realistic on that point. \"When we talk about change and evolution with regard to the ideologies of politics, I personally believe that we are not going to change the existing trees but we can change how the smaller trees will grow,\" he says. \"I don't know if you've ever seen an old, decrepit tree that's just slouched over. It's been growing the wrong way for decades and you see the younger trees that they just planted and they put a couple of guard rods and those sticks and those stupid rubber bands and shit.\n\n\"Projects like this are that rubber band to help guide younger people and newer people in a different way of considering the world in which they've lived. Somebody who's putting on a wool suit and going out and pretending to still be in the civil war? I don't know how much you're able to reach them in the long run.\"\n\nBut Wood adds: \"We can gain understanding from them. That's the one thing that really is dope about this project: there were a lot of very measured conversations. There wasn't a lot of yelling or screaming and back and forth. It was just literally, this is how I feel, this is why I feel. And I think that's more than enough to help move things forward.\"\n\nHunt, a former school teacher, agrees: \"Part of why we let these people talk so long is because for me, it's important to map out the main routes of escape that white southerners use around this. Let's show people the routes of escape that people use to not face the truth.\n\n\"I also wanted to shift people's understanding of what racism is. These people were all very nice to me. They did not hate me. They did not call me the N-word. But their entire worldview is based on this idea that enslaved people liked slavery and that white supremacy did not even exist in the past and that the echoes of slavery that continue to kill Black people are not existing.\n\n\"I want to push the conversation forward. This is not about hate in the heart. White supremacy is about a story we tell about the past, so I want folks to think about that and, to Roy's point, we're not wasting time on old trees, we're not wasting time on bigots. It's about the young trees. How do we get this type of education in schools?\"\n\nThe Neutral Ground is available to watch in the US on POV with a UK date to be announced"

      "text": "Since their foundings, HBCUs have been a white supremacist target\n\nThe Jacksonville shooting is a reminder of the long history of terrorism against Black people, their colleges and their communities\n\nJ ust nine years after Augusta Institute's founding in Georgia, a bloody massacre took place directly across the Savannah River in Hamburg, South Carolina. Since 1867, the leaders of the institute - a small, all-Black seminary - had endured various attacks by local white citizens for educating Black students following the civil war. But the Hamburg massacre, which resulted in the execution of six Black men ahead of one of the most contentious presidential elections in US history, epitomized the extent of post-emancipation violence against Black advancement. Designed to terrorize newly freed citizens, the massacre set the standard for how Black communities could be punished for amassing political and institutional power.\n\nAfter learning firsthand that Black political mobility and Black education stoked white resentment and violence, the seminary men fled to Atlanta. They strategically broke new ground for their institution on former Union army barracks; its location on a hill at the city's highest elevation point gave them a vantage of any attempts upon it. Two decades later, the school was renamed Morehouse College, at the time one of the nation's only colleges for Black men. A few years after that, Spelman College, a college for Black women, relocated less than a mile away from Morehouse, to achieve safety in numbers.\n\nSince their foundings, historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) have prioritized sanctuary for Black people both within and outside their gates. Much of the geography, design and mission of these schools was shaped by the Reconstruction era's reign of terror. I was reminded of this legacy on 26 August, when a gunman in Jacksonville, Florida , armed himself with an AR-15, tactical gear and a mask in the parking lot of Edward Waters University - the city's sole HBCU - before heading to a nearby Dollar General and killing three Black people. Although the 21-year-old shooter didn't attack the university, his presence at the school gestured toward the long history of terrorism against Black people and their institutions.\n\nIn response to the shooting, Florida governor Ron DeSantis pledged $100,000 to the victims' families, and an additional $1m to augment security at Edward Waters. Previously, DeSantis has lauded his state funding for HBCUs , of which Edward Waters received $6.4m for the 2020-2021 school year. \"HBCUs play an important role in Florida's educational fabric and continue to be trailblazers for innovation, talent and leadership,\" the governor said in a 2020 address.\n\nTo many Black Floridians, however, those gestures have little meaning when DeSantis's administration fostered the political climate, policies and ideologies that rendered the state's oldest HBCU and a nearby business vulnerable to a white supremacist shooter. Immediately after the governor's razor-thin 2019 defeat of his Black Democratic opponent Andrew Gillum (who remarked that racists believed DeSantis was one of them ), DeSantis gutted laws that expanded Black voter protections and instituted an election police force that later arrested Black voters at gunpoint on voter fraud charges. This year, the governor launched a widely criticized assault on the teaching of slavery, segregation and accurate US history in K-12 curricula. With the stroke of a pen, he slashed budgets for programs advocating for gun violence prevention and Black history education - programs that could keep Edward Waters both physically safe and institutionally significant.\n\nLike the Hamburg massacre and the fury that incited it, physical white violence against Black people is almost always preceded by the political white violence against them. Although Florida was once an early 20th-century incubator for enclaves of Black prosperity, much of the state's Black economic progress was squashed by Jim Crow legislation and a century of massacres and lynchings. Live Oak, Florida, where Edward Waters was founded in 1866, is notorious for the 1944 lynching of Willie James Howard , a 15-year-old Black staffer at an integrated dime store, who was kidnapped by three white men because he sent a love note to one of their daughters. One of the country's most heinous attacks on Black teachers occurred in Brevard county, Florida, when Harriette and Harry Moore , husband-and-wife civil rights activists who organized within the NAACP for Black teacher pay equity, were assassinated in the 1951 Christmas Day bombing of their home. Only 150 miles from Jacksonville, the Ocoee massacre, a retaliation against Black organized efforts to vote, resulted in the ethnic cleansing of the town's Black population, lasting for more than 50 years.\n\nWhile it is uncertain whether Edward Waters was ever targeted directly by physical white violence, it has long been plagued by policies of economic racism. During the Jim Crow era - long before anything called an \"anti-woke\" bill was ever imagined - Florida's legislature limited funding for its four HBCUs to create and sustain a two-tiered, segregated higher ed system. Edward Waters, like other public and independent Black colleges across the south, was manipulated by politicians who ostensibly supported HBCUs, but only because of their refusal to desegregate white campuses. Those policies ensured that HBCUs got the short end of the stick while redirecting state resources towards the massive growth and expansion of white colleges. In June of this year, a federal judge ruled that six Florida A&M University students could move forward with a lawsuit alleging that the state's systemic undercutting of the HBCU's funding stems from de jure segregationist state policies that have been in place since before the civil rights movement.\n\nWhite terrorism was never an effort by individual white people to ambush individual African Americans. Rather, it's an instrument to keep Black institutions, communities and people under the heel of subjugation - just as happened in Hamburg, where the vestiges of a once-Black town have been replaced today by perfectly manicured private golf courses. Black colleges represent a threat that white supremacists seek to thwart: political, economic and social competition from people who emerged from 250 years of slavery as politicians, intellectuals, freedom fighters and self-sufficient community members. Edward Waters narrowly escaped what could have been its greatest tragedy, but without an end to the anti-Black policies that rendered it vulnerable in the first place, it remains in a vicious fight for its political survival.\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nThis article was amended on 4 September 2023 because an earlier version omitted to note that HBCUs stands for historically Black colleges and universities."

      "text": "I've been on Parler. It's a cesspit of thinly veiled racism and hate\n\nThe 'free speech' app used by US Capitol rioters is an unsettling place where the far right encounters mainstream conservatives\n\n\"Civil war is coming.\"\n\nI saw this message on the social media platform Parler in November, about two weeks after the election was called for Joe Biden. The ominous post followed an even more harrowing message from a different user. \"[O]ur people have guns too ... it's time for us to use it!!! Just like in old days.\" The poster embedded a photograph of a noose.\n\nParler, which has since been banned by Apple's app store and from Amazon, has billed itself as a \"free speech\" platform for the \"world's town square\". Last fall, without much digging, I learned that this town square is one where an increasingly violent far right digitally dances with mainstream, influential conservatives.\n\nThe fact that Parler has a vague air of legitimacy - unlike other platforms known for their explicitly far-right user bases - normalizes racist violence against Black people and anyone associated with them. Like the white police officers and \"respectable\" public servants who joined the Ku Klux Klan after the US civil war, or the white families who partied under the lynched bodies of Black men, white America has continued its intergenerational love affair with public anti-blackness. The methods have simply mutated. Memes calling for our deaths are the lynching postcards of the 21st century. Shared among the masses, they make casual affairs of Black terror. It's not enough for the sharers of these memes to simply believe in white violence on a personal level; the collective experience is the point.\n\nI joined Parler in November, before various tech companies announced plans to take it offline. It didn't take long to find a bevy of hashtags and posts romanticizing civil war. By late November, there were over 10,000 posts that included the hashtag #civilwar and its variants. The person who posted \"Civil war is coming\" was replying to a post by Wayne Root, a conservative media personality with more than 100,000 followers on Twitter. Root leveled the same unproven accusations of voter fraud as Donald Trump, using the same calls for battle that white power groups heeded in their storming of the US Capitol the first week of 2021.\n\nWhile some on the far right will probably retreat into the shadows cast by polling booths and hidden by exit polling data that obscures Trump's popularity, many have not. Any perception of progress for Black people, even if this progress does not substantively exist, perpetuates violence against us and our perceived allies like leftists, Marxists and Democrats - all named by Parler posters as opposing parties in this hypothetical civil war).\n\nTo say that Parler's users, or any Americans who revel in white power tropes and violent memes, are \"extremist\" is a bit of a misnomer. What we call extremism is, if anything, a common American tradition. Millions of Americans, if they don't proactively endorse the violence, silently concede to it. They vote for it. They dress it in words like \"tradition\" and \"free speech\".\n\nI was raised witnessing it. There is a monument honoring Confederate soldiers in my home town of Stone Mountain, Georgia. The monument isn't an ordinary statue erected in some mundane public square. It's a nearly half-acre relief carved into the massive quartz and granite stone for which our town is named. It would take a runner five miles to circle around the rock formation's base. We took field trips to Stone Mountain in high school, as if it were an amusement park and not the largest Confederate memorial in the world.\n\nStone Mountain has now become a flashpoint for conflict. I hiked the mountain on a recent holiday trip with my mom, days before white men wielding guns protested against the widespread movement to remove Confederate statues. We tried to hike another day, but were blocked from entering. It was closed for the day after Black counter-protesters came back with guns of their own.\n\nWhen you talk to white southerners about honoring the Confederacy, you'll hear a lot about heritage. I've heard it all my life. I heard it when our state flag featured the Confederate symbol throughout my childhood and in the debates to remove it. I read about it when I decided to make it one of my debate topics for a summer college class in my last year of high school. But what you'll seldom hear is when this heritage has been selectively commemorated. Stone Mountain's Confederate monument opened on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's assassination.\n\nThis, too, is the culture of Parler.\n\n\"Time to get rid of the yoke calling itself democrats,\" someone wrote in response to Wayne Root's revolution post.\n\n\"Every town needs to decide on a gather place where an armed citizenry takes over everything ... every traitor must be executed,\" wrote another.\n\nIt's not enough to dismiss the radical right as merely having a difference of opinion, or explain it away as a population of marginalized, working-class white men who can be brought back from the brink by reason and calls for a universal basic income.\n\nUniversal prescriptions are necessary, but insufficient. This is an American tradition of terror - a culture of dehumanizing Blackness that bleeds out into the world. It is the shots I heard while reporting in Kenosha, blocks from where Kyle Rittenhouse killed two white Black Lives Matter protesters, as it happened. It was the ease of white vigilantes carrying weapons in another public square, Civic Center Park in downtown Kenosha, hours earlier. It is the audacity of those white vigilantes shouting down Philando Castile's girlfriend, from whom I was mere feet away in the park, as they argued for their right to kill to protect property. Of course, Philando was killed while exercising their revered second amendment right to bear arms, but that right is clearly reserved for some Americans more than others.\n\nParler may be homeless now, but there is an entire world that welcomes the hatred and violence it cultivates. As threatening as it may be, the platform will probably be replaced with something else. It's the public terror that's the point.\n\nMalaika Jabali is a public policy attorney, activist and Guardian US columnist"

      "text": "The case for quarantining extremist ideas\n\nWhen confronted with white supremacists, newspaper editors should consider 'strategic silence'\n\nG eorge Lincoln Rockwell, the head of the American Nazi party, had a simple media strategy in the 1960s. He wrote in his autobiography: \"Only by forcing the Jews to spread our message with their facilities could we have any hope of success in counteracting their left-wing, racemixing propaganda!\"\n\nCampus by campus, from Harvard to Brown to Columbia, he would use the violence of his ideas and brawn of his followers to become headline news. To compel media coverage, Rockwell needed: \"(1) A smashing, dramatic approach which could not be ignored, without exposing the most blatant press censorship, and (2) a super-tough, hard-core of young fighting men to enable such a dramatic presentation to the public.\" He understood what other groups competing for media attention knew too well: a movement could only be successful if the media amplified their message.\n\nContemporary Jewish community groups challenged journalists to consider not covering white supremacists' ideas. They called this strategy \"quarantine\", and it involved working with community organizations to minimize public confrontations and provide local journalists with enough context to understand why the American Nazi party was not newsworthy.\n\nIn regions where quarantine was deployed successfully, violence remained minimal and Rockwell was unable to recruit new party members. The press in those areas was aware that amplification served the agenda of the American Nazi party, so informed journalists employed strategic silence to reduce public harm.\n\nThe Media Manipulation research initiative at the Data & Society institute is concerned precisely with the legacy of this battle in discourse and the way that modern extremists undermine journalists and set media agendas. Media has always had the ability to publish or amplify particular voices, perspectives and incidents. In choosing stories and voices they will or will not prioritize, editors weigh the benefits and costs of coverage against potential social consequences. In doing so, they help create broader societal values. We call this willingness to avoid amplifying extremist messages \"strategic silence\".\n\nEditors used to engage in strategic silence - set agendas, omit extremist ideas and manage voices - without knowing they were doing so. Yet the online context has enhanced extremists' abilities to create controversies, prompting newsrooms to justify covering their spectacles. Because competition for audience is increasingly fierce and financially consequential, longstanding newsroom norms have come undone. We believe that journalists do not rebuild reputation through a race to the bottom. Rather, we think that it's imperative that newsrooms actively take the high ground and re-embrace strategic silence in order to defy extremists' platforms for spreading hate.\n\nStrategic silence is not a new idea. The Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s considered media coverage their most effective recruitment tactic and accordingly cultivated friendly journalists. According to Felix Harcourt , thousands of readers joined the KKK after the New York World ran a three-week chronicle of the group in 1921 . Catholic, Jewish and black presses of the 1920s consciously differed from Protestant-owned mainstream papers in their coverage of the Klan, conspicuously avoiding giving the group unnecessary attention. The black press called this use of editorial discretion in the public interest \" dignified silence \", and limited their reporting to KKK follies, such as canceled parades, rejected donations and resignations. Some mainstream journalists also grew suspicious of the KKK's attempts to bait them with camera-ready spectacles. Eventually coverage declined.\n\nThe KKK was so intent on getting the coverage they sought that they threatened violence and white boycotts of advertisers. Knowing they could bait coverage with violence, white vigilante groups of the 1960s staged cross burnings and engaged in high-profile murders and church bombings. Civil rights protesters countered white violence with black stillness, especially during lunch counter sit-ins. Journalists and editors had to make moral choices of which voices to privilege, and they chose those of peace and justice, championing stories of black resilience and shutting out white extremism. This was strategic silence in action, and it saved lives.\n\nThe emphasis of strategic silence must be placed on the strategic over the silencing. Every story requires a choice and the recent turn toward providing equal coverage to dangerous, antisocial opinions requires acknowledging the suffering that such reporting causes. Even attempts to cover extremism critically can result in the media disseminating the methods that hate groups aim to spread, such as when Virginia's Westmoreland News reproduced in full a local KKK recruitment flier on its front page. Media outlets who cannot argue that their reporting benefits the goal of a just and ethical society must opt for silence.\n\nNewsrooms must understand that even with the best of intentions, they can find themselves being used by extremists. By contrast, they must also understand they have the power to defy the goals of hate groups by optimizing for core American values of equality, respect and civil discourse. All Americans have the right to speak their minds, but not every person deserves to have their opinions amplified, particularly when their goals are to sow violence, hatred and chaos.\n\nIf telling stories didn't change lives, journalists would never have started in their careers. We know that words matter and that coverage makes a difference. In this era of increasing violence and extremism, we appeal to editors to choose strategic silence over publishing stories that fuel the radicalization of their readers."

      "text": "What is a black professor in America allowed to say?\n\nTommy J Curry thought forcing a public discussion about race and violence was part of his job. It turned out that people didn't want to hear it. By Steve Kolowich\n\nO ne Thursday morning in May, Tommy J Curry walked through the offices of the philosophy department at Texas A&M University with a police officer at his side and violence on his mind. The threats had started a few days earlier. \"Since you said white people need to be killed I'm in fear of my life,\" one person had written via email. \"The next time I see you on campus I might just have to pre-emptively defend myself you dumb fat nigger. You are done.\" Curry didn't know if that person was lurking on the university grounds. But Texas is a gun-friendly state, and Texas A&M is a gun-friendly campus, and he took the threat seriously.\n\nCurry supports the right to bear arms. It was part of how he ended up in this situation. In 2012 he had appeared on a satellite radio show and delivered a five-minute talk on how uneasy white people are with the idea of black people talking about owning guns and using them to combat racist forces. When a recording of the talk resurfaced in May, people thought the tenured professor was telling black people to kill white people. This idea swept through conservative media and into the fever swamps of Reddit forums and racist message boards. The threats followed.\n\nAnonymous bigots weren't the only ones making Curry feel unwanted. Michael K Young, the president of Texas A&M, had called the professor's comments \"disturbing\" and contrary to the values of the university. Curry was taken aback. His remarks on the radio were not a regrettable slip of the tongue. They were part of why the university had hired him.\n\nA police officer met Curry inside his academic building and rode with him in the elevator to the philosophy department, on the third floor. In a hallway, the professor pointed to photos of his graduate students so the police officer would know who was supposed to be there. The officer told him to keep an eye out for unfamiliar faces. Curry picked up his mail. There were a few angry letters, and also an envelope marked with a Texas A&M logo. He put the hate mail into a folder and carried the whole bundle downstairs. Back in the car with his wife, he opened the university envelope. Inside was a copy of a letter from a campus official that he had received a few days earlier by email - before his inbox was flooded with racist messages.\n\n\"I am delighted to offer my congratulations on your promotion to Professor at Texas A&M University effective September 1, 2017,\" said the letter. \"This measure of your achievement is an indicator of the very high esteem in which you are held by your peers. We are honored to have you on our faculty.\"\n\nAs the car pulled away from the campus, Curry reread the letter and rolled his eyes. He has not been back since.\n\nT he drama that unfolded at Texas A&M is about a scholar who was welcomed by a public university because of his unusual perspective, and who became estranged from the university for the same reason. It is a story about what a university values, how it expresses those values under pressure, and how that pressure works. It is about freedom and control, reason and fear, good faith and bad. Mostly, it is a story about a black man in America who did exactly what he said he set out to do, and who became a cautionary tale.\n\nIt starts in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where Curry grew up in the 1980s and 90s. His family lived in a mostly black neighbourhood on the east side of the city. The white folks lived on the other side of the highway. At the Woolworth store downtown, he saw the faded outline of letters that remained visible on the window glass: \"No Coloreds\". Curry's father sold insurance. He told his son stories about how white people used to break into black people's homes and terrorise them. The family kept a shotgun behind the couch, and Tommy Sr owned a pistol as well. \"He constantly told us that there is a very real threat of white violence,\" said Curry. \"The idea of black people having a right to defend themselves is just something I grew up with.\"\n\nHis mother, a social worker, told him to arm himself with an education. Curry was a serious child who hoarded information. He joined his high school's debate team, where he learned how to arrange information into arguments and recite them at breakneck speed. He became accustomed to being the only black voice in the room, although he occasionally met other black boys in the debating scene. One was Rob Redding, a preacher's son from Atlanta who was going to college in Lake Charles. Redding, who was a few years older, was struck by the high-schooler's confidence. \"I remember him coming to the debate room, and a lot of people thinking he was very bright, but maybe a little too self-confident, too self-assured,\" said Redding. \"Even some black people, who should know better, would think he was too cocky.\"\n\nCurry used debate scholarships to attend Southern Illinois University, where he won an award for his prowess as a cross-examiner. After getting his master's degree in Chicago, he went back to Southern Illinois to work on a doctorate in philosophy. He showed little deference to the canon, often challenging the universal claims that western philosophers made in their work. That annoyed a lot of people in the department, but Curry's adviser, Kenneth Stikkers, considered Curry a model student who \"inhaled\" the texts he recommended, reading them closely even if he disagreed with them. \"It was always a delight when he'd come to see me,\" said Stikkers, \"because I was always going to learn something.\"\n\nStikkers, who is white, understood that not everybody would find Curry's iconoclasm as energising as he did. Philosophers consider themselves open-minded, he said, but the department was still a white neighbourhood with expectations of how a black guest should behave. Curry was not interested in playing that game. In comments on Curry's papers, Stikkers found himself repeating a refrain: \"Don't unnecessarily antagonise your audience.\" Curry's patience for that advice was limited. \"He would say at times that he liked nothing more than pissing white people off,\" said Stikkers. \"I think he did get a certain thrill from that.\"\n\nI n 2004, while Curry was studying at Southern Illinois, the people of that state elected a young, mixed-race law professor to the US Senate. Liberals at the university had high hopes for Barack Obama as a unifying political figure, and a symbol of how far US race relations had come. Curry did not share their optimism. In the days after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, he heard that the police had opened fire on a group of unarmed black families on the Danziger Bridge in New Orleans. It would take years for courts to determine the guilt of the officers , but Curry didn't need an official judgment to convince him it was true. The aftermath of the hurricane bolstered his belief that anti-black racism in the US was a storm that would never end.\n\n\"The evidence of the last 50 years has convincingly demonstrated the failure of multicultural coalitions, civil rights legislation and integration,\" he wrote in a 2007 paper . \"The current task of radical Black thought now rests in the development of alternatives in light of this disappointment.\" Those alternatives might include violence: \"Historically, the use of violence has been a serious option in the liberation of African people from the cultural tyranny of whiteness,\" he wrote, \"and should again be investigated as a plausible and in some sense necessary political option.\"\n\nIt was a provocative thesis, and Curry knew it. He did not consider himself a violent person. Even when he was a teenage socialist, his revolutionary vision had been passive: white capitalism would collapse under its own weight, and black unionists would help build a more egalitarian society in its ruins. Anyway, philosophy was supposed to be about asking hard questions without fear or prejudice, and Curry was not interested in steering clear of topics just because they made his white colleagues uneasy.\n\nStikkers urged him to pre-emptively defend himself against charges that he wanted to incite violence. In the paper, Curry explained that he wanted to raise violent resistance in the context of US racism \"not as a call to arms, but as an open-ended political question\". Still, the young philosopher knew he was treading on dangerous ground. \"To some,\" he wrote, \"for a black scholar to even ask if violence should be used to combat racism is a career faux pas.\"\n\nThe paper was published in Radical Philosophy Today, and Curry put it on his curriculum vitae . Two years later, he earned his doctorate from Southern Illinois, and Texas A&M brought him on as a \"diversity hire\", he said. The university's philosophy department, like philosophy departments everywhere, was all white. \"They sold it to me based on the idea that they were trying to change,\" he said.\n\nBlack philosophers are rare in academe. In 2013 a study counted 141 black professors, instructors and graduate students working at US colleges, accounting for about 1% of the field. At Texas A&M, Curry turned heads almost immediately. In 2010 he taught a course that used hip-hop as a lens for philosophical ideas. The rapper 50 Cent was on the syllabus alongside Thomas Hobbes.\n\nCurry didn't want to confine his teaching to the classroom. In 2012 he reconnected with Redding, the acquaintance from his debating days in Lake Charles, who had gone on to become a radio host. His show, the Redding News Review, played online and was broadcast in several cities. Redding began featuring Curry in a segment called Talking Tough With Tommy . Every Thursday the professor would call in and lecture about race, fear and complacency during the Obama years. He warned listeners of what might happen as white America began to feel the levers of power slipping from its grasp. \"We despise black people who are pessimistic about the political situation,\" he said in one episode, \"as if history hasn't already borne out what happens when black people make progress, even if it's illusory.\"\n\nEarlier that year, grim news from a Florida suburb had reminded the nation of how precarious the political situation was, no matter who was in the White House. Trayvon Martin , an unarmed black teenager, had been stalked and killed in a gated community where his father's girlfriend lived. George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer, had seen Martin and assumed he was up to no good. He grabbed his gun and followed Martin. There was a confrontation. Martin broke Zimmerman's nose and injured the back of his head; Zimmerman then shot Martin in the chest. The case brought attention to \"stand-your-ground\" laws , which gave the residents of some states, including Florida, the right to use lethal force rather than retreat if they fear they might be in serious danger. (In court, Zimmerman was later acquitted.)\n\nThat December, Django Unchained was released in cinemas. The film starred Jamie Foxx as a black gunslinger in the antebellum south who frees his wife and murders her white slavers. In a Saturday Night Live monologue, Foxx joked about how great it was that he got to \"kill all the white people in the movie\", prompting some white pundits to accuse him of racism.\n\nCurry made plans to talk about Django on Redding's show. He wanted to place the film in the context of Nat Turner's slave revolt of 1831, the writings of the civil rights leader Robert F Williams, and the history of black people taking up arms. Once again, conjuring visions of black-on-white violence would be risky. The audience this time was not just the subscribers of Radical Philosophy Today. Curry's words would go out on the public airwaves and the internet. \"He knew that saying that would be controversial,\" said Redding. They decided the professor should focus on self-defence.\n\nWhen it came time to record the segment, Curry spoke without a script. \"When we have this conversation about violence or killing white people, it has to be looked at in these kinds of historical terms,\" he said. \"And the fact that we've had no one address, like, how relevant and how solidified this kind of tradition is, for black people saying, 'Look, in order to be equal, in order to be liberated, some white people may have to die.' I've just been immensely disappointed, because what we look at, week after week, is national catastrophe after catastrophe where black people, black children, are still dying.\"\n\nWhite conservatives speak reverently of gun rights, said Curry. \"But when we turn the conversation back and say, 'Does the black community ever need to own guns? Does the black community have a need to protect itself? Does the black individual have a need to protect himself from police officers?', we don't have that conversation at all.\"\n\nThe segment aired, and nothing happened. Redding posted Curry's piece on YouTube in December 2012 with the title \"Dr. Tommy Curry on killing whites\", then forgot about it.\n\nUntil Rod Dreher found it.\n\nD reher, too, is from Louisiana. Born 12 years before Curry, he grew up in St Francisville, a small town 160 miles north-east of Lake Charles. Only a few years before he was born, white vigilantes there had stalked and terrorised black men who had tried to register to vote in the town. In 1963, a tenant farmer named James Payne told a justice department official that a white mob had showed up at his house a day later. The intruders disarmed him, threatened to burn his family alive, and fired a bullet from his own pistol into the ground between his legs.\n\nDreher had a fling with progressive politics during his college years, at Louisiana State University, but his ideology took a right turn and he moved to the north-east, where he became a writer, cultivating an urbane Christian conservatism. Personal experience made him wary of vigilantism. In a 2001 column for the New York Post, Dreher bemoaned an elaborate funeral procession that black mourners had arranged for Aaliyah , the 22-year-old R&B artist who had died in a plane crash. \"A traffic-snarling, horse-drawn cortege in honor of a pop singer most people have never heard of?\" he wrote. \"Give us a break!\"\n\nDreher has vivid memories of what happened next. Callers flooded his voice mailbox with messages. They cursed him out, hurled antisemitic slurs (Dreher was raised Methodist and had converted to Catholicism), called him racist and said he should be fired. All of the callers had \"black accents\", he later recalled. Dreher tried to brush it off. He recorded a cheeky voicemail greeting that instructed his critics to press 1 to leave a death threat, 2 to leave a bomb threat, 3 to get him fired, and so on. Still, the outrage scared him. \"Every time a black man got within 10 feet of me, I thought: 'Could this be one of the people who made the death threat?'\" he wrote in a blogpost years later.\n\nDreher came to regret the Aaliyah column, admitting that it was \"insensitive\", but he nevertheless saw himself as a victim of racial venom coursing through parochial networks. He blamed black radio hosts for using their influence to mark him as the enemy of a race. He eventually moved back to Louisiana and cultivated an online following as a blogger for The American Conservative magazine. His take on the Trayvon Martin case was that Martin had \"overreacted\" to Zimmerman confronting him with a gun, and that black people had overreacted to Zimmerman's just acquittal. Dreher didn't see Django Unchained, he said, because revenge fantasies were corrupting. His audience eventually grew to about a million readers a month.\n\nBy the time Dreher learned about Curry earlier this year, he was writing regularly about campus politics, which he thought had grown more toxic since he was in college. The racial terrorism of the 1960s was in the past, as far as he was concerned, but the \"social-justice warriors\" remained on the warpath. Worse, college administrators indulged those students' petty outrages.\n\nIn spring, a reader sent Dreher an email, telling him that a black professor at Texas A&M was saying racist things about white people, and the university was letting it happen. (The tipster used a pseudonym, according to Dreher, but he guessed it was a student.) He Googled Curry and soon found the \"killing white people\" YouTube clip that Redding had posted. He also found the professor's 2007 paper on \"violence against whiteness\". To his ears, Curry sounded like a bully. \"That rat-a-tat-tat way of talking reminded me of people I've encountered in the past who are so busy talking at you that they don't actually listen,\" said Dreher. \"He reminded me of political and religious extremists I've run across in my life in that way. That stuff sets me on edge.\"\n\nSo he decided to expose Curry on his blog. Dreher embedded the YouTube clip and quoted from other radio appearances in which the professor had talked about how white people would never voluntarily surrender their advantages. \"What does any of this racist bilge mean?\" wrote Dreher . \"To prove his own human worth to Tommy Curry, a white person has to despise himself? Good luck with that, Tommy Curry.\"\n\nHe published it on Monday 8 May at 8.30am.\n\nD reher's post sent the professor's words racing across a network primed for racial outrage. The internet's rightwing news belt had expanded during the Obama presidency. Websites such as Infowars and Breitbart , once on the fringe, had found a champion in Donald Trump, who seemed passionate about defending white America's borders and voting rolls from usurpers such as Muslim refugees, undocumented Latinos and poor blacks.\n\nOne of the first online hubs to notice Dreher's article about Curry was a Reddit forum devoted to the lionisation of President Trump. \"'When Is It OK To Kill Whites?'\" somebody wrote there, posting a link to Dreher's article on The American Conservative. \"THE HELL?!?! This guy teaches at Texas A&M!! Liberalism at Universities as [sic] gotten completely out of hand!!\" Cristina Laila, a writer for The Gateway Pundit , a blog devoted to exposing \"the wickedness of the left\", also saw Dreher's post about Curry. \"This is more proof that rasicsm [sic] is ok,\" she wrote, \"as long as the attacks are against whites.\"\n\nInfowars was next. Then, on 10 May, somebody posted a link on the neo-Nazi website Stormfront. Some of the people who responded seemed to welcome the thought of a race war. They liked their chances. \"My West Point and 82nd Airborne cousins are more than happy to accommodate those of us who may need a little help in just such an emergency,\" wrote one person. \"So please, oh pretty please, do TRY to initiate hostilities sooner rather than later.\"\n\nCurry had succeeded in getting people across the country to talk about racial violence in the name of self-defence. Now they were talking about how Texas A&M University needed to defend itself from Curry. To hundreds of people on the forums of TexAgs, an A&M community site, the answer was clear. \"Can we not fire him?\" wrote one person. \"What an embarrassment to Texas A&M,\" wrote another. \"Waiting on a response from President Young, knowing it will never come.\"\n\nMichael Young, a lawyer, was hired to run Texas A&M in 2015 after a four-year stint as president of the University of Washington. At his new university, Young had swiftly earned a reputation as an able navigator of public-relations crises relating to racism. In 2016, white students had taunted a group of black and Latino high-school students who were visiting the campus from a Dallas preparatory school. One A&M student reportedly asked the prospective students what they thought of her Confederate flag earrings; other students told the high-school visitors to go back where they came from.\n\nYoung responded by announcing an investigation and then travelling to Dallas to personally apologise to the students who had been harassed. He was later praised widely for making a heartfelt response without rushing to judgment.\n\n\"Kneejerk responses have to be avoided at all costs,\" Young said a few weeks after the incident. The key to beating the outrage machine, he said, is to know exactly what your university stands for. If you do that, \"even if it doesn't play out the way the Twitter world initially thinks it should, you never have to back away or apologise\".\n\nTexas A&M officials quickly realised that Dreher's article might become a problem. Amy Smith, senior vice president for marketing and communications, advised the head of the philosophy department, Theodore George, on how to respond to inquiries about Curry. \"Barring direct threats by him to others, Dr Curry has a first-amendment right to offer his personal views on this subject,\" she advised him to say, \"no matter how incendiary and inappropriate others may consider them to be.\"\n\nIt soon became clear that would not be enough.\n\nE ven before Curry's comments were covered in the mainstream press, Porter Garner III, head of the Texas A&M Association of Former Students, an influential fundraising body, began receiving angry calls from donors. They thought Curry was encouraging violence against white people. Many of the callers might not have been \"fully informed\" of the context of Curry's words, said Garner, but some of them were longtime donors, volunteers, and friends of the university, and their concerns were \"pretty rational\" and \"very respectful\".\n\nYoung said he disagreed with the idea that Curry was inciting violence. But as president of the university, he felt an obligation to take the concerns seriously. Public outrage can be perilous for a public university, especially when race is involved. After black students and their allies caused a national stir by protesting racism at the University of Missouri in 2015, the university's fundraising efforts took a big hit, and it became a punching bag for the conservative state legislature. Two years later, freshman enrolment has dropped by 35%, and the university has temporarily shuttered seven dormitories.\n\nYoung said that finances were not on his mind as he weighed what to do about Curry, but also that he acknowledged the importance of staying in the good graces of constituencies beyond the campus. \"People send their children to A&M, and students come to A&M, because it's a very special place,\" he said in an interview. \"I didn't want anybody to doubt what they believe it stands for is what it stands for.\"\n\nOn the morning of 10 May, Curry was asked to meet with university administrators. The professor agreed, but told them he wanted another person of colour in the meeting. He didn't want to feel surrounded by people who didn't get it. At the meeting, Curry said, he got the impression that university officials wanted to draw a distinction between his radio commentary and his work for Texas A&M. But Curry told the university officials there was no difference. Earlier in the year, a panel of judges from the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy had honored Curry's radio work by giving him an award for public philosophy. His radio commentary wasn't some offbeat rant, the professor told his bosses. This is part of what you hired me to do.\n\n\"They backed down a little bit,\" Curry said. He said they told him to put his defence in writing, so they could use it to respond to people who were contacting the university to complain. Curry wrote in the third person, assuming that his bosses would adopt his voice as their own.\n\n\"The inflammatory phrase 'When is it OK to kill white people,'\" he wrote , referring to Dreher's headline, \"deliberately misconstrues Dr Curry's distinction between revolutionary violence and self-defense.\" He continued: \"Dr Curry, drawing from the Second Amendment tradition, suggests that the law's failure to protect the lives of Black, Latino, and Muslim Americans requires new conversations which may require self-defense and more radical options than protest. In no way does his work promote or incite violence toward whites or any other racial group.\" The professor sent the text to his department chair that evening. Two hours later, Curry was sitting in his apartment, at his computer, when a message arrived from President Young. It was addressed not to Curry, but to all faculty, staff and students.\n\n\"As you may know, a podcast interview by one of our professors that took place approximately four-and-a-half years ago resurfaced this week on social media, seen for the first time by many of us,\" wrote Young. \"The interview features disturbing comments about race and violence that stand in stark contrast to Aggie [Texas A&M] core values - most notably those of respect, excellence, leadership and integrity - values that we hold true toward all of humanity.\"\n\nCurry read the email, the text of which was later posted on the university's website , with dawning anger. He's throwing me under the bus, the professor thought. Young continued: \"As we know, the First Amendment of the US Constitution protects the rights of others to offer their personal views, no matter how reprehensible those views may be. It also protects our right to freedom of speech, which I am exercising now. We stand for equality. We stand against the advocacy of violence, hate and killing. We firmly commit to the success, not the destruction, of each other.\"\n\nHave no fear, the president assured them: Texas A&M's core values remained intact.\n\nS mith, the communications vice president, immediately sent Young's statement to the presidents of all the non-profit organisations that help fund Texas A&M. She felt good about the statement. Fair was fair: in December 2016, when the white nationalist Richard Spencer visited Texas A&M, Young made it clear that the university did not share his values, either. After trying and failing to bar Spencer from speaking on campus, university leaders organised a unity-themed rally in the football stadium. \"If you're a purveyor of hate and divisiveness,\" said John C Sharp, the chancellor, \"and you want to spew that kind of racism, this is the last campus on earth that you want to come to to do that.\"\n\nIn light of the situation with Curry, Smith found herself moved by the chancellor's words. \"It is even more meaningful now,\" she wrote to the president the next morning, \"as we articulated our core values again yesterday in a new-but-related situation that shows we mean this equitably.\"\n\nBut the statement did little to slow the momentum of the story. The outrage machine was just warming up. Conservative writers struggled to square their love of free speech with their horror at Curry's words. \"Certainly, no one should be stopped for sharing and debating ideas; the country has seen too many prohibitions of speech in past years,\" wrote Ron Meyer, editor of Red Alert Politics, a Washington-based blog. \"However, paying a professor to share radical ideas on behalf of a university has nothing to do with free speech.\"\n\nGarner, of the Association of Former Students, was still getting calls from alumni who thought Young had not gone far enough. Some said the president should have condemned Curry more forcefully. Others were upset that the professor hadn't been fired. A petition was started encouraging alumni to withhold all donations to Texas A&M and its affiliated fundraisers until the board took action against Curry and Young. The alumni were not the only ones who were upset. Young's attempt to get ahead of a national story created another outrage closer to home.\n\nT o some of Curry's colleagues , the statement the president sent out to mollify the professor's critics was not an affirmation of the university's core values. It was a betrayal of the sacred privilege of academic freedom. Joe Feagin, a long-serving sociology professor, wrote to Young the next morning. \"Michael,\" he wrote, \"I wish you had contacted me about the Curry matter.\" In a separate email to a student newspaper reporter, Feagin argued that Curry's 2012 radio piece was, in fact, based on good research.\n\nNandra Perry, an associate professor of English, also wrote to the president. Previously, she had assumed the university would have her back if anybody used a classroom recording to attack her. Now she wasn't so sure. \"To call this incident a blow to academic freedom,\" Perry told Young, \"doesn't begin to do justice to the chill it will have on my teaching, and indeed the teaching of almost everyone I know.\"\n\nPerhaps the most scathing rebuke to the president came in a letter signed by every faculty member in the Africana Studies department, where Curry also holds a faculty appointment. The history of black thought, they said, includes more than Martin Luther King Jr's crossover hits. By dismissing Curry's comments on violent resistance as \"personal views\", they said, Young had delegitimised the professor's expertise and dismissed centuries of history.\n\n\"Blacks in the United States live with the daily fear that a traffic stop, or a trip to the store or the park, could be the end of their lives,\" wrote the professors. \"Yet we cannot talk about black resistance? Historically or contemporaneously?\" They demanded an apology.\n\nWhen Dreher heard that Curry was getting death threats, he wrote a follow-up blogpost. Anyone threatening violence against Curry, he said, should be ashamed and, if possible, arrested. \"I hope Dr Curry is armed,\" he added, \"so that if anybody shows up at his house threatening him, he defends his home and family by any means necessary.\" Still, Dreher stuck by his interpretation of Curry's 2012 radio commentary. \"I don't believe Tommy Curry is encouraging black people to go out today and cut throats,\" he wrote. \"I think he is entertaining dangerous thoughts here, same as far-right white radicals.\" (He later would write a third post, which was removed, comparing the professor to Emperor Palpatine, the Star Wars villain who encourages morally complex characters to \"give in to the dark side\".)\n\nCurry read the second blogpost somewhat differently from how Dreher had meant it. That evening the professor wrote an email to Young with a headline that was provocative, if a bit misleading: \"Rod Dreher retracts\".\n\nThe president decided to make another statement, and his advisers spent several days discussing how to thread the needle. On 17 May, a week after Young had put out his statement about Texas A&M's values, he put out a new one . He said he was committed to academic freedom. He acknowledged that scholars often find their work oversimplified or misunderstood. He reiterated the university's position that racial violence is always bad. He did not, however, offer a personal apology to Curry.\n\nDespite the title of Curry's email to Young, Dreher has not changed his views on Curry's ideas. Dreher believes the only practical solution to racial resentment is the power of forgiveness. In 2015, Dreher marvelled at the \"Christ-like love\" of the teenage children of Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, one of the nine black parishioners killed by the white supremacist Dylann Roof at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Roof shot her five times. The next night, at a vigil for their mother, Chris and Camryn Coleman-Singleton told an interviewer that they had already forgiven Roof .\n\nDreher saw their gesture as both inspiring and necessary. \"There will always be haters, of all kinds, and sometimes those haters will murder in service of the hate that consumes them,\" he wrote at the time. \"But to deny that things have changed for the better, and can change for the better if we work at it, is to deny to ourselves the hope that inspired Martin Luther King and the civil rights heroes.\"\n\nCurry is no hero, Dreher said. He thinks the professor's talk of racial violence is reckless, and that he should cut it out before he inspires somebody to do real harm. \"Tommy Curry's big fat radical mouth gets to me,\" he wrote in an email, \"because of the consequences of the things he believes and says. It's not a joke.\"\n\nB ack in America, Curry was more worried about the consequences of what Dreher believed and said about him. For two weeks, Curry rarely left his apartment, as messages arrived by email warning him of what might happen if he did. \"You and your entire family of low-IQ, affirmative-action herpes-infected african monkeys might need to be put to death.\" There were dozens like that. The professor forwarded them to the campus police department. Curry said a detective told him some of the messages appeared to have been sent from within the county. Police officers made a point of regularly driving past his apartment building for several weeks. But Curry worried about whether his six-year-old was safe at her elementary school. Driving her home at the end of the day, he would circle the block a few times to make sure they had not been followed.\n\nNobody came to his door, knocked him down, disarmed him, fired a bullet between his legs or made him beg for his life. The mob that came for Curry was digital and diffuse, everywhere and nowhere. The goal, however, was the same as ever: fear. And it worked. The Currys left town. They had already been planning to move, but Curry and his wife decided to leave early to stay with family. His daughters thought they were going on vacation. He does not plan to bring them when he returns to Texas A&M in the autumn.\n\nIn the course of his life, Curry has embodied both the promise of racial progress and its limitations. He was able to study at an integrated school, but his hometown remained divided by the legacy of segregation. He was hired by a university that wanted more black professors, then was mocked by conservative students who assumed his insight was worthless. He earned honours from his colleagues, then anger from strangers and a tepid defence from his bosses.\n\n\"If that's the American dream,\" said Curry, \"then I'd hate to see what the actual nightmare is.\" He plans to return to Texas A&M in the fall as a full professor. He knows there are people there who want him gone. He no longer trusts the university to defend him. He only hopes he can defend himself.\n\nMain photograph by Benjamin Rasmussen.

      "text": "'Defend yourself': the Memphis gun club educating Black women and children on firearm safety\n\nA Tennessee chapter of the National African American Gun Association (Naaga) is teaching their community self-defense as more Black adults in US become firearm owners\n\nI n the middle of a strip of industrial, single-story buildings, it's easy to miss the offices of 901 Brothers Sisters Keeper gun club, the Memphis chapter of the National African American Gun Association (Naaga).\n\nInside the office multiple flags hang: the Black Lives Matter flag; the thin green line flag , which is often used by members and supporters of the US military; an American flag; and the Naaga flag, a red, black and green version of the country's flag that reads: \"community engagement\", \"tactical training\", \"safe storage\", \"kid's gun safety\", \"self defense\" and \"mentoring\" - tenets of the organization.\n\nTo some, the flags may indicate a clear contradiction, but for the members of Naaga, an organization made up of former law enforcement officers and families concerned about gun safety, they represent the layers of gun ownership within Black communities. Bennie Cobb, a retired police officer and former commander of the Shelby county sheriff's office's special weapons and tactics (Swat) team, thought that Memphis needed a Naaga Chapter after he found out about the national organization.\n\nDespite his own law enforcement background, no one in his family had ever touched a gun. Many young people with whom he interacted were familiar with guns, but not with gun safety.\n\n\"African Americans are getting more in tune to gun ownership,\" Cobb said. Between 2019 and 2021, 2.9% of US adults newly became gun owners. Approximately half of those adults were women, while about 20% were Black. \"Guns are powerful tools, training young people on gun ownership [is important].\"\n\nFounded in 2015 in Atlanta, Naaga has seen regular waves of growth over the last decade. Membership spiked after Trump's first time in office, said Philip Smith, the organization's founder, and in the years since, chapters have popped up across the country. Instances of nationally publicized police violence, rises in violent rhetoric and acts from hate groups , and mass shootings have also led to spurts of membership growth. Naaga now has more than 100 chapters across the country and five regional directors.\n\nThe majority of the organization's members, both nationwide and locally, Cobb said, are women: mothers, grandmothers and single women who joined the Memphis chapter to learn self-defense or to help their children learn about gun safety. Though Black and Latino populations experienced the sharpest decline in gun homicides in 2023 nationally, gun violence is still a concern in Memphis, where Black people are 4.2% more likely than whites to die from gun violence.\n\nMemphis's mayor, Paul Young has specifically worked to address gun violence in the city, writing earlier this year : \"I want Memphis, America's largest majority-Black city, to be a leader in finding ways to get the community to put our guns down and to solve our gun violence problems; I want Memphis to be the model.\"\n\nLast year, the city saw a 30% decline in homicides, a 29% decline in murder and a 39% decline in motor vehicle theft, according to data from the city of Memphis and its police department. Still, Naaga believes it's important to ensure the community remains educated about gun safety by reaching people of all ages, including children ages six to 17. Those classes, in which a parent or adult is required to bring and stay with the child or children the entire time, are almost entirely chaperoned by women.\n\nKatina Davis, an early member of the Memphis branch, said she joined the organization because of its community focus. Since joining, she has worked to ensure she is imparting the knowledge she learns to others. \"If I'm not telling my grandbabies about safety, I don't even bring [her firearm] out around them.\"\n\nIn March of 1892, a white mob lynched three Black men : Thomas Moss, a close friend of the journalist Ida B Wells, and his business partners, Will Stewart and Calvin McDowell, because their prosperous People's Grocery was taking business away from a white man's store that had previously held a monopoly in a Black neighborhood in Memphis. In her autobiography, Wells noted they were the first lynchings in Memphis since the American civil war.\n\nWriting in 1892, Wells responded to the year - full of lynchings and terror, and in which her newspaper offices in Memphis were destroyed by a white mob - with a call for self-defense: \"The lesson this teaches and which every Afro American should ponder well, is that a Winchester rifle should have a place of honor in every black home, and it should be used for that protection which the law refuses to give,\" she wrote.\n\nThat call has echoed throughout Black history. It was adopted in the 1950s and 60s by members of the Mississippi Freedom Movement, who responded to Jim Crow-era violence with a desire to defend their families; in 1962, by civil rights activist Robert F Williams, who wrote the book Negroes With Guns, about Black gun defense in light of white violence; in 1964, by the Deacons for Defense and Justice , who formed to protect civil rights activists; and by Huey P Newton and Bobby Seale, in 1966, when they founded the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense.\n\nThough there is a rich history of Black gun ownership in the US, Black people have consistently faced barriers to gun access. In the 1600s, Virginia banned all people of African descent, whether they were enslaved or free, from owning guns. Before the civil war, slave codes likewise prevented all Black people from gun ownership; following the civil war, those laws were replaced with \"black codes\", which also prohibited Black gun ownership. Many of those codes still shape laws about gun ownership in the country. The strict gun laws for which California is known came about as a direct result of white politicians attempting to curb Black gun ownership after 30 members of the Black Panthers protested on the steps of the California statehouse with their weapons.\n\nCenturies of repression of Black gun ownership have led to Black Americans having some of the lowest gun rates compared with other races: today, 24% of Black Americans own a gun, compared with 38% of white Americans. About seven in 10 gun owners, or 72%, say protection is a major reason why they own a gun.\n\nBy offering events for children as young as six, the Memphis chapter of Naaga hopes to ensure that the next generation of Black gun owners is knowledgable about both safety and self-defense.\n\n\"I try to get the kids to go so they can know when you are with your friend in the house and they play with guns, you [need] to go home,\" Davis said. \"You don't want to be involved with it because it can change your life or you could possibly lose your life.\"\n\nAfter attending the classes, Davis takes the children out to eat, lets them relax and asks them about what they learned as a way to reinforce their training.\n\nCobb says that the organization has trained all sorts of people. A week prior, a woman called and told him that her 65-year-old mother, who had never shot a gun, needed gun safety training; some women call to schedule day parties that are gun safety training opportunities instead of brunch; grandmothers in wheelchairs and those who are legally blind have taken classes as well.\n\nOnce a month, Naaga's Memphis chapter hosts women-only classes. Many of the participants are first-time gun owners who want to ensure they have proper training, Cobb said. The organization also offers non-lethal self-defense classes, in which they teach people how to safely use pepper spray or batons.\n\nCobb said that law enforcement officials flocking to the organization makes sense, as officers will want to join an organization in which they can continue weapons training. But having an organization that welcomes former and current authorities, as well as community members who may have a negative relationship with law enforcement can provide unique opportunities, he said. \"Tennessee has permitless carry, and more people want training and understanding about what they can and can't do.\"\n\nHaving people who are trained in the law lead the trainings helps ensure that those who attend 901 Brothers Sisters Keeper gun club's events are learning not only about gun safety and gun use, but they are also learning how to ensure their gun usage is within the law. One common issue, Cobb said, is explaining to people that they cannot legally use their guns lethally just because someone is, for instance, breaking into their vehicles.\n\n\"We want all people to know how to defend themselves,\" Cobb said, noting that police can take an extended period of time to arrive after an incident. \"We want people to know how to protect themselves.\""
