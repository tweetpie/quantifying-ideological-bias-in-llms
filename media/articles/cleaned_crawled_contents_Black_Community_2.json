      "text": "How the manosphere found its way into the Black community\n\nIn the summer of 2023, I read that YouTube had demonetized a podcast called \"Fresh & Fit,\" meaning that the show could no longer earn ad revenue.\n\nWhile YouTube didn't point to an inciting incident, the podcast had recently come under fire for hosting white supremacist Nick Fuentes. During the episode , Fuentes had called women \"baby machines\" and denied the existence of the Holocaust.\n\nUntil then, I hadn't heard of \"Fresh & Fit.\" But once I learned that the hosts were two young Black men, Myron Gaines and Walter Weekes , I wanted to learn more about what they were saying on their show - and how they said it.\n\nThe show is part of the \"manosphere\" : online places where men have conversations for, with and about men. Journalists and scholars generally describe younger white men as the most common audiences for manosphere influencers.\n\nAs a researcher of male-dominated spaces , I wondered: Were Gaines and Weekes specifically trying to target Black male followers? And, if so, how were they pulling this off?\n\nAs I listened to their episodes, I started noticing something interesting - the two hosts regularly used language to appeal to Black men. They spoke in the parlance of social justice movements, but applied it, in a twisted way, to justify misogyny and male superiority.\n\nI study male subcultures such as gaming and the military to see the types of rhetoric and behaviors that get rewarded and which kinds of topics are avoided.\n\nThere's the widespread belief that men don't express their feelings well or have a hard time being vulnerable.\n\nThe manosphere purports to upend that notion . On podcasts, YouTube series and discussion boards, men get into the weeds about their lives, their relationships and the challenges they face.\n\nSome have argued that these interviews, posts and threads can be healthy and productive . But the manosphere generally evokes controversial internet personalities such as Andrew Tate and Jordan Peterson , who have become notorious for their misogynistic and homophobic tirades. Tate doesn't just say outrageous stuff - he's been charged with sex trafficking and is awaiting trial in Romania.\n\nTo Tate and Peterson, being a better man isn't about learning to be more vulnerable. Instead, they argue that straight men have become marginalized in a society that's gotten too soft, too effeminate and too politically correct. In their view, men need to embrace their traditional roles as protectors, providers and producers.\n\nResearch has shown that young men in particular are receptive to these ideas . Of course, young Black men make up some of this cohort. But they rarely get mentioned in critiques of the manosphere.\n\n\"Fresh & Fit\" bills itself as a discussion on men's fitness, fashion and mental health.\n\nGaines is author of the book \" Why Women Deserve Less ,\" in which he writes, \"Women are benefiting unfairly at nearly every man's expense.\"\n\nWeekes is a business mogul who firmly believes in meritocracy; he credits his success to his own hard work, a point he eagerly reiterates on a number of episodes.\n\nThe show normally involves commentary from the hosts about current events, and they'll often feature guests ranging from CrossFit coaches and gym owners to more controversial interviewees like Fuentes and conservative political commentator Candace Owens .\n\nThe YouTube shows are wildly popular, with some episodes garnering hundreds of thousands of views.\n\nThere's also a spinoff, \"Fresh & Fit After Hours,\" which tends to include panels of young women. During these conversations, the women - who usually work in fields such as modeling, sex work or professional dance - often find themselves put on the spot by the hosts, who ask them to speak on behalf of all women.\n\nI listened to 40 randomly selected episodes of the main show and 25 of the \"After Hours\" show, and the conversations veered into explorations of gender differences and debates about why men are better than women. All of these elements fall under what sociolinguist Scott Kiesling calls \"masculine linguistic practices\" - the ways in which men express their masculinity in conversation with one another.\n\nEach episode is replete with misogyny. On one, Gaines encourages listeners to not go to Miami - not because it's too expensive or it's too hot, but because the women in South Beach think they're \"better than you.\" On another, when talking about what men are looking for in a partner, he notes, \"When we look for security in y'all, it's security in making sure the kid is ours. And a woman that has a promiscuous past might continue that trend in the future.\"\n\nGaines and Weekes do give a platform to women - but it's to women who echo the hosts' warped theories on gender.\n\nIn several of the \"Fresh & Fit After Hours\" episodes I watched, the hosts booked female guests who often admitted that they are status-conscious opportunists - that they want to be taken care of, that they expect men to give them gifts, and that they should be treated \"like a lady.\"\n\nIn one episode of \"After Hours,\" when a guest says she wishes men could approach her without being overly flirtatious, Gaines is quick to undermine her: Surely she gets approached by men every day. But are they all flirtatious?\n\nThen he throws out another question: How many of the men she ended up dating hadn't flirted with her?\n\nShe holds up her hand in the shape of a zero.\n\nWatching \"Fresh & Fit\" also showed me how the hosts sought to specifically appeal to Black viewers and listeners.\n\nI think it's important to note that although Black men are highly susceptible to being seen as a collective group, they aren't a monolith. Many Black men hold conservative views . Instances of homophobia, misogyny and transphobia are as common among Black Americans as they are among white Americans.\n\nIn other words, there isn't any sort of cultural insulation that would protect Black men from negative messages in the manosphere, and the hosts subtly use language and imagery common to Black culture to inculcate Black listeners to their views.\n\nGaines and Weekes invariably slip in and out of African American Vernacular English, which conveys not only authenticity but also forges a connection with Black listeners .\n\nAdditionally, a common theme is the degree to which men are being \"kept down.\" In the context of their show, \"kept down\" refers to the ways in which women constrain them. But in Black culture, the phrase is commonly used to talk about the ways in which the dominant white culture forces them to behave or act a certain way .\n\nCriminal law scholar Paul Butler refers to the impact of those stereotypes about Black men as \" black male exceptionalism .\"\n\nTo Butler, commonly repeated statistics about Black men - their higher incarceration rates, worse education outcomes and lower employment rates - reinforce the idea of Black men as an \" endangered species .\" My upcoming research expands on this, exploring how the internalization of this exceptionalism can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nThe darker corners of the manosphere stoke beliefs about disenfranchisement and discrimination against men. So it's worth pointing out that these messages can easily resonate among minority men, too.\n\nIf they listen to Gaines and Weekes, they'll come away from the episodes thinking that it isn't just racism keeping them down: It's women, too.\n\nSteven Dashiell , Assistant Research Professor, Morgan State University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Black Like I Thought I Was\n\nWayne Joseph is a 51-year-old high school principal in Chino whose family emigrated from the segregated parishes of Louisiana to central Los Angeles in the 1950s, as did mine. Like me, he is of Creole stock and is therefore on the lighter end of the black color spectrum, a common enough circumstance in the South that predates the multicultural movement by centuries. And like most other black folk, Joseph grew up with an unequivocal sense of his heritage and of himself; he tends toward black advocacy and has published thoughtful opinion pieces on racial issues in magazines like Newsweek. When Joseph decided on a whim to take a new ethnic DNA test he saw described on a 60 Minutes segment last year, it was only to indulge a casual curiosity about the exact percentage of black blood; virtually all black Americans are mixed with something, he knew, but he figured it would be interesting to make himself a guinea pig for this new testing process, which is offered by a Florida-based company called DNA Print Genomics Inc. The experience would at least be fodder for another essay for Newsweek. He got his kit in the mail, swabbed his mouth per the instructions and sent off the DNA samples for analysis. Now, I have always believed that what is now widely considered one of slavery's worst legacies -- the Southern \"one-drop\" rule that indicted anyone with black blood as a nigger and cleaved American society into black and white with a single stroke -- was also slavery's only upside. Of course I deplore the motive behind the law, which was rooted not only in white paranoia about miscegenation, but in a more practical need to maintain social order by keeping privilege and property in the hands of whites. But by forcing blacks of all complexions and blood percentages into the same boat, the law ironically laid a foundation of black unity that remains in place today. It's a foundation that allows us to talk abstractly about a \"black community\" as concretely as we talk about a black community in Harlem or Chicago or South-Central (a liberty that's often abused or lazily applied in modern discussions of race). And it gives the lightest-skinned among us the assurance of identity that everybody needs in order to feel grounded and psychologically whole -- even whites, whose public non-ethnicity is really ethnicity writ so large and influential it needs no name. Being black may still not be the most advantageous thing in the world, but being nothing or being neutral -- the rallying cry of modern-day multiculturalists -- has never made any emotional or real-world sense. Color marks you, but your membership in black society also gives you an indestructible house to live in and a bed to rest on. I can't imagine growing up any other way. Wayne Joseph can't, either. But when the results of his DNA test came back, he found himself staggered by the idea that though he still qualified as a person of color, it was not the color he was raised to think he was, one with a distinct culture and definitive place in the American struggle for social equality that he'd taken for granted. Here was the unexpected and rather unwelcome truth: Joseph was 57 percent Indo-European, 39 percent Native American, 4 percent East Asian -- and zero percent African. After a lifetime of assuming blackness, he was now being told that he lacked even a single drop of black blood to qualify. \"My son was flabbergasted by the results,\" says Joseph. \"He said, 'Dad, you mean for 50 years you've been passing for black?'\" Joseph admits that, strictly speaking, he has. But he's not sure if he can or wants to do anything about that at this point. For all the lingering effects of institutional racism, he's been perfectly content being a black man; it has shaped his worldview and the course of his life in ways that cannot, and probably should not, be altered. Yet Joseph struggles to balance the intellectual dishonesty of saying he's black with the unimpeachable honesty of a lifelong experience of being black. \"What do I do with this information?\" he says, sounding more than a little exasperated. \"It was like finding out you're adopted. I don't want to be disingenuous with myself. But I can't conceive of living any other way. It's a question of what's logical and what's visceral.\" Race, of course, has always been a far more visceral matter than a logical one. We now know that there is no such thing as race, that humans are biologically one species; we know that an African is likely to have more in common genetically with a European thousands of miles away than with a neighboring African. Yet this knowledge has not deterred the racism many Europeans continue to harbor toward Africans, nor the wariness Africans harbor toward Europeans. Such feelings may never be deterred. And despite all the loud assertions to the contrary, race is still America's bane, and its fascination; Philip Roth's widely acclaimed last novel set in the 1990s, The Human Stain , features a Faustian protagonist whose great moral failing is that he's a black man who's been passing most of his life for white (the book has been made into a movie due in theaters next month). Joseph recognizes this, and while he argues for a more rational and less emotional view of race for the sake of equity, he also recognizes that rationality is not the same thing as fact. As much as he might want to, he can't simply refute his black past and declare himself white or Native American. He can acknowledge the truth but can't quite apply it, which makes it pretty much useless to other, older members of his family. An aunt whom he told about the test results only said that she wasn't surprised. \"When I told my mother about the test, she said to me, 'I'm too old and too tired to be anything else,'\" recalls Joseph. \"It makes no difference to her. It's an easy issue.\" After recovering from the initial shock, Joseph began questioning his mother about their lineage. He discovered that, unbeknownst to him, his grandparents had made a conscious decision back in Louisiana to not be white, claiming they didn't want to side with a people who were known oppressors. Joseph says there was another, more practical consideration: Some men in the family routinely courted black women, and they didn't want the very public hassle such a pairing entailed in the South, which included everything from dirty looks to the ignominy of a couple having to separate on buses and streetcars and in restaurants per the Jim Crow laws. I know that the laws also pointedly separated mothers from sons, uncles from nephews, simply because one happened to be lighter than the other or have straighter hair. Determinations of race were entirely subjective and imposed from without, and the one-drop rule was enforced to such divisive and schizophrenic effects that Joseph's family -- and mine -- fled Louisiana for the presumably less boundary-obsessed West. But we didn't flee ourselves, and didn't expect to; we simply set up a new home in Los Angeles. The South was wrong about its policies but it was right about our color. It had to be. Joseph remains tortured by the possibility that maybe nobody is right. The essay he thought the DNA test experience would prompt became a book that he's already 150 pages into. He doesn't seem to know how it'll end. He's in a kind of limbo that he doesn't want and that I frankly wouldn't wish on anyone; when I wonder aloud about taking the $600 DNA test myself, Joseph flatly advises against it. \"You don't want to know,\" he says. \"It's like a genie coming out of a bottle. You can't put it back in.\" He has more empathy for the colorblind crowd than he had before, but isn't inclined to believe that the Ward Connerlys and other professed racial conservatives of the world have the best interests of colored people at heart. \"I see their point, but race does matter, especially with things like medical research and other social trends,\" he says of Connerly's Proposition 54, the much-derided state measure that seeks to outlaw the collection of ethnic data that will be voted on in the recall election next Tuesday. \"Problems like that can't just go away.\" For the moment, Joseph is compelled to try to  judge individually what he knows has always been judged broadly, to reconcile two famously opposed viewpoints of race not for the sake of political argument -- he has made those -- but for his own peace of mind. He's wrestling with a riddle that will likely outlive him, though he doesn't worry that it will be passed on to the next generation -- his ex-wife is black, enough to give his children the firm ethnic identity he had and that he embraced for most of his life. \"The question ultimately is, are you who you say you are, or are you who you are genetically?\" he muses. The logical -- and visceral -- answer is that it's not black and white."

      "text": "Racial trauma has profound mental health consequence\n\nSince European expansion into the Americas, white people have demonized Black people and portrayed them as undesirable, violent and hypersexual. Originally, the intent of this demonization was to legitimize the conquest and sale of African people.\n\nOne consequence of this negative portrayal has been the documented psychological impact on Black people themselves. It includes self-hatred , internalized racism and an erosion of Black consciousness within the Black community.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Martin Luther King Jr. recognized the consequences of racist stereotypes and tried to change the language and symbols of racism.\n\n\"Somebody told a lie one day,\" King said. \"They couched it in language. They made everything black ugly and evil. Look in your dictionaries and see the synonyms of the word black. It's always something degrading and low and sinister. Look at the word white and it's always something pure. ...\"\n\nThough King longed for the day when the word \"black\" would be associated with beauty, Black people are still coping with feelings of alienation as a result of what is known as racialized trauma , the emotional impact of racism, racial discrimination and violence on mostly Black people.\n\nI am a psychologist and professor of counseling. In our 2022 peer-reviewed article , mental health counselor Janeé M. Steele and I detail the mental injuries caused by encounters with racial bias, hostility, discrimination and harassment.\n\nMore important, our research has shown that healing from racialized trauma can help reduce the negative impacts of racism and provide the emotional resources necessary to challenge racial injustices.\n\nThe American Psychological Association defines trauma as \"any disturbing experience that results in significant fear, helplessness, dissociation, confusion, or other disruptive feelings intense enough to have a long-lasting negative effect on a person's attitudes, behavior, and other aspects of functioning.\"\n\nCommon ways people are exposed to racialized trauma include everyday slights such as a store owner following a person of color around the store, racial slurs, denied opportunities, racial profiling and hate crimes.\n\nThese encounters, known as race-based events , may occur directly between individuals or groups of people, or they may happen indirectly - for example, as a result of watching a video of police brutality .\n\nWhether they occur directly or indirectly, race-based events have a negative psychological effect on people of color and often leave them feeling wounded. Some of these wounds include increased rates of hypervigilance , depression , anxiety , post-traumatic stress disorder and low self-esteem .\n\nDuring our research, we interviewed a 29-year-old Black woman who grew up in a lower-middle-class neighborhood near Detroit. She attend predominantly white private schools and went on to become the first in her family to graduate from college and later earn a master's degree in counseling.\n\nA Black social worker listens to a client.\n\nSilvia Jansen/Getty Images\n\nBut when she started her first full-time job, she noticed that it was dominated by white males in a work environment where the voices of people of color were not regularly heard. For instance, the woman told us that during staff meetings she was often ignored, except on rare occasions when issues of race were discussed.\n\nAs a result, the woman explained that she felt that she was devalued and began to feel anxious, sad and hopeless. Her self-esteem also suffered.\n\nHealing from racialized trauma is possible.\n\nYet current incidents of social injustice combined with centuries of violence, poverty, undereducation, mass incarceration, family dysfunction and health disparities have made it difficult for some Black people to maintain hope, a necessary element in undertaking the work to overcome this trauma.\n\nNevertheless, by learning new ways of thinking and coping, it is possible to find hope and overcome the wounds of racialized trauma.\n\nBased on research and nearly 20 years of clinical experience, we have found tangible tools to address these wounds in five holistic ways.\n\nAs we write in \" Black Lives are Beautiful ,\" a first step is identifying and understanding the psychological impacts of racialized trauma, as well as knowledge of strategies for wellness.\n\nA second step in healing is the active promotion of higher self-esteem.\n\nIn our research, we learned that affirming one's personal strengths and replacing negative beliefs can help individuals deal with racialized trauma.\n\nBoosting self-confidence is one way to minimize the impact of racialiized trauma.\n\nKlaus Vedfelt/Getty Images\n\nThe third is developing resilience. Tenacity during adversity is important. The ability to bounce back and persevere can come from connecting with individuals, family and community.\n\nFor some Black people, this work is especially powerful, as research indicates that spending time engaged in activities that focus on cultural strengths can increase feelings of personal control and lead to higher self-esteem.\n\nThe fourth way is to promote empowerment. Finding strength in one's personal choices is fundamental to achieving a higher self-image. Those choices could include supporting Black-owned businesses, attending cultural events and developing a strategy to gain financial independence.\n\nThe last way of healing is found in promoting a sense of community. By doing so, an individual can increase a sense of belonging and counter the feelings of isolation triggered by racialized trauma.\n\nChar Newton , Clinical Assistant Professor, University of North Dakota\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Laura Ingraham guest quietly taken off air after proclaiming Black people 'love sneakers'\n\nRaymond Arroyo - a frequent guest and occasional substitute host on Laura Ingraham's primetime Fox News show - has been noticeably absent since a racially insensitive remark he made last month spread across the internet.\n\nDuring a February appearance on Ingraham's show, Arroyo - who is white - was lauding former President Donald Trump's new gold-painted sneakers that sell for roughly $400 a pair. He argued that Trump rolling out branded sneakers could make him more palatable to Black voters because \" they love sneakers .\"\n\n\"Even the sneaker thing. I was on social media last night. Very interesting as you see Black support eroding from Joe Biden,\" Arroyo said at the time. \"This is connecting with Black America because they love sneakers... This is a big deal. Certainly in the inner city. So when you have Trump roll out his sneaker line, they're like, 'Wait a minute, this is cool!\"\n\nArroyo's comments were met with a wave of criticism by Black writers, who slammed him for invoking a stereotype and generalizing an entire race of people.\n\n\"If conservatives believe Blacks are so simplistic that shiny sneakers will sway them to vote, it shows you how out of touch they continue to be with the community,\" Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel columnist James E. Causey wrote.\n\nJoan Brickner - a contributor to the Fargo, North Dakota Forum newspaper - panned Trump's efforts to reach out to the Black community in 2024, reminding readers that his record over the last several decades by far eclipses any rhetoric on the campaign trail.\n\n\"This is a man sued for failing to rent to Black people,\" Brickner wrote. \"This is a man who took out a full-page ad in The New York Times to promote executing the Central Park Five, Black and Latino men who had been convicted of raping a white woman - men later cleared, having nothing to do with it, after years of imprisonment. This is a man who has said neo-Nazis and KKK members in Charlottesville included 'fine people.'\"\n\nThe Daily Beast's Justin Baragona reported that Arroyo hasn't been on the air since that remark , despite being a paid contributor to the network since 2017. This suggests Fox News may have sidelined him over those comments, as he had reportedly been on the air 29 times prior to that comment. 22 of those appearances were on Ingraham's show, and several of the remaining appearances were as co-host of the panel discussion show Outnumbered."

      "text": "The Racial Wealth Divide Holds Back Black Earners at All Levels\n\nIt's no secret that there's a vast divide between the economic fortunes of black and white Americans. A new paper by the Equality of Opportunity Project attempts to shine a new light on just how hard that gap is to close. The study looked at the diverging fortunes of black and white men, and boys in particular. It found that even black men with affluent upbringings often fared worse than white men who grew up poorer.\n\nAs a splashy New York Times headline put it, the \" Sons of Rich Black Families Fare No Better Than Sons of Working Class Whites .\" The paper's coverage noted pointedly that \"broad income disparities still exist between black and white men even when they're raised in homes with the same incomes and the same family structure.\"\n\nThis was a striking finding. But if anything, the study, and the Times report on it, failed to demonstrate the true depth of the problem. That's because, as my colleague Antonio Moore has pointed out, the study conflates income (the amount of money one makes) with wealth (the value of the assets one owns).\n\nAs those who study racial wealth inequality understand, the racial wealth divide occurs at every income level. Whites at the lowest income quintile (earning less than $18,420) have a median wealth of $3,000, while blacks and Latinos have a median wealth of $0, according to the 2014 Survey of Income and Program Participation.\n\nThis wealth divide carries all the way up to people in the highest income quintile (those making over $104,508 in annual income). In this high-income category, white median wealth is about $444,500, compared to $137,000 and $185,000, respectively, for Latinos and blacks.\n\nAstonishingly, the New York Times and the Equality of Opportunity project report - written by leading researchers from Harvard, Stanford and the U.S. Census Bureau - repeatedly refer to high-income families as \"wealthy.\" But having a high income isn't the same as having a lot of wealth.\n\nThey imply that the black families and white families who see such different economic results in their children came from similar wealth backgrounds. But this is never actually demonstrated.\n\nWhen you factor in racial wealth inequality, you quickly understand why white boys coming from the highest income families are twice as likely to remain high income as black boys coming from the highest income families. Thanks to generations of inequality, as my coauthors and I relayed in a study for the Institute for Policy Studies and Prosperity Now , white households in the highest 20 percent of income earners have 2.4 times the wealth of African American households in the same percentile.\n\nAs research is increasingly showing us, wealth is a much stronger indicator of economic security and stability than income - and almost any other factor. Wealth means assets beyond income alone, which can support families through their ups and downs.\n\nUnfortunately, the Times and the report authors appear to ignore the racial wealth divide and instead dive into other factors that historically are used to explain racial economic inequality, such as marriage rates, the presence of black fathers, etc.\n\nI believe if these researchers had looked more seriously at racial wealth inequality, they would find that lower marriage rates are much more a result of the asset poverty found in the black community than its cause.\n\nThe study and its coverage may also suggest to some that racial economic inequality is driven solely by lower incomes among black men. But this reading leaves out black and Latino women, who also face large gaps when compared to both white men and white women.\n\nInterestingly, as researcher Mariko Chang shows , African American men and women are remarkably equitable in terms of income and wealth when compared to white men and white women, as are Latinos. It is primarily among the most economically well off demographic groups where we see substantive income and wealth differences between men and women.\n\nThere's still much in the 100-plus-page Equality of Opportunity Center report that can contribute to a better understanding of racial economic inequality. But one cannot understand racial inequality without a focus on the racial wealth divide.\n\nBlacks were imported to the United States as wealth for whites. So African Americans have been at the very foundation of wealth development in the United States from the beginning - but they have also been disproportionately excluded from investments in wealth building.\n\nWe as a nation will never get past our long, painful history of racial inequality without bridging that wealth divide."

Approximately 140 officers were injured that day.\"\n\nThe Bulwark's Tim Miller commented : \"This NABJ interview is a great example of why the people who demand that we deplatform Trump are wrong.

The segment moved to a clip of a health report highlighting the disparities among minorities in comparison to whites.\n\n\"It's hard enough to get mental health treatment in the U.S., but studies show racial and ethnic minorities are least likely to receive mental health treatment than whites,\" the reporter explained. \"Black and Hispanic children are less likely to get mental health care than white kids and studies show that irritability in the average white teenager is often labeled as depression. That same behavior is more likely to be seen as disruptiveness in Black and Latino children. Doctors say that can lead to feelings of hopelessness at an early age.\"\n\nSumming up the report, Noah noted, \"One of the reasons many Black people don't get the proper treatment is misdiagnosis. What is seen as depression in white people can be seen as disruptive behavior in Black people.\"\n\nAnother issue centers on the lacking number of Black psychologists across the United States. Per the report, \"Today, only 4% of psychologists are Black,\"\n\nNoah went on to note Black Americans' most common methods of self-help. Although churches are the most common form of support, the late-night host noted that churches aren't always the most effective options for support. From a religious perspective, there are many times when discussions of mental health have been shamed in the Black community.\n\nThe segment shifted to a comical perspective of the challenges Black Americans face in churches.

      "text": "Divided Loyalties: Feminism in the Black Community\n\nOn October 16, 1995, as the Million Man March in Washington, D.C., concluded, I participated in a panel discussion featuring, among others, feminist theorist bell hooks. Hooks had taken a sharply critical view of the march in a number of public appearances and writings in the weeks leading up to the event, but I was unprepared for the virulent hostility she expressed that day. The march, she declared, was a \"celebration of fascist patriarchy,\" and that was that.In retrospect, I think hooks' combativeness was provoked by the intense criticism she had already endured from black activists for opposing the march. African-Americans across the political spectrum had embraced the event, and the few that dared to dissent publicly--including other prominent black feminists such as Angela Davis, Michele Wallace, Pearle Cleage, Kimberl Crenshaw, Barbara Ransby and Julianne Malveaux -- were bitterly ostracized for undermining black unity. Malveaux, an economist, columnist and radio commentator, wasn't just subject to verbal attacks. \"My car was vandalized several times after I made some negative remarks about the Nation of Islam and [Minister Louis] Farrakhan,\" she recalls. \"And for a while my phone calls were dominated by black men shouting personal insults.\"While feminism has never been very popular in the African-American community, its stock sank even lower in the wake of the march. \"Ideological principle obliged us to oppose what was the largest demonstration by African-Americans ever in this country,\" Malveaux notes wryly. \"It's one of those ironies of history.\"Black feminists have long been considered aliens in the black community. In addition to the challenge they pose to patriarchal religious traditions and institutions, they are seen by many blacks as more attuned to the interests of white women than to the struggle for black empowerment. As far as many political activists are concerned, feminism is an impediment to the more important struggle against racism; the role of black women is to aid and comfort black men as they fight white oppression.In her 1980 book, Black Macho and the Myth of the Superwoman , Michele Wallace aired some of the black liberation movement's dirty laundry, frankly detailing the sexism she encountered within the ranks of activists. She wrote of sexual coercion, flagrant exploitation of labor and physical brutality, all committed \"in the name of the black revolution.\"Wallace's caustic expose, one of the seminal texts of modern black feminism, inspired a number of black feminists to deal more forthrightly with issues of gender discrimination within the black community. Academics Patricia Hill Collins, Paula Giddings, Hazel Carby and hooks, and popular writers Alice Walker, Ntozake Shange and Audre Lorde forcefully defended feminism as a liberating force in the black community, unleashing the potential of black women long imprisoned within the double walls of racism and sexism. They argued it would help counter the corroding excesses of what was a brutal patriarchy for far too many African-American women. Although black men share few of the fruits of society, they do benefit from some perquisites of patriarchal culture; thus, black feminists contend, those privileges have assumed an exaggerated significance at the expense of black women.At the same time, however, black feminists have felt some pressure to differentiate themselves from mainstream white feminism and even to soften their tone. Feminist arguments often sound shrill and coldly intellectual when compared to the warm religious undertones and communitarian imagery of black nationalism. It is just this contrast that led Alice Walker to coin the word \"womanism.\" In contrast to the decadent connotations many blacks associate with the word feminism, Walker and other writers, such as Gayle Jones and Gloria Naylor, present womanism as more holistic, nurturing and concerned about the entire community. Womanists differentiate themselves from feminists by stressing organic connections to a related freedom struggle in the black community and by moderating the feminist critique of the nuclear family.One of the most sensitive issues facing black feminists is how to engage issues of sexual abuse and discrimination without merely adding to the demonization of black men in American society. For example, many blacks condemned Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning epistolary novel, The Color Purple , for portraying black men so negatively.\"Feminist strategists seem to be especially enamored of African-American women writers who present Africana life though the favored feminist black-male-as-brute, black-woman-as-lesbian characterization,\" wrote Brenda Verner, the leader of a movement called Africana Womanism, in a 1995 critique of black feminism syndicated to black newspapers across the country. Verner is particularly contemptuous of black women who head feminist organizations. \"These groups use the technique of choosing a black woman as leader to convince the public that their organization is nonracist,\" she said in a later interview. \"And then they get black leaders to advise Africana women to support and promote do-it-yourself genocide through the mass abortion of black babies or join them in their fight for the latest issue on the feminist political or social agenda.\"Although most blacks who oppose feminist ideas do so less for ideological than for cultural reasons, Verner's views resonate among many nationalists and other activists. And she's far from alone in arguing that denunciations of patriarchal values are out of place in communities where unwed mothers and their children make up the bulk of the population. \"These black feminists are criticizing exactly what most black women in many of our communities want: strong men,\" says Robert Starks, a professor of political science at Northeastern Illinois University's Center for Inner City Studies and a longtime advocate in Chicago's black community. \"In the Robert Taylor Homes, for example, nearly 90 percent of the apartments are occupied by poor single women and their children. They desperately want patriarchy.\"Black feminist theorists counter that public policy designed to punish single mothers for their poverty, rather than help them escape it, is the primary reason for the wretched conditions of many low-income communities. Many feminist theorists lean to the political left and generally urge more government intervention in the areas of employment and vocational training. If more black men and women had jobs, they argue, there would be far fewer single-parent families.As vital as these issues are, the negative perception of black feminists has hampered their efforts to bring their message to the larger black community. In a large-scale study of black political attitudes completed in 1994, Michael Dawson, director of the University of Chicago Center for the Study of Race, Politics and Culture, found that nearly one-third of the African-Americans surveyed thought black feminism was dangerous to the black community.Dawson bemoans the black community's reluctance to come to grips with gender issues. \"Black unity is not possible without the black community squarely addressing these issues and listening to voices that have too often been silenced,\" Dawson says. He is pessimistic, however, about the possibility of much change in that direction. As white Americans withdraw their support for programs and policies designed to redress the legacy of slavery and racism, blacks will likely continue to circle the wagons. \"In such an embattled atmosphere, racial solidarity--not gender equality--is considered the primary value,\" he says.Black feminists identify black nationalism as the major source of opposition to their ideas. While they understand the acute identity crisis afflicting the descendants of enslaved Africans, they reject the answers that black nationalism offers. \"Rather than seeing the development of multiple black subjectivity as a positive intervention within white supremacist capitalist patriarchy,\" hooks writes in Killing Rage, Ending Racism , many black folks attempt to establish \"identity politics ... rooted in a vision of separatism.\"Hooks criticizes nationalism as an appeal for a \"unitary representation of blackness,\" emphasizing \"notions of authenticity that uphold a vision of patriarchal family life and nationhood as the only possible structure wherein the crisis in black identity can be resolved.\" By excluding women, the Million Man March reflected this view of nationalism.Barbara Ransby, too, assails the march and its underlying nationalist message, calling it a \"romanticization of black patriarchy.\" \"Simply reasserting the black male as the natural 'head' of the family will do little to better conditions for all black people,\" she says. Calls for African-Americans to scrutinize themselves as the cause of their problems, rather than examine government and corporate policy, is \"family-values conservatism in blackface\" and a step away from the needed progressive analysis.Although the Million Man March exacerbated the isolation of feminists within the African-American community, it also inspired some black feminists to intensify their struggle. Malveaux sees parallels between her opposition to the march and the stand that black feminists took during the 1991 confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. Thomas was widely supported in the black community, and many African-Americans denounced Anita Hill, who accused Thomas of sexual harassment, for reviving old stereotypes of black men as sexually aggressive. But instead of being intimidated, black feminists entered the fray on Hill's side. More than 1,500 black women signed on as \"African-American Women in Defense of Ourselves\" in an ad that ran in the New York Times and elsewhere. In the wake of the Million Man March, black feminists are fearlessly steering their own course. \"We are pretty much out of style in these post-march days,\" Ransby says. \"But we'll be back, once the bankruptcy of this new black activism is revealed as the conservatism it really is.\"Ransby is part of a larger group of black intellectuals and organizers now mobilizing around progressive issues, including feminism. Her Chicago-based group, the Ida B. Wells Forum (named for the prominent 19th-century black anti-lynching advocate), is attempting to provide an alternative to the black nationalist ideas currently dominating the racial discourse. Manning Marable, prolific author and director of Columbia University's Institute for Research in African-American Studies, is gathering like minds in a New York-based group, coincidentally named the Ida B. Wells-Barnett/W.E.B. DuBois Network. Smaller, less celebrated collectives are sprouting up elsewhere to challenge nationalist hegemony.Black feminists are not simply marking time waiting for the political pendulum to swing back toward a progressive agenda. \"The patriarchal fantasies of resurgent black nationalism are a good target,\" Malveaux says, \"and I'm going to spend more time trying to hit it.\""

      "text": "White America Is Oblivious to the Truth About Black Poverty\n\nThere's been a fascinating debate over the past few weeks between Ta-Nehisi Coates from the Atlantic and New York magazine's Jonathan Chait regarding the language President Obama employs in addressing African-American communities. Obama's been criticized by Coates and other supporters for using rhetoric that reinforces the belief shared by many on the right, that personal initiative and hard work is sufficient to overcome the obstacles confronting many young black men despite the continued existence of institutional racism in education, employment, healthcare, criminal justice and civic participation (to name a few).\n\nChait replied with, \"I agree that racial discrimination persists, but I don't believe this fact abnegates the possibility that a culture of poverty exists as well.\" Chait believes President Obama is uniquely suited to speak to black people about changing self-destructive behavior:\n\nBut Coates is committing a fallacy by assuming that Obama's exhortations to the black community amount to a belief that personal responsibility accounts for a major share of the blame. A person worries about the things that he can control. ....Obama's habit of speaking about this issue primarily to black audiences is Obama seizing upon his role as the most famous and admired African American in the world to urge positive habits and behavior.\n\nIn the most recent volley of exchanges, Chait takes Coates to task for ascribing views to him he does not hold. The column is titled: Ta-Nehisi Coates Disagrees With 'Jonathan Chait,' and So Do I . Chait states clearly he does not equate black culture with a \"culture of poverty\" as do Bill O'Reilly and many on the right, but he does see a link between persistent poverty and culture.\n\nSo let me explain what I do think. The culture of poverty is not solely or even primarily a black problem. It is a problem arising from concentrated poverty, and - as a result of both historic and ongoing racism - concentrated poverty disproportionately afflicts African-American communities. Obama understands that he commands prestige that can make him an inspirational figure in say, poor black neighborhoods in Chicago that he lacks in, say, poor white towns in West Virginia. As I've said, I understand Coates' practical objections to this tactic.\n\nThe reaction I've seen online to this debate suggests a lot of readers on both sides investing a great deal of broader meanings into it - identity, authenticity, yet another endless iteration of the meta question of How We Talk About Race. I have no interest in playing a role in that drama. What interests me is a real and vital public-policy debate over the relationship between culture and poverty.\n\nIn Chait's view, understanding the relationship between culture and poverty is essential to developing effective anti-poverty programs. He seems to view Coates' negation of this relationship as an example of aggressive misreading of his intentions and that of other white liberals rooted in racial hostility. Ultimately, he complains Coates negates the steady progress of U.S. race relations and the steady improvement in conditions and circumstances for the majority of African Americans.\n\nCoates and I disagree about racial progress in America. Coates sees the Americas' racial history as a story of continuity of white supremacy. I see the sequence (I'd call it a progression, but that term would load the argument in my favor) that began with chattel slavery and has led to the Obama administration as a story of halting, painful, non-continuous, but clear improvement. Coates associates himself with a quote from Malcolm X: \"You don't stick a knife in a man's back nine inches, and then pull it out six inches and say you're making progress.\"\n\nThe analogy defines out of existence the very possibility of steady progress. People who subscribe to this way of thinking won't agree with measures that reduce but fail to eliminate racial discrimination, or those that reduce but fail to eliminate poverty, or reduce but fail to eliminate medical deprivation.\n\nJonathan Chait is right about one thing-this is an ongoing and somewhat circular debate of limited utility, at least within the present frame. There are valid arguments to be made that persistent poverty leads to persistent deficits that impact health, well-being and lifestyle in ways that can continue across generations, yet the percentage of poor people who generally fall into this category is fairly small.\n\nThe majority of those classified as poor in the U.S. are people who work but don't make enough money to support themselves or their children, or they are people who have worked in the past but now find themselves permanently excluded from the workforce. The oft-cited statistic of female-headed households living in poverty-31%-is as much a result of the economic disadvantage women still face in the workforce and lack of affordable childcare as it is a reflection of their poor life choices. The \"culture of poverty\" can't be used to explain why 25% of Hispanics are living in poverty, despite exhibiting the work ethic and family cohesion associated by whites with \"middle-class\" success. And yet conservatives and liberals alike continue to focus on the subset of people who are the \"persistently poor\" as representative of the whole.\n\nSo who are these people? Contrary to Paul Ryan's admittedly inarticulate assertion, the locus of persistent poverty is not in our \"inner cities.\" The large majority-85.3%-of persistent-poverty counties are nonmetropolitan. Persistent poverty also demonstrates a strong regional pattern, with nearly 84% of persistent-poverty counties in the South comprising more than one-fifth of all counties in the region. Whether black, white or indigenous, the majority of poor Americans live in rural communities away from large cities. Most live in the southern region, in states whose leaders are committed to cutting assistance for the poor, keeping wages low, denying access to healthcare and empowering corporate extraction of natural resources. These facts are not new; they are consistent with trends that have endured for well over a century.\n\nI agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates. Conservatives and liberals alike prefer to focus on perceived deficits in black and brown people than on structural racism and the concepts of white supremacy that undergird it as the principal reasons for disparate conditions and outcomes for many blacks and Hispanics. White privilege means not having to think about the many ways the lives of those who are classified as white are enhanced and protected by the subjugation and exclusion of racial minorities. White privilege provides white ethnics escape from the stigma of poverty. As historian Nell Irvin Painter aptly distinguishes, \"Not all black people are poor, but among the people in America defined by race, black people tend to be the poorest.\"\n\nSimilarly, the link between poverty and criminality is dubious at best. The vast majority of poor people do not engage in criminal activity despite our tendency to label more and more things crimes. Lack of opportunity breeds disillusionment, which leads to disorder, a conclusion reached more than four decades ago by the Kerner Commission charged with investigating the causes of urban rebellions in the summer of 1967:\n\nAlthough Negro men worked as hard as the immigrants, they were unable to support their families. The entrepreneurial opportunities had vanished. As a result of slavery and long periods of unemployment, the Negro family structure had become matriarchal; the males played a secondary and marginal family role-one which offered little compensation for their hard and unrewarding labor. Above all, segregation denied Negroes access to good jobs and the opportunity to leave the ghetto. For them, the future seemed to lead only to a dead end.\n\nToday, whites tend to exaggerate how well and quickly they escaped from poverty. The fact is that immigrants who came from rural backgrounds, as many Negroes do, are only now, after three generations, finally beginning to move into the middle class.\n\nBy contrast, Negroes began concentrating in the city less than two generations ago, and under much less favorable conditions. Although some Negroes have escaped poverty, few have been able to escape the urban ghetto. Pervasive unemployment and underemployment are the most persistent and serious grievances in minority areas. They are inextricably linked to the problem of civil disorder.\n\nWhat white Americans have never fully understood but what the Negro can never forget-is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\n\nTherein lies the essential dilemma beneath this debate. What should be the focus of attention and reform efforts: changing the behavior of people trapped in cycles of poverty and marginalization, or changing the economic, social and political institutions that sustain the racial and economic status quo? The bootstrap approach advocated by President Obama and majority of the elite community seems to accept the intractable nature of white privilege and keeps the burden on poor communities of color to continuing absorbing the harms of institutional racism while white Americans continue the slow work of transforming their racial attitudes.\n\nWhat Chait's liberal analysis of American racism fails to acknowledge is racism was created to achieve an economic purpose. Anglo-Americans didn't start out as racists, they became racists in order to justify their chosen economic system, which relied on the exploitation of enslaved black labor. The principal motive for racism was and still is, profit.\n\nOne of the many things that infuriates black people, at least it does me, is the obliviousness of white Americans to the ways they project onto black people the pathological and violent behavior they have engaged in and seem to have collectively whitewashed from their memories. In the almost 400 years that African people have been in this country we've been subjected to continuous murder, rape, brutality, dehumanization and mob terror at the hands of whites (lynching ended a century ago only to be replaced by extra-judicial police killings) and yet the contemporary narrative is that whites are justified in their fear of blacks, especially black men. Seriously? Modern policing is based on this premise-one that whites rarely question and have trouble understanding as a source of black rage.\n\nOn the subject of pathology, there is a huge disparity between what white America did and what it remembers it did. Here's a quick refresher that we can't forget and you must remember:\n\nI don't know any instances in American history where thousands of black people gathered to watch the ritualistic killing of a white person as spectator sport.\n\nLest you say, those are isolated events from the past and the majority of white people are not like that anymore, I call your attention to a recent report demonstrating a substantial gap in support for the death penalty, with whites much more in favor than blacks or Hispanics. According to a recent Pew Research poll overall support for the death penalty is 55%. Among whites, however, support for the death penalty jumps to 63%, compared to 40% for Hispanics and 36% for blacks. Slate's Jamelle Bouie argues persuasively that white support for the death penalty is rooted in its history as a tool for whites to control and protect themselves from blacks. He connects the past to the present with the results of another recent study:\n\nIn 2007, two researchers tried to gauge racial differences on capital punishment and assess how blacks and whites responded to arguments against the practice. Their core findings with black Americans weren't a surprise-in general, blacks were receptive to any argument against the death penalty.\n\nTheir findings with whites, on the other hand, were disturbing. Not only were whites immune to persuasion on the death penalty, but when researchers told them of the racial disparity-that blacks faced unfair treatment-many increased their support.\n\nWhite privilege permits people to ignore the reflection of their own pathologies in others."

      "text": "Ye's antisemitism: Nothing to do with the Black community, straight from the white supremacist playbook\n\nAntisemitism dominates the news. But the media isn't focused on rising hate crimes , a study on antisemitism in hiring or a presidential candidate and former president dining with a Holocaust denier .\n\nAntisemitism is only dominating the news because Kanye West is saying blatantly antisemitic things over and over again. (Really he's just saying the quiet part out loud for most Republicans).\n\nSure West, or Ye, is a celebrity being outrageous (though so is Mel Gibson) but the real reason his antisemitism gets more coverage than antisemitic violent incidents is that it can be used to fuel racism and divide the Black and Jewish communities (of course, also erasing the existence of Black Jews). This only serves white supremacy.\n\nThere is a narrative in the US that antisemitism is higher in the Black community than in the white. People often point to Louis Farrakhan and the National of Islam. The media sees Farrakhan as a prominent figure on the left but ignores that he doesn't just peddle antisemitism but also homophobia , transphobia, sexism and he criticized Barack Obama for being too close to the Jewish community. Farrakhan has appeared on Alex Jones . He has praised Donald Trump.\n\nThe media needs to stop pretending this is a liberal movement and demanding the left answer for Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. Additionally, as John Blake explains, while Farrakhan has always been a controversial figure, what support he does have in the Black community is often in spite of his antisemitism - not because of it.\n\nThere was the controversy a few years ago about Women's March members not condemning Farrakhan, but honestly, his homophobia and transphobia should be as appalling to someone wanting to be the leader of a feminist movement. The March did eventually replace these leaders (as well as the controversy dominating news coverage because it once involved Black people and WOC).\n\nWhile Farrakhan's antisemitism and false claims about Jews controlling the slave trade have permeated culture ( Kyrie Irving recently shared an antisemitic movie on the subject), the popularity of the Nation of Islam has significantly waned in recent years.\n\nMany prominent Black people have condemned him, such as US Rep. Barbara Lee and Muhammad Ali , and other Black Muslims denounced Farrakhan back in 1984. However, while I am very appreciative when Black people denounce antisemitism generally and Farrakhan specifically, demanding they do so reeks of racism.\n\nDo you ask every white person about David Duke? Stop giving this man airtime and bringing his name up to use against Black people.\n\nThere's some evidence that antisemitic sentiment is a little more common in the Black community than the white, though it has lessened since the 1990s . There is also evidence to suggest that Black people are significantly more likely to agree that Jewish people face discrimination. Based on my experience, some Black people might repeat an antisemitic trope not realizing that it's harmful, but are much more open to learning than white people are. Many in the Black community have also spoken out against Kanye West, eager to stand with the Jewish community and show solidarity.\n\nSo is the Black community really more antisemitic or are these surveys not asking the right questions? Even worse, is the prevalence of some antisemitic tropes in the Black community in large part due to the outsized focus of the media on portraying Black people as antisemitic and encouraging rifts between our communities?\n\nNot to mention, and I cannot stress this enough, there are Black Jews. We aren't truly separate communities. To that end, Jewish spaces need to ensure they're welcoming to Black Jews and Jews of color. White Jews also need to make sure they never-ever ask a Black Jew to condemn Farrakhan or West. These men hurt Black Jews, too.\n\nWest repeats antisemitic tropes common among so-called Black Hebrew Israelites (they are a radical fringe group not to be confused with Black Jews), Farrakhan and run-of-the-mill white supremacists.\n\nThere's a lot of crossover in how these groups talk about Jews. It's hard to tease out sometimes. While antisemitic tropes about Jews and the slave trade, or Jews controlling Hollywood, might exist in the Black community and historical Black movements, Holocaust denial and Hitler praise are common only in white supremacist movements.\n\nIn the past few years Kanye West has spent time with Trump, Alex Jones and Nick Fuentes , a white nationalist Holocaust denier. West's antisemitism has nothing to do with the Black community. It's straight from the white supremacist playbook.\n\nWhile many Black people condemn West, radical white nationalists embrace him. West perpetuates ideology and politics that are just as harmful to Black people as they are to Jews. It makes no sense for the media to hold him up as a representative of the Black community.\n\nMany of the statements West made are vile and harmful. But if people really cared about antisemitism, they would be more concerned about men traveling to New York to attack synagogues .\n\nThe recently published survey showing that one in four hiring managers exhibit antisemitism in their hiring practices would have gotten much more attention. Supersessionist Christian cooptation of Jewish holidays would be a big news story. The GOP's constant invocation of dual loyalty tropes against American Jews would be rightfully reported as antisemitism.\n\nBut no.\n\nA rapper's antisemitic rantings get the most attention.\n\nI could talk about the history of cooperation between Black people and Jews in the US, but that history isn't really the point.\n\nWhite Jews must face racism in their communities same as Black people must fight strains of antisemitism in theirs.\n\nWhatever our shared history, good and bad, we must see that it serves white supremacy to divide us and encourage tension.\n\nJewish liberation will never come through racism. We cannot fight antisemitism by allowing the media to throw Black people away.\n\nThe threat is rising white nationalism.\n\nWe must fight that threat together."

These woods was our playgrounds.\"\n\nLong dirt roads were once occupied by a bustling community that had its own bartering system and a lucrative oyster industry.\n\n\"There were at one point over a thousand people living on this island,\" Robinson said.

(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)\n\nHistoric Black communities like Daufuskie Island are dying, and descendants like Robinson are attempting to salvage what's left of a quickly fading history.\n\n\"The towns are the authentic source or sources of much of our culture, our history, our physical expression of place,\" said Everett Fly, a landscape architect who uncovered more than 1,800 Black historic settlements through his research.\n\nScholars define a historic Black community or town as a settlement founded by formerly enslaved people, usually between the late 19th- and early 20th-century. The enclaves often had their own churches, schools, stores and economic systems.\n\nFly and other researchers estimate there are fewer than 30 incorporated historic Black towns left in the United States, a fraction of more than 1,200 at the peak between the 1880s and 1915.\n\n\"The ones that do remain are extremely rare. They're extremely important,\" Fly said.\n\nThe eradication of these neighborhoods can be traced back to their creation when white supremacists terrorized Black people, destroying whole blocks of homes and businesses or driving them out of town, as seen with the Tulsa Race Massacre in 1921 and the Rosewood, Florida, massacre in 1923.\n\nBut in more recent times, the dwindling of Black strongholds is due in part to the culmination of amended ordinances, uneven tax rates, home devaluations, and political challenges that leave communities vulnerable to developers and rampant gentrification.\n\nSallie Ann Robinson, of Daufuskie Island, S.C., looks into the kitchen of her childhood home, Wednesday, Sept. 13, 2023, in Daufuskie Island, S.C. \"I was born in this very house, as many generations of family have been as well,\" said Robinson, a chef and tour guide.

(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)\n\nThe governing Beaufort County council blocked a golf course on Gullah-Geechee land after the developer, Elvio Tropeano, requested to remove the 503-acre (204-hectare) plot from a zoning district on the island. The zoning district bans gated communities and resorts in locations considered culturally significant. Tropeano has since filed two legal actions against the county to appeal the decision, and is now considering building homes on the property.\n\nA local group, Community Coalition Action Network, supports the plan to build a golf course on the unoccupied land. Co-founder Tade' Oyeilumi said she was originally against it; then she went to a listening session.\n\n\"When I heard Mr. Tropeano speak about the development and what he wanted to do with the development, the purpose of the development and how that was going to contribute to the community that we live in, I was blown away,\" Oyeilumi said.\n\nShe fears the housing plan that the developer is now considering will instead have jarring results.\n\nSeretha Tuttle-Wynn stands on the steps of the Coffin Point Community Praise House on Tuesday, Sept. 19, 2023, in St. Helena Island, S.C.

The golf course, on the other hand, minimizes that,\" Oyeilumi said.\n\nResidents of Hogg Hummock, a tiny Gullah-Geechee community on Sapelo Island in Georgia, filed a lawsuit in October to halt a zoning law they say will raise taxes, forcing them to sell their homes. McIntosh County commissioners voted in September to double the size of houses allowed in the community, also known as Hog Hammock - a move locals believe will draw in wealthy outsiders who want to build vacation getaways. Only a few dozen Black residents still live in the enclave of modest homes along dirt roads.\n\n\"My ancestors were forced to work on that land, and then they fought for the right to have that land,\" said 23-year-old Keara Skates, a descendant who spent her last birthday speaking against the zoning law alongside state legislators in Atlanta, the state capital. \"Sapelo Island has historically never seen the level of growth that's being proposed. Where does that leave the descendants?\"\n\nMcIntosh County Commission Chairman David Stevens said the community's landscape is changing because some native owners have sold their property.\n\n\"I don't need anybody to lecture me on the culture of Sapelo Island,\" Stevens said, adding: \"If you don't want these outsiders, if you don't want these new homes being built ... don't sell your land.\"\n\nBarber Glenn Paige, 69, displays an old family photograph showing his father, left, and mother enjoying a band at Club Eaton, which opened during segregation and in its heyday became a venue for the country's most celebrated Black musicians, as Paige waits for his next client at Blessed by the Best barbershop in Eatonville, Fla., Thursday, Aug. 24, 2023.

(AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)\n\nResearch by Brookings Institution fellow Andre Perry finds that homes in majority Black neighborhoods are appraised at significantly lower values than homes in neighborhoods where Black people are the minority. Perry says that developers can buy these homes at lower costs and sell them for a much higher price.\n\n\"A lot of people will call that a major tool of gentrification,\" said Perry. \"The people who live in those areas may be priced out ultimately, and then the companies or individuals who purchase those properties get profit as a result.\"\n\nAttorney Rukaiyah Adams runs a nonprofit called \"Rebuild Albina\" based in Portland, Oregon. The organization aims to educate, invest and restore homeownership to Black people in an area that used to be a thriving Black neighborhood.\n\n\"We cannot continue to extract and exploit to the breaking point,\" said Adams. \"We're trying to create a new model for what that might look like, how we might live together.\"\n\nIn Florida, one of the first incorporated self-governing Black municipalities in the U.S. was Eatonville, established in 1887. Located just 24 miles (39 kilometers) north of Disney World, the key challenge for present-day residents is the Orange County Public School Board, which owns 100 acres (40 hectares) of property in the middle of town.\n\nBarber Glenn Paige, right, who grew up in neighboring Winter Park, Fla. and chose to open his business in Eatonville, rubs shaving cream onto client Pastor Walter Harris, Thursday, Aug. 24, 2023, as he prepares him for a shave at Blessed by the Best barbershop in Eatonville, Fla.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nFILE - National Urban League president and CEO Marc Morial speaks at the National Urban League Annual Conference, July 22, 2022, in Washington. Black Americans have endured considerable injustices and barriers to prosperity and equality throughout U.S. history. But their social, economic and political advances in the past 60 years have been unsatisfactory. That's according to a new annual study on racial progress, called the \"State of Black America.\" (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Black Americans have endured considerable injustices and barriers to prosperity and equality throughout U.S. history. But their social, economic and political advances in the 60 years since the enactment of major civil rights legislation have been unsatisfactory, according to a new annual study on racial progress.\n\nThe \" State of Black America \" report by the National Urban League, which has compiled research and analysis on the status of Black Americans in the U.S. for decades, cites legal challenges to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and backlash to efforts meant to advance racial progress such as affirmative action and diversity, equity and inclusion policies for decelerating progress.\n\n\"Doors have been opened in higher education, government and the private sector in that sixty year period. That's important. Every measure shows progress,\" National Urban League President Marc Morial said, in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the report's release Friday.\n\n\"But I would have thought we would have been much further along than we are in 2024 with respect to achieving a sense of parity in America,\" Morial said.\n\nIn an AP interview, National Urban League president Marc Morial says there was a big push to promote equality after the 2020 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, but now opponents are putting up new barriers.\n\nDespite significant economic advancement over several decades, the report also highlights numerous barriers to economic advancement. The result, the report's authors write, is persistent economic and political disparities. The racial income gap has been virtually unchanged for more than 20 years, with Black Americans making on average 64% of the income of white people, the report notes.\n\nSimilarly, the study highlighted barriers in opportunity. For instance, Black students are still more likely than their white counterparts to have uncertified and inexperienced teachers. At the same time, the number of Black students dropping out of primary education has decreased from 13.1% in 2000 to 3.9% in 2024.\n\nThe view of Black civic participation is also mixed. While the percentage of Black Americans registered to vote stood at 69% in 2020 compared to 64% in 2000, the percentage of Black people who voted in 2022 stood at 42.3%, a drop from 54% who cast ballots in 2002.\n\nAt the current pace, it would take anywhere from one to three centuries for most Black Americans to achieve parity with their white peers, depending on their region of the country, according to a February study by the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility.\n\nAnd while major institutions, including top corporations, governments and media have increased the number of Black leaders in their ranks, such efforts are being limited as diversity and inclusion initiatives face court challenges, public backlash from conservative activists and restrictions by some state and local Republican lawmakers.\n\n\"Notwithstanding the effort to move forward, there's always been a movement of resistance to that progress and that resistance has played a role in decelerating the progress that we need to make on the journey to parity. We see it being played out right now, \" Morial said in reference to issues such as political gerrymandering, book-banning in schools and attacks on diversity policies.\n\nMorial pointed to the current U.S. Supreme Court, which he said \"has demonstrated a hostility to the tools necessary to correct the long history of racial discrimination.'\n\nThe Urban League's study also evaluates President Joe Biden's performance in office and finds his administration's efforts fall short of promises made to Black Americans, even as the president faces significant opposition from Republican lawmakers and some in his own party.\n\nThe report, however, broadly approves of Biden's policy agenda. A record-low Black unemployment rate, as well as efforts to expand health-care access and affordable housing for Black Americans are signs of progress, the authors wrote.\n\nStill, the \"political opposition\" that blocked the enactment of policies considered top priorities by Black Americans, such as voting rights and policing reform, are major letdowns.\n\n\"We are in a world of deep attack by an ideological extreme that wants to erase so much of the civil-rights movement,\" said Maya Wiley, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and co-author of the study.\n\nKristen Clarke, assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Justice Department, said federal watchdogs are ready to ensure the nation's civil rights laws are being followed.\n\n\"We've been working across the country to reach underserved communities so that we understand the problems that communities face,\" Clarke said in an interview with the AP. \"Our country thrives when everyone has a voice in our democracy and we remain vigilant and work to counter voting discrimination and voter suppression wherever it rears its ugly head.\"\n\nOn the eve of the Bloody Sunday anniversary events commemorating voting rights marches in Selma, Alabama this weekend, Morial called on federal officials to increase their efforts to protect civil rights and to better support sociopolitical advances in the Black community.\n\n\"This moment is a reminder about our obligation to confront voter suppression and continuing threats that we see when it comes to access to the ballot box,\" he said.\n\n____\n\nMatt Brown is a member of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

(AP) - A Louisiana landscape of centuries-old sugar cane plantations and enduring Afro-Creole culture along the Mississippi River had been eligible for receiving rare federal protection following a multi-year review by the National Park Service.\n\nBut this month, the agency withdrew the 11-mile (18-kilometer) stretch of land known as Great River Road from consideration for National Historic Landmark designation at the request of state officials, who celebrated the move as a win for economic development.\n\nCommunity organizations bemoaned the decision as undermining efforts to preserve the rich yet endangered cultural legacies of free African American communities that grew out of slavery.\n\nThe region, in the heart of Louisiana's heavily industrialized Chemical Corridor in St. John the Baptist Parish, has been at the center of conflicts between grassroots community groups challenging the expansion of polluting industrial facilities and officials and business leaders doubling down on their importance for sustaining local economies. The area is among the most threatened by climate injustice in the nation, according to the Environmental Defense Fund's climate vulnerability index.\n\nAshley Rogers, executive director of the nearby Whitney Plantation, said the decision to remove the Great River Road region from consideration for federally granted recognition was due to the \"changing priorities\" of the Trump administration, the latest blow to \"a culture under attack.\"\n\n\"It's 100% because of the politics of the current administration, it's not because we've suddenly decided that this place doesn't matter,\" Rogers said.\n\nA multi-year National Park Service study on the area completed in October concluded that the \"exceptional integrity\" of the Great River Road landscape conveys \"the feeling of living and working in the plantation system in the American South.\"\n\nPlantation buildings are so well-preserved that director Quentin Tarantino used them while filming \"Django Unchained,\" to capture the antebellum era. But there's also a rich and overlooked history of the enslaved people who worked the plantations, their burial sites likely hidden in the surrounding cane fields and many of their descendants still living in tight-knit communities nearby.\n\nThe study deemed the region eligible to gain the same federal recognition as around 2,600 of the nation's most important historical sites, including Mount Vernon, George Washington's estate and Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's residence.\n\nHowever, the determination was \"premature and untimely\" given that a grain terminal that threatened to impact historic properties was no longer planned, said the National Park Service's Joy Beasley, who oversees the designation of historic landmarks, in a Feb. 13 letter to the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nBeasley's letter stated the reversal was prompted by a request from the state's Department of Environmental Quality, which is tasked with regulating environmental protection and has made no secret of its support for industrial expansion .\n\nThe head of the department, Aurelia S. Giacometto, framed the decision as freeing the region from federal meddling and oversight and opening up pathways for development.\n\n\"I'm grateful that the Trump Administration understands that states and localities are better at determining their interests relating to clean air, water and developing industry than leaving crucial decisions like those to Washington,\" Giacometto said in a statement.\n\nPort of South Louisiana CEO Paul Matthew said in a press release that companies are clamoring to develop and expand along the Mississippi River, which would improve quality of life and spur economic growth without sacrificing cultural legacies.\n\n\"If you really want to lift people out of poverty, you get them work and increase job opportunity,\" Republican Gov. Jeff Landry said.\n\nLocal historical and community organizations believe the region can instead improve its economy by focusing on preserving and promoting its history.\n\nRamshackled homes and shuttered buildings in the area are endemic of longstanding underinvestment in these communities, but it's not too late to reverse this trend through means besides industrialization, said Joy Banner, co-founder of the local nonprofit The Descendants Project, which is restoring historical properties in Great River Road.\n\nBanner helped lead efforts to successfully halt the construction of a towering $600 million industrial grain terminal that would have been built in her hometown, the predominantly Black community of Wallace - spurring the National Park Service's study. A spokesperson for the Army Corps of Engineers said any future industrial development in the Great River Road would still need to consider the potential impacts on historical and cultural heritage.\n\nIn the region's Willow Grove neighborhood, 76-year-old Isabella Poche still trims the grass and repaints the tombs at the cemetery where her mother, sisters and other relatives were buried with help from the Black community's generations-old mutual aid society she now leads. Beyond the furrows of the sugar cane fields where her family once worked, a large plantation home stands in the distance by the river's bank. It's a peaceful place she hopes to see protected.\n\n\"I don't want to move anywhere else,\" Poche said. \"I've been here all my life.\"\n\n___\n\nBrook is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

(AP) - In a century-old family story about a teenage aunt who liked to drive her luxury car down the trolley tracks of Tulsa, Kristi Williams still savors a tiny, lingering taste of how different life could have been for all Black Americans after slavery.\n\nOn Monday, Tulsans commemorated the 100th anniversary of a two-day assault by armed white men on Tulsa's prosperous Black community of Greenwood, known around the country as Black Wall Street, calling attention to an era of deadly mob assaults on Black communities that official history long suppressed.\n\nBut Williams, and other descendants of the freed Black people enslaved by Native American nations who once owned much of the land under Tulsa, say there's another part of Black Wall Street's history that more Americans need to know about.\n\nIt's one that has important lessons for contemporary racial issues in the United States, including the long debated matter of reparations, descendants and historians say.\n\nThat bit of the story: where much of the seed money that made Black Wall Street boom came from.\n\nUnlike Black Americans across the country after slavery, Williams' ancestors and thousands of other Black members of slave-owning Native American nations freed after the war \"had land,\" says Williams, a Tulsa community activist. \"They had opportunity to build a house on that land, farm that land, and they were wealthy with their crops.\"\n\n\"And that was huge - a great opportunity and you're thinking this is going to last for generations to come. I can leave my children this land, and they can leave their children this land,\" recounts Williams, whose ancestor went from enslaved laborer to judge of the Muscogee Creek tribal Supreme Court after slavery.\n\nIn fact, Alaina E. Roberts, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, writes in her book \"I've Been Here All the While: Black Freedom on Native Land,\" the freed slaves of five Native American nations \"became the only people of African descent in the world to receive what might be viewed as reparations for their enslavement on a large scale.\"\n\nWhy that happened in the territory that became Oklahoma, and not the rest of the slaveholding South: The U.S. government enforced stricter terms for reconstruction on the slave-owning American Indian nations that had fully or partially allied with the Confederacy than it had on Southern states.\n\nWhile U.S. officials quickly broke Gen. William T. Sherman's famous Special Field Order No. 15 providing 40 acres for each formerly enslaved family after the Civil War, U.S. treaties compelled five slave-owning tribes - the Choctaws, Chickasaws, Cherokees, Muscogee Creek and Seminoles - to share tribal land and other resources and rights with freed Black people who had been enslaved.\n\nBy 1860, about 14% of the total population of that tribal territory of the future state of Oklahoma were Black people enslaved by tribal members. After the Civil War, the Black tribal Freedmen held millions of acres in common with other tribal members and later in large individual allotments.\n\nThe difference that made is \"incalculable,\" Roberts said in an interview. \"Allotments really gave them an upward mobility that other Black people did not have in most of the United States.\"\n\nThe financial stability allowed Black Native American Freedmen to start businesses, farms and ranches, and helped give rise to Black Wall Street and thriving Black communities in the future state of Oklahoma. The prosperity of those communities - many long since vanished -\"attracted Black African Americans from the South, built them up as a Black mecca,\" Roberts says. Black Wall Street alone had roughly 200 businesses.\n\nMeeting the Black tribal Freedmen in the thriving Black city of Boley in 1905, Booker T. Washington wrote admiringly of a community \"which shall demonstrate the right of the negro, not merely as an individual, but as a race, to have a worthy and permanent place in the civilization that the American people are creating.\"\n\nAnd while some tribes reputedly gave their Black members some of the worst, rockiest, unfarmable land, that was often just where drillers struck oil starting in the first years of the 20th century, before statehood changed Indian Territory to Oklahoma in 1907. For a time it made the area around Tulsa the world's biggest oil producer.\n\nFor Eli Grayson, another descendant of Muscogee Creek Black Freedmen, any history that tries to tell the story of Black Wall Street without telling the story of the Black Indian Freedmen and their land is a flop.\n\n\"They're missing the point of what caused the wealth, the foundation of the wealth,\" Grayson says.\n\nThe oil wealth, besides helping put the bustle and boom in Tulsa's Black-owned Greenwood business district, gave rise to fortunes for a few Freedpeople that made headlines around the United States. That included 11-year-old Sarah Rector, a Muscogee Creek girl hailed as \"the richest colored girl in the world\" by newspapers of the time. Her oil fortune drew attention from Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Dubois, who intervened to check that Rector's white guardian wasn't pillaging her money.\n\nThe wealth from the tribal allotment also gave rise to Williams' family story of great-aunt Janie, \"who learned to drive by going behind the trolley lines\" in Tulsa, with her parents in the car, Williams' uncle, 67-year-old Samuel Morgan, recounted, laughing.\n\n\"It was real fashionable, because it was one of the cars that had four windows that rolled all the way up,\" Morgan said.\n\nLittle of that Black wealth remains today.\n\nIn May 1921, 100 years ago this month, Aunt Janie, then a teenager, had to flee Greenwood's Dreamland movie theater as the white mob burned Black Wall Street to the ground, killing scores or hundreds - no one knows - and leaving Greenwood an empty ruin populated by charred corpses.\n\nBlack Freedmen and many other American Indian citizens rapidly lost land and money to unscrupulous or careless white guardians that were imposed upon them, to property taxes, white scams, accidents, racist policies and laws, business mistakes or bad luck. For Aunt Janie, all the family knows today is a vague tale of the oil wells on her land catching fire.\n\nWilliams, Grayson and other Black Indian Freedmen descendants today drive past the spots in Tulsa that family history says used to belong to them: 51st Street. The grounds of Oral Roberts University. Mingo Park.\n\nThat's yet another lesson Tulsa's Greenwood has for the rest of the United States, says William A. Darity Jr., a leading scholar and writer on reparations at Duke University.\n\nIf freed Black people had gotten reparations after the Civil War, Darity said, assaults like the Tulsa Race Massacre show they would have needed years of U.S. troop deployments to protect them - given the angry resentment of white people at seeing money in Black hands.\n\n___\n\nFind AP's full coverage of the centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre: https://apnews.com/hub/tulsa-race-massacre\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP) - As the dust settled after the deadly collapse of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, as the initial shock wore off and the breaking news coverage subsided, residents of this tiny peninsula found themselves facing an uncertain future.\n\nMany had spent decades living in the shadow of the Key Bridge, an iconic landmark that placed the community of Turner Station firmly on the map. For their working-class, historically Black neighborhood, it was a lifeline to the outside world, a source of both pride and convenience.\n\nWithin seconds, it was gone. Six construction workers died after a massive container ship lost power and veered off course, striking one of the bridge's support piers in the overnight darkness of March 26.\n\nTurner Station was already struggling with population loss and economic decline long before the bridge collapse - and its newest chapter promises even more challenges.\n\nPlans are underway to rebuild the Key Bridge by 2028. But in the meantime, its absence will be felt most acutely by people like Loreasa Minor and her neighbors, people who routinely hopped over the bridge to run errands, visit family, attend church and get to work.\n\nMinor has lived in Turner Station nearly all her life. Some of her earliest memories are of the bridge being built, a feat of modern engineering taking shape right in her family's backyard. When it opened to cars in 1977, the 1.6-mile (2.6-kilometer) span bypassed downtown traffic and provided a direct connection between industrial communities on either side of Baltimore's harbor.\n\nIt also made Turner Station easily accessible, allowing residents to enjoy the neighborhood's small-town feel without living in the middle of nowhere. As jobs at nearby industrial plants gradually dried up, residents started commuting farther afield and many came to rely heavily on the Key Bridge.\n\nWithout it, Minor said, her daily commute has more than doubled.\n\nShe doesn't want to leave Turner Station, where her grandparents put down roots many decades ago. She currently lives across the street from her aging parents and around the corner from her beloved church. But sometimes while she's sitting in traffic for hours on end, she ruefully watches the gas gauge and contemplates her new routine.\n\n\"Do I relocate? Do I get a new job?\" said Minor, who works at a state-run veteran's cemetery south of Baltimore. \"I don't want to do either of those. I love my job. Who wants to start from scratch?\"\n\nTurner Station was originally built to house Black steelworkers at a time when segregation laws limited where they could settle.\n\nDuring WWI, military leaders tapped Baltimore's robust shipbuilding industry, including a sprawling steel mill northeast of the city. The federal government provided nearby housing only for white workers, so Black families started their own community in nearby Turner Station. Federal housing projects came later during WWII.\n\nBought by Bethlehem Steel in 1918, the mill at Sparrows Point would become the largest steel producer in the world. It provided lucrative jobs to Black people moving north, often to escape unfair sharecropping arrangements and other low-paying jobs in Southern states.\n\nBy the 1950s, Turner Station was home to many stores and other amenities, including an air conditioned movie theater, an amusement park, a community beach, doctor's offices, restaurants and cocktail lounges. It became largely self-sufficient in its heyday, an enclave of Black entrepreneurship and achievement in majority-white Baltimore County.\n\nThe population peaked at nearly 9,000 in the 1950s, but started shrinking soon after. Part of the area was rezoned for industry, resulting in the demolition of two large housing complexes. Manufacturing jobs gradually dwindled and businesses shuttered. By 1980, the population was under 4,000, according to local historians.\n\nAfter decades of downsizing, the Bethlehem Steel plant closed in 2012. Younger generations started leaving Turner Station while their parents and grandparents sought to preserve its legacy.\n\nDuring a recent tour of the neighborhood, longtime resident Courtney Speed marched up and down its residential streets lined with brick rowhouses and modest single-family homes. She said it shouldn't be lost on anyone that Turner Station is the product of racist housing policies, that its residents were fighting an uphill battle from day one.\n\nShe listed off a number of notable figures with ties to the community, many of them featured in the Turner Station History Center, a tiny museum filled with stories and photos.\n\n\"We've always been innovative,\" said Speed, 84, who owns one of Turner Station's longest operating businesses, Speed's Barber and Beauty. \"It's our culture to make something out of nothing.\"\n\nHenrietta Lacks, a Black woman whose cervical cells became a cornerstone of modern medicine after Johns Hopkins doctors harvested them without her consent , lived in Turner Station for almost a decade. Her name appears on commemorative street signs throughout the neighborhood and a plaque marks her former home.\n\nRobert Curbeam, a former NASA astronaut and retired Navy captain, spent some of his childhood there.\n\nU.S. Rep. Kweisi Mfume , former president of the NAACP, also grew up in Turner Station where he befriended NFL legend Calvin Hill. He said the community instilled in them certain core values.\n\n\"Work hard, play by the rules, love your country, cherish your faith, respect the elderly and always believe that you can succeed,\" he recited. \"It's a fiercely proud community. We were told to be proud of who you were.\"\n\nHe said most of the families were relatively poor, but they took care of each other. It was a simpler life, somewhat protected from the crime and violence that plagued nearby parts of Baltimore.\n\nMfume, a Democrat, now represents Turner Station as part of his district in Congress. Since the bridge collapse, he's been working with other members of Maryland's congressional delegation to secure 100% federal funding for the cleanup and rebuilding process.\n\nHe said Turner Station residents have expressed concern about potential damage to buildings from the seismic impact of the collapse. And they're already tired of 18-wheelers getting diverted through their neighborhood, spewing diesel fumes and wearing down the roads.\n\nResidents are also frustrated by rising home prices, partly a function of their desirable water views. Some worry about outside investors buying up properties, jacking up rents and pricing them out. They want to guard against the negative effects of gentrification by helping longtime renters become homeowners.\n\n\"This is some of the most valuable property in Baltimore County,\" Mfume said. \"We don't want real estate speculation taking place.\"\n\nResidents have spent years pushing government officials to adequately address flooding in Turner Station, a longstanding problem that has only gotten worse in recent years as county officials have studied the issue but failed to take significant action.\n\nThat's coupled with decades of industrial pollution making the surrounding water dangerous for swimming and fishing.\n\n\"They need to start treating this place as beautiful as it is,\" said Marquis Neal, whose backyard often floods during heavy rainstorms.\n\nHis neighbor Linwood Jackson, a Vietnam veteran who worked at Bethlehem Steel for over 30 years, called on elected officials to finally give Turner Station the attention and resources it deserves. That could mean bringing a grocery store back to the neighborhood, which has become a food desert in recent years. Or removing brush from the drainage ditches and replacing a rickety old fishing pier in the public park behind his house. Not to mention flood mitigation measures and continued pollution monitoring.\n\nJackson said he hopes Turner Station will become less of an afterthought since tragedy struck so close by.\n\n\"Now we're at a crossroads again,\" he said.\n\nBut one thing he's learned, in war and in life, is that no one's coming to save you.\n\nHaving watched construction of the original Key Bridge \"from the ground up,\" Vernon Banks said he looks forward to seeing its replacement take shape over the next four years. But it won't hold the same memories.\n\nLast month, state transportation leaders awarded a contract for the massive project, which is expected to cost around $1.7 billion.\n\nTurner Station residents hope some of that money will make its way into their neighborhood and help spur revitalization.\n\nState officials have pledged to include surrounding communities in the planning process and make jobs available for local workers during construction, though they haven't provided many details about the arrangements.\n\nTurner Station has already benefited from environmental cleanup and recent redevelopment of the old Bethlehem Steel site, which now houses an Amazon warehouse and a maritime shipping terminal. Tradepoint Atlantic, the site's owner, plans to continue growing the business into a major transportation and logistics hub. That also bodes well for job creation, although the glory days of steelworkers' wages are likely long gone.\n\nMeanwhile, Turner Station residents will be doing what they've done for generations: coming together and fighting for their community.\n\nThere's Gloria Nelson, president of the Turner Station Conservation Teams, who has spent decades working with government agencies to bring resources into the community, including for housing redevelopment and a recent federal Superfund designation to support environmental cleanup in historically polluted Bear Creek. She wants to help Turner Station \"move into the future while still respecting its history.\"\n\nThere's Antuan \"Sleep\" McQuaige, who's selling home-cooked meals around town and raising money to bring back a neighborhood youth football team.\n\nThere's Quanny Avondale, 30, who mentors younger men in the community, focusing on conflict resolution and financial planning. He encourages them to take advantage of Turner Station's real estate market and invest in property.\n\nAnd on Sunday mornings, there's Pastor Rashad Singletary inspiring dozens of parishioners at Mount Olive Baptist Church, about 500 feet away from where the Key Bridge once stood. In the hours after the bridge fell, he opened up the church for first responders to use the bathroom or take a nap and hosted a prayer vigil later that evening.\n\n\"Sometimes it's hard to go through and trust God when you don't see nothing working,\" Singletary told congregants during a recent Sunday sermon about persevering through challenges.\n\n\"I just believe that if God brought me from all the things I've been through before. He's not gonna leave me now.\"\n\nHis booming voice filled the sanctuary as church members nodded and clapped in affirmation, thinking back on the obstacles they've already faced and looking ahead to future possibilities.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Erin Hooley)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) - The closure of Wadsworth Elementary School in 2013 was a blow to residents of the majority-Black neighborhood it served, symbolizing a city indifferent to their interests.\n\nSo when the city reopened Wadsworth last year to shelter hundreds of migrants without seeking community input, it added insult to injury. Across Chicago , Black residents are frustrated that long-standing needs are not being met while the city's newly arrived are cared for with a sense of urgency, and with their tax dollars.\n\n\"Our voices are not valued nor heard,\" says Genesis Young, a lifelong Chicagoan who lives near Wadsworth.\n\nChicago is one of several big American cities grappling with a surge of migrants . The Republican governor of Texas has been sending them by the busload to highlight his grievances with the Biden administration's immigration policy.\n\nAP correspondent Donna Warder reports on the Black community in Chicago, and how some say the needs of recently-arrived migrants are being put ahead of their needs.\n\nTo manage the influx , Chicago has already spent more than $300 million of city, state and federal funds to provide housing, health care, education and more to over 38,000 mostly South American migrants who have arrived in the city since 2022, desperate for help. The speed with which these funds were marshaled has stirred widespread resentment among Black Chicagoans. But community leaders are trying to ease racial tensions and channel the public's frustrations into agitating for the greater good.\n\nThe outcry over migrants in Chicago and other large Democrat-led cities is having wider implications in an election year: The Biden administration is now advocating a more restrictive approach to immigration in its negotiations with Republicans in Congress.\n\nSince the Wadsworth building reopened as a shelter, Young has felt \"extreme anxiety\" because of the noise, loitering and around-the-clock police presence that came with it. More than anything, she and other neighbors say it is a reminder of problems that have been left unsolved for years, including high rates of crime, unemployment and homelessness.\n\n\"I definitely don't want to seem insensitive to them and them wanting a better life. However, if you can all of a sudden come up with all these millions of dollars to address their housing, why didn't you address the homeless issue here,\" said Charlotte Jackson, the owner of a bakery and restaurant in the South Loop neighborhood.\n\n\"For so long we accepted that this is how things had to be in our communities,\" said Chris Jackson, who co-founded the bakery with his wife. \"This migrant crisis has made many people go: 'Wait a minute, no it doesn't.'\"\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson declined to comment for this story.\n\nThe city received more than $200 million from the state and federal government to help care for migrants after Johnson appealed to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and President Joe Biden. The president will be in Chicago in August to make his reelection pitch at the 2024 Democratic National Convention.\n\nSome Black Chicagoans are protesting the placement of shelters in their neighborhoods, but others aim to turn the adversity into an opportunity.\n\n\"Chicago is a microcosm to the rest of the nation,\" said the Rev. Janette C. Wilson, national executive director of the civil rights group PUSH for Excellence. Black communities have faced discrimination and underinvestment for decades and are justifiably frustrated, Wilson said. The attention the migrants are receiving is deserved, she added, but it's also a chance for cities to reflect on their responsibility to all underserved communities.\n\n\"There is a moral imperative to take care of everybody,\" Wilson said.\n\nAfter nearly two years of acrimony, the city has begun to curb some accommodations for migrants - which has caused its own backlash. The city last month started evicting migrants who overstayed a 60-day limit at shelters, prompting condemnation from immigrant rights groups and from residents worried about public safety.\n\nMarlita Ingram, a school guidance counselor who lives in the South Shore neighborhood, said she is concerned about the resources being shared \"equitably\" between migrants and longtime residents. But she also believes \"it doesn't have to be a competition\" and sympathizes with the nearly 6,000 migrant children now enrolled in Chicago's public schools.\n\nAs the potential for racial strife rises, some activists are pointing to history as a cautionary tale.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Black southerners moved to Chicago in the early 20th century in search of greater freedoms and economic opportunities. White Chicagoans at the time accused them of receiving disproportionate resources from the city, and in 1919 tensions boiled over.\n\nIn a surge of racist attacks in cities across the U.S. that came to be known as \"Red Summer,\" white residents burned large swaths of Chicago's Black neighborhoods and killed 38 Black people, including by lynching.\n\n\"Those white folks were, like, 'Hell no, they're coming here, they're taking our jobs,''' said Richard Wallace, founder of Equity and Transformation, a majority-Black community group that co-hosted in a forum in March to improve dialogue between Black and Latino residents.\n\nHe hears echoes of that past bigotry - intentional or not - when Black Chicagoans complain about the help being given to migrants. \"How did we become like the white folks who were resisting our people coming to the city of the Chicago?\" he said.\n\nLabor and immigrant rights organizers have worked for years to tamp down divisions between working class communities. But the migrant crisis has created tensions between the city's large Mexican American community and recently arrived migrants, many of whom hail from Venezuela.\n\n\"If left unchecked, we all panic, we're all scared, we're going to retreat to our corners,\" said Leone Jose Bicchieri, executive director of Working Family Solidarity, a majority-Hispanic labor rights group. \"The truth is that this city wouldn't work without Black and Latino people.\"\n\nBlack Americans' views on immigration and diversity are expansive. The Civil Rights Movement was instrumental in pushing the U.S. to adopt a more inclusive immigration policy .\n\nAbout half of Black Americans say the United States' diverse population makes the country strong, including 30% who say it makes the U.S. \"much stronger,\" according to a March poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nMany leaders in Black neighborhoods in and around Chicago are trying to strike a balance between acknowledging the tensions without exacerbating them.\n\n\"Our church is divided on the migrant crisis,\" said the Rev. Chauncey Brown, pastor of Second Baptist Church in Maywood, Illinois, a majority-Black suburb of Chicago where some migrants are living in shelters.\n\nThere has been a noticeable uptick of non-English speakers in the pews, many of whom have said they are migrants in need of food and other services, Brown said. Some church members cautioned him against speaking out in support of migrants or allotting more church resources to them. But he said the Bible's teachings are clear on this issue.\n\n\"When a stranger enters your land, you are to care for them as if they are one of your own,\" he said.\n\n____\n\nMatt Brown is a member of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

But his legacy as the first Black person in those roles is murkier, with some African Americans saying that his voice on their behalf could have been louder.\n\nPowell, who died Monday of COVID-19 complications, spent 35 years in the Army and rose to political prominence under Republican presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. His stature fueled persistent speculation that he would one day run for president as a member of the GOP.\n\nThrough it all, Powell never seemed entirely comfortable talking about race, said Kevin Powell, a New York-based writer and rights activist who is not related to Colin Powell.\n\n\"I think that's why a lot of Black folks never saw him as a leader. There was never a sense that Colin Powell was one of us,\" said Kevin Powell, who met him in the 1990s, when he was often discussed as a potential presidential candidate.\n\nWhen he did talk about race, his words were measured, as in a 1994 commencement speech at Howard University: \"Racism is a disease that you can help cure by standing up for your rights, and by your commitment to excellence and to performance, by being ready to take advantage of your rights and the opportunities that will come from those rights.\"\n\nIn the years after George W. Bush left office, Powell \"was largely invisible in a lot of things that happened - Trayvon Martin, Ferguson, George Floyd,\" said Kevin Powell, who also is Black. \"It was clear that the party he was part of was moving right. I don't recall him ever saying this party has become nothing more than race mongers.\"\n\nPowell eventually became disenchanted with the GOP and endorsed Democrats for president, starting with Barack Obama. He also called former President Donald Trump a national disgrace and said he no longer considered himself a Republican following the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol.\n\nPowell's dignity and composure should not be interpreted as any indication that he failed to understand the struggle of his people, according to Sam Riddle, an Army veteran and Detroit-based political activist.\n\n\"He personified a quiet inner strength that we knew he held on the battlefield for America and for Black Americans,\" said Riddle, who also hosts a Detroit talk radio show. \"The bullhorns we can use can be simply quiet competency, integrity and perseverance.\"\n\nPowell expressed concern over the U.S. rate of incarceration, which has consistently been the highest in the world. He favored policies designed to keep young adults, especially Black Americans, out of the criminal justice system.\n\nYears before the 2020 murder of George Floyd renewed calls from the Black Lives Matter movement to \"defund the police,\" Powell said he was not in favor of reducing law enforcement budgets to address police brutality. He suspected that many Black Americans agreed.\n\nA June 2020 poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research around the height of that summer's police protests showed that 43% of Black Americans strongly supported or somewhat supported reducing police funding, while 30% opposed the idea.\n\n\"You can't say, 'We should disinvest the criminal justice, police and courts,'\" Powell said in a 2017 interview with the Mic news outlet . \"They're there not just to protect white folks. They're there to protect Black folks as well.\"\n\nHe continued: \"If you tell a Black community leader that the police are not going to be around, they may say, 'Whoa! Wait a minute!' What they want is fair and balanced justice treatment for all Americans.\"\n\nA child of Jamaican immigrants who grew up in the Bronx borough of New York City, Powell said he was raised in a community where his neighbors were as invested in his safety and success as his own mother and father.\n\n\"I had adults who cared about me,\" Powell told Mic. \"My two parents, all my Jamaican relatives in the South Bronx, they watched out for us kids. And if you ever did anything wrong, I mean, you were going to get it.\"\n\nPowell graduated in 1958 from City College of New York, which later created the Colin Powell Center to develop student leadership and campus community engagement. The program was eventually renamed the Colin Powell School for Civic and Global Leadership.\n\nIn the wake of Floyd's slaying and the Black Lives Matter protests, the school launched a racial justice fellows program as a joint initiative between the Colin Powell School and CCNY's Black studies program.\n\nPowell once said he wanted the next generation to have opportunities like he did, according to Andrew Rich, dean of the Colin Powell School.\n\nBeing a Black American \"defined his experience,\" Rich said. \"He was a trailblazer in every sense. I think he was very aware of the barriers he broke. One of the things he was so proud of was that he knocked open doors and did not close them behind him.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama said Monday that Powell helped \"a generation of young people set their sights higher\" and \"never denied the role that race played in his own life and in our society more broadly.\"\n\n\"But he also refused to accept that race would limit his dreams, and through his steady and principled leadership, helped pave the way for so many who would follow,\" Obama said.\n\nObama recalled a time in 2008 when conspiracy theories swirled around his own faith and Powell addressed it head-on. He quoted Powell as saying: \"The correct answer is, he is not a Muslim; he's a Christian. But the really right answer is, 'What if he is?' Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer's no, that's not America.\"\n\nMany Black people look to high-achieving African Americans to act on their behalf, said Frederick Gooding, associate professor of humanities at Texas Christian University.\n\n\"Maybe they just disproportionately expect a Colin Powell to do more or be more than he needs to be. It might be one of those deals where he may not have spoken for every Black person, but at the same time it's OK that he does not,\" Gooding said.\n\nPowell's career and his long record of public service show his excellence, Gooding added.\n\n\"When it comes to African Americans, often times, when you've been touched by the struggle so to speak, when you have a position of power and privilege, do you leverage it?\" Gooding said. \"He may not have been that front-line cheerleader, but that doesn't mean he wasn't affected by the struggle.\"\n\n___\n\nMorrison reported from New York City.
