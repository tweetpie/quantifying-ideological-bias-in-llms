      "text": "Watch: Dem rep. calls out GOP lawmaker to his face over party's refusal to support stricter gun laws\n\nOne Democratic lawmaker is completely fed up with Republican lawmakers' lack of regard gun violence across the United States.\n\nOn Wednesday, March 29, Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) delivered a blistering take on Republican lawmakers' ongoing opposition to legislation to enforce stricter gun laws. Speaking to reporters outside of the House chambers, the New York lawmaker described Republicans as \"cowards.\"\n\nWhen Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) - chairman of the Second Amendment Caucus which advocates for lax gun laws - passed Bowman speaking with reporters, he inquired about Bowman's remarks.\n\nThe angry Democratic lawmaker had no problem offering insight.\n\nTurning to Massie, he said, \"I'm talking about gun violence!\"\n\nIn response to Bowman's fiery remarks, Massie suggested that the shooting is another reason why school teachers and faculty members should carry guns. Bowman argued that the suggestion would not be a good resolution.\n\n\"Carry guns?\" Bowman asked. \"More guns lead to more death.\"\n\nThe Democratic lawmaker went on to suggest that Massie was \"carrying water for the gun lobby.\"\n\nWhen Massie said he should he calm down, Bowman made it clear why he would not.\n\n\"Calm down? Children are dying!\" Bowman yelled. \"The solution is not arming teachers.\"\n\nWatch the video below or at this link."

Jamaal Bowman , a Democrat from New York, is responding to an attack earlier Thursday from Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), which many are calling racist. Congressman Bowman called Greene's words \"incredibly dangerous and incredibly reckless,\" suggested she is a white supremacist, and likened her actions to \"one of the reasons why Emmett Till was killed.\"\n\n\"Marjorie Taylor Greene at her press conference this morning said something incredibly dangerous and incredibly reckless about me, talking about my demeanor as being 'aggressive' and saying that she feels 'intimidated' by me,\" Congressman Bowman told reporters Thursday afternoon. \"Unfortunately, this country has a history of characterizing Black men who are outspoken, who stand their ground, and who push back as being threatening or intimidating.\"\n\nBowman declared Greene was \"not even using a dog whistle,\" but \"a bullhorn to put a target on my back to the people that she refers to as MAGA people out there who might want to cause harm.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Greene tried to build a case against Bowman, telling reporters that at a recent New York City protest rally against Donald Trump, the New York Democratic lawmaker was \"shouting at the top of his lungs, cursing, calling me a horrible - calling me a white supremacist, which I take great offense to. That is like calling a person of color the N word which should never happen. Calling me a white supremacist is equal to that and that is wrong.\"\n\nAfter having attempted to paint the New York Democratic Congressman as dangerous, Greene declared, \"I think there's a lot of concern about Jamaal Bowman, so and I am concerned about, I feel threatened by him. He not only let a mob there, but his boisterous lies.\"\n\nShen concluded her remarks by saying, \"I am very concerned about Jamaal Bowman, and he's someone that people should watch.\"\n\nCongressman Bowman declared, \" This is the same reason why Mike Brown was killed. This is one of the reasons why Emmett Till was killed. And throughout history Black men have continued to be characterized as aggressive because one because of our skin color, but two because we happen to be outspoken and passionate about certain issues.\"\n\n\"It's reckless and dangerous what she said, Okay, characterizing me in my interaction with her yesterday. I never invaded her personal space. I was laughing and gregarious the entire time. How was that intimidating? What was intimidating about that? So she goes to a press conference today and say that she's intimidated by me and my mannerisms are aggressive. Anyone who's interacted with me, anyone knows me, even reported this, you know, I'm middle school principal energy, always loving and engaging and friendly, except when kids filled in our streets. Everyone should be outraged about that.\"\n\n\"But she knows what she's doing when she does that,\" Bowman added. \"And unfortunately white supremacists historically, this is what they do. They try to dehumanize black people, black skin and black humanity so that they could be you know, more likely to be targeted for harm.\"\n\nAs NCRM reported earlier, Congresswoman Greene has a history of racism.\n\nWatch Bowman's and Greene's remarks below or at this link ."

Bowman's suggestion was in earlier times, political parties were expected to take responsibility for their corrupt members.\n\n\"And I'll tell you another thing he said outside there, he was saying save your party.' I kept telling him no, 'save the country.' It's not about political parties. We shouldn't care about political parties. We should care about the country, because no matter what our political beliefs are Jamaal Bowman I don't know what his political beliefs are. I know what mine are. But we both we both swore an oath to serve the country here in Congress's representatives.\"\n\nShe then issued a warning against the New York Democratic lawmaker, declaring, \"I am very concerned about Jamaal Bowman, and he's someone that people should watch.\"\n\nBut Greene has a documented history of racist remarks. Three years ago, as a candidate, Republicans distanced themselves from her, \"after POLITICO uncovered hours of Facebook videos in which she expresses racist, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic views,\" the news outlet reported in June of 2020.\n\nGreene \"suggested that Muslims do not belong in government; thinks black people 'are held slaves to the Democratic Party'; called George Soros, a Jewish Democratic megadonor, a Nazi; and said she would feel 'proud' to see a Confederate monument if she were black because it symbolizes progress made since the Civil War.\"\n\n\"Now,\" Politico reported at the time, \"GOP lawmakers, aides and operatives fear Greene - a wealthy businesswoman who has already drawn national attention because of her belief in a trove of QAnon \" conspiracy theories - could create an even bigger black eye for the party if she wins the nomination.\"\n\nIn December of 2021 Greene was accused of using a \"racial slur,\" according to The Independent , which also reported she \"has a history of remarks that have drawn accusations of racism. In the past few weeks, she has accused her Muslim-American colleagues in the US House of Representatives of being 'Islamic terrorist sympathizers' and called one member in particular, Rep Ilhan Omar, 'pro-Al Qaeda.'\"\n\nIn February of 2022 Greene was highly criticized for speaking \"at a white nationalist conference in Orlando,\" and then mocked after claiming she was unaware of what it was.\n\nLast fall Greene came under criticism for making remarks that \"echoed the 'Great Replacement' conspiracy theory long promoted by white nationalists that nonwhite immigrants could eventually displace native-born white Americans,\" Spectrum News reported.\n\nIn a December, 2021 opinion piece at The Daily Beast , Kali Holloway wrote about Greene and her Republican colleague from Colorado, Rep. Lauren Boebert.\n\n\"She and Boebert spew racist talking points and stoke white terror like it's their jobs, mostly because it is. The GOP 'big tent' has a come-one-come-all policy for white racists, white supremacists, and white nationalists from every walk of life. Boebert and Greene are just faithfully representing a voting base that overwhelmingly thinks America's most pressing problem is that white status-loss leaves white people vulnerable to being treated like Black people.\"\n\nWatch a clip of Congresswoman Greene below, and video of her and Congressman Bowman above, or both at this link ."

Clay Higgins (R-Louisiana) posted a tweet bashing both Haiti and its people, a wave of backlash led to him deleting it. Now, some Democrats are calling for Higgins to be officially censured.\n\nOn Wednesday, Higgins weighed in on the ongoing controversy surrounding both former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) spreading a widely debunked lie about Haitian refugees in Springfield, Ohio eating residents' pets. Earlier this week, the nonprofit Haitian Bridge Alliance pushed for criminal charges against Trump and Vance for knowingly lying about the Haitian community, which they say was a direct contributor to the wave of threats to Haitians in Ohio and elsewhere.\n\nIn his tweet. Higgins wrote: \"Lol. These Haitians are wild. Eating pets, vudu, nastiest country in the western hemisphere, cults, slapstick gangsters... but damned if they don't feel all sophisticated now, filing charges against our President and VP. All these thugs better get their mind right and their a- out of our country before January 20th.\"\n\nHiggins' tweet led to Rep. Steve Horsford (D-Nevada) to file an official motion to censure Higgins . He argued that a censure was warranted in order for Congress to send a message to the Haitian community that racist attacks from members are not tolerated.\n\n\"It is time to end hate, and the rhetoric of hate, and it is not becoming on any member to continue to push this type of rhetoric on any platform - let alone from the House of Representatives,\" Horsford said. \"I ask unanimous consent to accept my motion to censure Representative Clay Higgins for violating Rule 9, by bringing discredit and disgrace to the House of Representatives.\"\n\nAt that point, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-Louisiana) rose to defend his Bayou State colleague, objecting to the motion on the basis that Higgins eventually took down his post. That objection prompted audible laughter from Democratic members present in the chamber.\n\n\"First of all, the tweet has been deleted already, and removed,\" Scalise said, while some Democrats are heard in the background laughing. \"And if we want to go through everything the other side has said we'll be happy to do it!\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) told reporters during an impromptu press conference Wednesday that Higgins ultimately decided to delete the tweet after taking a moment to pray about it after it was posted. The censure motion has not yet passed as of Wednesday evening.\n\nIf he is censured, Higgins would be the third member of 2024 to be officially reprimanded by his colleagues. Earlier this year, the House voted along party lines to censure Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-New York) for pulling a fire alarm and interrupting an ongoing vote. Members also censured Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) - the first Palestinian American elected to Congress - for remarks she made about Israel's bombing of Gaza.\n\nWatch the video of Horsford's speech and Scalise's response below, or by clicking this link ."

Al Green (D-TX) shouts out as U.S. President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the U.S. Capitol on March 04, 2025 in Washington, DC.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Al Green of Texas is earning praise online after delivering perhaps the most dramatic moment of U.S. President Donald Trump's address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night.\n\nGreen interrupted the speech, shaking his cane at Trump and shouting that the president had \"no mandate to cut Medicaid.\" He was led out of the chamber by the sergeant-at-arms after being told to sit down by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), as Republicans cheered. Speaking to reporters after he was escorted out, Green said that he was protesting Trump's efforts to cut federal government programs, including Medicaid, according to The Hill.\n\n\"Al Green understood the assignment,\" wrote Sam Weinberg, the executive director of the progressive group Path to Progress, on Bluesky on Tuesday. Ezra Levin, the co-founder of the grassroots group Indivisible, similarly said : \"Al Green stood up. Would like to see more people stand up.\"\n\n\"EVERY DEMOCRAT SHOULD BE EXACTLY LIKE THIS!!! RESPECT TO AL GREEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" posted the leftist Twitch streamer Hasan Piker, on X.\n\nFormer Congressman Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) wrote \"Al Green!\" and added that all the Democrats in the room should have left with him.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Green's act was a show of protest not only against Trump, but also congressional Democratic Party leaders who had asked Democrats to attend the speech but not disrupt it.\n\nDuring the address, other Democrats sat through the speech and raised signs with messages such as \"Save Medicaid\" and \"Musk Steals.\" According to Reuters , Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) and others turned their backs as Trump spoke, revealing messages on the backs of their shirts like \"No Kings live here,\" before exiting.\n\nWhile threats to Medicaid were the central focus of Green's protests, Republicans' targeting of the program did not feature in Trump's speech-during which he boasted about gutting climate initiatives, ending the \"tyranny of so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies,\" and peddled the falsehood that Social Security benefits are being paid out out on a large scale to people who have been dead for years.\n\nLast week, House Republicans were able to pass a budget resolution that tees up passing trillions of dollars in tax cuts, a move that will almost certainly be paid for by slashing social programs like Medicaid and nutrition assistance.\n\nThe resolution instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to \"submit changes in laws within its jurisdiction to reduce the deficit by not less than\" $880 billion over the next decade. That panel has jurisdiction over Medicaid, which the GOP has repeatedly targeted in public and private discussions, with one leaked document floating over $2 trillion in cuts to the program.\n\nRepublicans also rejected numerous Democratic amendments that would have prevented Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program cuts in the upcoming budget reconciliation process as their resolution moved through committees.\n\nWatch video of the incident below or at this link."

Democrats who accept their money or endorsement should be shamed out of the party.\"\n\nInstitute on Race, Power, and Political Economy senior fellow Nina Turner , a former Democratic congressional candidate, declared , \"AIPAC is a right-wing group that buys deep blue seats.\"\n\nTrita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, drew a comparison to the National Rifle Association, saying , \"Imagine how mainstream Democrats would react if the NRA was the single biggest source of Republicans donating into Democratic primaries.\"\n\nSupport for or criticism of the Israeli government has become a defining issue in this election cycle over the past eight months, as Israel has waged a war on the Gaza Strip that has led to a genocide case at the International Court of Justice. AIPAC, which supports pro-Israel Democratic and Republican candidates, has targeted progressives who oppose the military assault.\n\n\"We are proud to engage in the democratic process in a bipartisan way to help elect candidates who support the U.S.-Israel relationship,\" AIPAC spokesperson Marshall Wittmann said in a statement. \"Candidates from both parties should welcome the engagement of pro-Israel activists because Americans overwhelmingly stand with the Jewish state. In fact, those who object to our participation only represent a small, extremist fringe.\"\n\nGallup polling released in March shows that 55% of Americans disapprove of Israeli military actions in Gaza-which as of Sunday, have killed over 37,000 people, according to local officials. A Pew Research Center survey published last week found that 53% of U.S. adults have little to no confidence that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will \"do the right thing regarding world affairs.\"\n\nPolitico put out the findings from its analysis-which is based on a review of Federal Election Commission filings from AIPAC, the ActBlue and WinRed donation platforms, and individual campaigns-a day after thousands of American critics of Israel's war and U.S. complicity in it descended on the White House while Israeli forces slaughtered hundreds more Palestinians.\n\nAccording to the outlet:\n\nThe top recipient of AIPAC money-at least $1.61 million-is Westchester County Executive George Latimer , who launched his challenge to Democratic Congressman Jamaal Bowman in New York's 16th Congressional District after visiting Israel.\n\nResponding to the report on social media Sunday, Bowman-who has called Israel's assault on Gaza genocide- said that \"Republicans are setting records spending against us. And we're going to break records beating them.\"\n\nPolitico pointed out that \"competitive Democratic primaries are also the biggest targets for AIPAC's affiliated super PAC, United Democracy Project, which has already spent $19.8 million in them this year, including $9.3 million in the Bowman-Latimer race. That makes it by far the biggest outside group in Democratic primaries, with more money flowing from UDP than the next 10 biggest spenders combined. (The super PAC has also spent in a handful of GOP primaries, dropping $3 million total.)\"\n\nThe New York arm of the Working Families Party, which is backing Bowman in the June 25 primary, shared Politico 's graph of top AIPAC beneficiaries and stressed that \"we must be united in rejecting AIPAC's efforts to subvert our democracy.\"\n\nAfter Bowman and two incumbents is St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell, at $869,300. He is trying to oust another progressive \"Squad\" member, Democratic Congresswoman Cori Bush , in the August 6 primary for Missouri's 1st District.\n\n\"My opponent Wesley Bell is among AIPAC's TOP 4 recipients this cycle-and is gladly taking money from anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ+, anti-labor, pro-NRA Republicans who expect his loyalty in return above all else,\" Bush said on social media. \"We deserve better. #StLouisIsNotForSale .\"\n\nFellow \"Squad\" member Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) also weighed in, saying , \"Hmm it's almost like AIPAC functions as a political slush fund for Republican billionaires and should not have influence in the Democratic Party, let alone our primaries.\"\n\nPeople for Bernie-which was initially launched in support of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders ' (I-Vt.) 2016 Democratic presidential campaign- said , \"Simply put: George Latimer in New York and Wesley Bell in Missouri are trying to become Democratic members of Congress off millions of dollars of money from rich right-wing Republicans.\"\n\nJustice Democrats, which worked to elect Bowman, Bush, and Ocasio-Cortez, asserted that reelecting the New York and Missouri progressives \"is a vote to #RejectAIPAC and Republican donors spending in our elections.\"\n\nThe group also noted Republican President Donald Trump , who is expected to face Democratic President Joe Biden in November. Justice Democrats said , \"Now that it's undeniable that AIPAC is *the* vehicle for Republican billionaires to spend in Democratic primaries, you have to ask what type of candidates would be willing to be bought and paid for by Trump donors?\""

Each and every day, their role in U.S. politics becomes a greater scandal. They are the NRA of foreign policy. Of course they don't want a cease-fire.\"\n\nThe other lawmakers targeted by AIPAC were Democratic Reps. Jamaal Bowman (N.Y.), Cori Bush (Mo.), Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), Summer Lee (D-Pa.), Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Mark Pocan (Wis.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.), and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), the only Palestinian American in Congress.\n\n\"I'm starting to think that AIPAC isn't just a puppet of [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu, but a partner,\" said Pocan. \"They cover for his murdering of innocents in the course of supposedly going after Hamas and those actions aren't getting hostages released. They seem fine with that and don't mind the killing of kids.\"\n\nIn less than five months, Israel's blockade and bombardment of Gaza have killed at least 29,313 Palestinians and devastated civilian infrastructure, displacing the vast majority of the Hamas-governed enclave's 2.3 million residents.\n\nBefore October 7, the United States already gave Israel nearly $4 billion in annual military aid. The Biden administration has responded to the war by seeking a package worth over $14 billion, bypassing federal lawmakers to arm Israeli forces, and defending Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories at the ICJ on Wednesday.\n\nAIPAC, meanwhile, has worked to oust progressive members of Congress in the November election. The group is also fighting growing global allegations that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza and demands for a cease-fire deal that would free hostages taken on October 7 as well as Palestinians imprisoned in Israel.\n\n\"A cease-fire means Palestinians will not be slaughtered by Israel every day. A cease-fire means medicine and food. A cease-fire means hostages come home,\" Jewish Voice for Peace political director Beth Miller said of the group's social media post. \"AIPAC wants a total genocide of Palestinians, with full funding from the U.S. AIPAC wants death and destruction. That's it.\"\n\nOrganizer Melissa Byrne accused AIPAC of \"exploiting sexual violence to keep a war going,\" adding that the group \"prefers war to freeing the hostages and security for Israel and Palestine .\""

Kyrsten Sinema's departure from the party won't change much in Washington, D.C., progressives in her home state of Arizona and across the nation are already pushing to replace the newly declared Independent if she runs for reelection in 2024.\n\nThe \"Primary Sinema\" campaign rebranded on Saturday as \"Replace Sinema\" following the senator's Friday announcement-which came just days after Democrats secured 51 seats in the Senate with Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) winning his second crucial runoff in as many years.\n\nThe Change for Arizona 2024 PAC project was launched in September \"to educate the public about the ways Kyrsten Sinema has let down Arizonans and caved to special interests,\" said the campaign, which has raised over $500,000 from thousands of grassroots donors. \"Now, as Kyrsten Sinema has left the Democratic Party, the group's effort will shift toward defeating her in a potential three-way general election and replacing her with a real Democrat.\"\n\nSinema-who insists she won't caucus with the GOP-is now one of three Independents in the upper chamber, joining Sens. Angus King (Maine) and Bernie Sanders (Vt.), who both caucus with the Democrats. Sanders notably sought the party's nomination for president in 2016 and 2020.\n\nThe \"Replace Sinema\" campaign on Sunday spotlighted Sanders' morning appearance on CNN , during which he called her out for so far serving as a \"corporate Democrat\" who, along with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), has \"sabotaged enormously important legislation.\"\n\n\"I happen to suspect that it's probably a lot to do with politics back in Arizona,\" Sanders said of Sinema abandoning the party. \"I think the Democrats there are not all that enthusiastic about somebody who helped sabotage some of the most important legislation that protects the interests of working families and voting rights and so forth.\"\n\n\"So I think it really has to do with her political aspirations for the future in Arizona,\" added Sanders, who said he'd be watching closely to see who may challenge her in two years. \"But for us, I think nothing much has changed in terms of the functioning of the U.S. Senate.\"\n\nIn response to a video Sinema shared about her decision-which she has framed as an attempt to \"stay focused on solving problems and getting things done for everyday Arizonans\"-Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted that \"not once in this long soliloquy does Sinema offer a single concrete value or policy she believes in.\"\n\n\"She lays out no goals for Arizonans, no vision, no commitments,\" the progressive \"Squad\" member added. \"It's 'no healthcare, just vibes' for Senate. People deserve more. Grateful this race and nomination has opened up.\"\n\nPushing back against Sinema's statements about the move, Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) said : \"Bye Felicia... This isn't about the party, this is about your pharma donors! Stop lying!\"\n\nOthers also took aim at Sinema's wealthy donors and history of obstructing key priorities of President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats, including efforts to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and increase taxes on corporations.\n\n\"We are not surprised that she would once again center herself,\" Alejandra Gomez, executive director of Living United for Change in Arizona (LUCHA), told The New York Times . \"This is another unfortunate, selfish act. It is yet another betrayal-there [has] been a slew of betrayals, but this is one of the ultimates, because voters elected her as Democrat, and she turned her back on those voters.\"\n\nWhile suggesting her shift won't impede the party, Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said in a statement that \"this is a predictable outcome for Sinema as she has entirely separated herself from any semblance of representing hardworking and struggling Arizonans. Her alignment with wealthy and corporate interests has crippled her ability to support the Democratic agenda.\"\n\nStephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, told The Hill that \"she should join her friends on Wall Street in 2024, and Democrats should nominate someone truly on the side of the working class who can unite and win Arizona.\"\n\nMorris Pearl, chair of the Patriotic Millionaires, highlighted that \"in the past year alone, she torpedoed efforts to raise corporate taxes in Biden's Build Back Better Act, killed the momentum to change the carried interest loophole in the Inflation Reduction Act, and tanked the movement to change the filibuster to safeguard American elections-all things that Democrats rightly wanted to do to make life better for working people.\"\n\n\"By registering as an Independent, Sinema is just admitting what the rest of us have known for years-she has no allegiance to the Democratic Party or Democratic voters. Sinema works for her ultrarich, corporate donors, and no one else,\" he added. \"Her label change might improve her prospects of winning a corporate board room seat after her inevitable demise in 2024, but it won't change the fact that she has never and will never have the best interests of ordinary Arizonans and Americans at heart.\"\n\nWaleed Shahid of Justice Democrats tweeted that \"Sinema and her big corporate donors know her politics have no path forward among Democratic primary voters. She's made this decision simply to cling to power as one of corporate America's leading obstructionists to the Democratic Party agenda.\"\n\n\"After seeing her horrifically low poll numbers with Democratic voters, Sinema is once again doing everything she can to protect herself and big corporate donors at the expense of multiracial democracy,\" Shahid told The Hill .\n\n\"Either Kyrsten Sinema is actively helping the Republican Party by splitting the Democratic vote, or she is a fundamentally self-interested person who would rather throw lives under the bus than give up her political career,\" said Ellen Sciales of the Sunrise Movement, who wants to see a progressive challenger. \"We're wondering if she's just trying to force the Democratic Party to not challenge her in 2024 because she knows her polling is incredibly unpopular.\"\n\n\"There's a whole question about her calculus here,\" Sciales continued. \"One thing is really clear: She's not thinking about the people of Arizona, she's thinking about her own political career.\"\n\nAs the Times detailed:\n\nWhile some such as Pearl were more optimistic about 2024, others warned that despite victories by Democrats in statewide races last month, the party could face a significant battle if it runs a candidate and Sinema seeks reelection-a topic she has declined to address in recent days, despite an abundance of media attention.\n\nNBC News reported on comments from a leader in the state Democratic Party, which last year censured Sinema after she opposed reforming Senate rules to pass a voting rights bill:\n\nArizona-based pollster Mike Noble, chief research and managing partner at OH Predictive Insights, told The Hill that \"the fastest growing political party in the state is actually Independent voters.\"\n\n\"There's got to be representation for folks more in the middle,\" he said. \"I could absolutely see Democrats having a progressive candidate, Republicans having a more hard-right candidate, and then you have Sinema in the middle. Absolutely there is a path to victory there for her.\"\n\nStacy Pearson, an Arizona-based Democratic strategist who wasn't surprised by Sinema's move given criticism from the party in their state, agreed that Sinema has a decent shot at winning.\n\n\"Democrats in Arizona only comprise 30% of the electorate,\" Pearson pointed out. \"It's the smallest bloc behind Republicans on top and Independents in second place.\"\n\nGrijalva told the Times that he would support fellow Democratic Arizona Congressman Ruben Gallego if he runs for Senate in 2024 but also issued a warning: \"Anybody that underestimates Sen. Sinema is being foolish... She's going to be formidable if she decides to run.\"\n\nThe newspaper interviewed Gallego, who referenced Warnock's Tuesday win:\n\nThe other potential Democratic candidate whose name is already making the rounds is another Arizona congressman: Greg Stanton, a former Phoenix mayor who on Friday tweeted an image of results from a statewide survey about his possible run for Senate.\n\n\"Democratic leaders were cagey on Friday about how they would approach the 2024 race or a potential Independent Sinema campaign,\" according to the Times . \"Representatives for Senate Democrats' campaign arm and for Senate Majority PAC, the leading Democratic super PAC devoted to Senate races, declined to comment on Friday afternoon about Ms. Sinema's move.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement that Sinema \"asked me to keep her committee assignments and I agreed. Kyrsten is Independent; that's how she's always been. I believe she's a good and effective senator and am looking forward to a productive session in the new Democratic majority Senate. We will maintain our new majority on committees, exercise our subpoena power, and be able to clear nominees without discharge votes.\"\n\nWhilte House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre struck a similar tone:\n\nMeanwhile, progressive strategist Max Berger said of Sinema ditching Democrats, \"The level of shamelessness that it takes to do something like this at this particular moment in history, it's really mind-boggling.\"\n\n\"The White House and leadership have no choice but to treat her like a very important figure in the Senate, but they should be working to defeat her as quickly as possible,\" he argued. \"No one should have the slightest amount of deference or respect for her because what she's done is a betrayal of the voters of Arizona and of American democracy and it's loathsome.\""

      "text": "House Democrats blast 'racist tropes' in Florida schools' new history curriculum\n\nEditor's note: An extra space was removed from the headline.\n\nC ongressman Maxwell Alejandro Frost led the letter against \"bigoted teaching standards in Florida that want kids to learn that Black people received 'benefits' from being enslaved.\"\n\nFour Black Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday joined the growing chorus of critics opposing \"racist tropes\" in Florida's new K-12 history curriculum, which includes teaching middle school students \"the resurrection of one of the greatest lies America has ever told itself, that slavery benefited the enslaved.\"\n\n\"Your decision to rewrite history to ingrain white supremacy into the minds of children is a colossal step backward and an insult to Black people, descendants of slaves, and the intellect of the American people,\" three Florida Democrats-Reps. Maxwell Alejandro Frost, Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, and Frederica Wilson-and Congressional Black Caucus Chair Steven Horsford (D-Nev.) wrote to the state's Department of Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. and Board of Education Chairman Ben Gibson.\n\nThe first-of-its-kind standards approved Wednesday by the Florida board \"are not the truth of American history but riddled with falsehoods that minimize the unique racial terror experienced by Black people in America throughout time,\" the lawmakers argued.\n\n\"These standards are out of touch with reality and will leave future generations of Floridians out of touch and disadvantaged in the world outside of Florida,\" they warned. \"Even worse, it plants the sinister thought that enslavement and continued harm toward Black people today is also acceptable and beneficial.\"\n\nFlordia's mandated instruction that enslaved people developed \"skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit\" has garnered national attention but \"is not the only dangerous falsehood,\" the quartet highlighted. They pointed out that the curriculum for middle school students \"also requires downplaying and tempering the horror of American slavery by requiring it is coupled with teaching, 'how slavery was utilized in Asian, European, and African cultures,' 'the similarities and differences between serfdom and slavery,' and 'comparative treatment of indentured servants of European and African extraction.'\"\n\nAdditionally, for high schoolers, the standards \"list massacres of Black people in America as, 'examples of acts of violence perpetrated against and by African Americans,' falsely assigning shared responsibility to Black victims,\" the lawmakers noted.\n\n\"We demand the Florida Board of Education immediately reverse its decision,\" they concluded. \"Not repealing these new standards would dig up the corpse of the worst version of our nation and force our children to live in it.\"\n\nFrost, Cherfilus-McCormick, Wilson, and Horsford aren't the only critics of the Florida curriculum in Congress. U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), a Black former teacher and principal, tweeted Friday that \"this is an outright attempt to rewrite history and ignore America's past of racial exploitation and violence and the trauma from the impact of slavery on Black Americans.\"\n\nCongressman Jonathan Jackson (D-Ill.)-a son of civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson-thanked Vice President Kamala Harris \"for standing up for the truth\" by blasting the Florida standards and declared that \"we must be true to our history, even when it's painful.\"\n\nThe national alarm over Florida's curriculum comes after the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis-now a GOP 2024 presidential candidate-earned widespread criticism earlier this year for rejecting an Advanced Placement course about African American studies for high school students."
