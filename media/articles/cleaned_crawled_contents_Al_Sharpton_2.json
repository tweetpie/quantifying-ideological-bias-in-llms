      "text": "'Humiliating to watch': Al Sharpton slams Tim Scott's 'embarrassing' pro-Trump antics\n\nAfter Sen. Tim Scott (R-South Carolina) launched his 2024 presidential campaign, his supporters hailed him as a traditional non-MAGA conservative who could rescue the GOP from Trumpism if he won the nomination and become the United States' second Black president by defeating Democratic incumbent Joe Biden in the general election.\n\nBut Scott's critics argued that his criticism of Trump during the primary was tepid at best. The South Carolina senator is now campaigning for Trump, and the Rev. Al Sharpton is among the Scott critics who believe he is debasing himself in the process.\n\nAfter Trump defeated former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the New Hampshire primary, Scott stood alongside the GOP presidential frontrunner during his victory speech. Trump told Scott, \"Did you ever think (Haley) actually supported you, Tim? And you're the senator of her state. And (you) endorsed me. You must really hate her.\"\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\nScott responded, \"I just love you.\"\n\nDuring a January 24 appearance on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Sharpton slammed Scott's behavior in New Hampshire as \"humiliating to watch.\"\n\nThe civil rights activist and MSNBC host argued, \"I think (Trump) will be the nominee. And I think he's demanding people bow to him. There are few moments in my life I've been more embarrassed than to watch Tim Scott. You know, I know Tim and I are both practicing Christians, but I don't know if he could pray like that to the other side. I mean, it was humiliating to watch what Tim Scott did as a sitting senator. And one time, he wasn't even on the script; he interrupted Trump to pay homage.\"\n\nSharpton went on to tell \"Morning Joe\" hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, \"He has a right to be a Republican. He has a right to do Donald Trump. But to do it in such a way that is so humiliating was troubling.\"\n\nSharpton isn't the only one who is calling out Scott's obsequious behavior on behalf of Trump.\n\nNever Trump conservative Tara Setmayer said of Scott, \"Who's worse? Trump or his court jester enablers?\"\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, author Jeff Sharlet posted , \"I hold Tim Scott in contempt, but the depth of self-abasement here is hard to look at. All the more so for understanding how Trump's supporters see it, a racist inoculation against charges of racism that in turn 'permits' more racism.\n\nWatch the full video of Al Sharpton's MSNBC appearance below :"

Al Sharpton cut to the root of the issue: Trump seems to have a serious problem with black women.\n\n\"I think that even I did not think a sitting president - even Donald Trump - referred to a woman as a 'dog,'\" he said. \"And then, to see the White House say they could not deny the possibility that he had used the n-word - I mean, you have major corporate CEOs that have had to leave their jobs because they used the n-word. I remember, and all of us condemned the n-word when used in slang and all. And when this campaign started, many of us were attacked by rappers. I remember sitting in Sony Movie Studios, watching a CEO resign her job because of racial language. And now we're told the president of the United States cannot emphatically, unequivocally deny the use of the term, on the day that he also calls this woman - who he himself said spoke nicely of him - calls her a 'dog'?\"\n\n\"I mean, I don't think - the presidency is being, in my opinion, being disgraced by these actions,\" he thundered.\n\n\"And you can't separate the fact that we just hit the one-year anniversary of Charlottesville, where the president saw good people on both sides of a KKK march,\" added Wallace. \"From the fact that black women are the largest group that did not support this president. And black women seem to trigger him the most violently.\"\n\nSharpton agreed. \"Black women, like Maxine Waters -\"\n\n\"And Frederica Wilson,\" interjected Wallace. \"The widow of La David T. Johnson.\"\n\n\"On and on and on,\" said Sharpton. \"And he has not called Putin a dog! I mean, when you look at the president - he has not called him, really, much of anything. Even Kim Jong Un was only 'Rocket Man.' But a dog? I mean, we've not seen him this vicious toward avowed enemies of the United States.\""

Al Sharpton delivered a moving and passionate speech at her funeral on Friday celebrating her legacy.\n\nHe also took the opportunity to fire back at President Donald Trump, who had tried to claim part of Franklin's legacy as his own after her death, claiming \"she worked for me\" because she had performed at his failed casino.\n\n\"The other Sunday on my show, you know, I misspelled 'respect,' and a lot of y'all corrected me,\" Sharpton said. \"Now I want y'all to help me correct Donald Trump, to teach him what it means.\"\n\nThe crowd stood and cheered at that remark.\n\n\"When word went out that Ms. Franklin passed, Trump said she used to work for me.

      "text": "Why Al Sharpton is the Man Millions Love to Hate\n\nThe only thing really remarkable about the warning from the FBI to Al Sharpton that an unnamed, and unspecified dangerous substance may have been mailed to his National Action Network office in New York was that it came from the FBI. For months Sharpton has bitterly complained that he had been receiving a steady stream of hate mail, and death threats, and had repeatedly told law enforcement and the FBI about the threats. He questioned just how seriously they took them. This time the FBI apparently took the substance threat serious enough to warn him. That Sharpton should be under attack is hardly a surprise. If it's a police shooting, a protest over housing discrimination, a Jena six march, the charge to dump Dump Don Imus, a fist shake at the Bush administration, the bet is that Sharpton will be in the thick of the action. When Sharpton toppled Jesse Jackson from the top spot as black America's main man, the notoriety, and the hostility, that that title carries with it, insured that he'd take the heat for whatever went right or wrong when blacks took to the streets in protest. Sharpton's ubiquitous visibility on the protest front and willingness to go virtually anywhere as the visible, face and voice of angry black America makes him a universal punching bag. But that doesn't totally explain the deep, and almost clinical loathing that the mere mention of Sharpton's name stirs among far too many whites, and a fair number of blacks. There are two bigger reasons why the hatred-fascination for Sharpton. He shakes, rattles, and ignites the goblin of racial denial in many whites. Sharpton is a breathing, walking, reminder that race still matters, and matters a lot in America. He is a slap in the face to the legions that duck, dodge, deflect, and flat out deny that there's still a lot of racial hurt inflicted on blacks. Sharpton shatters their comforting delusion that racial hate is a dusty antique thing of a bygone past, a figment of the overwrought, paranoid imagination of many blacks, or better still that blacks themselves with their alleged incessant penchant for playing the race card are the only bigots left in America. The flap over Imus or Dog the Bounty Hunter was a textbook example of that. The instant they copped to their racial sins, the predictable happened. Legions of whites unleashed a torrent of self-righteous, angry, and near paranoid rants on internet chat rooms, on the comment section of news blogs, and in emails to this writer, hysterically defending Imus and Dog. They cussed Sharpton, always Sharpton, even though he had nothing to do with Dog or Imus opening their traps and blurting out their racist digs. Sharpton got the by now familiar taunts -- race baiter, hustler, clown, buffoon, and racial pimp. For an instant one would have thought that Sharpton had called whites the C word, and the Duke Lacrosse players accused of rape, nappy headed honkies. But then again if there wasn't a Sharpton, he'd have to be invented, or someone such as him. That's because blacks are eternally straight-jacketed with the tiresome monolith of race burden. Think how ludicrous it sounds to say the white leader, the Latino leader, the Asian Leader. But that's not the case with blacks, whites demand a one-size-fits-all black leader; the \"black leader.\" There's a method to this absurdity. When the mantle of black leadership is wrapped tightly around one man, the presumption is that he or she speaks for all blacks. Jackson, pre-Sharpton's muscling him off the top perch, was the whipping boy. In the 1980s when he talked about forming the Rainbow Coalition, blacks were attacked as radicals. When he talked about building an independent black political organization, blacks were attacked as separatists. When he talked about boycotting corporations and baseball leagues that racially discriminate in hiring and promotion, blacks were attacked as disruptive. When he called New York \"hymietown,\" blacks were attacked as anti-Semitic. When he talked about leading a national crusade to save affirmative action, blacks were attacked as wanting quotas and special preferences for the unqualified. It's the same with Sharpton. While he took much heat for the Tawana Brawley rape controversy, the burning down of a Jewish-owned store in Harlem after picketing that he endorsed, and his then penchant for shoot-from-the-lip inflammatory statements, so did blacks. They were forced to publicly defend him from the attacks while privately grousing that he made them look like idiots. Like clockwork, even though the Brawley case happened nearly two decades ago, whenever there's a Sharpton sighting on an issue it's instantly thrown up in his face. When the FBI notified him of the dangerous substance threat, Sharpton quickly sent out an alert to his regional offices. Whether the dangerous substance threat was real, or more likely a crank, it won't change one thing. Sharpton will continue to be the man that millions love to hate."

      "text": "Stop Trolling Erica Garner and Other Black People Over Al Sharpton - We Know Who the Real Enemies Are\n\nA right-wing group secretly captured Eric Garner's daughter and others on a heavily edited undercover video suggesting that Rev. Al Sharpton's activism is motivated primarily by money.\n\nIn the video, an offscreen interviewer asks Garner's daughter Erica Snipes, \"You think Al Sharpton is kind of like a crook in a sense?,\" to which Snipes replies, \"He is all about this,\" rubbing her fingers together to symbolize money.\n\nProject Veritas , which dubs itself as \"Investigative Film Journalists,\" asks Snipes and other family members and supporters of slain black people whom Sharpton's National Action Network has supported questions about the Harlem-based activist's sincerity.\n\nDuring the near eight-minute video, Snipes also criticizes the head of the National Action Network's Staten Island Branch, Cynthia Davis, for allegedly chastising Snipes for  using flyers during an Eric Garner protest that did not bear the organization's name.\n\n\"Al Sharpton paid for the funeral,\" Snipes is seen saying in the video. \"She's trying to make me feel like I owe them,\" she says, referring to Davis.\n\nTracy Martin, father of slain teen Trayvon Martin, is captured on the video saying that Sharpton is \"on his own personal mission.\" No context for that comment is provided, not even the question posed to him.\n\nWhat is troubling about this \"investigation\" is that Project Veritas did Snipes and others on the film far more harm than good. For one, the grumblings that Sharpton is a \"shakedown artist\" are nothing new and have been heard for years. Also, the \"investigation\" proved nothing. There was no smoking gun that directs the viewer to any fraudulent behavior by Sharpton or his associates.\n\n\"It's is very interesting that they, when they reached the people in the video, the people contradicted what was in the video,\" Sharpton told CBS News referring to the New York Post's story on the video . \"My response is it's a headline of a story that they contradict in their own article.\"\n\n\"Not only do I think the video was taken out of context, there is nobody in that video that said I did anything with money,\" he continued. \"The New York Post has more explaining to do than I do in this case.\"\n\nYep, he is correct.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Post, Snipes denied calling Sharpton a financial opportunist saying, \"No, I didn't say that I think Al Sharpton is all about the money.\"\n\nThere will be lots of back and forth over mischaracterizations from the subjects recorded in the video but the bottom line is that what Project Veritas makes is dishonest and crappy journalism that does damage to people in pain. Though Sharpton has gone on record defending Snipes , we have no idea what strains Snipes conversation, which she mostly likely believed was private, could cause between her and Sharpton's group.\n\nAnd when someone goes undercover to unearth wrongdoing, you would hope they turn up damning evidence that can prove people were truly being abused by a very awful person. The world is not a better place for African Americans because of Project Veritas' \"investigation.\" It did nothing more than add to a \"You Know That Al Sharpton Is a Crook\" gossip column.\n\nMoreover, Project Veritas' actions amount to the trolling of black pain. There are plenty of activists who have taken to Twitter and other platforms to criticize Sharpton and have no problem accepting the fallout that can potentially follow for doing so. No one seems to have given permission to speak candidly on video about Sharpton. The video also amounts to surveillance of black lives, something that our community has endured for years and needs less of, not more of.\n\nTo be clear, I am not cheerleading for Sharpton. I am not a fan of his politics, nor do I benefit from any relationship with him, directly or indirectly. But what I find troubling about these \"investigations\" to \"expose\" Sharpton is that none of them have led to any indictable actions against him. Sharpton is a lot of things to a lot of people, but one thing he is not is Enemy Number One of black people. That honor would go to white supremacy and those who benefit from it.\n\nBlack people do not need groups like Project Veritas \"investigating\" Sharpton.\n\nAn investigation into police brutality, racism in hiring and other forms of racism that truly hurt black people is more useful than a trolling, voyeuristic video that reveals nothing more than recycled allegations that black folks have been speaking to each other about for decades. But there is one more way I can describe this video: a distraction.\n\nNice try, Project Veritas. This video may generate a few clicks for your site but it certainly won't divert activists on the streets from focusing on their real enemy.\n\nAnd it certainly isn't Rev. Al Sharpton.\n\nTheir propaganda video is here. expand=1]"

Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Georgia) and the Rev. Al Sharpton are Protestant ministers and scathing Trump critics; President Joe Biden and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California) are practicing Catholics who have nothing good to say about the 2024 GOP presidential frontrunner.\n\nYet Trump remains popular among a particular group within Christianity: far-right white evangelicals. If he wins the Republican presidential nomination next year, he will do it with a lot of help from that demographic.\n\nIn an essay published by The Atlantic on November 22, Never Trump conservative Peter Wehner laments the fact that Trump continues to enjoy so much white evangelical support despite an abundance of \"rhetoric\" that is \"clearly fascistic.\"\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\nWehner observes , \"He demanded that the parent company of MSNBC and NBC be investigated for 'treason' over what he described as 'one-sided and vicious coverage'.... 'We pledge to you that we will root out the communists, Marxists, fascists, and the radical-left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country - that lie and steal and cheat on elections,' Trump said toward the end of his speech in Claremont, New Hampshire. 'They'll do anything, whether legally or illegally, to destroy America and to destroy the American Dream.'\"\n\nBut despite such rhetoric, Wehner stresses , Trump's white evangelicals supporters remain loyal to him.\n\n\"Trump's support among white evangelicals is still extremely high: 81 percent hold a favorable view of him, according to a poll taken in June - after Trump was indicted for a second time,\" the Never Trumper observes . \"The evangelical movement in America has been reshaped by the sensibilities of Trump and MAGA World.... It is a rather remarkable indictment of those who claim to be followers of Jesus that they would continue to show fealty to a man whose cruel ethic has always been antithetical to Jesus' and becomes more so every day.... Far too many Christians in America are not only betraying their humanity; they are betraying the Lord they claim to love and serve.\"\n\nPeter Wehner's full essay for The Atlantic is available at this link (subscription required)."

Al Sharpton, and former US Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) about recent polling that suggests Donald Trump is no longer faring well with working class voters - and why.\n\nNoting that Trump recently said people who work at McDonalds and people who are teachers \"have never had a real job,\" Reid asked Sharpton and McCaskill, \"Is he, like, on something?\" She added, \"A teacher is a real job. I hate to break it to Trump. They didn't inherit $317 million from their dada and then take over his company. Trump organization is Trump's dad's company.\"\n\nThe MSNBC host then noted current New York Times /Sienna polling, which shows \"among non-college educated voters in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. \"The margin that Trump had over Biden was 26 points. The margin he has over Harris , among white non-college voters has dropped to only 13,\" the MSNBC host added. \"He's still ahead, but it's shrinking.\"\n\nSpeaking with Sharpton, Reid also noted, \"Donald Trump was known for screwing over people who are working class. Meaning, workers that worked for him, contractors, subcontractors that helped him build his buildings, and then refused to pay them and said, 'Well, sue me. I'm not paying you.\"\n\nSharpton agreed, saying Trump \"was notorious for not paying contractors, subcontractors and even workers.\" The He was also notorious for not dealing in a diverse way. You must remember, Donald Trump's business was centered in New York - two thirds of which is Black and Latino - people of color. I don't know any Black or Latino subcontractors or contractors he ever did business with. Any time that I've met with Donald Trump at Trump Towers, it was like going up the Rocky Mountains. The higher you got, the whiter it was.\"\n\nMcCaskill - who told Reid she paid her way through law school by working as a server ins restaurants - added, \"This is somebody who never wanted who never wanted to touch the unwashed. He's got a bad attitude about his life because he wanted to be accepted by the top 1% in the country. And so he overcompensated his whole life trying to be that.\"\n\nThe MSNBC analyst continued, \"He would never hang out with the people at his rallies. He doesn't respect them. In fact, behind their back he probably says bad things about them. The people who take a shower after work, rather than before work, need to wake up and realize Donald Trump is not their friend. Donald Trump is not going to look after their needs.

Texas (2003) and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015). But the High Court is now dominated by extreme social conservatives, who overturned Roe v. Wade with their 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. And many civil libertarians fear that during President Donald Trump's second term, everything from same-sex marriage to access to contraception will be endangered by a Christian nationalist legal agenda.\n\nDuring a Monday morning, March 24 appearance on MSNBC , progressive attorney/author Elie Mystal stressed that from a legal standpoint, liberals and progressives are at a disadvantage because they are reactive rather than proactive.\n\nMystal told \"Morning Joe\" hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski and their MSNBC colleague, the Rev.

And so, what I'm trying to do is point out what an aggressive Democratic policy agenda looks like.... I think one of the problems that many people in the (Democratic) base have is that the Democrats always seem to be in a fetal position.\"\n\nMystal continued , \"The Democrats always seem to be in a defensive posture; we're always running around trying to pick up after Republicans after Republicans smash anything. Well, let's go out there and talk about the positive Democratic agenda. Let's talk about the things that we can do on the front foot.\"\n\nWhen Brzezinski asked Mystal for some examples, the attorney responded, \"Well, we could eliminate all voter registration laws. See, when Democrats get in charge, we try to protect voting rights. We don't make voting easier. Now, I'm all for voter eligibility requirements. We might disagree about what those requirements should be.... Why do you have to pre-register?
