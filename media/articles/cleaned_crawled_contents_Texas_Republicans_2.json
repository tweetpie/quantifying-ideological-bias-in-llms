All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nFor years, Carmen Cavazos' neighborhood in southeast Houston has voted reliably for Democrats up and down the ballot. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won 68% of the vote in Cavazos' voting precinct, a mostly residential enclave of about 3,000 people near Hobby Airport.\n\nBut something is changing in the precinct, where about nine out of 10 residents are Hispanic. President Joe Biden carried it by 20 points in his 2020 race against Donald Trump - a solid showing for Democrats, but half of Clinton's 40-point advantage from just four years earlier against the same Republican.\n\nCavazos, a 44-year-old flight attendant and Republican precinct chair, said she expects the trend to continue in November. She has been trying to accelerate the political shift, helping organize regular meetings of the Saturday Menudo Club, a group that meets monthly at local Mexican restaurants to hear from conservative candidates and other speakers.\n\n\"The messaging and voter engagement in our community is critically important,\" Cavazos said. \"When presented with data, facts, and statistics, the false narrative of identity politics and ideology propaganda encouraged by Democrats crumbles.\"\n\nRepublicans have logged historic gains in South Texas the last couple of elections, making political battlegrounds out of border communities that voted solidly Democratic for years. That sea change has largely overshadowed the more subtle rightward shift of Latino voters in cities and suburbs away from the border.\n\nThe threat of eroding Latino support in urban areas could spell even bigger trouble for Democrats' abiding hopes of turning Texas blue, because far more Latino voters live in these areas than in South Texas. While Democrats may not lose precincts like Cavazos' anytime soon, they will continue to be locked out of statewide elections if Republicans are able to continue peeling off nearly 40% of the vote there.\n\nLatino voters have long been a steady Democratic voting bloc in Texas. In 2016, exit polls measured Clinton winning Latino voters by a 27-point margin statewide - virtually unchanged from Barack Obama's 28-point edge in 2008.\n\nBut in 2020, Biden won the statewide Latino vote by only 17 points, as about four in 10 Latinos pulled the lever for Trump. Across Texas, including in Houston, San Antonio and other big cities, the Democratic margin fell an average of 17 percentage points from 2016 in precincts that were at least 80% Latino, according to The New York Times .\n\nAnd heading into November, polls in Texas and elsewhere have shown Democrats atop the ticket still underperforming with Latino voters, with Biden even trailing Trump among Latinos in Texas before he dropped out of the race.\n\n\"Latinos are still a growing Democratic majority,\" said Houston Democratic strategist Jaime Mercado. \"Latinos are voting Democratic holistically, across the county and across the state. But we should be very aware of these precincts where we're starting to see something go in the other direction. That should concern us, and we should engage in it.\"\n\nTexas Republicans are bullish about continuing their momentum with Latino voters this fall, betting a message focused on inflation and the economy, immigration, and crime - issues they are talking about with voters across the board - will resonate with Latinos.\n\nIn his reelection bid, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz , a Republican, is pouring $4.4 million into an ad campaign targeting Latino voters, a majority of which is going toward Spanish-language advertising. Cruz's first spot aimed at Latinos - titled \"El Valiente Senador,\" or \"The Brave Senator\" in English - portrays him as a fighter battling high taxes and working to keep Texas \"free and safe.\"\n\n\"We see a massive opportunity to win a bigger share of the Hispanic vote,\" said Cruz campaign spokesperson Macarena Martinez. \"It has long been said that Hispanics are Republicans, they just don't know it yet.\"\n\nThis election is the first since the U.S. Census Bureau reported Hispanic Texans now outnumber the state's non-Hispanic white residents. Hispanics make up nearly one-third of Texas' eligible voting population, more than all but two other states, according to the Pew Research Center . A quarter of Latinos in Texas will be voting in their first presidential election this fall, according to the nonprofit UnidosUS.\n\n\"That means that there's no traditional legacy of them wanting to vote Democrat or Republican,\" said Jorge Martinez, the Texas strategic director for the LIBRE Initiative, a conservative Latino voter outreach group. \"They are going to be voters that any side can reach out to to earn that vote.\"\n\nRobert Cardenas, outreach director for the Harris County Republican Party, said he has found a receptive audience among Hispanic voters at party-sponsored town hall events focused on crime and in settings like a recent gun show in Pasadena, where the party operated a booth where attendees could register to vote.\n\nMost of all, Cardenas said, concerns about the inflated cost of basic goods are driving Latinos, and working-class voters of all races and ethnicities, toward the Republican Party. The issue has dogged Biden for much of his term, though Democrats are optimistic that the problem has finally begun to ease .\n\n\"Whether that's going out, or being able to pay their bills, that is what is affecting them,\" Cardenas said. \"It's the economy, and that's why I think we're seeing a big shift.\"\n\nIn a statewide poll by Univision earlier this year, about two-thirds of undecided Latino voters put inflation, the cost of living and jobs among their top issues, more than all other topics.\n\nMercado said he worries that overall Democratic messaging has suffered in recent years from the influence of party elites who have spent too much time online and not enough time door-knocking. They have helped craft a message overly focused on identity politics and less on talking about jobs and opportunity, he said.\n\n\"Some of the elements of, frankly, the MAGA message, some of it has endeared itself to blue-collar, hard-working, non-college educated people,\" Mercado said. \"And guess who fits those demographics really well? Latino populations.\"\n\nFor all the GOP gains among Latinos in urban areas, though, some Republicans think their party can do better. In urban counties across Texas, most predominantly Latino areas still lean solidly Democratic. And many of the voting precincts in these areas lack GOP precinct chairs - an issue that rankles Orlando Sanchez, founder of Texas Latino Conservatives.\n\nSanchez, whose group works to get Latinos more involved in politics, said that if he had to grade Texas Republicans' recent Latino outreach efforts in urban counties, \"I'd say it went from a D to a C-minus.\"\n\n\"In major urban areas, we're doing a very poor job of delivering a conservative message,\" said Sanchez, a former Houston City Council member and mayoral candidate. \"(Republicans) are good at criticizing communities that want to defund the police ... but they're not very good at delivering a positive message of economic opportunity to Hispanics.\"\n\nSanchez believes Republicans should more aggressively pitch their free-market economic vision to working-class Latinos, and he said they have missed the boat on criticizing specific policies pushed by the Biden administration such as debt relief for student loans.\n\n\"Republicans are missing the opportunity to explain to Hispanics that their hard-earned paycheck is now going to pay the debt for some kid in Massachusetts who went and got a liberal arts degree at Boston University,\" Sanchez said. \"Explain that to the Hispanic family, and I'll tell you, they're not going to vote for the Democrats anymore.\"\n\nThe Univision poll found that 60% of Hispanic voters in Texas \"support the Biden Administration's efforts to forgive student loans,\" compared to 21% who voiced opposition.\n\nIn 2020, some of the most astonishing political shifts anywhere in the country came along the border in Starr County, which Trump lost by 5 points after losing it by 60 points four years earlier. Neighboring Zapata County flipped red after going to Clinton by 33 points in 2016.\n\nBut while a flood of national media attention captured the changing voter sentiments there, the two predominantly Latino counties tallied only about 21,000 combined votes in 2020; in Harris County, by contrast, more than 337,000 Spanish-surname voters turned out, according to estimates from Hector de Léon, a Harris County elections official who tracks Houston-area voting patterns.\n\nPublic polling has revealed key differences between the values and attitudes of Latino voters in urban counties compared to those in South Texas - a reminder of the wide array of backgrounds, nationalities, and religious and cultural beliefs within what is often lumped together as \"the Latino vote.\"\n\nAn April statewide poll by the Texas Hispanic Policy Foundation found that Hispanic voters in major urban areas were much less likely to support GOP Gov. Greg Abbott 's handling of the U.S.-Mexico border than those in the suburbs and South Texas. The poll measured a similar regional split over the multibillion-dollar cost of Abbott's border crackdown: 70% of Hispanic voters in border counties and South Texas supported the use of billions in state tax dollars for border security, compared to 48% in large urban counties.\n\nLatinos in major cities are also more likely to support abortion rights than those in South Texas, the poll found. The regional disparities suggest that each party's generic messaging on those issues will be received much differently by Latino voters depending on where they live, said Mark Jones, the Hispanic Policy Foundation's chief information and analytics officer.\n\n\"A lot of the national Democratic policies that criticize Gov. Abbott, and sort of criticize the Republican approach to the border, are going to go over very poorly in South Texas and the (Rio Grande Valley) and, most importantly, in the two congressional races that are actually in play this cycle,\" said Jones, a political science professor at Rice University, referring to the battleground races for Texas' 15th and 34th Congressional Districts.\n\nBut there are also parallels between the regions.\n\nDaniel Vasquez, a 35-year-old San Juan resident, regularly makes the three-hour commute to his job as a safety coordinator at a Port Lavaca refinery. He said he started paying attention to politics during Obama's 2008 campaign and voted for him twice, along with Clinton in 2016. But he found himself aligning more with the Republican Party midway through Trump's term, driven by a humming economy and the GOP's petrochemical-friendly policies.\n\nEnergy politics may also be driving some of the Latino shift around Houston. Dozens of predominantly Latino precincts in east Harris County, where many residents work in petrochemical jobs around the Ship Channel, drifted to the right between 2016 and 2020.\n\nVasquez's views were only solidified, he said, by some of the Biden administration's policies aimed at combating climate change, such as an attempted pause on natural gas export permits. Vasquez said he believes environmental concerns are important, but that Biden should be striking a better balance.\n\n\"The economy, to me, it was thriving,\" Vasquez said. \"My paycheck had more purchasing power. And I mean, there was work all across the state. The oil and gas sector was booming.\"\n\n___\n\nThis story was originally published by The Texas Tribune and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Brown Convention Center on Thursday, June 16, 2022, in Houston. (Elizabeth Conley/Houston Chronicle via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Ten years ago, the Texas Republican Party used its platform to oppose teaching critical thinking in schools. In 2014, it declared homosexuality a chosen behavior contrary to God and endorsed \"reparative therapy\" to reverse it. By 2020, the party was ready to remind the world that \"Texas retains the right to secede from the United States.\"\n\nBut now the GOP platform in the country's largest red state - long an ideological wish list that even the most conservative Texans knew was mostly filled with pipe dreams that would never become policy - has broken new ground in its push to the far right.\n\nApproved by 5,000-plus party delegates last weekend in Houston during the party's biennial convention, the new platform brands President Joe Biden an \"acting\" commander-in-chief who was never \"legitimately elected.\"\n\nIt may not matter who the president is, though, since the platform takes previous language about secession much farther - urging the Republican-controlled legislature to put the question of leaving the United States to voters next year.\n\nThe platform also says homosexuality is \"an abnormal lifestyle choice\" and rejects bipartisan legislation in Congress seeking to raise the minimum age to buy assault weapons from 18 to 21, saying Texans under 21 are \"most likely to be victims of violent crime and thus most likely to need to defend themselves.\"\n\nThough non-binding, the platform illustrates just how far Texas Republicans have moved to the right in the past decade - from championing tea party ideals in 2012 to endorsing former President Donald Trump's continued lies about nonexistent widespread fraud costing him an election he actually lost by more than 7 million votes.\n\n\"The platform reflects the direction that party activists believe the party should take,\" said Matt Mackowiak, a Republican strategist based in the Texas capital of Austin. He said that, rather than deciding elections or dictating legislative action, the platform is more relevant as a signal of \"where primary voters are and what they care about.\"\n\nMackowiak said items like considering succession won't be taken seriously, but \"Trump's policy agenda is here to stay.\" He said that, as the former president continues to question 2020 election results, he will continue to find a receptive audience in the Texas GOP.\n\n\"Are people really in doubt that Republicans have concerns about how the election was conducted?\" Mackowiak asked.\n\nMatt Rinaldi, a former state lawmaker who now chairs the Texas GOP, said state Republicans \"rightly have no faith in the 2020 election results and we don't care how many times the elites tell us we have to.\"\n\n\"We refuse to let Democrats rig the elections in 2022 or 2024,\" Rinaldi said in a statement.\n\nDemocrats haven't rigged anything. An Associated Press r eview of every potential case of voter fraud in the six battleground states disputed by Trump has found fewer than 475 - a number that would have made no difference in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nMeanwhile, Texas' 2020 election was a romp even by the standards of Republicans who have dominated the state for decades . The party's candidates topped Democrats in key congressional and statehouse races as Trump easily carried its electoral votes.\n\nBut that didn't stop the former president from praising the party's 2022 platform, posting Tuesday: \"Look at the \"Great State of Texas and their powerful Republican Party Platform on the 2020 Presidential Election Fraud.\"\n\n\"Such courage,\" he wrote, \"but that's why Texas is Texas.\"\n\nTrump was cheering language declaring, \"We reject the certified results of the 2020 presidential election, and we hold that acting President Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was not legitimately elected.\" That was a departure from as recently as 2014, when the Texas GOP platform questioned Barack Obama's \"commitment to citizens' constitutional rights,\" but at least recognized him as president.\n\nThis year's platform also says that \"Texas retains the right to secede from the United States, and the Texas Legislature should be called upon to pass a referendum consistent thereto.\"\n\nEd Espinoza, executive director of the advocacy organization Progress Texas, said some of the adherence to open discriminatory language might have receded if not for the rise of Trump - who has demonstrated \"he could double down on the crazy and not suffer a consequence yet.\"\n\n\"Normally what happens is, when there's crazy in a party, people try to soften it,\" said Espinoza, former Western States Director of the Democratic National Committee. \"In this case, they saw it worked for Trump so they think it'll work for them.\"\n\nTexas was an independent republic for nearly a decade until 1845. With the coronavirus pandemic raging, the 2020 Texas Republican Party convention was held virtually and degenerated into a leadership struggle. But it also featured platform language declaring, \"Texas retains the right to secede from the United States should a future president and congress change our political system from a constitutional republic to another system.\"\n\nThat caveat about governmental system was dropped in the 2022 edition, which seeks a referendum for voters \"to determine whether or not\" their state \"should reassert its status as an independent nation.\"\n\nTexas' rightward push was clear in ways beyond the party platform. Delegates booed Republican Sen. John Cornyn - who has held his seat for 20 years and got more 2020 votes statewide than Trump did - for working on bipartisan legislation seeking to impose modest limits on guns. Those efforts began following last month's mass shooting in the Texas town of Uvalde, which killed 19 elementary students and two teachers.\n\nStill, such state convention outbursts also aren't new. Republican Gov. Rick Perry was booed in 2012 for praising fellow GOPer and Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who was then locked in a primary battle for an open Senate seat with Ted Cruz. Some delegates also in the past walked out of a speech by then-Republican Texas House Speaker Joe Straus.\n\n\"It shows you how much QAnon may not be an outlier in the Republican Party,\" Espinoza said. \"Some people are very susceptible to conspiracy theory, and that appears to be a higher percentage the deeper you go into the Republican Party of Texas.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nFILE - Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, left, and Gov. Greg Abbott talk during on the first day of the 88th Texas Legislative Session in Austin, Texas, Jan. 10, 2023. Abbott and Paxton are looking to settle political scores within their own party in the Tuesday, May 27, 2024, primary runoff elections.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Two prominent Texas Republicans are looking to settle political scores within their own party in the primary runoff elections on Tuesday, when voters will decide nearly three dozen unresolved races from the state's March 5 primary.\n\nFor entirely different reasons, Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton have put the weight of their statewide political organizations behind efforts to unseat Republican state representatives who have crossed them on policy or political grounds. Abbott is focusing on GOP members who helped defeat his 2023 education plan that would have allowed spending taxpayer money on private schools. Paxton has targeted more than 30 incumbents who voted to impeach him last year on corruption charges. He was later acquitted in the state Senate.\n\nThe revenge campaigns could push the legislature further to the right in a state where Republicans already have a lock on state government. In recent years, Texas has implemented one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country, expanded gun rights and adopted a sweeping immigration enforcement law that is currently tied up in federal court .\n\nNine Republican state House incumbents were defeated in the March 5 primary, while an additional eight were forced to runoffs. All were targeted by Abbott or Paxton or both.\n\nThe highest profile of these state House Republican runoffs is in District 21, where Speaker Dade Phelan faces a challenge from oil and gas consultant and party activist David Covey. Phelan oversaw the effort to impeach Paxton, for which he was censured by the Republican Party of Texas for \"lack of fidelity to Republican principles and priorities.\" Phelan's defeat on Tuesday would be Paxton's biggest prize of the night. Covey has endorsements from Paxton and his biggest ally, former President Donald Trump. He placed first in the March primary with 46% of the vote to 43% for Phelan.\n\nAnother notable state House runoff is the Republican contest in District 33, where former Trump campaign adviser and spokesperson Katrina Pierson hopes to unseat state Rep. Justin Holland. Pierson is backed by Abbott and Paxton. She edged out Holland in the March primary, 40% to 39%.\n\nAbbott and Paxton back opposing candidates in five state House runoffs as well as in the Republican contest to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Kay Granger in the 12th Congressional District.\n\nThere are also a number of runoffs for U.S. House nominations, the most prominent of which is the Republican race in the 23rd Congressional District, where U.S. Rep. Tony Gonzales seeks a third term in the sprawling, West Texas-based seat. Gonzales has broken with his party on key votes on gun safety, immigration and same-sex marriage, earning him a censure from the state party in 2023. He has Abbott's backing over challenger Brandon Herrera, a gun rights advocate known for his gun-themed YouTube channel, The AK Guy.\n\nIn the 28th Congressional District, retired Navy officer Jay Furman and rancher Lazaro Garza compete for the GOP nomination to face Democratic U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar in November. Cuellar and his wife were indicted this month on conspiracy and bribery charges . The couple has denied any wrongdoing. Rosie Cuellar, the congressman's sister, will compete in the Democratic runoff for state House District 80.\n\nHere's a look at what to expect on Tuesday:\n\nThe Texas primary runoff election will be held Tuesday. All polls close at 7 p.m. local time, but Texas is in the Central and Mountain time zones. This means most of the polls in the state closes at 8 p.m. ET, while polls in El Paso, Hudspeth and parts of Culberson counties in West Texas close at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nThe Associated Press will provide vote results for and determine the winners in 32 races in which no candidate received a majority in the March 5 primary. This includes eight U.S. House, three state Senate, 19 state House and two state Board of Education runoff elections.\n\nVoters who participated in a party's primary on March 5 may only vote in runoff elections for that same party. In other words, voters who cast ballots in the Republican primary on March 5 may not vote in a Democratic runoff, and Democratic primary voters can't vote in a Republican runoff. Registered voters who did not participate in any party's primary on March 5 may participate in the runoff. All voters must be registered in the district holding the runoff.\n\nRunoffs tend to be lower-turnout events than the initial elections that prompted them. This could slow the race-calling process for a competitive contest, especially in smaller state House districts. In these cases, determining the outcome could rest on a handful of ballots that have yet to be tabulated.\n\nTwo contests take place in districts that span both the Central and Mountain time zones: the Republican runoff in the 23rd Congressional District and the Democratic runoff in state House District 77. Winners in those contests won't be declared until the last polls in the districts close at 9 p.m. ET. Races that take place entirely within the Central time zone could be called during the 8 p.m. ET hour.\n\nThe AP does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it's determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.\n\nTexas requires an automatic recount only in cases of a tie vote. Losing candidates may request and pay for a recount if the margin is less than 10% of the leading candidate's vote. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.\n\nAs of March, there were 17.9 million registered voters in Texas. Voters in Texas do not register by party.\n\nIn March, turnout was nearly 13% of registered voters in the Republican presidential primary and slightly more than 5% in the Democratic primary, according to the Texas secretary of state. About 53% of Republican primary voters and 61% of Democratic primary voters cast their ballots before primary day.\n\nAs of Wednesday, a total of 148,477 ballots had already been cast in the Republican runoffs and 89,981 in the Democratic runoffs. Early in-person voting began on Monday and concludes on Friday.\n\nIn the March 5 presidential primary, the AP first reported results at 8 p.m. ET, right as polls closed in most of the state. The election night tabulation ended at 5:46 a.m. ET with slightly more than 99% of total votes counted.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there will be 161 days until the November general election.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024 .\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Stephen Spillman)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) - A push by Texas' hard right to widen control in the state Capitol fell short Tuesday after House lawmakers rejected its choice for the powerful speakership amid a Republican feud accelerated by the historic impeachment of Attorney General Ken Paxton .\n\nInstead, new House Speaker Dustin Burrows won the job with the support of Democrats, who favored him over a challenger backed by the GOP's emboldened right.\n\nThe outcome is a victory for Texas Republicans' establishment wing, and it's possible that Democrats could still lose influence under the new leadership. The race deepened divisions within the GOP, partly driven by Republicans who say an agenda that includes some of the toughest laws in the U.S. over abortion and immigration doesn't go far enough.\n\n\"He's a leader who will at least have a conversation,\" Democratic state Rep. Toni Rose said in a nomination speech for Burrows.\n\nBurrows was challenged by state Rep. David Cook, who pledged to block Democrats from running committees in the House - a longstanding bipartisan tradition in a chamber that has historically been a more moderate balance to the hard-right-leaning Senate.\n\nBurrows will lead one of the state's highest offices after a dramatic bowing-out of the former House speaker , Dade Phelan, who lost favor with the hard-right faction of his party after Paxton's impeachment. The state Senate ultimately acquitted Paxton , who in recent weeks campaigned against Republicans who sought to deny Cook's victory.\n\nThe newly elected speaker has few ideological distinctions between himself and Cook, but his opponent came to be the choice of some Republicans who believe Democrats have too much control over the House.\n\nThe House's failure to approve taxpayer funds for private schools in 2023 also intensified Republican squabbles in the run-up to November's elections, when Republicans expanded their already commanding majority and gained ground on the U.S.-Mexico border .\n\nTexas in recent years has passed some of the nation's toughest restrictions on abortion, immigration and voting. Republicans this year have proposed bans on public funds for gender-affirming care for adults and giving in-state college tuition for students without legal status in the U.S.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been edited to clarify that Democrats, not Burrows, could still lose influence.\n\nLathan is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

(AP Photo/LM Otero)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Republicans in America's largest conservative state for years racked up victories under the slogan \"Keep Texas Red,\" a pledge to quash a coming blue wave that Democrats argued was inevitable given shifting demographics.\n\nNow, those population transformations have arrived, with the 2020 census confirming that the state got bigger, more suburban and far more diverse . Yet a more apt state GOP rallying cry for today might be \"Make Texas Even Redder.\"\n\nFaced with increasingly dire demographic threats to their party's dominance, Texas Republicans have championed a bevy of boundary-pushing conservative policymaking that dramatically expands gun rights, curbs abortions and tightens election laws - steering a state that was already far to the right even more so.\n\nFar from tiptoeing toward the middle to appease the Democratic-leaning Texans driving population growth, the party is embracing its base and vowing to use a new round of redistricting to ensure things stay that way through 2030 - becoming a national model for staying on the offensive no matter how political winds may eventually shift.\n\n\"Texas, obviously, is a national leader as it concerns the laws that we pass and other states follow,\" Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who is fond of vowing to make Texas the \"freedom capital of America,\" said Tuesday.\n\nAbbott, who is up for reelection next year and often mentioned as a possible 2024 presidential contender, signed voting legislation Tuesday that empowers partisan poll watchers and prohibits a host of measures that made casting ballots easier in heavily Democratic cities amid the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans argue that the new rules boost election security and charged ahead to pass them, even as Democratic state lawmakers fled the state for weeks to block them.\n\nThe voting law was nearly overshadowed by national debate over another new Texas law - the nation's toughest set of abortion restrictions . By banning the procedure in most instances and leaving no exceptions for cases of rape and incest, the state has mounted perhaps the strongest threat yet to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision establishing a woman's right to an abortion.\n\nAnother new law allows virtually any Texan age 21 and older to carry guns without licenses. Other legislation banned schools from teaching about institutional racism and limited the state's own cities from making decisions on police funding, environmental budgeting and mask mandates. And on Tuesday, Abbott instructed lawmakers to once again try passing restrictions on transgender student athletes when the Legislature convenes later this month to begin drawing new voting maps.\n\nThese policy victories are poised to become cemented for the foreseeable future. Because Republicans control both chambers of the Legislature, the party will decide new congressional and statehouse districts based on 2020 census figures - seeking to make the boundaries as favorable as possible so the GOP can hold statehouse majorities for the next decade and beyond.\n\nThe new maps will have to counteract what looks to be unfavorable census data for Texas Republicans. The state's Hispanic population grew by nearly 2 million , according to 2020 census figures, accounting for half of Texas' total population increase. Even as the GOP made gains with Hispanic voters, about 6 in 10 Hispanics in Texas chose Democrat Joe Biden over Republican Donald Trump in November, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of the electorate.\n\nRepublicans also see warning signs in the suburbs. The state is home to four of the nation's 10 fastest-growing cities, fueled by booming communities outside Houston, Dallas and Austin. After years of GOP advantages in these places, Biden split suburban voters in Texas with Trump, AP VoteCast found, and won the state's five largest counties.\n\nDemocrats blame the unfettered conservativism on Trumpism. The former president ushered in \"a new Republican Party that is more feisty. It's more fringe,\" said Democratic state Rep. Ron Reynolds, vice chair of the Texas Legislative Black Caucus.\n\n\"The cow's left the barn, and it's hard to put it back,\" said Reynolds, whose district includes booming suburban Houston. \"They have to entertain and they have to appease because these are the people that are excited about voting in Republican primaries.\"\n\nDemocrats like Reynolds warn there will be voter backlash. But they have little history to back that up: Republicans haven't lost a statewide race in 27 years and say it is a fierce commitment to conservativism, not pragmatic compromise, that has preserved the nation's longest electoral winning streak.\n\n\"If anyone expected that, their head is way too far up their, uh, philosophy,\" Corbin Casteel, the Trump campaign's Texas director in 2016, joked about any notion that census figures might make the state's Republicans move to the center.\n\nEven more moderate Texas Republicans say past pronouncements about changing demographics helping Democrats were overblown. \"The rumors of our demise have been greatly exaggerated,\" said state Rep. Travis Clardy of Nacogdoches in east Texas.\n\n\"We keep winning with really strong numbers,\" Clardy added. \"I don't think we've had strident, extreme, right-wing positions. I think we've governed conservatively.\"\n\nStill, the party has shown a capacity for moderation in the not-too-distant past. After a Democratic wave swept Texas and the nation in 2018, the GOP had an exceedingly quiet legislative session, focusing on traditional issues like property tax cuts and public education.\n\nIt was only after the party held the Legislature and gained seats in Congress last November that it turned hard right - anticipating that its members' biggest electoral threat going forward is primary challenges rather than being unseated by Democrats.\n\n\"I've heard that all this demographic change is going to catch up to the party of the old white people, but I don't think it's happened,\" Clardy said. \"The numbers may be changing, but they may not be trending the way they think that they are.\"\n\nThe move to the right is perhaps best illustrated by Abbott, a former state Supreme Court justice who was once considered to have a more measured and deliberative, business-friendly approach to the job but has lately gone even further right than the Legislature - particularly on immigration.\n\nThe governor recently ordered state police to arrest people suspected of being in the country illegally and directed a state agency to pony up $25 million for 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) of wall along Texas' nearly 1,200-mile (1,930-kilometer) border with Mexico.\n\nNo major Democrat has yet announced a candidacy against Abbott, though former presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke - who came within 3 percentage points of upsetting Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018 - still might . The governor has already drawn a primary challenge from former congressman Allen West, a onetime tea party darling known for likening Democrats to Nazis.\n\nCasteel said doubling down on conservative values is working for Republicans in Texas and beyond. He pointed to Abbott and another governor and possible 2024 presidential candidate, Republican Ron DeSantis of Florida. Both have gained national followings by being willing to combat unpopular policies like universal mask mandates . That's despite Democrats in both states insisting the governors' failure to more strenuously battle the pandemic could ultimately jeopardize their aspirations for reelection - not to mention the White House.\n\n\"He's faced circumstances that few governors have, with the pandemic and all sorts of other things that put conservatives in a tough bind,\" Casteel said of Abbott. \"It's safety versus liberty and he - and folks like Gov. DeSantis - they've threaded that needle very nicely. And I think the results are speaking for themselves.\"\n\n___\n\nWeissert reported from Washington.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/LM Otero)\n\nLEWISVILLE, Texas (AP) - Deep in the heart of Texas' sprawl, the city of Lewisville embodies the Lone Star State.\n\nBisected by Interstate 35 and ribboned with six- and eight-lane thoroughfares lined with chain stores, Mexican restaurants and pawn shops, Lewisville, 23 miles north of Dallas, is the prototypical slice of the nation's second most populous state. Its typical resident is about 36 years old, the same as in Texas. Similar to statewide, 6 out of 10 residents are not white, and about two-thirds of its voters cast ballots in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nNext door is the city of Flower Mound, a swath of swanky subdivisions with names such as Teal Wood Oaks and Chaucer Estates. Flower Mound looks more like the electorate that has kept Texas dominated by Republicans for decades. It is wealthier than Lewisville, more than two-thirds of its residents are white, and 78% of them voted in 2020.\n\nThat discrepancy, between the diverse, potential electorate of Lewisville and the actual, heavily white electorate of Flower Mound, has been the subtext for the past two decades of U.S. politics.\n\nFor a long time, the presumption has been that closing that gap between Lewisville and Flower Mound - getting more people to vote and having the electorate better represent the country's actual population - would help Democrats and hurt Republicans. That's because a larger electorate would mean more minorities voting, and those groups historically lean Democratic.\n\nThat presumption helped spark the Great Replacement conspiracy theory among some conservatives, imagining a plot to import immigrants to substitute for more conservative white voters. It's been part of the fuel behind Republican-led efforts to make it tougher to vote, especially in Texas, which has some of the strictest election laws in the country. But this presidential election has flipped the script .\n\nRepublicans have built their field campaign for Donald Trump around reaching what they believe is a vast population of infrequent, conservative-leaning voters. His campaign is counting on support from younger, Latino and African American voters who are less likely to go to the polls.\n\nDemocrat Kamala Harris is relying on Black and Latino voters, but also on increasing her support among college-educated voters, a growing group that's both highly likely to vote and helped put Democrat Joe Biden in the White House in 2020.\n\nThe contrast is clear in the neighboring cities in north Texas.\n\nIn Flower Mound, Republicans who used to dominate voting in the suburb fear it's trending Democratic. In more diverse Lewisville, those who rarely vote or cannot are warming to Trump.\n\n\"I think Trump would make a difference,\" said Brandon Taylor, 35, who cannot vote because of criminal convictions but is trying to persuade his girlfriend, Whitney Black, to cast a ballot for the former president. \"We need that extra vote,\" he told Black as the two, now homeless, sat on a bench outside Lewisville's public library.\n\nMeanwhile, Martha Mackenzie, a retired Naval officer in Flower Mound, is a former Republican who left the party over Trump.\n\n\"I just can't get behind a lot of the BS behind Trump,\" McKenzie said, scoffing particularly at Trump's insistence that the 2020 election he lost to Biden was stolen from him.\n\nThere are, of course, plenty of Harris supporters in Lewisville and numerous Trump voters in Flower Mound. The contrast between the towns goes beyond partisan politics and more to an age-old adage voiced by Sally Ortega Putney on a recent night in a Flower Mound office park.\n\nPutney, 59, and a handful of other volunteers were calling voters on behalf of the Democratic Party. She recalled spending hours outside Lewisville Latino markets trying, unsuccessfully, to find new voters.\n\n\"We got our hearts broken trying all sorts of different outreach. The lower class, they don't have the time, they're too busy trying to feed their kids,\" Putney said between calls that she and two other volunteers were making to voters.\n\nShe gestured around the room: \"It's the middle class that ends up running everything, because we have the time to do it.\"\n\nFor decades in Texas, Republicans have run things. The party has controlled the Legislature for more than 20 years and won every statewide race since 1994. As Texas has steadily grown more diverse, Republican margins have narrowed, but the GOP has taken steps to protect its hold on power .\n\nTexas Republicans have drawn some of the most notorious gerrymanders in the country, reshuffling the lines of state legislative and congressional districts to protect GOP politicians and push the Democratic voters who could oust them into a few oddly shaped districts. That ensures Democrats remain the minority in the Legislature.\n\nThe Legislature in 2021 tightened election laws in response to Trump's false fraud claims . Lawmakers banned election offices from holding 24-hour voting after that had become popular in a major Democratic-leaning county and they prohibited anyone from sending mail ballot applications to eligible voters.\n\nSince then Texas Republicans have continued to push back against a perceived menace of improper additional voters.\n\nAttorney General Ken Paxton sued two of the state's largest and most Democratic-leaning counties to stop their voter registration drives, and his office raided the homes of leaders of Latino civil rights groups in what it said was an investigation of possible election fraud.\n\n\"There's no question that the design of a lot of Texas' election laws, both old and new, is rooted in the idea of demographic change and that new voters won't support the people in power,\" said Michael Li, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York, who grew up in Dallas and still watches the state carefully.\n\nTexas has had recent experience with a surge of new voters, and it didn't turn out as badly for Republicans as the party feared.\n\nIn 2018, Democrat Beto O'Rourke challenged Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. The little-known congressman became a national phenomenon for his populist message and get-out-the-vote pushes. He lost 51% to 48%.\n\nJim Henson, a political scientist at the University of Texas, said the new voters who turned out in 2018 were evenly split between Republicans and Democrats - only slightly more Democratic than the normally conservative-leaning Texas electorate.\n\n\"There are untapped voters for both parties,\" he said.\n\nLacey Riley is one Republican who thinks Texas' voting laws are just \"safeguarding the election,\" not making it tougher for new voters.\n\n\"I think everyone should vote,\" said Riley, chair of the Denton County Republican Party.\n\nA Flower Mound resident, Riley said she's excited to see the GOP reaching new voters, including ones in Lewisville.\n\n\"The Republican Party has changed,\" she said. \"It's not a bunch of rich white people.\"\n\nRiley acknowledges that Flower Mound, which has a population of 80,000, is changing. She was stunned to watch a friend running for local school board get heckled in public for being conservative - something unthinkable in times past.\n\nThe city was founded in 1961 to prevent its patch of prairie from being swallowed by other fast-growing suburbs. For decades, it has prized slow growth and single-family housing, which has led to intense political fights over development.\n\nIn contrast, Lewisville dates to the 19th century and has a small downtown with a few historic buildings.\n\nWhen the area began to grow, the city let various property owners do what they wanted with their land, leading to its hodge-podge of different types of development. While the city of 135,000 contains subdivisions that wouldn't look out of place in Flower Mound, about half its residential properties are apartment buildings that attract a younger, less wealthy and more diverse population.\n\nDelia Parker Mims, the Denton County Democratic Party chair, lives in Lewisville. The level of political engagement is just lower in the town than in Flower Mound - so low that Mims failed to find enough people to form a local Democratic club and had to create a Lewisville-Flower Mound one to assemble a critical mass of members.\n\nMims. however, blames local Republicans who run the county for keeping turnout in Lewisville down by forcing voters to go to the polls at assigned precincts that often change location from election to election, rather than at central vote centers where anyone can vote.\n\nLewisville's comparative marginalization does not only come from its eligible voters not voting, though. One-fifth of its residents are foreign-born, and many are not citizens. That means they are shut out of the political process.\n\nThat is unnerving for some like Jose Colmenares, 56, a former Venezuelan university administrator who fled to Texas last year. He notes that one of the candidates in the presidential race, Harris, seems friendlier to migrants than Trump, who complains of an \"invasion\" of people from South America and promises mass deportations.\n\n\"All of us would support this candidate if we could,\" Colmenares said of Harris as he stood outside one of the city's Latino markets.\n\nAlex Salguero came to Lewisville from Guatemala in 1994 and started working as a mechanic. He eventually opened his own body shop in a custom-built building on a downtown corner. He is aghast at the way Trump talks about immigrants - \"it hurts our heart\" - and said many Latinos in town feel that way, but were dispirited by the complexities of the U.S. election system.\n\nHe cited 2016, when Democrat Hillary Clinton won 3 million more votes than Trump nationally but lost because Trump beat her in the Electoral College.\n\n\"That's when you go back and say, 'Why did I vote?'\" said Salguero, who remains a regular Democratic voter.\n\nIvan Barrera, 32, works in Salguero's shop and shares his boss' concern about the former president's rhetoric on immigration. Still, he is leaning toward Trump because Barrera normally votes Republican.\n\n\"I don't want nothing given to me,\" Barrera said, \"because I know nothing was given to my parents growing up.\"\n\nBarrera's trying to persuade his parents, Mexican immigrants who live outside Lewisville, to support Trump.\n\nThere's a catch. His parents have been citizens for decades, but they still are not registered to vote.\n\n___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Texas Republicans approved on Monday redrawn U.S. House maps that favor incumbents and decrease political representation for growing minority communities, even as Latinos drive much of the growth in the nation's largest red state.\n\nThe maps were approved following outcry from Democrats over what they claimed was a rushed redistricting process crammed into a 30-day session, and one which gave little time for public input. They also denounced the reduction of minority opportunity districts -- Texas will now have seven House districts where Latino residents hold a majority, down from eight -- despite the state's changing demographics.\n\n\"What we are doing in passing this congressional map is a disservice to the people of Texas,\" Democratic state Rep. Rafael Anchia said to the chamber just before the final vote.\n\nGOP Gov. Greg Abbott is expected to sign off on the changes.\n\nCivil rights groups, including the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, sued before Republican lawmakers were even done Monday. The lawsuit alleges that Republican mapmakers diluted the political strength of minority voters by not drawing any new districts where Latino residents hold a majority, despite Latinos making up half of Texas' 4 million new residents over the last decade.\n\nAbbott's office did not respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nRepublicans have said they followed the law in defending the maps, which protect their slipping grip on Texas by pulling more GOP-leaning voters into suburban districts where Democrats have made inroads in recent years.\n\nTexas has been routinely dragged into court for decades over voting maps, and in 2017, a federal court found that a Republican-drawn map was drawn to intentionally discriminate against minority voters. But two years later, that same court said there was insufficient reason to take the extraordinary step of putting Texas back under federal supervision before changing voting laws or maps.\n\nThe maps that overhaul how Texas' nearly 30 million residents are sorted into political districts - and who is elected to represent them - bookends a highly charged year in the state over voting rights. Democratic lawmakers twice walked out on an elections bill that tightened the state's already strict voting rules, which they called a brazen attempt to disenfranchise minorities and other Democratic-leaning voters.\n\nThe plan does not create any additional districts where Black or Hispanic voters make up more than 50% of the voting population, even as people of color accounted for more than 9 of 10 new residents in Texas over the past decade.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Joan Huffman, who authored the maps and leads the Senate Redistricting Committee, told fellow lawmakers that they were \"drawn blind to race.\" She said her legal team ensured the plan followed the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe Texas GOP control both chambers of the Legislature, giving them nearly complete control of the mapmaking process. The state has had to defend their maps in court after every redistricting process since the Voting Rights Act took effect in 1965, but this will be the first since a U.S. Supreme Court ruling said Texas and other states with a history of racial discrimination no longer need to have the Justice Department scrutinize the maps before they are approved.\n\nHowever, drawing maps to engineer a political advantage is not unconstitutional. The proposal would also make an estimated two dozen of the state's 38 congressional districts safe Republican districts, with an opportunity to pick up at least one additional newly redrawn Democratic stronghold on the border with Mexico, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of data from last year's election collected by the Texas Legislative Council. Currently, Republicans hold 23 of the state's 36 seats.\n\nFollowing negotiations between Texas House members and state senators, the Houston-area districts of U.S. Rep Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat who is serving her 14th term, and U.S. Rep Al Green, a neighboring Democrat, were restored, unpairing the two and drawing Jackson Lee's home back into her district.\n\nTexas lawmakers also approved redrawn maps for their own districts, with Republicans following a similar plan that does not increase minority opportunity districts and would keep their party in power in the state House and Senate.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Paul J.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Texas Republicans advanced new voting restrictions Thursday night after months of protests by Democrats, who after returning from a 38-day walkout are now all but out of ways to stop a bill that includes a ban on drive-thru voting and would empower poll watchers.\n\nThe nearly 50-page bill passed the Texas House on a 79-37 mostly party-line vote, moving fast a week after Democrats ended their holdout . Republican Gov. Greg Abbott says he will sign the measure that is on track to reach his desk by early September, if not sooner.\n\nIn what is now the GOP's third try at passing the bill since May, the atmosphere was charged. For more than 12 hours Republicans defended the changes as safeguards while Democrats, who offered a raft of rejected attempts to soften the bill, continued to say it would disproportionately impact people of color. At one heated point Republican Dade Phelan, the House speaker, interrupted lawmakers to tell them not to accuse each other of racism - or even say the word.\n\nBut in the end, the bill easily passed, just as Democrats knew it would once they returned.\n\nTexas is now set to become the last big GOP state to pass tighter voting laws driven by former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. When one exchange Thursday turned to the violent Jan. 6 Capitol riot, Republican Kyle Biedermann, who was in Washington, D.C., that day, downplayed the attack and rejected that it was an insurrection.\n\nIn seeking to stop the bill, more than 50 Democrats had gone to Washington D.C., a destination they chose to press Congress on voting rights legislation. On Wednesday, the U.S. House passed federal voting rights legislation that congressional Democrats say is progress in their quest to fight back against voting restrictions advanced in states such as Texas. But Democrats do not have the votes to overcome opposition from Senate Republicans.\n\n\"As much as you might decry our need to go to Washington, I really beg for federal protection,\" Democratic state Rep. Rafael Anchia said.\n\nSome Republicans did not hide their frustration with Democrats' refusal to return until now.\n\n\"I think you could care a little more, and should have been here,\" Republican J.M. Lozano said during one exchange with Anchia.\n\nThe bill now goes back to the state Senate, which already signed off on a similar version this month following a 15-hour filibuster by Democrat Carol Alvarado.\n\nThat was another last-ditch gambit by Texas Democrats who have virtually no legislative means left to stop new voting measures in the state - which already has some of the nation's toughest election laws. Abbott, who is up for reelection in 2022, has demanded the bill and swiftly vetoed paychecks for 2,100 legislative staffers after Democrats first blocked the legislation by walking out of the state Capitol in May.\n\nAbbott then had to call a special session to take up voting restrictions. Democrats again walked out in July, with dozens boarding private jets to the nation's capital.\n\nWithout a quorum of 100 legislators necessary to do business, Republicans were left waiting, frustrated by Democrats, but knowing time was on their side. After the 30-day special session wound down, Abbott called another one - and this time Republicans enlisted the help of law enforcement.\n\nIn the end, the bill closely resembled the same one Democrats walked out on more than a month ago. It includes a raft of tweaks and changes to the state's election code, which when taken as a whole would make it harder to cast a ballot in Texas.\n\nAmong other things, it prohibits drive-thru voting and threatens local elections officials with felony charges if they send mail-in voting applications to voters who don't request one. Many of the provisions take aim at Harris County - which includes Houston and is a major Democratic stronghold - after leaders there expanded ways to vote during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt also states that poll watchers, who are appointed by campaigns and political parties, cannot be denied \"free movement\" and makes it a crime for elections judges to obstruct them. Concerns raised by Democrats about voter intimidation and disruption were met with Republicans pointing to oaths and training that poll watchers are required to take.\n\nFor months, Texas Republicans accuse Democrats of exaggerating the bill's impact and maintain it's not driven by Trump's loss, even as some have dodged questions about whether they believe the election was stolen. Republicans point out that the latest version would require another extra hour daily of early voting, and result in more counties offering at least 12 hours of early voting on weekdays.\n\n\"Texas affords an immense amount of opportunity to vote,\" said Republican state Rep. Andrew Murr, who is carrying the bill in the House.\n\nThe bill must reach Abbott's desk by Labor Day weekend. Otherwise, Republicans will have to start over for a fourth time.\n\n___\n\nAcacia Coronado is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

(Ralph Barrera/Austin American-Statesman via AP, File)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Texas Republicans on Saturday night closed in on redrawn U.S. House maps that would shore up their eroding dominance as voters peel away from the GOP in the state's booming suburbs.\n\nIn a key late-night vote in the Texas House, Republicans gave early sign-off to new congressional boundaries that would give them more breathing room after some close calls in 2018 and 2020, while also opening a new path for the GOP along the border with Mexico.\n\nBut in a preview of legal challenges to come, Democrats spent hours blasting the maps as discriminatory and all but blind to the state's surging number of Latino residents, who made up more than half of the nearly 4 million new Texans over the past decade. Many live around Dallas and Houston, where under the GOP-engineered maps, there would be no new districts that give Latinos a majority.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Todd Hunter, who has presided over the redrawn maps in the House, defended the changes and said they comply with the law.\n\nThe maps will still need final negotiations in the coming days between the House and Senate before being sent to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who is expected to sign them.\n\nThe redrawn congressional districts would make make it easier for many incumbents to hold their seats, but critics say they also threaten Black and Hispanic communities' political influence, even as those voters drive Texas' growth. The new lines, the product of a once-in-a-decade redistricting process, create two new districts and make several less competitive for Republican lawmakers.\n\nTexas was the only state to gain two congressional seats following the 2020 census, which showed that people of color accounted for more than 9 of 10 new residents in Texas .\n\n\"Race is clearly the factor here,\" Democratic state Rep. Rafael Anchia said of how the maps were drawn. \"Not partisanship, but rather race.\"\n\nOne revision by the Texas House during hours of debate Saturday would increase the number of Hispanic voters in two districts, but those changes must still make it through another round of approval.\n\nDemocrats and voting rights advocates are preparing to challenge the maps in court in what would be yet another high-profile, high-stakes legal battle over Texas politics - already the epicenter of disputes over abortion and voting rights .\n\nRepublicans who control both chambers of the Legislature have nearly complete control of the mapmaking process. They are working from maps that experts and courts have already declared as gerrymandered in their favor, and the state has had to defend their maps in court after every redistricting process since the Voting Rights Act took effect in 1965.\n\nBut legal challenges face new hurdles this round - the first since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that Texas and other states with a history of racial discrimination no longer need to have the Justice Department scrutinize the maps before they are approved. Plaintiffs must now wait to file claims and must show that maps were intentionally meant to discriminate by race. Drawing maps to engineer a political advantage is not unconstitutional.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Joan Huffman, who authored the maps and leads the Senate Redistricting Committee, has told lawmakers they were \"drawn blind to race.\" She said her legal team ensured the proposal followed the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe proposal would make 24 of the state's 38 congressional districts safe Republican districts, with an opportunity to pick up at least one additional newly redrawn Democratic stronghold on the border with Mexico, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of data from last year's election collected by the Texas Legislative Council. Currently, Republicans hold 23 of the state's 36 seats.\n\nRepublicans with newly fortified advantages include Rep. Van Taylor, whose district in Dallas' exurbs went for President Donald Trump by a single percentage point last year. Under the new maps, Trump would have won the district by double-digits.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, who Democrats aggressively targeted the last two cycles, would now represent a solidly pro-Trump district under lines that exclude Houston's suburbs and liberal parts of Austin.\n\nAnd a long, vertically drawn district stretching from the Rio Grande Valley to San Antonio that President Joe Biden won by just over 2 percentage points would now slightly tilt toward Trump voters.\n\nIn a late-night win for Democrats, U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat who is serving her 14th term, had her home drawn back into her Houston district, which was restored nearly entirely to its former shape. So, too, was the nearby district of U.S. Rep. Al Green after both had seen longtime constituents of minority communities drawn out of their districts.\n\nTexas lawmakers are also redrawing the maps for their own districts, with Republicans following a similar plan that would keep their party in power in the state House and Senate. Those proposals are also expected to be sent to Abbott by next week.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Paul J. Weber contributed to this report.

      "text": "Texas GOP Goes All-In on Trump's Big Lie, Says Biden Is 'Acting President'\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nIt's been over 500 days since President Joe Biden was sworn into office-but some Texas Republicans still refuse to believe it.\n\nThe Republican Party of Texas over the weekend passed a resolution rejecting Biden's victory in the 2020 election in the latest attempt to further promote false voter fraud claims. The resolution was made during the party's first in-person state party convention in four years , where they voted on the official party platform that also called homosexuality \"an abnormal lifestyle choice\" and urged Texas schools to reach children \"about the humanity of the preborn child.\"\n\n\"We reject the certified results of the 2020 Presidential election, and we hold that acting President Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was not legitimately elected by the people of the United States,\" read the resolution, which was passed on Saturday. \"We strongly urge all Republicans to work to ensure election integrity and to show up to vote in November of 2022, bring your friends and family, volunteer for your local Republicans, and overwhelm any possible fraud.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe shocking platform once again promotes the far-right false belief that former President Donald Trump was the winner of the 2020 election. It comes after a week of hearing about the Jan. 6, 2021, riots that sought to overturn the electoral certification of Biden's presidency.\n\nDespite that these false election claims have repeatedly been debunked , including by many of Trump's own former aides and several unsuccessful legal battles, the Texas Republican Party still passed the resolution, which also insists the elections violated Articles 1 and 2 of the Constitution. It also notes that the group believes that \"various secretaries of state illegally circumvented their state legislatures in conducting their elections in multiple ways, including by allowing ballots to be received after November 3, 2020\" and that \"substantial election fraud in key metropolitan areas significantly affected the results in five key states in favor of\" Biden.\n\nAnd the denial of Biden's presidency wasn't the only highlight at the Republicans' convention. The party now officially, in writing, opposes \"all efforts to validate transgender identity\" and does not support the use of taxpayer funds for any \"medical gender dysphoria treatments or sex change operations.\" The resolution also urges the Texas Legislature \"to abolish abortion.\"\n\n\"The official position of the Texas schools shall be that there are only two genders: biological male and biological female,\" the resolution states. \"We oppose transgender normalizing curriculum and pronoun use. We hold that biological men shall compete against other biological men and biological women shall compete against other biological women in athletics in the public school system of Texas and at the collegiate level.\"\n\nThe state party's resolution also opposes the bipartisan gun bill currently in negotiations-noting that \"all gun control is a violation of the Second Amendment and our God given rights.\"\n\nEven Republican stalwarts like Sen. John Cornyn were not spared from the far-right. The senator was repeatedly booed by members of his own party on Friday after working with colleagues across the aisle on potential gun control legislation.\n\nIn a video taken by KHOU 11 , Cornyn was met by constant booing as he mentioned on stage that he is \"making sure that violent criminals and the mentally ill cannot buy firearms\"-even though he insisted that he was not supporting any policy that would impact Second Amendment rights. The negotiations come in the wake of the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

The letter, which TMZ has obtained, says the 11 members of the Texas Freedom Caucus have become aware of Sidley Austin \"reimbursing travel costs of employees who leave Texas to murder their unborn children.\" The letter also accused the firm of being complicit in performing illegal abortions, adding that abortion is a felony in Texas if the mother's life is not in danger. Rep. Mayes Middleton, the chair of the caucus who signed the letter, added that if Sidley Austin breaks the law, the firm and all its partners could be prosecuted and disbarred. The letter also said Sidley \"may have aided or abetted drug-induced abortions in violation of the Texas Heartbeat Act, by paying for abortions (or abortion-related travel) in which the patient ingested the second drug in Texas after receiving the drugs from an out-of-state provider.\" The message said there is litigation already underway to find out the identity of the lawyers who are responsible for the Texas Heartbeat Act breach.\n\nBreaking News Editor\n\ndan.hall@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "White Supremacist Nick Fuentes is Causing Chaos Inside Texas Youth GOP\n\nA simmering civil war among Texas's young Republicans came to a boil this month after a prominent GOP donor was seen meeting with white supremacist influencer Nick Fuentes .\n\nFuentes, a Holocaust denier who has fantasized on livestreams about marrying a child , took an hours-long meeting with a prominent conservative donor on Oct. 6, the Texas Tribune reported this month. News of the meeting set off a wave of accusations between factions of activist Republicans in the state. Now state lawmakers are condemning one of those factions as its members flee to a rival young Republican group.\n\nFuentes met for several hours with Jonathan Stickland , then-president of the ultraconservative Texas donor group Defend Texas Liberty, the Tribune first reported. The Tribune also photographed Kyle Rittenhouse entering the building, although a gun rights group later stated that he was attending a meeting with them, not Fuentes. Fuentes was driven to the appointment by Chris Russo, president of the group Texans for Strong Borders. (None of the attendees have commented on the meeting. Defend Texas Liberty announced a new president this week , who did not return a request for comment on Stickland's current status with the organization.)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe meeting was not Fuentes' first encounter with well-connected Texas Republicans, some of the state's conservatives noted. This summer, the state's largest youth conservative organization underwent a schism after some members accused peers of being Fuentes fans.\n\nIn August , the Texas Young Republican Federation (TYRF) voted to disassociate from the Republican Party of Texas (RPT), over what the TYRF claimed were troll tactics by RPT chair Matt Rinaldi. The young Republicans group accused Rinaldi of \"intiat[ing] a smear campaign\" against their leader, whom Rinaldi mocked for making a video in 2020 stating that \"Black lives matter.\" (Rinaldi was in the same building as Fuentes during the Stickland meeting, but has said he did not attend the meeting, and that he condemns Fuentes.)\n\nDuring that breakup , some smaller youth Republican groups also broke from the TYRF. Some of that divide was due to members of splinter groups promoting far-right or openly neo-Nazi content, including posts praising Fuentes, writer Amanda Moore reported last week .\n\nThose splinter groups formed their own rival young conservative coalition called the Young Republicans of Texas (YRT), which cast itself as the more MAGA alternative to the TYRF. (Neither the TYRF nor the YRT returned requests for comment.)\n\nTexas's State Republican Executive Committee (SREC) voted to partner with the YRT in September , with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton praising the hard-right group as \"the newest generation of Young Republicans.\"\n\nBut after Fuentes' meeting with Stickland, some of Texas's Republican brass is revisiting YRT's ties to the white supremacist internet personality.\n\nIn a Wednesday letter to Rinaldi, two members of the Texas Executive Committee urged the state party to distance itself from the ascendant YRT.\n\n\"Because it has become clear that the YRT has actively recruited and embraced into its leadership individuals who support self-avowed Neo-Nazi White Supremacists, the Republican Party of Texas must separate from this group, as they do not represent the core values of the Republican Party of Texas,\" the letter read.\n\nAmong the Executive Committee members' concerns were a YRT leader who \"openly affiliates with antisemites\" online, as well as another prominent member who \"is a public supporter of Adolf Hitler, making public statements such as 'National cold brew day AND Hitler's bday?! It's a great day indeed' and 'I'm antisemitic.'\" (The Republican Party of Texas did not return a request for comment.)\n\nAt least two YRT chapters also dropped out of the organization after the Fuentes meeting, and encouraged the state Republican party to cut ties with the YRT.\n\nThe Gulf Coast and Rural Young Republicans groups issued a joint statement last Thursday announcing their departure from YRT, alleging that \"mismanagement and untruthfulness plagued the new organization from the outset.\"\n\n\"Allegations were made that the new organization contained several members that do not reflect our values or the Republican Party of Texas' values,\" the two groups wrote . \"Initially, we dismissed this concern as a concerted smear effort but subsequent reporting revealed that our chapters were misled and that these members were, in fact, involved. Knowing this, our chapters have decided to disaffiliate from the Young Republicans of Texas. In additional to disaffiliating from the Young Republicans of Texas, we encourage the SREC to consider eliminating partnership auxiliary statuses for youth organizations.\"\n\nThe two now-ex YRT groups are working to join the TYRF, according to the TYRF's chair .\n\nIn their letter to Rinaldi, the two Executive Committee members said state Republicans had heard troubling allegations against YRT members, but moved ahead with the partnership.\n\n\"During the rushed SREC vetting process of YRT, concerned activists came forward with troubling information regarding the charter members of the organization,\" their letter alleges.\n\n\"Those concerns were not given full weight, and now YRT itself admits what many of us suspected all along: the ranks of YRT are infested with avowed antisemites and neo-Nazi sympathizers.\"\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify Kyle Rittenhouse's presence at a building where Nick Fuentes was attending meetings.\n\nkelly.weill@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Colin Allred, CNN and NBC News have reported.\n\nThe two-term GOP senator was expected to win a third, although polling had tightened in the days leading up to the election-suggesting that Allred, a former NFL linebacker, had a chance to flip the seat in the ordinarily red Lone Star State.\n\nBut despite Allred's impressive fundraising efforts, Cruz kept his margin tight among women voters-winning 47 percent to Allred's 51, exit polls showed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThose polls also showed that Cruz made gains among Latinos; 52 percent said they voted for the Republican, as opposed to just 35 percent in 2018.\n\nA Democrat has not won a statewide election in Texas since 1994.\n\nCruz suffered a scare in 2018 when Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke-another fundraising magnet-lost by fewer than three points.\n\nAs in that race, the Democratic party's national groups, who have seen Texas as a future battleground, poured millions into Allred's campaign as he slammed Cruz over his support for Texas' six-week abortion ban.\n\nAllred also tried to flip the script when it came to immigration, pointing to Cruz's failure to support a bipartisan border deal.\n\n\"No one is more self-serving, more disconnected from Texans than Ted Cruz,\" Allred said at the state's Democratic Convention in June. \"Ted Cruz is the ultimate me guy.\"\n\nCruz, for his part, attempted to link Allred to the Biden-Harris campaign on issues like immigration and transgender athletes in women's sports.\n\nThe Republican, though he was favored, didn't take a win for granted ahead of the election.\n\n\"Texas is a battlefield,\" he told Texas Republicans in July. \"It's easy to be complacent. One of the real mistakes people make in politics is they have a recency bias. They say well, whatever things have been recently, that's what it's going to be forever.\"\n\nBut when the dust settled, Cruz declared his win over Allred on Tuesday night.\n\n\"This decisive victory should shake the Democrat establishment to its core,\" he told his supporters at a rally in Houston, The Texas Tribune reported.\n\nCruz made a name for himself early in his Senate career as a highly conservative and outspoken rabble-rouser, known for his strongly-worded speeches.\n\nAlthough he was a vocal critic of Donald Trump as the two competed for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, Cruz has since aligned himself with the now-GOP nominee.\n\nNews Reporter\n\nliam.archacki@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott Is Pushing Republicans Across the Country to the Extreme Right\n\nEverything is bigger in Texas, including a radicalized , weaponized, and emboldened GOP's audacious abuse of power to fuel their culture wars and subvert democracy.\n\nIf you want to see a sneak preview of the GOP's national project to maintain white, minority rule then look no further than Texas, the second-most populous state in the nation, that now serves as a trendsetter for Republican state legislatures across the nation.\n\nTexas Republicans, led by Gov. Greg Abbott and Sen. Ted Cruz, are committed to one-upping their colleagues by introducing the most extreme versions of voter suppression, open carry laws, anti-abortion bills, and critical race theory (CRT) bans. Although the state serves as a massive warning for Democrats and the majority of Americans of what will happen when Republicans dominate the state legislature, it also reveals insights into how activists and organizers can creatively resist and advocate for popular, progressive policies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Lone Star State has become the \"laboratory\" for GOP politicians and their hard-right agenda, according to Democrat Ben Chou, who is running to be Commissioner of Harris County Precinct 4. \"This is all for a national platform for when they go into the Republican primary,\" Chou said, predicting Abbott and Cruz are nursing 2024 presidential ambitions and trying to \"one-up\" their conservative competition, which includes Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida.\n\nLike a reality-TV competition from hell, Texas Republicans are showing off their skills.\n\nThey're first flexing with voter suppression. \"More than 440 bills with provisions that restrict voting access have been introduced in 49 states in the 2021 legislative sessions,\" according to the Brennan Center of Justice which tracks the GOP's voter suppression efforts across the nation. Texas is leading the way.\n\nUnder the guise of fighting voter fraud, which is almost nonexistent, Texas Republicans passed Senate Bill 1, which restricts the state's voting process, narrows local control of elections, and implements absurd voting ID requirements that negatively impact Democrats and voters of color. As an example, in diverse and multi-racial Harris County, nearly 16% of the 1,276 absentee ballot applications received for the upcoming primary elections were rejected for failing to meet the new ID requirements. For perspective, in the 2018 Texas primary, only 2.5 percent of 4,800 applications were rejected , according to election officials. Fewer people can vote, which means the bill is working exactly as planned.\n\nThe Texas GOP is becoming more extreme because they are responding to their radicalized base, says Azra Siddiqui, president of Wise Up Texas, a non-partisan non-profit that empowers and educates Texans of South Asian descent to partake in civic engagement.\n\nTake Sen. Cruz's masochistic groveling before Tucker Carlson's audience on Fox News , where he backtracked from a previous statement where he correctly referred to the January 6th violent insurrection as a \"terrorist attack.\" A few days later, Sen. Cruz was born again hard, and he shamelessly peddled Carlson's \"false flag\" conspiracy theory at a Senate hearing questioning DOJ officials.\n\nAs for Gov. Abbott, Siddiqui believes he was pushed further to the right after being primaried by hard-right candidates, such as former Rep. Allen West, whose \"far-right primary voters actually show up to the polls for the primary.\" As a result, Abbott criticized vaccine and mask mandates and banned any Texas entity, including private employers, from requiring the vaccine .\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton followed up by launching lawsuits against President Biden's federal vaccine orders for the National Guard. In turn, these anti-mask and anti-vaccine regulations have harmed progressive activism, according to Texas Democrat Jen Ramos, State Democratic Executive Committee (SDEC) committeewoman for Senate District 21. Before the pandemic, she said, \"it wasn't easy for the GOP to push through their bills without pushback.\" In previous years, progressive groups and allies were always protesting at the Texas Capitol against GOP bills. More recently, she said progressives were being outnumbered in testimony ten to one because many didn't feel safe or comfortable going to the Capitol, where even the Texas state troopers didn't wear masks in the building.\n\nTexas serves as a warning for Democrats across the nation to pay particular attention to state legislature races. Currently, both houses in Texas have a Republican majority. As a result, the GOP controls redistricting.\n\n\"Gerrymandering exists and we're screwed when it comes to the state legislature. We're not going to win a majority there any time soon,\" Chou said. \"The GOP essentially has never advocated for a fair and representative democracy,\" Ramos told me. However, with Republicans' consolidation of power, Ramos says their new position is, basically, \"We don't have repercussions anymore, so we're just going to run for it.\"\n\nThat includes passing a dangerous and reckless open-carry bill that could weaponize the most unhinged among us. Before 2020, Siddiqui couldn't imagine that moderate Republicans would pass the open-carry bill, which allows Texans to carry handguns in public without permits or undergoing training. That it was signed into law by Gov. Abbott \"was very shocking for a lot of us.\" It's proof that what were once the radicalized fringes of the GOP are now its center.\n\n\"This past legislative session was the most far-right that I've ever seen,\" Siddiqui said, citing the introduction of the Texas abortion law, SB8, which allows private citizens to sue anyone who facilitates an abortion after six weeks, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Anyone who succeeds in their claim can be awarded $10,000 by a court. The law has halted most abortions in Texas and serves as a template for Republicans across the nation, especially after the conservative majority of the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear objections to the law-effectively leaving it in place.\n\nFurthermore, the Texas bill was a model used by Gov. DeSantis in Florida for his recent Stop WOKE Act, which allows parents the right to sue teachers if they believe their kids are being taught critical race theory, and to collect attorneys if they succeed in their lawsuit. Not to be outdone, Gov. Abbott just trumped him with a new \" Parental Bill of Rights \" which gives Texas parents more control of their children's education, including decisions about the course curriculum, especially concerning topics about race and LGBTQ+ issues. The bill will allow parents to stop educators from providing books depicting same-sex relationships, which are described as \" pornographic materials .\"\n\nThe pivot for Democrats in Texas isn't to necessarily chase moderates or abandon their progressive policies. Ramos cites the example of \"rising star\" Lena Hidalgo , a 30-year-old country judge in Harris County, the third-most populous county in the United States, who according to Ramos won \"against all odds\" against incumbent Ed Emmett, a well-liked Republican and one of the largest executives in Houston. Hidalgo is the first woman and Latina to be elected to the office. Ramos says Hidalgo is an example of a young woman who is progressive, unapologetic about her Latinx heritage, young-and all those factors were assets that helped her win mainly because she focused on issues that people cared about. As a result, she's been able to fight back against the GOP and advocate for COVID safety protocols, which Ramos credits with saving lives.\n\nChou recommends Democrats focus on counties and cities, where they can push back against the Republican-dominated state legislature, which only meets for five months every two years and thus can't spend their entire time restricting their efforts. \"Up until that next legislative session, we in counties, we plot, we strategize, and we start enacting policies,\" he said. Democrats in Harris County, for example, put a polling location in the county jail because nearly two-thirds of the people are there because they are poor and can't afford bail but can still legally vote. They did this without publicity.\n\nIn the end, Democrats have to give people a reason to come out and vote for them, and that means focusing on issues that concern them. They can't simply rely on people of color-especially Latinos-to show up just because a significant and disturbing number of Republicans are aggressively xenophobic and hateful. In fact, some troubling data shows that the GOP has been able to win over Latino voters recently, focusing on issues concerning the economy, immigration, and the culture wars.\n\nRamos says it's a good lesson to remember that Latinos are not a monolith, and Texas Latinos \"feel disenfranchised regardless of representation,\" with politicians often ignoring community concerns about health care, transportation, and safe drinking water. She said Latino voters will show up for \"whoever actually advocates for issues that affect our communities-job security, livable wage, and food on the table.\"\n\nA great hope and test for Democrats is the upcoming governor's race featuring former Rep. Beto O'Rourke. Both Ramos and Chou believe O'Rourke has a shot, having mobilized grassroots communities, specifically leaning heavily into health care and rural broadband, and avoiding right-wing bait on divisive culture war issues.\n\nAlthough it seems hopeless for Democrats in Texas, Ramos urged people not to ignore Texas as unwinnable or dismiss it as a radically conservative state. Texas is far from a left-leaning state, she said, but Democrats are still mobilized, especially in large metropolitan areas where there is still hope for systemic change.\n\nHowever, hope is no longer enough for Democrats. If they really want to mobilize the majority and push back against a radicalized GOP, they have to step up, organize, fight back, strategize and finally deliver for increasingly disillusioned voters, who are tired of false promises and empty slogans.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "This GOP Rep.'s Anti-Abortion Stances Keep Vanishing From Her Website\n\nDeputy Politics Editor\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nIn 2020, Monica De La Cruz was, like most Republican candidates for office, a vocal opponent of abortion rights. Campaigning for a swing U.S. House seat in south Texas that year, De La Cruz proclaimed her belief that human life begins at conception. On her campaign website's issues page , \"Pro-Life\" was listed at the top.\n\n\"As your Congresswoman I promise to fight for each and every soul and to always support the sanctity of life,\" she wrote.\n\nNow, four years later, De La Cruz is an incumbent congresswoman running to keep her seat in a competitive race. But on her campaign website, you won't find her absolutist anti-abortion position. In fact, you won't find any mention of abortion anywhere on De La Cruz's website at all.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAcross three election cycles since 2020, De La Cruz appears to have gradually scrubbed abortion-related content from her online platform, making the language more ambiguous and less prominent until it disappeared, according to a Daily Beast review of internet archives.\n\nBy February 2022, for instance, \"Pro-Life\" was no longer a listed issue on her campaign site. It was replaced instead by a \"Constitutional Values\" section where she vaguely promised to fight for \"the Right to Life,\" along with vowing to \"stand strong for our Second Amendment\" and ensure \"true Freedom of Speech is protected.\"\n\nNow, ahead of what will likely be a competitive re-election race, De La Cruz's website currently contains no abortion language whatsoever.\n\nIn 2020, De La Cruz lost to Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX), but when he changed districts in 2022, she easily defeated her Democratic opponent. Texas' 15th District, which Donald Trump won by 3 points in 2020, is currently rated as \"competitive\" in 2024 by the Cook Political Report.\n\nApproached on Wednesday in the Capitol, De La Cruz insisted to The Daily Beast that anti-abortion advocacy remains \"a very important issue for us and for our district\"-one that she \"absolutely\" plans to highlight this cycle. She said the removal of abortion references may be due to work on a \"campaign site launch,\" but advised The Daily Beast to follow up with her campaign.\n\nWhen the Daily Beast reached out to De La Cruz's campaign to ask, campaign manager Andrew Baughman simply said, \"We have nothing to add to her statement.\"\n\nThe abortion issue's disappearing act on De La Cruz's website is a tidy example of broader Republican efforts to change the conversation on a losing issue. Since the Supreme Court revoked the national right to an abortion in 2022, Republicans have lost races across the country -including in GOP strongholds -as Democrats brand candidates as agents of an extreme anti-abortion agenda.\n\nAhead of 2024, Democrats intend to lean heavily on that playbook as an electoral silver bullet. By tapping into continued voter alarm over abortion access, the party's candidates and various campaign arms are banking they can not only win seats like De La Cruz's and re-capture the House, but keep the Senate and potentially re-elect an unpopular President Joe Biden .\n\nVulnerable Republicans now face a pivotal decision on how to handle the issue: champion their long-held anti-abortion positions on the trail and face voter wrath at the polls, or skirt the subject and abandon an issue critical to much of the GOP base.\n\nThe freshman Republican is not the only politician to get caught scrubbing their website of anti-abortion language or content. Ahead of the 2022 election, several GOP candidates for office-such as Blake Masters in Arizona and Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania- did the same thing .\n\nLast year, Pennsylvania state Rep. Rob Mercuri, who is seeking to challenge freshman Rep. Chris DeLuzio (D-PA) in a Pittsburgh-area swing seat, was busted by a graduate student for removing any mention of abortion from his website.\n\nDe La Cruz's changes, of course, did not happen in a vacuum. They track closely with the rise in voter backlash to conservative efforts to roll back abortion rights, both nationally and in her home state of Texas.\n\nIn September 2021, before De La Cruz modified the abortion language on her site for the first time, Texas Republicans' S.B. 8, which banned abortion in the state after five weeks of pregnancy, took effect. The legislation dominated local news cycles for weeks.\n\nBy February 2022, the nation braced for a potentially seismic ruling in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson , which the Supreme Court heard in December 2021. With a conservative court primed to overturn Roe v. Wade , political operatives on both sides were preparing to fight out a 2022 midterm campaign around the issue of abortion access and the GOP's efforts to roll them back.\n\nOf course, that's exactly what happened-and that November, Democrats delivered stinging defeats to Republicans in an election which was predicted to be a \"red wave.\" Sorting through the disappointing results , many Republicans publicly called for the party to figure out a better way to communicate with voters about their positions, resulting in plenty of debate and finger-pointing between factions of the party.\n\nDe La Cruz, apparently, has decided-at least for now-that saying nothing about abortion on her campaign platform is better than saying anything.\n\nThat approach goes against the latest advice from National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Richard Hudson (R-NC), who is tasked with protecting the GOP's House majority in 2024. As Republicans defend themselves from a blitz of Democratic attacks casting them as anti-abortion zealots , Hudson told Punchbowl News in a recent interview that Republicans need to be upfront about where they stand.\n\n\"[Candidates] need to articulate their position to the voters, because the voters think the Republican position is like, 'We'll throw you in jail if you get an abortion,'\" Hudson told Punchbowl.\n\nIn 2020, even before the abortion rights groundswell, De La Cruz' pro-life rhetoric didn't seem to help her win. In her first campaign that year, she lost to Gonzalez by roughly 3 points.\n\nDe La Cruz campaigned on a staunchly pro-life platform, hitting Gonzalez for his votes with Democrats on abortion-related issues. In a 2020 Facebook rant De La Cruz called \"Truthful Tuesday,\" she touted her endorsement from National Right to Life, a lead anti-abortion organization, and suggested Gonzalez was a \"sicko\" for his vote against a GOP anti-abortion messaging bill.\n\nLike most states, Texas redrew congressional district lines ahead of the 2022 midterms. Gonzalez moved to a neighboring district, paving the way for De La Cruz to beat Democrat Michelle Vallejo by 9 points.\n\nWhile in office, De La Cruz has consistently backed Republican-led anti-abortion policies-all of which have been stonewalled by the Senate's Democratic majority. For her voting record, she nabbed an A+ rating from anti-abortion advocacy group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\n\nThis cycle, Vallejo is running again-one of several Democrats vying to challenge De La Cruz -and hitting her hard on abortion.\n\n\"It's not right for politicians like [Texas Gov.] Greg Abbott or Monica De La Cruz or [Texas Sen.] Ted Cruz to be involved in these very private decisions,\" Vallejo said in a recent interview with Roll Call .\n\nDeputy Politics Editor\n\nSam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nriley.rogerson@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Texas Republicans' New Push to Ban Trans Teens From Playing Sports\n\nToday, Texas brings lawmakers back to Austin for yet another special session to reconsider its latest proposed discriminatory ban on transgender student-athletes and five other bills that would threaten gender-affirming health care.\n\nIf this sounds like a rerun, that's because it is. Texas is one of dozens of states that considered anti-trans bills this year but try as they might, not one has passed the state legislature... yet. And they certainly did try: As The 19th reported , Texas lawmakers introduced the greatest number of anti-trans bills in the country this year, more than 40 bills-triple any other state. And despite not being passed, 29 of those bills are still pending .\n\nRight now, eight states have restrictive laws on the books , or executive orders, banning trans kids from competing with cisgender classmates in school sports: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Mississippi, Tennessee, South Dakota, and West Virginia. Legal challenges are underway in Arkansas , Florida , Tennessee , and West Virginia . So far, only Arkansas passed a law restricting transgender health care and that has been blocked by a federal judge.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe bill before the special session is Texas House Bill 24 , introduced on Sept. 9 by former Baptist minister Rep. Bryan Slaton of East Texas. It would restrict participation on interscholastic teams beginning in kindergarten. Children and teenage athletes could only play sports that correspond with their sex assigned at birth or listed on their official birth certificate issued at or near the time of their birth.\n\n\"Over the course of all three special sessions the Governor has asked legislators to pass legislation that would exclude transgender youth from normal school activities, in this case K-12 sports,\" Rachel Hill, community outreach and engagement manager of Equality Texas , told The Daily Beast. \"No child deserves to be excluded from their peers. It's especially out-of-touch to debate who is allowed to play sports while schools across the state are shutting down everything-including school sports-to cope with the spike in COVID-19 cases.\"\n\nAs Hill sees it, since schools in Texas aren't even offering sports, the reason Gov. Greg Abbott keeps bringing this issue back to the legislature is that it's not about sports, at all. \"This is a concentrated campaign to dehumanize and ostracize transgender youth in exchange for a few votes in a Republican primary,\" said Hill in a post on the Equality Texas website .\n\nThe debate over trans youth is one of five topics to be tackled during the special session that begins Monday, including the key issue of redistricting . \"The Texas Legislature now has the opportunity to redraw legislative and congressional districts in accordance with the new census numbers,\" Abbott said in a statement.\n\nThe others are how to allocate $16 billion in federal COVID-19 relief funds and the controversial decision as to whether state or local governments can mandate COVID-19 vaccines as the federal government has done. Another agenda item is a ban on chaining dogs outside.\n\nGov. Abbott vetoed that animal cruelty bill this summer, calling it \"micro-managing and over-criminalization.\" But it's the Texas approach to chaining children to the gender they were presumed to be at birth that should sound alarm bells. These proposals give a whole new meaning to \"micro-managing and over-criminalization.\"\n\nThe other five anti-trans bills to be considered in this special session threaten to ban life-saving health care for children and teens who identify as transgender and nonbinary. One even goes so far as to ban mental health counseling that affirms their existence. And to those who scoff at the word \"existence,\" let's be clear: Living in a gender that is incongruous with what one knows to be true, whether it be at an early age or in middle age, is tantamount to not existing.\n\nIt's one reason why 42 percent of LGBTQ youth say they seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, including more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth .\n\nThe Trevor Project , which provided that grim statistic, issued a new research paper this week looking at why so few LGBTQ youth participate in school and community sports . Many respondents to the organization's latest national survey cite discrimination and the fear of being mistreated as reasons. Only 32 percent of the 35,000 respondents said they ever participated in sports at school or as part of a club, compared to the majority of the broader population of U.S. youth. One young person explained, \"I avoided athletic activities out of terror, not disinterest.\"\n\nDuring the regular legislative session that ended May 31, the Trans Lifeline suicide and crisis prevention hotline recorded a 72 percent increase in calls from Texas area codes, compared to May 2020.\n\nThe threat to trans children isn't just from self-harm, either, as advocate and athlete Chris Mosier tweeted in April.\n\n\"Every time these politicians have renewed their push for anti-transgender legislation, I have thought about Leon, a 9 year old trans boy whose family had to leave Texas because they felt unsafe ( as reported by The Daily Beast ), or Libby who has been coming to the Capitol for five years to ask legislators to stop attacking her,\" said Ricardo Martinez, CEO of Equality Texas , in a post on Instagram. \"I think about Aidelen Evans, Tiffany Thomas, Iris Santos, and Miss Coco Chanel Wortham-all transgender Texans who have tragically lost their lives to violence in 2021.\"\n\nIt's only September, and those four names have brought the national toll of transgender murders to at least 36, according to the Human Rights Campaign . That means 2021 is already on track to match or exceed the horrifying death toll of 2020, when at least 44 individuals identifying as trans were murdered for being who they are. The majority of them were Black women.\n\nEquality Texas has issued a \"Free to Be Me\" toolkit to protect students' rights , and suggests allies call Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan, and urge him to not move the anti-trans bills to the floor.\n\n\"Trans kids, their parents, trans adults, and allies all across the country are watching in horror as the Texas legislature begins yet another session with trans youth in the crosshairs,\" advocate Debi Jackson of Missouri told The Daily Beast. Jackson is raising a transgender daughter, Avery, who has been in the national spotlight since 2014, when Jackson gave an impassioned speech about how she came to accept that her child is transgender and a girl.\n\n\"Attacks on the rights and humanity of trans kids have been at an all time high in state after state this year, and we are all scared,\" Jackson said. \"Even families in 'safe states' know that the hate could spread. Our children's mental health is suffering, knowing that elected officials all over our country deem them as unworthy of equal rights. We are angry, exhausted, and praying that the Texas legislature will finally end without adding to the harm.\"\n\ndawnennis@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "The Drama in This Crazy Texas Primary Explains Trump's GOP\n\nDeputy Politics Editor\n\nBefore he was a candidate for Congress, Christian Collins was like a lot of Republicans: Wondering if his party's anti-immigrant message was slowly strangling its future.\n\nOn the heels of Mitt Romney's defeat in the 2012 presidential election, Collins wrote a thesis for his graduate program at Liberty University that dissected how the GOP's rhetoric toward Hispanic immigrants affected their view of the party.\n\n\"He neglected to make Hispanics feel included in his vision for America,\" Collins wrote of Romney. \"Republicans obviously need to do something, because what they have been doing is not working.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRepublicans, of course, did something: The opposite. Donald Trump later won the presidency by pouring gas on the \"nativist drift\" that Collins had decried in his thesis.\n\nMeanwhile, Collins himself has totally rejected his own advice from 2013. Now claiming the mantle of a MAGA warrior, he's running a campaign for a Houston-area congressional seat using anti-immigration rhetoric that makes Romney's comments look quaint .\n\nIn this competitive GOP primary in a ruby-red district, that's hardly a liability. What is a liability is the fact that Collins once advocated the position that Republicans should moderate their tone on immigration.\n\nCollins has acted accordingly.\n\nHis paper, for instance, is not available on Liberty's website-a notice on the thesis page says it has been \"withdrawn.\" And in January, Breitbart News ran a story on how Collins had \"ditched\" his \"pro-amnesty thesis\" in favor of a \"hardline immigration agenda,\" featuring quotes from the candidate distancing himself from those ideas.\n\nSuch are the moves necessary for an ambitious candidate to succeed in today's GOP. And in the primary in Texas' 8th District-one of the party's most hotly contested internal contests anywhere-the entire Trump-era Republican playbook is on display. On steroids.\n\n\"It's a national primary, despite the fact that it's in a sleepy little part of East Texas,\" said Brandon Rottinghaus, a professor of political science at the University of Houston.\n\n\"Especially given where it is in this very red part of Texas, you have to give an edge to the candidate who can appeal to the most conservative issues,\" he continued. \"They're looking for a bomb-thrower, they're looking for the next Ted Cruz.\"\n\nThe two leading candidates in the crowded primary field are Collins and former Navy SEAL Morgan Luttrell, and they are racing to win over the district's GOP base ahead of the March 1 primary, which observers like Rottinghaus are calling a toss-up contest.\n\nWith very little daylight between the two frontrunners on ideology, or on the most important thing in today's GOP-fealty to Trump-the contest in Texas' 8th District has become an increasingly personal and bitter fight over what constitutes a real Republican these days. And the choice that primary voters make could actually signal what kind of Republican that safely red seats like this one will send to Congress this year.\n\nBoth candidates have solid credentials. Collins is a conservative political operative who has worked for notable Texas Republicans, like Cruz. Aside from his time in the Navy, Luttrell-whose brother Marcus' service in Afghanistan inspired the film Lone Survivor -worked for former Energy Secretary and Texas Gov. Rick Perry in the Trump administration.\n\nThe respective Twitter feeds of both candidates feature separate grip-and-grin photos with Trump during his recent visit to the district for a rally. They both feature invocations of the \"Let's go Brandon\" mantra that the right uses as a not-terribly-clever-but-politically-correct stand-in for \"Fuck Joe Biden.\" At a recent candidate forum, both denied the reality that Biden actually won the election. Trump has not endorsed in the race so far.\n\nBut in important matters of signaling and strategy, the two have come across differently to observers-and those differences have helped make this campaign for a safe Republican seat into a bruising, and potentially expensive, intra-party battle.\n\nPerhaps the defining point of contention between the two in the homestretch of the race involves not any pressing local issue or policy difference, but whether Luttrell deserves the toxic RINO label-a \"Republican In Name Only\"-because he reportedly solicited a campaign contribution from Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), one of the GOP's few remaining Trump critics in office.\n\nLuttrell has denied this, but Collins has played this up ruthlessly on social media and at candidate forums. At a recent debate , Collins charged that Kinzinger was a \"traitor to our country;\" Luttrell responded by saying he doesn't agree with Kinzinger but highlighted the congressman's military service. \"He fought in a war for his country. Did you?\" Luttrell said. \"No, you didn't.\"\n\nLuttrell's supporters are watching the mudslinging through gritted teeth. Matt Wiltshire, a local Republican activist who formerly advised Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), a prominent Luttrell backer, says Collins is trying to make the race into \"this RINO versus Establishment idiocy.\" To start calling lifelong conservatives like Luttrell RINOs just \"to score political points is just really silly,\" he said.\n\nWhat's more, Wiltshire told The Daily Beast, he has known Collins for three years through conservative politics in the Houston area, and he feels the current \"America First\" posturing is hollow. \"It's not the man that I thought I knew three years ago,\" he said. \"Everything I've seen feels calculated.\"\n\nAsked to respond, Collins, through a spokesman, said, \"I am not surprised these things would come from Matt Wiltshire\" and called him an \"anti-Trump activist hack.\" He did not comment further on his past support for immigration reform, but called The Daily Beast \"fake news.\"\n\nCollins would hardly be the first Republican in recent years to have abandoned moderate principles to seek the favor of the party base. But these days, GOP diehards have seemed more concerned with things like the alleged support of an Illinois congressman deemed a \"traitor\" than past support for policy positions that are anathema.\n\nNot only has Collins won over the base, he has put icons of the Trumpian far right at the heart of his campaign.\n\nAmong Collins' endorsers are Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Madison Cawthorn (R-NC). On Feb. 19, his campaign is hosting a rally with that duo and a number of MAGA movement heroes, including some of its most fringe characters, such as Arizona state senator Wendy Rogers. He has also appeared frequently with Cruz at campaign stops in the district.\n\nNeither Greene nor Cawthorn responded to a request for comment on Collins' past support of amnesty for undocumented immigrants. But on Tuesday, Greene did name-check Collins in an appearance on Steve Bannon's podcast, an influential platform for the fringe.\n\nIf Collins is aligning with a GOP caucus seemingly more fired-up about posting than policy , Luttrell has positioned himself as a more traditional leader. Although his political stances hit the high notes for today's GOP base-vaccine mandates, \"election integrity,\" and the like-he has aimed to look and sound more like a serious officeholder by emphasizing certain local issues.\n\nRottinghaus, the University of Houston professor, said Collins is presenting himself as a \"Cruz-style pugilist,\" while Luttrell brings a \"modest nuance to conservative politics, edging more toward base concerns for people.\"\n\nLuttrell's endorsements also reflect how the race has become a proxy battle between competing power centers in Trump's Republican Party. Perry, a close personal friend as well as a former boss, is an enthusiastic backer. So is Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is personally very close to the ex-president, and Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-TX), the former White House doctor turned MAGA firebrand.\n\nEspecially prominent among Luttrell's endorsers is his fellow Navy SEAL and neighboring congressman, Crenshaw. During the campaign, Crenshaw has highlighted Collins' about-face on immigration, telling the Texas Tribune that \"his opinions change with the political winds.\"\n\nCrenshaw has been a loyal backer of Trump's, but in recent months, he has openly swung at Republicans, such as those backing Collins. At an event in December, Crenshaw called out \"grifters\" and \"performance artists\" within the House GOP. Luttrell happened to be present. In a subsequent spat, Crenshaw called Greene a \"Democrat, or an idiot\" as the Georgia congresswoman attacked him for supporting the use of FEMA resources for COVID-19 testing.\n\nBut Crenshaw himself has become a factor in the race, with some of Collins' backers putting up billboards reminding voters of his support for Luttrell .\n\nUltimately, whoever wins this seat is guaranteed to be far Trumpier than its current occupant, retiring Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX), a wonky lawmaker who is better known for his views on tax policy than, say, the efficacy of the COVID vaccine or the integrity of the 2020 election.\n\nNine other candidates are in the race, but the only one with significant resources is another veteran, Jonathan Hullihan, who touts the backing of far-right Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ).\n\nAcross the country, other longtime Republicans in the House and Senate are on their way out of office this year, and in many places, GOP primary voters will have the definitive say about who replaces them. It's why a number of Republicans and other political observers are closely watching the race in Texas' 8th.\n\n\"The issues are less important than the trust that people put in these candidates,\" Rottinghaus said. \"Anything that undercuts the message that they're true believers is troublesome for those candidates.\"\n\nDeputy Politics Editor\n\nSam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Texas Republicans open to death penalty for abortion providers\n\nGOP convention votes on wide-ranging platform including striking law protecting abortion providers from being charged with murder\n\nTexas Republicans are open to applying the death penalty to abortion providers, a new proposal from the state party indicates.\n\nOver the weekend, during the Texas GOP convention, Republican delegates voted on a party platform for 2024 that proclaims \"abortion is not healthcare, it is homicide\" and suggests striking a state law that protects abortion providers from being charged with homicide. In Texas, capital murder is punishable by the death penalty. Killing a child under the age of 15 can qualify as capital murder , the most severe form of homicide.\n\nElsewhere in the platform, the Texas GOP calls for \"legislation to abolish abortion by immediately securing the right to life and equal protection of the laws to all preborn children from the moment of fertilization\".\n\nThat language, as highlighted by the feminist writer Jessica Valenti , who first called attention to it earlier this week, draws from the rhetoric of \"abortion abolitionists\", a fringe, hardline segment of the anti-abortion movement that has inched closer to the mainstream in recent years . While the mainstream anti-abortion movement typically supports exempting women seeking abortions from punishment, abortion abolitionists adhere to what they consider a more consistent line of logic: if a fetus is a person and abortion is murder, then abortion patients deserve to be punished like murderers.\n\nAbortion patients are not mentioned in the provision in the proposed platform that redefines abortion as homicide, making its implications for abortion seekers unclear. Abortion bans typically target abortion providers for punishment, not patients.\n\nPunishing women for abortions is a politically toxic stance, particularly as support for abortion rights has surged in the wake of the overturning of Roe v Wade. Even before Roe fell, Texas lawmakers repeatedly introduced bills that would have instituted the death penalty for abortion patients. They all stalled out in the Republican-dominated state legislature.\n\nRegardless of the platform's implications for abortion patients, adding language that in effect defines fetuses as people, complete with full legal rights and protections, could have vast implications for wide swaths of Texas law, including cutting off access to in vitro fertilization. Efforts to establish \"fetal personhood\" have sped up in anti-abortion circles in recent years, but experts say that the full implications of this ideology have never been realized. Earlier this year, IVF treatments in Alabama temporarily ground to a halt after the state supreme court ruled frozen embryos were \"intrauterine children\".\n\nAs the home to one in 10 American women of reproductive age, Texas has long been a key laboratory for activists and lawmakers looking to fine-tune bills that restrict reproductive rights - many of which are exported to other state legislatures across the country.\n\nIn the 50-page platform, the Texas GOP also calls homosexuality an \"abnormal lifestyle choice\" and says providing gender-affirming care to minors is \"child abuse\". The platform demands that the recent renaming of military bases be reversed in order to \"publicly honor the southern heroes\", and confirms the platform supports \"affirmation of God, including prayer, the Bible, and the Ten Commandments being returned to our schools, courthouses, and other government buildings\".\n\nAlthough Republicans voted over the weekend on the proposed platform, the votes were set to be tallied this week . The Texas GOP did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the platform has been formally adopted or on its approach to abortion. The party platform is not a legislative slate; these proposals may never make their way into bills, much less pass.\n\nThe Texas state legislature, which meets only in odd-numbered years, will open for business in January 2025."

Syed runs Nash Up Chick, a food truck dishing out Nashville-style hot chicken just off Highway 6. The men, both immigrants from Pakistan, sit in plastic chairs and pass the time in the soupy Texas heat, chatting in a mix of English and Urdu.\n\nIt's a scene that was hard to imagine when Aziz, a 52-year-old cook, moved to Houston more than two decades ago. Back then, he remembers, Highway 6 was just a single lane in each direction, and there was so little development that it seemed like a jungle. Now, the adjoining strip mall includes an Afghan restaurant, a Pakistani dessert spot where the line can stretch out the door. A corner of the parking lot is closed off for food trucks like Syed's, serving kabobs, burgers, kati rolls and chicken wings.\n\nThe transformation is why the once-quiet suburban Fort Bend county, which includes Sugar Land, has become one of the most important places in America.\n\nThe political and demographic future of America will look like what Fort Bend county looks like now, demographers believe. The county is extremely diverse - about 32% of people are white, 25% are Hispanic or Latino, 21% are Asian and 21% are Black. And its population exploded over the last decade, growing by 40% to about 823,000 people. But this fall, Republicans could blunt the remarkable transformation happening in Fort Bend county, across Texas, and places around the US seeing similar changes.\n\nAfter winning key state legislative races last year , Republicans have complete control in far more places than Democrats do over perhaps the most powerful weapon in American politics - the ability to redraw electoral districts. It's an all-powerful scalpel that will allow Republicans to shore up their advantage simply by regrouping voters into certain districts, entrenching the voting power of white voters amid a quickly diversifying electorate. The technique of distorting district lines for partisan advantage is called gerrymandering.\n\nIn Fort Bend county, gerrymandering could be particularly brutal. Donald Trump won the 22nd congressional district, which includes Fort Bend county, by about one percentage point in 2020. Just by reconfiguring the lines, cutting out the most Democratic areas, Republicans could transform it into a district that Trump would have won by more than 20 points, said Dave Wasserman, a senior editor at the Cook Political Report, who closely studies redistricting.\n\n\"I think that's likely. That's pretty easy to do,\" he said. \"The march of Democrats in Fort Bend county is inexorable. Republicans know that to hold on to that seat, they're going to have to make some more drastic changes this time.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Texas Republicans unveiled a plan that essentially does just that. The draft map shifts the boundaries of the 22nd congressional district to annex Wharton and Matagorda counties, both of which overwhelmingly favored Trump in 2020. It carves out portions of Fort Bend and attaches them to already Democratic-leaning districts anchored in Houston. If the 2020 election were run under the new proposed boundaries, Trump would have carried the district by 16 points, according to Planscore , a tool that measures the partisan fairness of districts. Democrats would have just an 11% chance of carrying the district.\n\nEach decade, Republicans have tweaked the boundaries of the 22nd congressional district, which includes much of Fort Bend, to keep it a Republican seat, he added. The 22nd congressional district was the fastest-growing in the country over the last decade, Wasserman said, and Republicans who redraw it will have to shed about 200,000 people from its boundaries to ensure that each district has roughly the same number of people.\n\n\"The story in Texas is very similar to the story across the United States. You've got urban areas that are increasingly disproportionately Democratic. And you've got rural areas that are disproportionately decreasing,\" said Stephen Klineberg, a demographer at Rice University.\n\n\"You can't prevent it. So redistricting becomes one of the major mechanisms by which the party that is in control of the senate, the house, and the governorship has really free rein now to redraw the districts to minimize the power of non-Anglos for the Republicans.\"\n\nD rive across Fort Bend and it has all of the hallmarks of an American suburb - big box stores along the highway and huge houses arranged along cul-de-sacs that peek over the brick walls of residential developments. But look closer and you can see the diversity. There are Asian, Indian and Pakistani grocery stores. Lights don't just go up on houses at Christmastime, but also are vibrant on Chinese New Year, Diwali and Eid, said Amatullah Contractor, the deputy executive director of Emgage, a civic engagement organization for Muslim American communities.\n\nUntil recently, the county had been a longstanding and reliable Republican area, home to the congressional district once represented by Tom DeLay, the Republican who served as speaker of the House in the early 2000s. George W Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney all won the county when they ran for president.\n\nBut in 2016, Hillary Clinton flipped the county, which overwhelmingly voted for Romney just four years previously. Joe Biden handily won it in 2020. And in the 2018 Senate race, Beto O'Rourke won the county while Democrats won several of the county's top offices. They elected KP George, a Democrat and Indian American, as the county judge, ousting a Republican incumbent who had been in office for nearly two decades. They also put the first Democratic district attorney to office in 26 years - the first Black person to hold the position. In 2020, the county elected its first Black sheriff since reconstruction.\n\n\"It's a turning point,\" said Mark Solano, a Democratic strategist who is running George's re-election campaign.\n\nNinety-five per cent of the population growth in Texas over the last decade was driven by non-white people, a surge that means the state will add two more seats to its delegation in the US House, bring its total number of seats to 38. A decade ago, 58% of Texas's congressional districts were majority white, but today just 35% of them are, according to the Cook Political Report. And seven of the eight congressional districts that are no longer majority white are currently represented by Republicans, the analysis noted.\n\n\"Greater Houston has changed enormously, especially to the west in places like Sugar Land. Booming east Asian, south Asian, and Hispanic populations have created a changed political landscape,\" said Samuel Wang, the director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which studies electoral maps across the country. \"Redistricting could give voice to those communities, or keep them out of power for years to come.\"\n\nRepublicans face a similar problem in the northern suburbs of Dallas. They will have to find a way to hold on to districts like the one currently represented by Van Taylor. A decade ago, Taylor's district was 62% white, but today it's just under half white, according to the Cook Political Report. The Asian population in the district has surged significantly, growing from 15% to about a quarter of the population.\n\nR epublicans know how advantageous extreme gerrymandering can be. In 2011, Republicans undertook an unprecedented effort to use the redistricting process to their advantage, redrawing district lines in such a way that virtually guaranteed re-election across the country. It helped them hold majorities in state legislatures and the US Congress for much of the decade.\n\nRepublicans are once again poised to dominate the process, but there are even fewer protections in place than in the past . In 2019, the supreme court said for the first time that there were no federal limits on how far politicians could go to draw districts to their benefit. And for the first time since 1965, states with a history of voting discrimination won't have to get their district approved by the federal government before they go into effect to ensure they don't discriminate against minority voters. That could make a huge difference in Texas, where the state has drawn districts that violate the Voting Rights Act in every decade since the law was enacted.\n\nRepublicans will have to make a series of choices about which districts they want to shore up and which they will leave competitive. Each time they move a line, it has a ripple effect on what districts look like elsewhere in the state. The problem for Republicans is that they are running out of Republican voters to group into districts, said Mustafa Tameez, a Democratic strategist in the state.\n\n\"Republicans in the past were able to take an exurban population and the suburban population build a district. They were able to take an urban population, connect it to a large Republican suburb, and were able to create a district,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, you can draw in Republican precincts, but you have to have Republican precincts. And you're running out of that.\"\n\nWayne Thompson, a Republican who was an elected constable in Fort Bend county until last year, praised the new Democratic county leadership and said his party missed opportunities to reach out to new voters.\n\n\"We were behind the curve in reaching out,\" said Thompson, also a former GOP precinct chair. \"I think the party as a whole did not reach out to people maybe that talked different than we did and looked a little different than we did. I don't think that's a prejudice thing. I think that's just a severe error.\"\n\nThe Republican party of Fort Bend county did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nWhen it comes to congressional districts, one possibility, Tameez said, is that Republicans may try to cram the new Democratic voters in Fort Bend county into already heavily Democratic congressional districts anchored in Houston, a gerrymandering technique called \"packing\". Republicans could then get creative in drawing lines to group all of the remaining Republican areas into a GOP district. Republicans embraced such an approach in their proposal for the 22nd district released on Monday.\n\n\"It's kind of upsetting because that means that rural Fort Bend county gets lumped in with a little bit of some of the more populous centers here and we lose out on a possible real contender for elected office or congressional seat,\" said Nabila Mansoor, a local organizer. \"The Asian vote is so strong here. But we really need to see elected officials that actually look like us and actually represent us.\"\n\nT he invisible threat looms over people like Cynthia Ginyard, the chair of the Fort Bend county Democratic party since 2016. She doesn't hold back her enthusiasm about how the county is changing (all of her emails arrived written in all capital letters). A few times each month, she leads a canvass of her neighborhood, knocking on doors to sign up new voters. She uses an app that analyzes public records to flag households where there are suspected unregistered voters. Each household appears as a green dot. When she went out one evening in early September, the area around her house was a sea of green.\n\nDressed in a white sweatband and cutoff T-shirt that says \"voter registration\" and \"I can help\" on the back, she stopped anyone she saw just to check to see if they were registered to vote. (\"I've got my T-shirt on so they know I'm not the bogeyman,\" she said.)\n\nHouse prices are soaring in Fort Bend county, she said, and there are so many people moving into neighborhoods, many of whom don't know they need to register. Over two hours of canvassing one evening in late September, Ginyard got to about a dozen houses where there were suspected unregistered voters. Among the people who came to the door were two south Asian people, two Hispanic people and one Asian person. She wound up registering just two people to vote.\n\nBut Ginyard is relentless when it comes to voter registration, and since becoming the party chair, she's made efforts to make the party more inclusive, showing up at religious celebrations and other cultural events to engage voters. \"People ask me what's my magic secret and I say 'open my arms',\" Ginyard said as she bounded up the doorway of one house. \"When I have functions and I have meetings, and everyone in the room is Black, I've got a problem. Because that is not Fort Bend,\" she said.\n\nGerrymandering would undo the work Ginyard and others have done to bring so many new voters into the fold, Mansoor said.\n\n\"We keep getting pushed to say 'register as many people to vote'. And so Cynthia and me and all these other folks in Fort Bend county, we do and our voter turnout does increase. And we get more Asians, and we get more Muslims, we get more everyone that we're targeting, we get all of those communities to come out. And then we still don't win. And it's disheartening, and it's demoralizing.\"\n\nShe pointed to two recent losses that particularly stung. In 2020, Democrats lost a race for a local state house district that includes Fort Bend, losing by about three percentage points. In both 2018 and 2020, Democrats also lost a race for the 22nd congressional district, which also includes Fort Bend . \"We should have won that seat and yet we were not able to win that seat,\" she said.\n\nMansoor said that if Republicans are able to get away with gerrymandering Fort Bend, it would send a troubling message to other places where minority voters are becoming a growing political force.\n\n\"We have to get it right here in Fort Bend county because we are kind of what the country is gonna look like later,\" she said. \" If we can get it right here, it feels like it bodes well for the rest of the country.\""

      "text": "How Texas Republicans are rigging the system against minority voters\n\nRepublicans currently have a 23-13 advantage over Democrats, and the new map gives them a good chance to pick up two extra seats - what might happen next?\n\nHello Fight to vote readers,\n\nYou don't have to be an expert to see why Texas' new maps for its state legislature and congress discriminate against minority voters. Ninety-five per cent of the state's growth over the last decade has been driven by minorities. But the new maps Texas enacted don't include a single new district where there is a Hispanic majority.\n\nIt's an astounding fact that underscores how powerfully Texas Republicans have wielded the control they have over the once-a-decade redistricting process.\n\nRepublicans currently have a 23-13 advantage over Democrats in the congressional delegation, and the new map gives them a good chance to pick up the two extra seats .\n\nThe boundaries of several of the congressional districts Donald Trump barely won in 2020 have become safe GOP seats. I wrote about one of those districts, the 22nd congressional district a few weeks ago. The new map transforms it from one Trump won by about 1 percentage point in 2020 to one he would have carried by 16 points.\n\nA few days before the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, approved the maps, I spoke with Nina Perales, a lawyer at the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund (Maldef), who filed the first of two lawsuits challenging the maps, and who is one of the most widely respected redistricting attorneys in the country. I asked her to walk me through how exactly Texas Republicans had gone about entrenching control and what might happen next.\n\n\"These maps are intended to protect incumbents against the effects of demographic change,\" said Perales, who has been involved in Texas redistricting cases for decades. \"They're also maps to kind of protect white voters and the power of white voters at the expense of clearly Latino voters, because Latinos are the large demographic that's growing very quickly.\"\n\nOf the two new seats, \"one is made into a white majority Republican seat. And the other one is made into a white-majority Democratic seat. So white people win and people of color don't get anything,\" she added.\n\nTexas has a long history of discriminating against minority voters in redistricting - courts have struck down districts in every redistricting cycle since the Voting Rights Act was enacted in 1965. For years a key provision of the act required Texas to get its maps pre-approved by the federal government before they went into effect. But the US supreme court gutted that provision in 2013. That means this year will be the first time since 1965 that Texas won't have to get its maps pre-cleared before they go into effect.\n\nThat puts Perales and other people challenging the maps at a huge disadvantage. One reason is that the burden now falls on those who challenge the map to demonstrate why districts are discriminatory. Before, the burden was on Texas to show why the maps didn't discriminate.\n\n\"Essentially, we have to prove race discrimination. That's very hard to prove. The working assumption is always going to be that the state did not discriminate. And it's our burden to establish that the state did discriminate. And courts are just very, very reluctant to accept the idea that a state actor has discriminated on the basis of race, even unintentionally.\"\n\nThe new Texas districts should be the poster child that show why pre-clearance is still needed, Perales said. Given clear evidence of recent discrimination in redistricting, Texas should have a burden to show why the new plans don't discriminate, Perales said.\n\nYet as they were drawing the districts, Republicans were already building a shield against claims that the maps were drawn with race in mind. \"I've stated it, and I'll state it again - we drew these maps race blind,\" Joan Huffman, the GOP state senator, who oversaw the redistricting process in her chamber said during a public hearing .\n\nPerales said that kind of claim was \"a lie\".\n\n\"Do you think she was blind to the fact that the Rio Grande Valley is heavily Hispanic? Or the border region is heavily Hispanic? Do you think the historic wards of Houston, historic Black neighborhoods, that she's somehow unaware of those things? It's just not true,\" she said.\n\nWhen she testified at one of the legislature's redistricting hearings, Perales urged lawmakers not to repeat the mistakes of the past. Afterwards she realized she had said something nearly identical during the redistricting cycle 10 years ago.\n\n\"I feel almost cursed,\" she said. \"I go to these hearings. I tell them about the cases that they've lost. I tell them not to repeat the mistakes. I tell them the plans are likely illegal. And they go ahead and do it anyway.\"\n\nThank you to everyone who wrote in last week with questions. You can continue to write to me each week at sam.levine@theguardian.com or DM me on Twitter at @srl and I'll try and answer as many as I can.\n\nAndy in Washington writes: Are there mechanisms that can be put into place to help reduce lawsuits (such as those impacting election law) that have no sound basis before they drag through the courts? Asking this because we all watched as the Trump team put the legal system to task claiming election fraud, and lost over 50 of these cases. It was clear to most rational people what was going on, yet our legal system allowed this continuance of abuse of power to great detriment.\n\nYes, there are mechanisms in place that are supposed to hold bad-faith actors accountable in the legal system.\n\nIn August, a federal judge in Detroit sanctioned Sidney Powell and L Lin Wood, two attorneys involved in several of Trump's post-election suits, for making bad-faith arguments. Powell and Wood were ordered to take legal education classes and pay attorneys fees to the city of Detroit and the state of Michigan. Rudy Giuliani also had his law license suspended in New York and Washington DC for spreading election lies."

      "text": "Texas Republicans turn on their own in attorney general impeachment scandal\n\nTwenty articles of impeachment have been brought against Ken Paxton - could Texas politics see a historic toppling?\n\nEverything is bigger in Texas , including the drama unfolding within the chambers of its government.\n\nThe impeachment of Texas attorney general Ken Paxton came as a shock to many, not just because of the nature of his alleged crimes, but because it is a rare instance of the party holding its own to account.\n\nWilliam Flores, a political and social science professor at the University of Houston-Downtown, called the situation \"absolutely historic\".\n\n\"This is a Republican-led impeachment against one of the highest Republican leaders in the state. It is absolutely unprecedented, at least in recent times,\" Flores said.\n\nThe Republican-majority Texas congress had largely remained silent on Paxton's ethically questionable conduct that dates back before his first term in 2014, when the Texas state securities board fined him for violating financial laws.\n\nIn 2020, things heated up when aides from his own office asked the FBI to investigate him. They alleged Paxton abused his power by accepting bribes in the form of donations from a real estate developer. They also claimed Paxton recommended that a wealthy donor to his campaign hire a woman with whom he was having an affair.\n\nWhen Paxton fired the staff members, they claimed he was unlawfully retaliating.\n\nIn May, the house general investigating committee , composed of three Republicans and two Democrats, voted unanimously to recommend Paxton's impeachment. Twenty articles of impeachment were brought against him.\n\nIt's not surprising for politicians to be embroiled in a scandal, but it is unusual for Texas Republicans , who usually remain in lockstep, to eat their own.\n\nPaxton belongs to the most extreme wing of his party. He is the architect of some of the most severe voting restrictions imposed on the state, such as preventing most mail-in ballots and disbanding drive-through voting , two methods counties have tried to implement to make voting widely accessible. He established an \"election integrity\" division in his office that dedicates tens of thousands of hours to investigating voter fraud cases, despite no evidence that it is a widespread problem.\n\nMore recently, Paxton launched an investigation into Austin's Dell children's hospital for the gender-affirming care it provided, which led to the swift departure of doctors from its adolescent unit, disrupting treatment not just for transitioning teens, but also those with cancer and eating disorders. He is now pursuing a similar investigation into the Texas children's hospital, the largest such facility in the country.\n\nHe also stands in staunch opposition to reproductive choice and federal immigration policy, and in firm support of gun rights despite the string of school mass shootings his state has suffered.\n\nIn 2022, faced with a subpoena to testify in a lawsuit filed by abortion advocacy organizations at his doorstep, Paxton fled in a truck driven by his state senator wife, Angela Paxton.\n\nAnimosity towards Paxton culminated when he tried earlier this year to use state funds to pay a legal settlement of over $3m to the former office members who blew the whistle on their boss's dealings.\n\nIn order to use taxpayer dollars to pay legal fees for an elected official, the state legislature needs to give approval. But obtaining that approval was not as simple as Paxton might have hoped.\n\nIf there's one thing that can be counted on in tax-averse Texas, it's less spending and limited government. And that extends to the Republicans in charge.\n\nSign up to Headlines US\n\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nDavid Spiller, a Republican who also serves on the general investigation committee, began a statement with praise for the attorney general's \"brilliant legal mind\" but said: \"I have a duty and obligation to protect the citizens of Texas from elected officials who abuse their office and their powers for personal gain. I cannot be complicit in condoning the improper actions of Attorney General Paxton. I cannot ignore it and pretend it didn't happen.\"\n\nEven more atypical is the infighting now seen among party members. Hours before the investigation into Paxton was announced, Paxton called for the resignation of Republican house speaker Dade Phelan, whom he accused of drunken behavior while serving in office. Phelan's retort was presented through his spokesperson, who called Paxton's move \"a last-ditch effort to save face\".\n\nAbbott remains silent on the impeachment of his attorney general and the fault lines emerging within his party. The state's lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, offered a milquetoast statement which was neither informative nor indicative of where he stood.\n\nHowever, Donald Trump weighed in on the drama on the Truth Social social media platform in defense of Paxton.\n\nTrump wrote: \"The Rino Speaker of the House of Texas, Dade Phelan, who is barely a Republican at all and failed the test on voter integrity, wants to impeach one of the most hard working and effective Attorney Generals in the United States, Ken Paxton, who just won re-election with a large number of American Patriots strongly voting for him.\"\n\nAlthough the spectacle has shaken up the party, Flores said not much will change within the state's Republican party regardless of if Paxton gets ousted or not.\n\n\"The red meat kind of issues that go to the core and are very popular not only in the state of Texas, but with conservatives - it's a national playbook,\" Flores said. \"Texas is filled with with contradictions, but the conservatives are pretty unified around conservative issues.\"\n\nNow, a senate trial will be held no later than 28 August. A two-thirds majority is needed to remove Paxton from office, including possibly one vote from his wife who has yet to recuse herself due to an unethical conflict of interest.\n\nIn the event that happens, Abbott will be forced to appoint his permanent replacement and Texas will see the historic toppling of a leader not seen before in the state.\n\nThis article was amended on 12 June 2023 to correct the number of Republicans and Democrats on the house investigating committee, and to remove reference to house members belonging to the Texas Freedom Caucus."

      "text": "How Texas Republicans are catering to election deniers in this county\n\nHeider Garcia, Tarrant county's elections administrator, quit after an election crimes taskforce was set up, which critics say undermines confidence\n\nO n 22 November 2020, Heider Garcia, the elections administrator for Tarrant county, Texas, was awake in his living room until around 3am, unable to sleep over fears that a stranger might show up at his house, he recalled .\n\nAn account had posted his family's home address on Twitter during weeks of false conspiracy theories and death threats about his role in the 2020 election. Donald Trump's supporters refused to believe that Tarrant county, a major, diverse county that encompasses the cities of Fort Worth and Arlington, had broken its Republican voting patterns for Joe Biden.\n\nGarcia spent Thanksgiving break installing security cameras - but he didn't quit his job or stay quiet in the wake of the threats. Rather, as he detailed in his 2022 Senate testimony , his office devoted the next 18 months to championing transparency , from releasing public records to speaking with skeptics.\n\nGarcia \"has an open door, he would answer the phone, and he would walk people through the process\", said Paul Gronke, a political science professor at Reed College and the director of the elections and voting information center. \"A lot of election officials are not willing to be as open and transparent as that.\"\n\nBut after weathering attacks from the outside, Garcia was driven to quit in April by events closer to home. His resignation letter alluded to differences with a Republican county judge who has catered to election deniers. The judge helped set up a taskforce focused on investigating and prosecuting election crimes, which critics view as doing little but feeding the anxious climate around elections.\n\nAcross the US, conservative officials who entertain Trump's falsehoods about the 2020 election have raised alarms about voter fraud, despite a dearth of evidence that it's a problem. Some election skeptics have sought positions that influence how local elections are run, persisting even as their attempts to win and interfere with elections have mostly failed .\n\nTarrant county exemplifies the fallout of this movement in one of the most populous counties in the country. Democrats have asked the US justice department to intervene to protect voters of color in Tarrant county from intimidation. The county judge has dismissed their concerns as \"partisan\" and \"pathetic\".\n\nAfter Garcia resigned, the hiring process to replace him included a candidate who, as an election \"integrity\" activist , went to a voter's home to deliver a letter questioning their choice of polling place.\n\nGarcia declined to comment on his resignation. But he said that politicians who focus on election integrity like to play the hero, and it will continue as long as they are rewarded for it. \"There is absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing anywhere,\" he said. \"Yet it seems that there's still a quest to find a villain.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the taskforce, which handles complaints through the sheriff's criminal investigations division and is part of the public integrity unit in the DA's office, reports no filed cases. But Texas Democrats see it as part of a bigger problem.\n\nState representative Chris Turner, a Democrat in Tarrant county, called it \"one more element in a years-long Republican strategy at the national, state and local level to undermine the confidence in our elections, to provide a pretext for disputing the results of elections when they don't go your way\".\n\nTarrant county has over 2 million people, about half of whom are Black, Latino or Hispanic, according to the 2022 census estimate. Republicans have maintained their long hold on the county, even as voters slimly rejected Trump in 2020. Democrats paint last year's election of county judge Tim O'Hare, a former Tarrant county Republican party chair, as an ideological shift to the right.\n\nO'Hare campaigned on finding voter fraud , though an audit of the 2020 election by Republican state leadership determined that the county's election was \"quality\" and \"transparent\". He has fanned doubts about voting methods and echoed allegations that his opponent, the county's former Democratic party chair, led \"a sophisticated vote-harvesting operation\". She called the allegations \"libelous\", according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram .\n\nO'Hare did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn February, after the election, O'Hare, the county sheriff, Bill Waybourn, and the district attorney, Phil Sorrells, also elected Republicans, announced the taskforce focused on election fraud.\n\nThe county already had a way to submit election complaints through the secretary of state's office, but Republicans said the taskforce would give people a central place to file complaints and bolster confidence in elections.\n\nThe taskforce began printing a non-emergency number for the sheriff's office on voting receipts, as recently as the June runoff election.\n\nThe Tarrant county commissioner, Alisa Simmons, a Democrat, said she fielded a few calls about the phone number. \"People were confused by it and uncomfortable with it,\" she said.\n\nThe taskforce is \"a publicity stunt\", said Kat Cano, who previously served as the alternate judge of the ballot board and central counting station, and the Democratic member of the public testing board, which together conduct elections oversight.\n\n\"They wanted to look like they were doing something about elections integrity,\" she said.\n\nJulie McCarty, CEO of the True Texas Project, which boosted false claims about the 2020 election and has ties to O'Hare, questioned why Democrats were so concerned about the unit. \"I can only assume it's because it thwarts their plans to cheat,\" she wrote in an email.\n\nAs of the 6 May election, the sheriff's office had received seven complaints in the days before the election, ranging from rude poll workers to a candidate being too close to a polling station entrance; all were closed with no criminal activity found, a spokesperson wrote in an email. The DA's office has two incidents under investigation and no cases filed, according to their spokesperson.\n\n\"The taskforce is working as designed,\" Sorrells wrote in an email. \"Legal and fair elections encourage more people to vote because they know their vote counts.\"\n\nIn other states, Republicans have announced election integrity units in a climate where Trump has sought to undermine elections for his own benefit, despite the lack of evidence that voter fraud is a serious issue. Many have little to show for their efforts, or, as is the case in Florida , are prosecuting people with felony convictions who mistakenly thought they could vote.\n\nCriminalizing and investigating voting has long been used as a tool of intimidation, voting rights experts say, especially of voters of color. Crystal Mason , a Black woman, was sentenced in Tarrant county to five years in prison for mistakenly casting a provisional ballot in 2016 when she was on federal supervised release.\n\nThe taskforce's orbit is also broader than voters. Democrats say the 2021 election restrictions in Texas already made it more difficult to recruit election workers, who are nervous about making a mistake, and the taskforce heightens that concern.\n\nIn May, someone posted an anonymous YouTube video of Cano from 2022, doing what she called \"normal work\" with the ballot board, but insinuating that she was manipulating ballots. (In the video, a sheriff's deputy appears to almost always be in the room.)\n\nWith the atmosphere around the taskforce, she said, \"any kind of accusation then becomes a sort of exercise in paranoia\".\n\nShe didn't know if she was actually reported. But the fear, along with concerns about public perception, contributed to her decision to resign at the time, she said. \"I didn't know whether they were going to try to make an example of me the way they made an example out of Crystal Mason.\"\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nGarcia submitted his letter of resignation in April, just under three weeks after he testified in Austin on behalf of the Texas Association of Elections Administrators. They opposed a bill to eliminate countywide polling locations, which has been a focus for election fraud activists .\n\n\"Judge O'Hare, my formula to ' administer a quality transparent election ' stands on respect and zero politics; compromising on those values is not an option for me,\" he wrote. \"You made it clear in our last meeting that your formula is different, thus, my decision to leave.\"\n\nO'Hare, in response, said that supporting the creation of the taskforce was \"all about quality, transparent elections\".\n\nGarcia, who had held his position since 2018, had over a decade of experience working for Smartmatic, a voting technology company in the private sector, a position that put him in direct opposition to election denialism.\n\nJohn Scott, who served as the interim Republican Texas attorney general, told Votebeat that Garcia was the \"prototype\" for an election administrator.\n\n\"We defended Garcia on a regular basis to [those] who came to us so upset,\" said McCarty.\n\nElections administrators are the \"stewards of democracy\", who work on everything from making sure citizens have access to the ballot to serving as the first point of contact for voter registration, said Gronke.\n\n\"It is very disturbing when Garcia, who has shown such openness to talking with everyone, felt that his position was simply just not tenable any more,\" he added.\n\nA poll of local election officials published by the Brennan Center for Justice in April found that 30% had been \"abused, harassed or threatened\" because of their roles. And it's not just voters they are concerned about: more than half were somewhat or very worried about political leaders interfering with how they do their jobs in the future. As recently as June, an elections director in Arizona resigned , citing attacks from Republican officials.\n\nIn Tarrant county, Democratic officials highlighted both Garcia's resignation and the taskforce in their May letter requesting an investigation from the justice department. \"O'Hare has consistently challenged Mr Garcia's efforts to uphold the integrity and racial fairness of our elections,\" they wrote.\n\nO'Hare responded to their letter in a statement that did not mention Garcia. \"Let me be clear: this 'letter' is a political document. It alleges no actual wrongdoing or facts,\" he wrote.\n\nO'Hare was part of the commission picking Garcia's replacement. One candidate who advanced was Karen Wiseman, a Republican poll watcher who hand-delivered a letter to a lawful voter questioning their address during the fall 2022 election according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, and challenged a contract renewal for instrumental elections software that was needed for the June runoff.\n\nGarcia told Votebeat in a text message that he wasn't surprised to see a partisan candidate in the mix. There is \"an expectation that the [elections administrator] will play politics\", he said . (Wiseman did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nThe vast majority of elections officials treat their jobs as non-partisan, according to elections experts. Some people, however, view \"these positions not [as] umpires, but as players\", said Lawrence Norden, senior director of the Brennan Center's elections and government program.\n\n\"They have some role to play, not in just following the rules, but in helping to determine the outcome.\"\n\nIt's still a \"tiny minority\", he emphasized. But some of the problems he has seen range from giving improper access to election equipment to refusing to certify elections.\n\nUltimately, in Tarrant county, another candidate, Clinton Ludwig, who was chosen for the job, definitively said \"no\" when asked if he had any reason to doubt the results of the 2020 election, according to Allison Campolo, the departing Tarrant county Democratic party chair who was on the hiring commission.\n\nO'Hare picked people who were \"to me, very highly partisan\", she said, though she ultimately felt the hiring process was fair.\n\n\"I don't think he's a partisan individual,\" she said of Ludwig.\n\nSimmons, the Democratic commissioner, expressed concern that Ludwig has no experience in elections administration. \"Everybody should be concerned about that,\" she said.\n\nLudwig declined to comment in an email, noting he hadn't started his job yet. But in a statement, he pointed to his 20 years of experience in the Marine Corps. \"You can trust that I will further Tarrant county's legacy of conducting free and fair elections,\" he wrote.\n\nCampolo and O'Hare both praised Ludwig.\n\nBut the taskforce - and the environment around it - only adds to \"how difficult it is to do an election administrator's job\", Campolo said.\n\n\"We're in strange times,\" Garcia said.\n\nSam Levine contributed reporting"

      "text": "Texas Republican party adopts far-right position that homosexuality is 'abnormal'\n\nDelegates at biennial convention also approve platform declaring that Joe Biden was not legitimately elected\n\nThe Republican party in Texas has officially adopted a series of extreme-right positions that includes claims Joe Biden was not legitimately elected and homosexuality is \"abnormal\". In a platform adopted at its biennial convention in Houston, delegates voted to oppose \"all efforts to validate transgender identity\", including the use of taxpayer funds for any \"medical gender dysphoria treatments or sex change operations\".\n\nThe anti-trans and anti-gay declarations are part of the state party's new guiding principles, in a section titled homosexuality and gender issues, which contradict claims by some Republicans that the GOP wants to be more inclusive.\n\nI often hear Republicans say they want to make a \"bigger tent\" and to be more inclusive. It's clear that many Texas Republicans don't want LGBT+ people in it. Here's some of the flyers being passed around  at the TX GOP Convention: #txleg #txpol pic.twitter.com/3S7vDX9WfM\n\nAdopted planks include opposition to giving a special legal status to gay men or women, while supporting those who oppose homosexuality based on faith, religion or a belief in \"traditional values\". Military personnel, prison inmates and young people struggling with body dysmorphia and gender identity issues are singled out as groups who should not receive care and treatment.\n\nThe state party's stance is a rebuke to Biden's recent executive order designed to protect the LGBTQ+ community from a wave of state laws in Republican states such as Texas that prevent access to health care resources and ban the discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools.\n\nIn another section dedicated to education, the platform calls for students in Texas to \"learn about the humanity of the preborn child\", by witnessing a live ultrasound and the use of fetal baby models. The supreme court decision on abortion access is expected in the coming days, but Texas has already criminalized abortion in most cases.\n\nThe resolution embracing falsehoods about the 2020 election stated that \"substantial election fraud in key metropolitan areas significantly affected the results in five key states in favor of ... Biden.\" The state party rejects \"the certified results of the 2020 presidential election, and we hold that acting President Joseph Robinette Biden Jr was not legitimately elected by the people of the United States.\"\n\nThe resolution encouraged Republicans to \"show up to vote\" in the November midterms, and to \"bring your friends and family, volunteer for your local Republicans and overwhelm any possible fraud\".\n\nThe state party also supports further restriction on mail-in voting and for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the landmark legislation which outlawed racial discrimination in elections, to be \"repealed and not reauthorized\".\n\nOverall, the new platform provides more evidence of Texas Republicans moving further to the extreme right. Republicans, who control the legislature, governor's mansion and every statewide office, have used their dominance to push through a swath of regressive laws in recent months including anti-abortion , anti-LGBTQ+, anti-migrant and anti-voting rights legislation.\n\nSteve Toth, the state representative for part of Montgomery county, a Houston suburb, denied the party was moving to the right. \"Defense of marriage? Abortion? Second amendment? Where have we moved to the right?... The Republicans have always been strong defenders of constitutional family values.\""

      "text": "Texas Republicans target state's largest city with voting restrictions\n\nTwo laws approved by the house on Tuesday will affect Democratic stronghold of Houston\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Texas are targeting Houston, the state's largest city and Democratic stronghold, with a series of bills that would limit local authority to administer elections and give that power to the state.\n\nHouse Republicans on Tuesday gave final approval to two bills, both already passed by the senate in April, that would affect elections in Harris county, the third most populous county in the country. One bill, SB 1750 , would get rid of the election administrator position in the county, eliminating a non-partisan role, and give their authority to the county clerk and tax assessor-collector. Another, SB 1933 , could give the Texas secretary of state, currently a Republican appointed by Greg Abbott, the governor, administrative oversight of a county office administering elections.\n\nIt allows the secretary of state to investigate election \"irregularities\" if prompted by a complaint and allows them to remove a county election official if the secretary of state has \"good cause to believe that a recurring pattern of problems with election administration or voter registration exists in the county\". Problems might include delays in reporting election results, failure to comply with list maintenance procedures and issues with voting equipment.\n\nThe house amended the second bill this week to apply only to counties with more than 4 million people, which is currently just Harris county. Changes must be approved by the senate before the bill can head to Abbott's desk and become law.\n\nHarris county is home to nearly 5 million people, a population that's more than 20% Black and 44% Latino, according to census data.\n\nThe county attorney, Christian Menefee, said that Republican legislators' latest effort targeting Harris county is part of a trend of them trying to make it more difficult to vote and to administer elections and to subvert local control. He pointed out that currently, all three local officials being targeted - the county election administrator, clerk and assessor-collector, are Black.\n\n\"It's a very clear effort to supplant local control, to demonize people, to make it more difficult for them to do their job, to score political points and give red meat to their base,\" he said. \"I think they're going to escalate this every cycle and it's shameful because the Republican party used to be the party of local control.\"\n\nHe said the county is planning to file a lawsuit. \"We'll see how successful we are and how it shakes out in the courts,\" he said. \"When you're elected by people to protect communities, to protect public officials as the civil lawyer for the largest county in the state, it's my job to use every single tool in my toolbox to fight back against these laws.\"\n\nState senator Paul Bettencourt, a Republican who represents Houston and who authored both bills, said election problems in Harris county in 2022 prompted him to introduce the legislation. About 20 Harris county polling locations ran out of paper on election day in 2022 and some GOP officials said the ballot shortages targeted Republicans. But that claim has been debunked .\n\nDaniel Griffith, senior policy director at the non-partisan organization Secure Democracy USA, said a small group of lawmakers had taken innocuous, unintentional mistakes and administrative issues - which happen during every election across the country - and tried to turn them into a baseless conspiracy that warrants election integrity legislation.\n\n\"The evidence underpinning this desire for drastic change seems pretty limited,\" he said. \"I think the kind of things we saw in Harris county - there's been reporting that it's been overblown.\"\n\nSign up to Headlines US\n\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nAnother bill this session which did not advance out of committee, SB 1993 , would have given the secretary of state the authority to order a new election under certain circumstances in counties with a population of more than 2.7 million. Only Harris county would currently qualify. A separate bill would have ended country-wide voting in Harris county, which allows people to vote on election day anywhere in the county.\n\n\"That's a big deal when you have a county this big with this many people,\" Menefee said.\n\nOver the last few years, the GOP-controlled legislature has also ended drive-through voting and 24-hour voting - both efforts introduced by Harris county during the coronavirus pandemic in order to increase voter turnout.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the House passed SB 1070, which would let Texas leave the Electronic Registration Information Center, known as Eric, and contract with a not-yet-determined vendor. A growing number of GOP-controlled states have left the organization in the past year after false conspiracy theories circulated about its ties to the liberal donor George Soros.\n\nIf signed into law, SB 1750 would take effect on 1 September. Houston is scheduled to have a mayoral election in November, and advocates and Democratic lawmakers said they were concerned that a handover of election duties so shortly before an election could cause chaos."

Matt Schaefer's controversial bill in a hearing that stretched late into the night.\n\nHundreds of Texans converged on the capital this week to oppose a new state-led security force that would enlist civilians to track and capture undocumented people.\n\nIn a hearing that stretched into the wee hours of the morning Wednesday, the Texas House of Representatives heard testimony from first-generation college students, undocumented activists, parents, and children about the inherent dangers of House Bill 20 . The author of the controversial proposal, Republican Rep. Matt Schaefer, meanwhile, was grilled by his Democratic counterparts over his bill's logical and constitutional implications.\n\nIn his most extensive public defense of his bill to date, Schaefer, the founder and chair of the arch-conservative Texas Freedom Caucus, collapsed the issues of fentanyl overdoses and migration, ignoring facts and evidence to argue that migrants are responsible for a wave of death and suffering that exceeds the worst episodes of national trauma in modern American history. Pointing to national overdose statistics, he described \"a scale of death far greater than Pearl Harbor, the attacks on 9/11, or the totality of the Vietnam War.\"\n\n\"So much fentanyl is coming across the border, it's unreal,\" the Texas lawmaker said before proceeding to conflate and misrepresent several issues regarding migration and drugs.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nAs federal officials, border researchers, and journalists have documented ad nauseam, most fentanyl illegally trafficked into the United States comes through U.S. ports of entry, often in vehicles driven by U.S. citizens; according to U.S. Sentencing Commission data cited in Wednesday's hearing, 86 percent of defendants convicted of smuggling fentanyl through ports of entry are U.S. citizens.\n\nMigrants, on the other hand, overwhelmingly cross the border between ports of entry, thanks to successive bipartisan policies that have made admission at the ports - including pursuit of asylum claims - all but impossible. Customs officers who work the ports where most of the drugs are crossing are distinct from the Border Patrol agents who work between them, undermining a central argument Schaefer made that Mexican organized crime uses migrants to pull away U.S. officials who would otherwise be intercepting drug flows.\n\n\"Many of them are coming here just for a better life and make wonderful neighbors,\" Schaefer said of the migrants themselves, but \"some of them are criminals - rapists, gang members, MS-13.\" To address the threat, Schaefer has proposed the \"Border Protection Unit,\" a new security force composed of law enforcement personnel and private individuals alike, answering directly to the governor in a mission to \"arrest, detain, and deter individuals crossing the border.\"\n\nRelated Texas GOP Wants Citizens to Stop Migrants. Critics Say It's a \"Vigilante Death Squads Policy.\"\n\nSchaefer's bill, which Texas Democrats have dubbed the \"vigilante death squads policy,\" was among a bundle of proposals lawmakers heard Wednesday that would create a parallel, state-led border and immigration enforcement apparatus in Texas.\n\nThe bills are part of an explicit GOP effort to provoke a legal fight that would ultimately overturn Arizona v. United States, a 2012 Supreme Court decision that struck down a similar set of policies in Arizona as unconstitutional. Republican thought leaders, both on the border and in Washington, believe that the current conservation composition of the court is inclined to reverse the decision.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Rafael Anchía drilled down on whether the intent of Schaefer's bill was to undo the Supreme Court case.\n\n\"The intent of the bill is to assert the authority of the state of Texas under the United States Constitution,\" Schaefer told him.\n\n\"Is there a reason you're being cagey and coy and not wanting to answer?\" Anchía asked.\n\n\"I've answered your question,\" Schaefer replied.\n\nRep. Chris Turner, also a Democrat, pressed Schaefer about the fundamentals of his proposal as it related to drug overdoses, asking where the majority of the fentanyl smuggled into the U.S. comes from.\n\n\"The southern border,\" Schaefer said.\n\n\"Where specifically?\" Turner asked.\n\n\"I think there's some debate about that, Representative,\" Schaefer replied. \"I think you're going to hear some say that most of it comes through the ports of entry.\" Others, he added, without specifying who, will say \"a lot of it comes through in between the ports of entry, but I think in a way it's distinction without a difference.\"\n\nTurner noted that seizure data from Customs and Border Protection, the federal agency responsible for border security, shows that more than 90 percent of the fentanyl trafficked into the U.S. comes through the ports.\n\nThough he used CBP's figures concerning the apprehension of people at the border repeatedly throughout his testimony, Schaefer said he did not trust the data. At one point, the Republican lawmaker attempted to turn the tables, pressing Turner to tell him the last time he had visited the border.\n\n\"We're gonna talk about your bill, and I'm gonna get to ask you the questions,\" Turner said. \"I don't represent a border community, and last I checked, you don't represent a border community, so we're both talking about a region of the state that neither one of us represents, frankly.\"\n\nSchaefer's hometown of Tyler, Texas, is more than 500 miles from the border, closer to Arkansas than Mexico.\n\n\"What I'm trying to get to is the data and the facts, and the facts indicate that we know fentanyl is a huge crisis in our country,\" Turner said. \"We have a lot of different strategies that we can use to deal with that. I don't think your bill addresses fentanyl at all. That's that's my problem with your claims.\"\n\nSchaefer's proposal came at the end of a grueling day of testimony involving multiple bills that would effectively institutionalize Operation Lone Star, a $4 billion program that Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott authorized in 2021. The program has been riddled with scandal - including the deaths of National Guard personnel and systemic civil rights violations that have led to a Justice Department investigation - while making no discernable impact on the illicit movement of drugs or people across the border.\n\nBy midday, more than 300 people were registered to testify on Schaefer's bill, nearly all of them in opposition. Many drove across the state to make their voices heard and did so despite the fact that Schaefer didn't rise to defend his bill until after 9 p.m.\n\nAcross four hours of testimony, one speaker after another blasted the proposal as racist, sloppy, dangerous, and unnecessary.\n\nUndocumented activist María Treviño recalled the \"dark history\" of a state-backed vigilante groups targeting Mexicans and Mexican Americans in Texas.\n\n\"This bill doubles down on these racist and illegal activities by potentially training and employing anti-immigrant hate groups,\" Treviño said. \"I oppose this pricey, xenophobic, and unconstitutional legislation that undermines the separation of powers of our country and believe that Texas legislators should instead prioritize the health of our residents.\"\n\nThe youngest of the speakers was 9-year-old Asher Vargas, the son of a firefighter, who took the microphone late in the evening.\n\nWith Schaefer sitting behind him in the front row of the hearing room, Vargas told the lawmakers about his shifts volunteering at the local migrant shelter, folding clothes, preparing meals, and, with his dad's help, arranging travel plans for families new to the U.S.\n\n\"I find joy in helping the migrants,\" Vargas said. His grandmother came to the U.S. from Mexico in the 1980s, he explained, making his family's life possible. \"Migrants come seeking peace and better lives, just like my abuelita did,\" he said. \"This bill will make it harder for them, which is not very kind.\"\n\n\"Do you want to be known as a hateful, unwelcoming state?\" Vargas asked. \"I know I don't.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Texas Republicans Just Proposed a Bounty on Drag Shows\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe latest legal attack pulls from a long legacy of state-sanctioned violence.\n\nMembers of the drag show community listen in during a meeting at the Texas Capitol on March 23, 2023, in Austin, Texas.\n\nGiven Republicans' relentless legislative attempts to erase trans and gender nonconforming people, a new bill in Texas that LGBTQ+ advocates are describing as the \"drag bounty hunter bill\" may seem like a drop in the ocean. This fact alone is intolerable. There is, however, something particularly barbaric in the bill's explicit encouragement of citizen harassment to drive gender variance out of public life.\n\nThe proposed legislation defines \"drag\" as any \"performance in which a performer exhibits a gender that is different than the performer's gender recorded at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers and sings, lip syncs, dances, or otherwise performs in a lascivious manner before an audience.\"\n\nThe inclusion of \"lascivious\" might suggest that the bill is only aimed at performances in venues that already exclude minors, like nightclubs. But given that Texas Republicans are at this very moment attempting to pass a law defining any venue that hosts a drag performance as \"a sexually oriented business\" - including restaurants - it's clear that \"lascivious\" provides no limit to the bounty hunter bill.\n\nIf passed, the law is certain to shut down family-friendly drag events and library story hours, but it threatens all gender-nonconforming performers, and even events like Pride.\n\nThe bill is a rehash of a strategy used against abortion in the state. When Texas lawmakers passed Senate Bill 8 in 2021, effectively banning abortion in the state , they introduced a novel legislative approach for running roughshod over constitutional protections: sanctioned vigilantism .\n\nThe abortion law deputized private citizens to sue anyone suspected of helping a person obtain an abortion, with the promise of a $10,000 reward for successful cases. Since its passing, copycat laws have abounded, given the legislation's ability to evade federal court challenges by relying on civil lawsuits. Now, Texas Republicans are seeking to use the same legal mechanism in their all-out assault on gender variance.\n\nThe drag bounty bill likewise encourages citizens to sue anyone who hosts or performs in a drag performance in the presence of a minor - with the added allure of a monetary reward. Successful plaintiffs could receive as much as $5,000 in \"damages,\" up to 10 years after the event.\n\nAcross the country, even in New York City , far-right militias and other armed fascists have already made a habit of threatening family-friendly drag performances and story hours. The Texas bill grants the practice a vile authority - and pulls from a long legacy of the government using state-sanctioned vigilantism to enforce white supremacy, gender conformity, and border rule.\n\nThe very nature of such base-catering legislation is to chill LGBTQ+ expression and embolden attacks against it. Even technically ineffectual laws have material consequences for public life, like the recently passed anti-drag law in Tennessee, which makes nothing illegal that is not already illegal.\n\nLike every new anti-LGBTQ+ law, the bounty hunter bill rests on the formulated far-right paranoia around drag performances and trans existence as sites of \" grooming \" and sexual predation. Underlying this anti-trans, anti-queer panic is the fact that compulsory heterosexuality and gender conformity is so manufactured, so fragile, that it requires heavy policing and enforcement - both by the state and vigilante forces.\n\nThe same reliance on vigilantism has shaped most every aspect of the history of oppression in this country. Armed far-right groups on the U.S.-Mexico border have been active in brutal border enforcement for over 40 years, with a notable presence since Donald Trump's presidency. In recent years, racist vigilantes have hunted and captured hundreds of undocumented people attempting to cross the border, largely without retribution. The Texas GOP is currently seeking to codify the practice with the recent introduction of a \" vigilante death squads policy .\" The proposed legislation would create an official security force, comprised of both police and private citizens, to track down, arrest, and deport undocumented people.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe history of such violence is long, including the extreme, deadly brutality of the fabled Texas Rangers from the mid-19th century onward, who perpetrated extraordinary lethal violence against Indigenous and Mexican people to establish and maintain settler border lines. From the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 , to many thousands of lynchings, to the vigilante violence on which Jim Crow rule relied, the U.S. government and law enforcement have embraced vigilantism - through outright deputization or the granting of expansive impunity - to uphold white supremacy. The porousness between far-right armed groups and police forces, as well as Republican elected officials, has long made this relationship all too clear.\n\nRacist stand-your-ground laws, which permit citizens to use deadly force when they deem it necessary to defend themselves or their property, reliably uphold the white paranoia that the mere presence of Black men and boys constitutes a threat. What are such laws, then, if not the legal sanctioning of vigilantism?\n\nAnd when it comes to the government's endorsement of anti-queer, anti-trans violence, consider the fact that the \" LGBTQ+ panic \" defense still remains on the books nationwide today, despite long and widespread protest. This legal strategy permits a defendant, even one accused of murder, to assert that their victim's sexual orientation or gender expression is to blame for their violent response. A jury can, of course, outright reject such a defense, but the ability to deploy it in court unambiguously constitutes the legal acceptance of violence against gender nonconformity.\n\nIt is building on this legacy that the Republicans have turned to vigilante loopholes in new legislation to police bodily autonomy, when it comes to both reproductive freedoms and LGBTQ+ liberation. Such legislation continues to tell a right-wing story about for whom the U.S. exists - those granted the permission to take up its violent powers, in the brutish image of the Texas Ranger.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Texas Republicans Ran a 20-Year Experiment. The Results Are In.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe state's energy crisis didn't come out of nowhere: It took decades of deregulation to make it happen.\n\nIn the early 2000s , after gaining control of the Texas House of Representatives for the first time in modern history, Republicans undertook a gerrymandering scheme that solidified their control of the state even further. What followed was a multidecade experiment in deregulation that has now left millions of Texas residents freezing and without power. Ryan Grim talks to former congressional candidate Mike Siegel and University of Texas at Austin's LBJ School of Public Affairs professor Varun Rai about how it happened - and how it could have been prevented.\n\n[Musical introduction.]\n\nRyan Grim: They were called the Texas Eleven, and they are, in many ways, the beginning of the story that ended this week with the deadly collapse of the state's electrical grid.\n\nIn the 2002 midterm elections, Texas Republicans finally gained full control of the state's government. The party immediately moved to redraw congressional and state legislative lines to gerrymander Democrats into oblivion.\n\nBut to approve the redistricting, the state Senate needed a quorum - a quorum that 11 Democrats could deny by simply not showing up. And so the Texas 11 were born. Also known, a bit ridiculously, as the Killer Ds, these 11 state senators fled to New Mexico and Oklahoma, out of the reach of the Texas Rangers.\n\nThe story became grist for late-night comedians. Here's Stephen Colbert, then on The Daily Show.\n\nStephen Colbert : Runaways... they're a problem all across the nation. And New Mexico is no exception. One such runaway, who we'll call Rodney, came here from Texas. His story will break your heart.\n\nRodney, why did you run away?\n\nRodney: I'm here as part of an effort to break a legislative quorum in the Texas legislature.\n\nSC: Yes, like so many runaways, Rodney is here as part of an effort to break a legislative quorum in the TX legislature.\n\nRG: Over that summer, they successfully killed a special legislative session aimed at redistricting. But in the fall, one of the Democrats eventually caved and returned to Austin.\n\nIn 2002, Democrats had controlled 17 of 30 congressional districts. Two years later, with the state's population growing, Texas had 32 members of congress, but Democrats controlling just 11 seats. They had gone from a majority to deep in the minority overnight, and that's where they would remain over the next 20 years as Republicans used their unchecked authority over the state to launch an experiment in radical deregulation. They stripped the government down to the boards, and then ripped out the boards and sold them for scrap.\n\nHere's how Beto O'Rourke described today's Republican Party to me over the phone this week:\n\nBeto O'Rourke: You have people running the government in Texas, who are in the highest positions of public trust, who just fundamentally do not believe in government.\n\nRepublicans, though, have found the culprit. It's the Green New Deal.\n\nNews Anchor: Is green energy to blame for the power outages in Texas?\n\nJesse Watters: Joe Biden and Democrats better think twice about unleashing the Green New Deal on the whole country. Just take a look at what's happening in Texas!\n\nTucker Carlson: Unbeknownst to most people, the Green New Deal came to Texas, the power grid in the state became totally reliant on windmills. Then it got cold, and the windmills broke.\n\nRick Perry: We got a massive amount of wind farms out in West Texas that are frozen up. All of that wind energy was lost.\n\nJesse Watters: Wind turbines are frozen.\n\nStuart Varney: Wind turbines froze.\n\nNews Anchor: Wind turbines are frozen solid.\n\nTC: Because that's what happens in the Green New Deal.\n\nSV: This is a clash between Green Dreams, and deep freeze reality.\n\nTC: The same energy policies that have wrecked Texas this week are going nationwide, they're coming to your state.\n\nNews Anchor: Is this what American would look like under the Green New Deal?\n\nSV: This is where the weather meets the Green New Deal. This is where you pay the price for the climate dreams of the coastal elites?\n\nRG: OK, but back to reality. It wasn't as if Texas didn't know cold winters are possible. In 1989, a cold snap crashed below zero and caused major power outages. In 2011, it happened again.\n\nNews Anchor: The freeze caused rolling power blackouts throughout Texas, including Dallas.\n\nNews Anchor: There were rolling blackouts forced upon that city because the power plants just stopped working.\n\nNews Anchor: You knew trouble was around the corner, especially at intersections with blacked out traffic lights.\n\nJimmy Kimmel : The Super Bowl is in Dallas on Sunday, but it's very cold. It's so cold there are power outages, and rolling blackouts all over Texas. In fact, they're having to import power from Mexico. When Mexico has to give us electricity, that's when we know we're in trouble.\n\nRG: Experts warned that the state's energy system needed major upgrades. Instead, as we'll talk about later in the show with Varun Rai, director of the University of Texas' energy institute, deregulation set up incentives for many firms to ignore infrastructure investments. They gambled it wouldn't be their problem.\n\nAnd so millions remain out of power, and access to water is touch and go. It might seem crass to talk about the political repercussions of this crisis while it's still unfolding, but politics got us into this mess, and only politics is going to get us out.\n\nWe'll talk with former congressional candidate Mike Siegel, who last appeared on the show in November, to talk about how this is playing politically. But first, I reached out to Beto O'Rourke, who has been hammering Governor Greg Abbott, and he's been running a massive phone banking operation to reach out to stranded, freezing, and starving seniors across the state to see how they can be helped.\n\nO'Rourke's response to the crisis has fueled speculation that he's running for governor in 2022 against Abbott. He was asked about it at the end of January by a local radio station, KLAQ in El Paso:\n\nBuzz Adams: So, according to the Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gil Hinojosa, he says, Beto, you are thinking about a challenge to Governor Greg Abbott in 2022. I don't expect you to make any kind of announcement on a regional radio show, but the story here says \"O'Rourke could not be reached for comment.\" And I was thinking, \"Oh, well, I've reached him, maybe he'll comment to us.\" [Laughs.]\n\nBO: You've got my Skype number now, so.\n\nBA: That's right.\n\nBO: Yeah, you know what? It's something I'm going to think about.\n\nRG: Abbott responded by saying Beto's promise as a presidential candidate to take assault weapons away from their owners wouldn't \"sell well\" in Texas.\n\nIf O'Rourke does run, he'll make the election a referendum on Republican rule. Here's how he put it to me on Thursday:\n\nBO: It's not just the current disaster with the severe cold snap in Texas, and the power blackouts that affected millions, and the boiled water notice that seven million Texans are living under right now because of the radical deregulation, the failure to require power generators to weatherize the facilities or to connect to the national grids, we could draw down power when we need it. It's not just that!\n\nIt's also the response to Covid that has claimed the lives of more than 40,000 of my fellow Texans, this bungled Covid vaccine rollout in Texas, where they literally asked each of the 254 counties in Texas to figure it out on their own.\n\nThe absolute rejection of science, and facts, and truth when it comes to climate and other extraordinarily important emergencies that we face. And we're also the state that is obviously on the front lines of this. You look at Hurricane Harvey in 2017, you look at the severe droughts that we face, the severe winter weather storms that are absolutely unprecedented - this is not just our future. This is happening right now. This is the cost of 20 years of absolute Republican control, unbroken in Texas, at literally every significant level of government. And it's the consequence of having people who don't believe in government running the government. That's what we're up against.\n\nRG: To dig deeper into the state's politics, we're joined by civil rights attorney Mike Siegel, who ran for Congress in Texas in 2020. He last appeared on the November episode of Deconstructed titled \"What Happened?\"\n\nMike Siegel, thank you so much for joining us again on Deconstructed.\n\nMike Siegel: Thank you Ryan. So glad to be with you.\n\nRG: Now, I wish it were under better circumstances. But we got actually a ton of positive feedback from your last interview. People really found the story of your congressional race to be quite elucidating in the wake of November's election. What have you been up to since?\n\nMS: Well, recovering, frankly. I spent three years of my life running for Congress here in Texas - in 2018 and again in 2020 - and I have a lot of things to attend to after all that was done: my family, my house, my health, my mental and physical health.\n\nBut truthfully, in the last month or so I've been really picking up and getting back on my feet and focusing on what needs to be done here in Texas: What kind of infrastructure do we need to put in place to enable Texas, for example, in 2028 to deliver our Electoral College votes for Democratic nominee for president Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? To me, that's the long game, right? And we definitely want to follow in the footsteps of what folks have done in places like Arizona and Georgia, and not just blow all of our money on campaigns where you spend that money on TV and ads and mail pieces and don't actually build the base.\n\nI've been involved in conversations with people like Julie Oliver, a fellow Texas progressive, and we've got some things in the works where we basically want to raise money to knock doors year-round. From the looks of things, we're going to be knocking doors and talking to people about electric deregulation in Texas and how Texas Republicans have sold us out by letting big oil and big gas control our electric grid to the detriment of so many Texans.\n\nRG: So how are you personally? How long have you had power restored?\n\nMS: Well, thank you for asking, Ryan. And definitely my love and solidarity is with all the people right now who don't have electricity, who don't have housing, who are vulnerable in all of these different ways.\n\nI got my power back about 3 a.m. today. So we were out of power in our home for about 48 hours. By the end it was less than 40 degrees inside the house and it was pretty rough. I have two kids - 5 and 8 years old - and kind of a small older house that doesn't have good insulation, but we did, on the bright side, because a lot of folks have it worse, it's like we had gas, so we had a stovetop. We had running water - people are having all sorts of broken water lines. And my wife has a business where we were able to charge up our phones. So, you know, we had some good things going on, for as rough as it has been.\n\nRG: What are people doing who've been without water for so long?\n\nMS: Some folks are filling their bathtubs. I mean, if they got word soon enough. My friends are taking snow from outside and using it to flush their toilet.\n\nRG: Oh, wow.\n\nMS: Some people are fleeing their homes. You know, for example, in Austin, it's been about 200,000 households without electricity. So it's about half the city. So a lot of people have gone to their friends' or neighbors' or loved ones' who have electricity to stay there - which, of course, is not ideal during a COVID pandemic, but there's all sorts of survival strategies going on right now.\n\nRG: I've heard that there are things called warming centers where entire communities are gathering which, like you said, it might be the best of all the possible options, but it's certainly not ideal in a pandemic. Is that a real thing? Is that something that's happening?\n\nMS: Yes, for example, in Austin, some of the school campuses have been opened as warming centers, different public facilities, and I've seen different things - some of these things are open overnight, some of them close at, for example, 9 p.m., which is not ideal. But basically a place where you can get warm, you can charge up your electronics. And then I guess even if it closes at nine o'clock, you can just go home and get under the covers and wait it out till the morning.\n\nRG: Have they suggested that you're in the clear, or are you worried that you could lose power again at any moment?\n\nMS: No, we could certainly lose power at any moment. It just seems some sort of freak of happenstance that we got power back; basically overnight, maybe 10,000 households were added back to power. And unfortunately, we have an ice rain storm going on right now. They're predicting that some people are gonna lose power again. Apparently we're not out of the woods. There's at least another day or two of this crisis.\n\nRG: How's this humanitarian crisis unfolding, politically, down there? On the national level, on Fox News and elsewhere, you see all these Republicans just preposterously and so confidently blaming the Green New Deal for the failure of Texas' grid? Is that a theme that's being taken seriously in Texas?\n\nMS: Not among the media or local leaders. But certainly Abbott knows what he's doing. This is a catastrophic failure of Republican governance, going back 20 years and more when they supported deregulation, allowing for an electrical system where it's basically on demand spot bidding, you know? These energy providers are constantly buying electricity on the market, and so the price goes up 10,000 percent. And that's just business as usual in Texas.\n\nTen years ago, we had a major freeze, where the recommendation that came out of that was we need to weatherize our grid, our facilities, and they never followed through on that. And so it's a catastrophic failure of governance. I mean, these natural gas facilities in particular, you have frozen wells, frozen lines, that's a big part of our electrical generation capacity in Texas. And that's failed. Most of our reserve energy that's supposed to get us through moments like this didn't come online. And that's frozen coal piles, non-working gas facilities and the rest.\n\nAnd so they would never look at themselves in the mirror. You know, Greg Abbott would never admit failure. And he knows that a huge political repercussion is coming his way very shortly. And so they tried to get ahead of it by going on Fox News and Sinclair Broadcasting and telling this lie that the Green New Deal is the problem. that wind energy is the problem, even though wind energy actually met its expected demand for this week, and it is gas and coal that have really failed.\n\nRG: Does it have any chance of succeeding? You see a lot of cynicism among a national audience that says, \"Look, these rubes in Texas, they'll fall for this. They'll be happy to blame AOC for their lights going out.\" But I just can't see people being quite that dumb. They know who runs Texas. And they know it's not AOC.\n\nMS: I agree that the conditions are there for a dramatic political shift in Texas. I mean, as someone who considers myself a political actor, this is our moment, right? We need to take what's happened - how big oil and big gas have been enormously profiting from an electrical grid that's not resilient, that's not built to sustain crises like this, where they basically gambled with our lives, to increase their profits - we need to take this moment and use it for political change. But it's not going to happen just by proving that they're lying. We can't just get on Twitter, issue press releases and say, \"Abbott's lying. What a liar. He should lose.\" That's not how it's gonna happen, right? So it's gonna be on us after we thaw out - as Democrats, as progressives - to really organize with this moment.\n\nSimilar to the January 6 insurrection - we need to organize based on what happened there and how Texas Republicans are complicit - this is a perfect moment for populism, right? That it's not about left versus right. It's about bottom versus top. And while Governor Abbott has had perfect electricity in his mansion throughout this crisis, the rest of us have been freezing, crashing on roadways, having our medical equipment fail for lack of electricity, go on down the line - all of these crises, the most disadvantaged are the ones who are hurt first. But we need to go out and organize based on what's happening right now to change the politics of Texas.\n\nRG: So, Mike, there's a really interesting kind of historical rhyme almost to this when you talk about Texas populism. I mean, the rural electrification was sort of the kind of route of the original Texas populism. Is that going to resonate with people? Because now you have the party that's in leadership saying: You're kind of on your own! And: Sorry, this thing that was delivered 100 years ago, it isn't actually going to work anymore.\n\nMS: No, I agree. I mean, certainly the Republicans have always preached \"pull yourself up by your bootstraps.\" And that meant, you know, don't expect support getting a job or going to college. But at a certain fundamental level, people do expect something from the government, you know? Maybe they expect police, they expect roads, and I think expect electricity, you know? Maybe not high-speed internet, although I think that should be a fundamental right as well, but electricity is so fundamental, kinda like sewage, that you expect that from the government.\n\nAnd I agree that this is certainly a moment to awaken people, and I think that if the right candidates run in '22 statewide - our governor race is coming up, our lieutenant governor, our attorney general races are coming up, Beto O'Rourke has said he's running, maybe some others will jump in - I think this is the perfect thing to organize on. It's the complete bankruptcy of a conservative ideology. You know, the whole starve-the-beast thought process, we're gonna shrink the government down to the size of a thimble and drown it in a bathtub, people realize, well, if it's that small, then I'm gonna die, too. Right?\n\nRG: How does deregulation play into the catastrophic failure? Is there a link between deregulation and the lack of investment into the infrastructure?\n\nMS: Yes. And to be clear, I'm no expert in ERCOT and the Public Utilities Commission. I was a city attorney in Austin and did a couple cases on behalf of our municipal energy company, Austin energy. But I'll admit my eyes glazed over whenever the word ERCOT came up.\n\nBut big picture, I think a great example is in 2011 we had a big freeze, and some people died. And there were a lot of recriminations and promises to weatherize these facilities that weren't able to come online. And that's the key, you know? Texas with this deregulation, basically all the energy providers, it's up to them on how to do business, and they sell their energy to the grid and then other people buy it from the grid. And unfortunately, the system that operates on the idea that basically the lower the supply, the higher the profit. So there's very little margin for error. And so what that means is these energy providers, they make tons of money in the peak demand periods of the summer, after our 80th day in a row of 100 degrees in Central Texas, they're selling their energy at spot prices of, I don't know, $9,000 per watt or measurement, where it's normally it's $40. And so they build it around, like maximizing these moments of peak demand and low supply. And so unfortunately, there's just these perverse incentives throughout the system.\n\nBut then they also know that there are structural problems. So, for example, they know that weatherization - that's going to be a keyword in Texas in the months ahead - these natural gas energy facilities, these coal facilities are not properly weatherized, so these different intake valves freeze, the wells themselves do not operate just all the nuts and bolts of how, you know these raw materials get converted into electricity. They can't survive this temperature. And there were all these recommendations that that they need to weatherize facilities, it would require an investment that would decrease their marginal profit, but that's what is necessary to save lives. And unfortunately, because we're not treating electricity as a public good, they were able to make these decisions to not weatherize and there was very little oversight by Texas regulatory commissions that are captured by Big Oil. And so therefore, 10 years later, we're in an even worse predicament where who knows how many people have died and there's all these other casualties.\n\nRG: Right. And instead, they act like there's something inherent to a windmill, that it will freeze, when, of course, everybody knows there's windmills in Alaska, there's windmills in Canada, there's windmills in Northern Europe. It gets cold there, too. But they've invested and planned ahead for that and so the windmills continue to function. Mike, good luck, the rest of this week and next and thanks for joining us.\n\nMS: Well, thanks for having me, Ryan. I appreciate everything you do.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nRG: That was Mike Siegel.\n\nNow, to talk in more detail about what exactly is going on in Texas right now and why its power grid collapsed so spectacularly, I'm joined by Varun Rai. Rai is a professor in the LBJ School of Public Affairs and the director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin. He also directs the Energy Systems Transformation Research Group. From 2013 to 2015, he served as a commissioner for the electric utility Austin Energy, so he knows a little bit about the Texas Energy Grid.\n\nProfessor Rai, welcome to Deconstructed.\n\nVarun Rai: Thank you so much for having me.\n\nRG: Yeah, so what has the last week been like, for you?\n\nVR: Oh - it's been incredible, to say the least. I live in Austin, and even before the major weather conditions hit broadly in Texas, in Austin we had icing weather on Thursday and we already had power losses in many parts of Austin starting Thursday.\n\nAnd so, in the neighborhood we live in, we have been out of power since Thursday. So that's almost a week now. As of this morning, we have gotten power back, but now water is out. And this is widespread. This is not just you know, me or just even for Austin, right? It's much more widespread.\n\nRG: Were you able to cook? Do you have an electric stove? And what was the temperature like in your house after a few days of this?\n\nVR: Yeah, it went down to the 30s inside the house.\n\nRG: Geez.\n\nVR: Outside, without the wind chill, the temperatures were about 10 Fahrenheit, and then with wind chill, it went to -10 Fahrenheit. Inside it went into the 30s.\n\nWe have an electric cookstove, but we do have a gas fireplace and gas heating. Of course, the gas heating doesn't work because you need electricity for the controllers and for the fan. So we were burning wood. I was fortunate to have gotten a bunch of food just a few days ago, in preparation partly. And so that came in very handy. So in the gas fireplace, we were burning wood to stay warm, as well as we actually literally cooked food in the fireplace for the last six days, literally. There is no delivery. Nobody's delivering, obviously.\n\nRG: Right. Right.\n\nCan you talk a little bit about, you know, how we got here?\n\nI mean, what's fascinating is that rural electrification was one of Texas's kind of great populist achievements. And it was more recent than people remember - we're talking 1930s, 40s, 50s, that the state was getting wired up. How did the state go from, you know, populist control of, and pride in its electrical system, to where we are today? What was the kind of hinge point when that pivoted?\n\nVR: Great question. I think the pride in the Texas energy and electricity system still exists - well, you know, right before a week or so.\n\nRG: Right.\n\nVR: Now it's going to get very hard. And it's a system where certainly transparency and openness in terms of opportunities for market participants to come in and play - and also in one of the big changes that happened in this market was roughly two decades ago when the market was deregulated, and a few years later, things moved to what is known as an energy-only market where power plant generators get payback only for what the price of electricity is on the market and not necessarily for capacity. You're standing by the side waiting to be called, right? So there is a separation between how the market is designed.\n\nAnd it all had been working fine. But in events like this, it just becomes very difficult.\n\nRG: Right. A lot of people have been talking about 2011, the cold snap that came and the recommendations that followed that said: Look, this system needs upgrades to its infrastructure, or the next time there's a cold snap like this, you're gonna have a catastrophe. Is there something about the deregulated system that just disincentivizes investing in the infrastructure? Was it a political choice made by Republicans, and it's not totally to blame on the deregulated system? As somebody who's participated in this, but also studied it so extensively, what is it about this system that led us to a place where it was under-invested in?\n\nVR: Great question. It's a very complex question, Ryan. I'll try to break it up.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, as a generator, you will make your revenues by selling electricity on to the market. And so, part of the idea of this market design is because you're going to make money that way, and because, typically, you would expect market prices to go up higher in conditions like this, you'd have that incentive to keep running anyway. Because if you are not maintaining, then you will not be able to serve the market and hence, you will not be able to make money just when it is most profitable, potentially, to make the money. So there are actually incentives built into this type of design.\n\nThings are very competitive, right? And that was one of the primary ideas that, you know, doing that will bring prices down, right. And so there's a lot of competition. And, you know, that's one of the things that, you know, Texas thrives on, and there are all sorts of great things that come out of competition, not just in energy. And so to the extent you are investing in your own infrastructure, that costs you money, and then you know, that's a trade-off for you as an individual generator, your own bet as to how likely it might be for the system price to go up, that your investment will actually pay out.\n\nIf not, then your cost of production will be higher, but you will not be making up the money because the system price is not expected to go up much higher. And so it's understandable why, for an individual generator, the call might be, \"Hey, it's not worth going all the way.\"\n\nRG: Right. So it seems like on the question of incentives for spending on infrastructure upgrades, you have the collective action problem that you talked about, because it might be smarter for each individual business, and there's so many of them, to say: You know what? Let's roll the dice, and not invest, and hope that it doesn't hit a peak, and we can keep our prices the lowest.\n\nI wonder if you have the same collective action problem when it comes to transparency around how robustly you are actually following the guidelines that the state is putting out, that ERCOT is putting out because you might have an incentive to just, what they call in the army, just pencil with it. Say: Hey, did you check all of these boxes? Did you do all of this work? And you take your pencil out, and you check the box. And you say: Yes, sure, we did that. Because you're already gambling, that there aren't going to be severe events. You gambled with your investment that there won't be severe events. So if there are severe events, you're screwed, already on the front end, so you might as well just kind of fudge your records a little bit, since you're an LLC that's probably going to go under in the event of some major event. Do you think that that kind of dynamic could be playing in here?\n\nVR: It is totally and certainly possible. Is it real? That is what will need to be investigated, and I believe will be investigated.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind, there are all ranges of players, right? Everybody has to go through financial requirements, they are regulatory requirements; it's not easy to set up to be a generator or a supplier. Right? So there are all sorts of other things that do happen.\n\nSo, you know, it's not that simple. And also, there are other safety aspects that come into play. So it's hard for me to imagine that there is wide scale, complete neglect, I don't think that that happens. We function pretty well in tough conditions, you know? Even our winters sometimes get tough and we do well. Summers are very tough in taxes. We have done very well, even if nervously, every year. But we have continued to do so.\n\nBut going back to your question on collective action on transparency, I think that is also a possibility.\n\nRG: So, you know, early on, you started seeing Fox News and other right-wing outlets start putting up pictures of frozen windmills and saying: See, we told you, you go into renewables and this is what's going to happen. What's your reaction to that argument?\n\nVR: Some of those pictures are probably true. Windmills can freeze, and some of them can stop operating, and some of that actually happened in this market as well. That's one question.\n\nIf the question is, how much of what we're seeing right now is because of renewable energy generation, I mean, that already has got an answer. In our peak, as I mentioned, there were about 35 to 45 gigawatts of outages and a few gigawatts of that were wind, because that is that is the capacity that was going to be available, and the majority of that, up to about 30 gigawatts, that was outages in natural gas-based generation, both because of power plant generation and some because of gas supply limitations.\n\nRG: Right. So it's just not true to say that it had any demonstrable kind of large-scale effect?\n\nVR: Not in the full-scale problem that we are seeing.\n\nRG: Right. Lastly, what do you think needs to be done to make sure that not necessarily this doesn't happen again, but when you get a crisis like this again, that it's mitigated to a degree where you might have a few thousand people who lose power for a few hours, but you don't have millions of people freezing and starving?\n\nVR: Great question, Ryan. There are a couple things that are really basic and essential.\n\nOne we talked a lot about is winterization of our infrastructure. This has been known. How well are we doing that? That is the lowest-hanging fruit here. Let's push the pedal as far as we can there. That's number one; that's absolutely true.\n\nNumber two is there is a flip side to this. We talk mostly about supply, we didn't talk much about demand. Demand soared! And it soared past what was expected in ERCOT, even in extreme conditions, and not these extreme conditions, but whatever those horizons are planning were, it exceeded by a few gigawatts of what was planned. So, you know, people don't pay as much attention to the demand side, and that includes efficiency and weatherization of your homes and so on. It turns out that in events like this, actually, it's extremely important, how do we increase the efficiency of our appliances so that we are not consuming more - that helps not just in these conditions, it helps in a whole lot of other conditions and with whole lots of other problems, including with bills, and with, different types of pollutions.\n\nBut then also, especially in events like this, it becomes an extremely critical tool, while the supply side is getting its act together, at least people can stay inside for a little bit longer and not die of hypothermia.\n\nRG: Right.\n\nVR: So that's a very important piece. And the third piece to keep in mind, though, Ryan, is there are limits to how much we can prove any of this. Right? Going beyond a couple of the things that we talked about, that's the social choice that we all make, these are policy choices, right? We can create all sorts of policies and say: Hey, even if you're in a month-long, winter snow spell in Texas, we should be able to supply reliably to all our customers - yes, that's a policy choice we can make, but it comes at extremely huge costs, right? So where are those boundaries? That's a big discussion we need to have.\n\nI mean, what is shocking about this whole thing is how different entities, and policymakers, and local utilities, and lawmakers - everybody's really in a hard, tough situation, but pointing fingers at each other. And that just tells you that, in the big scheme of things, yeah, this is an extreme event for Texas, but things like this happen elsewhere in the world and in elsewhere in the U.S. and the type of response we are seeing is very shocking - the level of incoordination, unpreparedness, the sheer lack of coordinated response, that's been very challenging.\n\nSo, coming back to my point that it can get very costly. So, as a society, there needs to be a very clear discussion as to what we are looking for and that gets encoded through policy. But obviously, no matter what it is, I can tell you one thing, Ryan. The social choice will not be: Yeah, we can accept what we are seeing here for the last week. Absolutely not.\n\nRG: Right.

      "text": "How Texas Republicans Paved the Way for Their Own Demise\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Texas GOP's business-friendly policies have brought unexpected electoral changes to the state's booming suburbs.\n\nThe Republican takeover of Texas was gradual. First came the shocking upset of populist Democratic Gov. Ann Richards in 1994, who was upset by the party boy-turned-evangelical George W. Bush. Two years later, the GOP flipped the state Senate. It wasn't until the midterms of 2002, with Bush in the White House and riding a post-9/11 wave of popularity, that Texas Republicans achieved their trifecta.\n\nThe new majority went to work quickly on two primary objectives: to make Texas the most hospitable state in the country for business and the least hospitable for Democrats. By most measures, they delivered on both fronts. Yet success on their first objective ended up, to Republicans' great surprise, undermining their second. Texas did indeed become home to hundreds of thousands of new jobs as companies either launched or newly headquartered there with generous subsidies and low taxes . The problem for Republicans is that the environment they built to attract those companies also drew people to the state who are not Republicans.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism.

Grants would only be awarded when Texas was competing with another state to attract a company site. The effectiveness of those funds in creating new jobs is up for debate , as several companies receiving grants already had plans to come to the state, said University of Texas at Austin professor Nate Jensen, who studies state business incentive programs. But it was emblematic of the GOP's approach. No longer were Texas populists battling the barons on behalf of the little man. The full power of the state would now be aimed at making businesses in Texas more comfortable and attracting as many from out of state as possible.\n\nIn Austin, the Republican-controlled legislature used the last two decades to create a business haven in the state, creating billions of dollars in corporate incentives and tax breaks. Texas has never levied a state income tax and is one of nine states without one. The state also has generally low taxes, a low cost of living, and relatively high quality of life. It also has land - lots of it. As housing prices soared in the 2000s, particularly in California, life in Texas, where a large home could be bought on a reasonable salary, people came in droves. New developments sprang up as the suburbs of Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and Austin exploded. Each new suburban development or relocated headquarters created its own expanded economic activity, a virtuous circle that helped feed what became known as \"the Texas miracle .\" That miracle was concentrated in Texas's major cities while poorer and rural areas saw declines. Texas still has one of the highest poverty rates in the nation, and while the average rate declined slightly in recent years, almost 4 million people fell below the poverty line between 2016 and 2018, the Houston Chronicle reported .\n\nIn their first year controlling the chamber, GOP legislators, guided by national Republicans Karl Rove and Tom DeLay, also did away with Democrats. Because the state legislature had been divided the previous session, redistricting hadn't been completed. It was stuck in the courts, but the newly empowered Republicans decided to do it themselves, putting a radical gerrymandering on the House floor. Democrats fled the state to try to deny quorum. Holed up in Oklahoma , they became known as the \"Killer Ds.\" But Republicans got the map through anyway and cemented their majority. Democrats clawed back slightly but were crushed again by the tea party wave in 2010, leading to a fresh new gerrymander .\n\nTexas has also led the way when it comes to voter suppression - despite a rapidly growing population and the spike in turnout in 2018, the state still ranks near last in voter turnout. Texas's slowly shifting political demography, from red to purple, is often attributed to its three fast-growing metro areas, which have drawn in Democratic voters from around the country . A record number of voters in Texas have registered so far this year. That, paired with its population boom and a backlash to Donald Trump among Republican voters in the state, could make 2020 the year Democrats take control of the state House for the first time since 2002 and possibly vote for a Democrat in the race for the White House and the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe success of Texas in luring so many well-educated workers predisposed to vote Democrat happened, in part, in spite of the Republicans, not because of them. \"I wouldn't ascribe that to the Republican Party or certainly not those who are in power right now,\" said former Democratic presidential candidate and Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke. \"A lot of this just has to do with ingenuity and innovation of everyday Texans who are making this a more and more attractive state.\"\n\nSome of that ingenuity is centered in the state's major cities, which the Texas Republican lawmakers are regularly at war with. \"The Texas business success is a complex story, and business incentives are probably a very small part of it,\" Jensen said, explaining that some receiving companies were either already operating in the state or planning to expand there. \"That being said, we offer really large incentives, in particular for a successful state.\" Other factors contributing to Texas's population boom are its size and physical infrastructure, Jensen said, including having a large market and its own power grid, a robust renewable energy sector, and major shipping and airports.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage Election 2020\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nIn just the last two years, Apple, Uber, Tesla, and Facebook all announced plans to expand offices in Texas. Nasdaq is in talks with Republican Gov. Greg Abbott about relocating trading systems to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the Dallas Morning News reported last week.\n\nCompanies like Uber and Tesla typically offer higher-paying jobs concentrated in cities, Jensen explained, and the state isn't seeing even development in the state's more rural areas. Those areas have simultaneously had dips in population. \"A lot of our really high-end, really great investment that's coming here has been clustered around just a handful of cities. Again, not uncommon. But it's easy to say, 'Well, Texas is a great business environment.' It's more like there's few cities in Texas that have been very good at attracting [business].\" For example, he said, the high quality of life in Austin attracts people on their own. \"In some sense, it's attractive for workers and that makes it attractive for companies that are trying to attract kind of a global workforce.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump tours an Apple manufacturing plant in Austin with Apple CEO Tim Cook and Ivanka Trump, the daughter and adviser of President Donald Trump, left on Nov. 20, 2019.\n\nThe state's population grew by more than 3.5 million people between 2010 and 2018, a 14 percent increase. About 40 percent of Texans are Latino, compared to 18 percent nationally, and the state has a slightly younger population than the nation as a whole - a quarter of people are under the age of 18. People of color make up close to half of Texas's eligible voting population and estimates show that Latinos will represent a plurality of the state population by 2021 . Those changes created a much more competitive landscape last cycle, eventually pushing six GOP members of Congress to announce retirement last year, and a seventh, John Ratcliffe, was confirmed as director of national intelligence in May.\n\nTrump's election in 2016 changed the future of Republican politics in the state for the worse and foreshadowed a slow erosion. Trump won the state by a much smaller margin than Mitt Romney had in 2012, and slightly less than John McCain did in 2008. Another six House Republicans retired ahead of the 2018 midterms, compared to two Democrats, including O'Rourke, who challenged Republican Sen. Ted Cruz that year. More than 1.8 million additional people have registered to vote in Texas since 2016, and Democrats are nine seats away from taking control of the state House for the first time in 20 years, sights set on breaking a long-held Republican trifecta ahead of redistricting in 2021.\n\nThose trends, combined with spikes in voter turnout in recent years and efforts by local groups to engage working-class and low-income voters, laid the groundwork for O'Rourke to come within 3 points of unseating Cruz in 2018. That year, voter turnout in the state reached its highest point since 1970 . Democratic candidate Lizzie Fletcher defeated nine-term Republican Rep. John Culberson by 5 points in Houston that year, and Colin Allred ousted former Republican House Rules Chair Pete Sessions by 7 points in Dallas. (Sessions is running in November in the open race for the 17th District, where Rep. Bill Flores announced his retirement last year.) Twelve Democratic candidates ran in this year's March Senate primary, with labor organizer Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez coming in third with more than 246,000 votes.\n\nIf Democratic gains in the Houston and Dallas suburbs hold, it's a matter of when, not if, Texas flips blue. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden \"has his foot in the door\" in Texas, O'Rourke and Tory Gavito, Texas activist and co-founder of the progressive fundraising group Way to Win, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed last week, \"and needs to kick it open for a quick end to the election.\" A \"pattern of underestimating Democratic candidates shows Biden can win Texas,\" they argued. Days later, the Biden campaign booked a $6 million digital ad buy in the state, the largest such investment there from any Democratic presidential nominee in more than 20 years. But the campaign appeared to scale back some of those efforts, the Dallas Morning News reported Friday and canceled some of the planned ads. Jill Biden and Douglas Emhoff, husband of the Democratic vice presidential candidate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, traveled to the state in recent weeks ahead of the first day of early voting on Tuesday. Biden and Harris have not visited since the March primary.\n\nThe Lone Star state's major corporate incentives and property tax abatements have helped attract major tech companies, and their employees, who tend to be younger and more highly educated. The state's urban hubs have shifted further blue, and national Democrats are paying more attention to Texas in the final weeks leading up to Election Day - a notably late investment.\n\nBut even as more and more voters are engaging each year, voter suppression tactics by Republicans could block Democratic progress.\n\nA worker puts a ballot into a lock box at a drive-thru mail ballot hand delivery center in Austin, Texas, U.S., Oct. 2, 2020.\n\nVoter suppression in Texas has been exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic. While most states have expanded mail-in voting, some doing so even before the start of the coronavirus outbreak, Abbott, the Texas governor, has repeatedly refused to do so, most recently on October 1. The GOP has also erected barriers to early voting; early Tuesday morning, a panel of three Trump-appointed federal judges overturned a lower-court ruling allowing counties to use multiple drop boxes to make voting easier during the pandemic, upholding Abbott's October 1 order that counties could have only one box.\n\nThat's likely because they know that shifts in the voting population don't bode well for them. \"Texas is arguably the most voter-suppressed state in the union,\" O'Rourke said, during a break from a 12-hour phone bank with his voter outreach group, Powered by People, on Monday, when they registered 18,000 volunteers to help call 1 million people. \"No state tries harder to keep its own people from voting - and specifically Black Texans, Latino Texans, Texans from communities of color. Prior to 2018, we were 50th, dead last, in voter turnout,\" O'Rourke said. The share of Latino voters who turned out during the state's 2018 midterms nearly doubled from 2014 , reaching 1.87 million voters, the Corpus-Christi Caller-Times reported . Groups like the Texas Organizing Project, MOVE Texas, and Jolt , which Ramirez founded, focusing on grassroots organizing and activating the state's young, Latino and working-class voters, helped make that possible.\n\n\"All that was really the prologue or preview of 2020,\" O'Rourke said, adding that turnout during presidential cycles tends to favor Democrats. On top of that, he said, Texas is dealing with \"miserable leadership from Republicans nationally and certainly in the state of Texas where we have 16,500 Covid deaths disproportionately impacting communities of color.\" As of Tuesday, that number surpassed 17,000.\n\nRelated Texas Voter Suppression Tactics Recall the Jim Crow Era\n\nDemocrats haven't won a statewide office in Texas since the early '90s, but they're within reach of flipping the state House before redistricting takes place next year, a process during which Texas is expected to add at least three new congressional districts. State Democrats need to flip nine seats to take the House and are targeting 22 seats where Republicans won by less than 10 points. The state Democratic Party has capitalized on that growth, O'Rourke said, listing candidates for the state House running to flip districts in Houston's suburbs like Akilah Bacy in District 138, a local attorney and former assistant district attorney in Harris County, and Natali Hurtado in District 126, who's running a second time against Republican state Rep. Sam Harless after losing to him last cycle by just under 10 points.\n\nOther state House districts most likely to flip from red to blue are clustered around the metro areas of north Dallas, including Districts 108, 66, and 112, and in Houston and its western suburbs in Districts 26 and 134. \"There's a real chance Democrats could flip the Texas house this year. Just imagine that for a second,\" said Rita Bosworth, founder and executive director of Sister District, a grassroots group founded after Trump's election focused on flipping state legislatures blue. \"Beto won nine seats in 2018, nine of these seats in a Republican house. It's not like this is Democrats and their pipe dream. This is actually a possibility,\" she said. O'Rourke carried nine of 17 districts represented by Republicans that year.\n\nFor all its growth in recent years, Texas still follows the federal $7.25 minimum wage and has some of the highest numbers of uninsured people in the country, a massive maternal mortality crisis disproportionately impacting Black women , and a county jail system as the largest provider of mental health care, O'Rourke said. Following national trends , unemployment as a result of the pandemic has disproportionately hit the state's Black and Hispanic residents, the Texas Tribune reported, exacerbated by the state's already unequal economic expansion. Focusing on those issues is what's resonating with voters, O'Rourke said. \"There are a lot of things that make it very hard for a lot of people to live in Texas. And I think that is creating an opportunity for Democratic challengers who can connect the dots.\"\n\nUnlike other major states preparing for delayed election results due to expanded mail-in voting, Texas is expected to know the winner of the presidential election on November 3. If the state goes blue, it could be decisive in determining the overall results of the election on the very same day, O'Rourke said. \"You could wait days or weeks for Pennsylvania to come in, and that's gonna be contested in the courts, and Donald Trump's gonna seek to invalidate this or that state's returns, or individual ballots, in a kind of nightmare reminiscent of the year 2000 in Bush v. Gore. Or we could decide this with Texas. And then it is mathematically, psychologically, and in every other way that matters, impossible for Donald Trump to claim victory. And we as a country can avert the kind of crisis that he would seek to create if there's any confusion about the results.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Texas GOP Wants Citizens to Stop Migrants. Critics Say It's a \"Vigilante Death Squads Policy.\"\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nRepublican lawmakers are making a bid to challenge the federal government's monopoly on immigration enforcement at the Supreme Court.\n\nDade Phelan, the Republican speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, sounded mostly triumphant delivering speech at a right-wing think tank in Austin earlier this month. \"Eleven-hundred people come here every single day,\" the fourth-generation real estate developer told a friendly audience at the Texas Public Policy Foundation as he laid out his party's objectives in the final weeks of the state's legislative session.\n\n\"They're voting with their feet,\" Phelan said of the newcomers. \"They know we're a conservative state. They know we value the Second Amendment. They know we value life, and they know we value religious liberty.\" These people are \"fleeing states like California, New Jersey, New York, and Illinois for a very good reason,\" the speaker argued, because Texas is \"the land of opportunity.\"\n\nThe news wasn't all good though. The promise of opportunity had consequences, which would require a stiff response from the state's residents. \"In southeast Texas we care about four things, which is God, the Second Amendment, babies, and the border,\" Phelan said. While Texas was doing great in the first three categories, \"we have a long way to go on the border.\" Luckily, the party has a plan. \"Sometime next week,\" Phelan vowed, \"we are going to file a bill that is, I hope, going to make national headlines and change the conversation on border security, and hopefully take the battle all the way to the Supreme Court and allow Texas to protect its own border.\"\n\nBy seeking to create a state security force that would include private citizens amassed to \"repel\" border crossers and do battle with \"cartel operatives,\" the proposal - House Bill 20 - did make news. If it passes, Texas will field a new unit under its Department of Public Safety to track down, arrest, and deport undocumented people.\n\nStationed at the border, the unit will be run by a chief serving at the pleasure of the governor, who will oversee a mix of locally recruited law enforcement and ordinary citizens \"without a felony conviction.\" Unit members will have immunity from criminal prosecution and lawsuits in pursuing their mission to \"arrest, detain, and deter individuals crossing the border illegally including with the use of non-deadly force.\" They will also \"use force to repel, arrest, and detain known transnational cartel operatives in the border region.\" Private citizens will be given arrest powers if they are \"trained and specifically authorized by the governor.\"\n\nCompanion legislation in the Texas Senate, if passed, will make undocumented entry into Texas a state crime - with first-time offenders facing a year in prison, second-time offenders facing two, and offenders with a prior felony conviction facing life behind bars. The new unit will exist until at least 2030, at which point Texas lawmakers will decide on its reauthorization. Republicans have called the bill the \"Border Protection Unit Act.\" Texas Democrats have gone a different direction, dubbing the proposal the \"vigilante death squads policy.\"\n\n\"This dangerous, radical, and unconstitutional proposal which empowers border vigilantes to hunt migrants and racially profile Latinos is going to result in the death of innocent people,\" Victoria Neave Criado, the Democratic chair of Mexican American Legislative Caucus, said in a statement last week. \"MALC is going to do everything in our power to kill this legislation just as Latino State Representatives for the past 5 decades have fought against Klan-like proposals.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nBy seeking to legalize state-run deportation squads, Texas Republicans have created a dilemma for their ideological foes: accept the existence of the new border unit until at least 2030 or challenge the law and roll the dice with a conservative Supreme Court. The lawmakers clearly like their odds with the high court justices, three of whom were appointed by former President Donald Trump, and have their sights set on undoing one of the most important bodies of borderland precedent in recent history.\n\nEric Gamino, an assistant professor of criminology and justice studies at California State University, Northridge, grew up in the Rio Grande Valley, the South Texas epicenter of national-level border discourse and ground-level border militarization. For eight years, he was a police officer there. He now researches the way the border policing intersects border life. Gamino sees two important components to the Border Protection Unit Act: the immediate changes that would come to Texas if the bill is passed, and the long game Republicans are playing in angling for a Supreme Court fight.\n\nOn its surface, he said, the bill is an escape hatch from a costly and ineffective border blitz. In 2021, Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott launched \"Operation Lone Star,\" a massive state-led effort that has surged thousands of National Guard troops and various law enforcement officials from across the state to the border. In the two years since, the more than $4 billion program has been riddled with scandal - including the deaths of National Guard personnel and allegations of systemic civil rights violations that have led to a Justice Department investigation - while making no discernable impact in slowing the illicit movement of drugs or people across the border.\n\n\"It's a rebranding campaign,\" Gamino told The Intercept. \"The governor has recognized that Operation Lone Star is ineffective, that it's a failed operation. They want to send these individuals back home, but they need to replace the bodies - meaning these individuals who are hyper-militarizing the borderlands - they need to replace them with people that have arrest authorities.\"\n\nPhelan, the Texas House speaker, made precisely that argument in Austin earlier this month, telling Texas Public Policy Foundation attendees: \"We can bring our troopers home. We can bring home our game wardens. We can bring home our National Guard and take the fight to the border ourselves.\"\n\nIf the bill passes, Gamino expects that most of the Border Protection Unit's arrest operations will be carried out by locally recruited law enforcement officials, with civilians aiding in surveillance and border wall construction. The inclusion of civilians, which has featured prominently in coverage of the bill, still concerns him. \"They might vet these individuals by providing training through DPS,\" Gamino said, referring to the state's Department of Public Safety, \"but they know the type of individual that they're going to attract.\" The likelihood for zealous, anti-immigrant recruits is high. Gamino's deeper concern, however, is the shrewd, and potentially precedent-setting, power play Republicans are making in proposing the bill at all.\n\n\"They know that it's unconstitutional, that it's bound to get challenged in the courts, and that is what they're purposely doing,\" he said. If the gambit is successful, he said, \"It will change the complexity of enforcement on the borderlands for the entire Southwest region.\"\n\nSpeaker of the House Dade Phelan bangs a gavel in the House chamber at the State Capitol in Austin, Tex., on July 8, 2021.\n\nIn Texas, raising citizen armies against particular populations of people has a dark, not-too-distant history. In the early 20th century, the state was the site of widespread lynchings of Mexicans and Mexican Americans. The work of Monica Muñoz Martinez, a historian at the University of Texas and author of \"The Injustice Never Leaves You: Anti-Mexican Violence in Texas,\" examines a particularly bloody period from 1910 to 1920.\n\n\"That was a period where you saw the militarization of the border in response to calls to secure the border and to protect Anglo Americans from Mexicans that were profiled as criminals, as dangerous, as a threat to democracy, whether they were American citizens or Mexican nationals,\" Muñoz told The Intercept. \"It was this period of what you would call today racial profiling.\"\n\nAt the time, lawmakers were clamoring - as they are today - for military force against Mexico. The state activated posses that worked with local law enforcement to hunt down purported threats from the borderlands. Historians estimate that thousands of men, women, and children were killed. The specter of vigilante violence returned in the 1970s, when Louis Beam, an infamous white supremacist, built a paramilitary \"Klan Border Watch\" compound in Texas. Beam trained hundreds of border vigilantes over several years. \"When our government officials refuse to enforce the laws of the country,\" he said , \"we will enforce them ourselves.\"\n\nWhile it was Phelan who teased the Border Protection Unit Act in Austin, the proposal was written by fellow Republican Rep. Matt Schaefer, the founder and chair of the arch-conservative Texas Freedom Caucus. The east Texas lawmaker, who did not respond to an interview request, has dismissed his bill's alleged reflection of a dark history of racial terror and violence.\n\n\"The Texas Border Protection Unit will be an organization of professional men and women hired/trained under the authority of the Dept of Public Safety to protect Texans,\" Schaefer tweeted last week. \"Many will be licensed peace officers, others trained and specifically authorized by the Governor to make lawful arrests. Exactly as the Nat'l Guard & DPS operate now under Operation Lone Star.\"\n\nSchaefer's bill is part of a wider movement within the GOP. Since losing the White House in 2020, Republicans have made one legal effort after another to wrest control of the border from the federal government by arguing that the Southwest is in the grips of an \"invasion\" aided and abetted by the president of the United States and his administration. Under these conditions, GOP lawmakers say they are duty-bound to assert unusual wartime powers.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nThe argument is in part the brainchild of the Center for Renewing America , a right-wing Washington think tank. Populated by former Trump administration officials, including Ken Cuccinelli, Trump's former acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the group has spent the past two years lobbying hard for a legal theory that challenges broadly accepted constitutional understandings of the separation of powers between the federal government and border states.\n\nIn Arizona last year, the Center for Renewing America's work set in motion former state Attorney General Mark Brnovich's filing of a legal opinion declaring that the state was being invaded . Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, who recently left office, used a similar line of reasoning in a lawsuit last fall, which argued that a strip of the border that has belonged to the federal government since before Arizona statehood in fact fell under state jurisdiction. Ducey said a state of emergency meant that he could ignore all federal laws concerning construction on those lands. He then attempted to build a 10-mile border wall of shipping containers in defiance of federal authorities . The project, which is estimated to have cost Arizona taxpayers more than $200 million , was blocked by local community resistance and Ducey agreed to remove the containers in December.\n\nIn Texas, Abbott has leaned on the states' rights invasion argument to justify Operation Lone Star, though he has faced criticism from the Center for Renewing America for not going far enough . Up until now, Abbott has stopped short of authorizing his forces to boot undocumented people out of the country themselves, a critical component needed to trigger the kind of constitutional challenges the nativist Republicans would like to see before the nation's highest court.\n\nWhether the Center for Renewing America played a role in the creation of Border Protection Unit Act is unclear, and the think tank did not respond to a request for comment. It appears, however, that the most hard-line elements of the Republican Party have finally gotten at least part of what they want: a powerful border state moving forward with a plan to conduct its own immigration arrests and deportations.\n\nThey have, in other words, created a constitutional provocation that seemingly cannot be ignored.\n\nKen Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, has been prodigious in his legal war against the Biden administration. With a string Trump-era appointments to the federal bench, his efforts have been effective, so much so, though, that some constitutional law experts have accused the attorney general of \"judge shopping.\" (Paxton has denied the allegation.) In a state Senate hearing last year, Paxton's deputy, First Assistant Attorney General Brent Webster, highlighted his office's \"wild success\" in suing the White House.\n\n\"We have a 93 percent win rate right now against the federal government,\" Webster testified. But there was a problem: \"Our hands are somewhat tied in what we can legally do in Texas regarding immigration. And that is because of a case called Arizona v. U.S.\"\n\nThe case is among the most important in the recent history of the border. It stems from a 2010 Arizona law, known as S.B. 1070, that - like the Border Protection Unit Act in Texas - expanded the state-level government's authority over border and immigration enforcement. The law empowered local officials like former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who then created a now infamous regime of racial profiling. The backlash to S.B. 1070 fueled massive protests across the country. In 2012, the core components of the law were struck down in a 5-3 Supreme Court decision.\n\n\"Our office doesn't agree with that ruling,\" Webster testified to Texas lawmakers last year. \"We welcome laws that might allow us to have a new case we could go up on to readdress this issue, because the makeup of the Supreme Court has changed and because the situation has changed.\"\n\nAs if he weren't clear enough, Webster spelled it out. \"Look at the laws that we can pass to go up and, again, challenge the current precedent regarding Arizona v. U.S.,\" he said. \"We ask for you guys to consider laws that might enable us to go and challenge that ruling again.\"\n\nA year later, nearly to the day, the Border Protection Unit Act was introduced. For Texas Democrats, the bill is a road map to a \"show me your papers\" police state and a sign of the Republican majority's posture going into the final weeks of lawmaking. \"HB 20 is a tinderbox waiting to explode that will leave this Session in flames,\" Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, chair of the Texas House Democratic Caucus, said last week. \"House Republicans have been warned.\"\n\nTexas immigration advocates are now in a delicate place. \"This bill is the most dangerous proposal we have ever seen on border issues,\" Roberto Lopez, of the Texas Civil Rights Project, told Texas Public Radio. But he cautioned that if a legal challenge led to the Supreme Court overturning federal control of immigration policy, the state-led regime that would take its place could be more dangerous for immigrants. \"We need to make that very challenging and difficult decision on whether or not we want to risk upsetting or removing prior precedent that was beneficial to our communities.\"\n\nIt's a no-win situation, said Gamino, the border cop-turned-researcher. The Border Protection Unit Act would be bad in practice, he argued, and it would be the law of the land for several years at least. A Supreme Court decision upholding its legality, paving the way for its replication across the border, would be even worse.\n\n\"When you look at Arizona and you look at the decision that was handed down, that was 5-3. And now you look at the makeup of the Supreme Court, where it's a conservative majority, who's not to say that they will side with the state of Texas?\" Gamino asked. \"I'm not trying to minimize the concerns of the greater public with regards to what's going to happen with this Border Protection Unit, but I think what should raise concern is the ultimate goal of these politicians.\"\n\n\"You can't play to their hand,\" he said, \"because if the Supreme Court sides with the state of Texas, it's not going to be pretty.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Pegasus Spyware Maker Said to Flout Federal Court as It Lobbies to Get Off U.S. Blacklist\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nOn the same day lobbyists for NSO met with Rep. Pete Sessions, a lawyer from the lobbying firm gave $1,000 to \"Pete Sessions for Congress.\"\n\nRep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, serves a primarily rural district anchored in Waco, a city of 150,000. It's unclear why he is so interested in NSO Group, the infamous Israeli spyware firm that was blacklisted by the U.S. for its role in human rights abuses.\n\nBetween February and July, though, Sessions and his team met eight times with lobbyists on behalf of NSO.\n\nOne meeting was held for a \"briefing on Bureau of Industry and Security Status\" - the Department of Commerce office that blacklisted NSO in November 2021. Others were for \"discussions of news articles reporting on NSO technology and the war in Gaza\" and \"NSO VISA issue,\" according to documents filed with the Foreign Agents Registrations Act, or FARA, at the end of August.\n\nIn July, on the same day that the lobbyists from the law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, a D.C. powerhouse, met with Sessions to \"discuss NSO technology and human rights policies,\" one of its lawyers and former House member from Texas, Greg Laughlin, paid $1,000 by check to \"Pete Sessions for Congress.\" At other times, Laughlin - who is actively registered as a lobbyist for NSO, according to current filings - donated to the campaigns of other Texas Republicans who NSO met with , including Rep. Dan Crenshaw.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of Israel's war efforts and the looming possibility of a Trump administration, NSO is doubling down on its efforts to connect with members of Congress - almost exclusively with Republicans - as it makes a bid to reverse its blacklisting . NSO's Pegasus spyware can infect and infiltrate cellphones and has been used by authoritarian governments to hack the devices of dissidents, journalists, and human rights activists, enabling grave abuses.\n\nThe latest blitz in its yearslong campaign for delisting kicked off at the onset of the Israeli war in Gaza last year, when NSO tried to persuade Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that its technology was of use to the American government.\n\n\"It is, unfortunately, not uncommon for FARA registrants to make campaign contributions to the members of Congress they're contacting on behalf of foreign interests,\" Ben Freeman, director of the Democratizing Foreign Policy program at the Quincy Institute, told The Intercept. \"And, even if that contribution occurs on the exact same day the meeting takes place, it's perfectly legal.\"\n\nFreeman said NSO's focus on Republicans might arise from Democrats' growing disillusionment with Israel.\n\n\"This absolutely looks like part of NSO Group lobbyists ongoing efforts to reverse the firm's blacklisting,\" he said. \"Frankly, they're going to find Republicans an easier target than Democrats for putting pressure on the Commerce Department to delist NSO Group, with many Democrats' souring on Israel because of the thousands of civilians they've killed in the Gaza war.\"\n\nIn a statement to The Intercept, Pillsbury spokesperson Matt Myams said, \"Former Congressman Greg Laughlin has known and politically supported Congressman Sessions for many years. During that time, they have discussed a wide variety of topics, including general questions about how certain immigration laws work.\" (NSO Group declined to comment and Sessions' office did not respond to a request.)\n\nSo far this year NSO has spent over $1.8 million on lobbying, according to FARA documents. Alongside Pillsbury, D.C.-based Chartwell Strategy Group as well as Los Angeles lobbying firm Paul Hastings have also heavily focused their efforts on connecting predominately with Republican lawmakers on behalf of NSO.\n\nWhile NSO continues to rebuild its reputation in the U.S., others have thrown in the towel. Candiru , another Israeli spyware company which was blacklisted along with NSO, lost its U.S. contracts and terminated its Washington lobbying contract with ArentFox Schiff earlier this year.\n\nNSO, in contrast, continued its effort by using Israel's war to boost its chances. The company marketed itself as a volunteer in the war on Gaza, claiming to help track down missing Israelis and hostages. The bid to persuade the American government to let it come back to the table has been called an attempt to \" crisis-wash \" NSO's record.\n\nEven as it makes the case in Washington that it complies with U.S. requirements for discouraging rights abuses using its software, in California, NSO is being accused in a separate instance of flagrantly defying a federal court order.\n\nEarlier this month, WhatsApp and its parent company Meta asked the judge in their case against NSO to award them a total win as punishment for NSO's violations of discovery requirements. The spyware company has refused to produce internal email communications and the source code of its technology.\n\nIn NSO's response , filed on October 16, the firm said there was \"no basis for any sanction, let alone terminating sanctions, because Defendants have not violated any order.\" WhatsApp's termination request, the filing said, was \"ludicrous.\" NSO said WhatsApp's case was \"the first of five ill-conceived lawsuits filed against Defendants in the United States amidst a wave of negative press coverage.\"\n\nIn its five-year-long case, WhatsApp this month made sweeping allegations about NSO's refusal to produce internal email communications and Pegasus source code.\n\n\"NSO's discovery violations were willful, and unfairly skew the record on virtually every key issue in the case, from the merits, to jurisdiction, to damages, making a full and fair trial on the facts impossible,\" the company said in the filing.\n\nLast year, NSO asked the court for a protective order to insulate them from the discovery process under Israeli law, which was denied. At a hearing this February, the court said it \"would not feel reluctant to impose sanctions\" if NSO failed to meet its discovery obligations.\n\n\"NSO group has made a lot of arguments to resist discovery and kind of draw out the early stages of litigation in these cases as much as possible,\" said Stephanie Krent, attorney at Columbia University's Knight First Amendment Institute.\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nThe next hearing in the WhatsApp case will take place on November 7.\n\n\"We remain focused on protecting our users,\" a WhatsApp spokesperson told The Intercept. \"We firmly believe NSO's operations violate U.S. law and they must be held accountable for their unlawful attacks.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in addition to the case by WhatsApp, NSO is facing other hefty accusations in U.S. litigation.\n\nLast month, Apple asked a court in San Francisco to dismiss its three-year hacking suit against NSO. The California tech giant said its case was no longer viable after Israeli government officials took files from NSO's headquarters in an apparent attempt to frustrate lawsuits in the U.S. Apple argued it may now never be able to get the most critical files about Pegasus spyware.\n\nAs NSO continues to face problems in the U.S., the High Court in London ruled this month that a case against Saudi Arabia for its use of Pegasus can move forward, according to documents obtained by The Intercept. (The Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThe ruling came after four human rights defenders who were hacked with Pegasus on British soil submitted a report to the Metropolitan Police last month asking them to open an investigation and prosecute the company.\n\nYahya Assiri, a Saudi human rights activist who has been granted refugee status in the U.K., had previously lodged a civil claim against Saudi Arabia. As a check to protect diplomatic relations, British courts have a process to approve the routing of claims to foreign governments.\n\nWith this month's ruling, Assiri has overcome that hurdle. His lawyers can now serve his claim against Saudi Arabia for using NSO's Pegasus and another spyware product by Quadream - also an Israeli company founded by NSO veterans - to hack his phone multiple times between 2018 and 2020 while he was living in the U.K.\n\nThe claim will be sent through diplomatic channels to the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n\"Violators' impunity is the main power for repression to continue. Accountability - bringing them before courts, the media, and the world - can at least partially deter them,\" Assiri told The Intercept. \"The evidence is strong, and the authorities' request for immunity has been rejected. This means that the world must stop looking for justifications for violations - there is no justification for any violation.\"\n\nCorrection: November 11, 2024 This story has been corrected to reflect that Matt Myams is a spokesperson for the law firm Pillsbury, not Rep. Pete Sessions.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "God, Gas, and Cash: How Texas Fell in Love With Israel - and Then Trampled on the Constitution\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\n\"The Israelis are kind of like cowboys,\" said Texas' agriculture commissioner. \"They're tough and gritty and they don't take any shit from anybody.\"\n\nOn the afternoon of April 19, 2018, a group of Texas Republicans received an email confirming their upcoming all-expenses-paid trips to Israel. An orientation packet filled with background on their destination \"for reading on the flight,\" the message said, was forthcoming.\n\nThe May 2018 trip to Israel would not be Texas politicians' first - Gov. Greg Abbott, for one, flew to Israel on casino magnate Sheldon Adelson's private jet in 2016 .\n\nBut it was unique in at least one crucial way: The trip was organized by the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, according to records obtained by the Center for Media and Democracy and reviewed by The Intercept. The right-wing group of over 2,000 state legislators, lobbyists, and corporate backers writes legislation to be exported to statehouses around the country and has largely focused on issues like \"stand your ground\" gun laws and voter suppression efforts. By leading a delegation to Israel, ALEC was opening up a new front, demonstrating the extent to which support for Israel has become a central part of the GOP's policy agenda, especially in Texas.\n\nThe delegation, which included eight elected Texas officials, was a reflection of Texas Republicans' deep ties to Israel: rooted in a combination of economic interests, an Israel-loving evangelical base, and pro-Israel advocates whose campaign contributions have helped the state's GOP maintain its 16-year governing trifecta. Those ties have grown stronger in recent years, even as Israel lurches to the extremist right, entrenches its military occupation of Palestinian land, and continues to build settlements, considered by most of the world illegal under international law.\n\n\"The Israelis are kind of like cowboys. They're tough and gritty and they don't take any shit from anybody.\"\n\nAs the Trump administration maintains the friendliest U.S. relationship with the Israeli right in history, Texas has become one of the most pro-Israel states in the country. It has forged ties with Israeli settlements and aggressively enforced a law targeting advocates of boycotting Israel. Its exports to Israel last year topped $900 million, and its imports from Israel are valued at $1.5 billion, according to the Texas Economic Development Corporation, making Texas the fourth biggest Israeli trade partner in the U.S. (Florida, however, is now competing with Texas over supporting Israel: The state's Trump-backed governor, Ron DeSantis, who campaigned on a promise to be America's most pro-Israel governor, traveled to Israel on a \" business development mission \" with members of his cabinet in late May and was on hand to applaud the announcement of a student exchange program between Ariel University, an institution located in an Israeli settlement deep in the occupied West Bank, and Florida Atlantic University.)\n\n\"I think we have a lot in common with Israel,\" Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, an adviser to Trump's 2016 election campaign who once shared a meme on Facebook suggesting the U.S. drop a nuclear bomb on the \"Muslim world,\" told The Intercept. \"The Israelis are kind of like cowboys. They're tough and gritty and they don't take any shit from anybody.\"\n\nTexas's booming oil and gas industry was a focal point of the ALEC-sponsored delegation, which was meant to strengthen the already robust economic bonds between Texas and Israel, according to the records reviewed by The Intercept. The Texas energy companies CenterPoint and Vistra, and Zev Shulkin, a Texas doctor and pro-Israel advocate, joined ALEC in paying for the trip, according to the records, which do not reveal the total cost.\n\nThe Texas Republicans on the trip included Railroad Commissioner Wayne Christian; state Reps. Phil King, Ron Simmons, Tony Dale, and Dennis Paul; and state Sens. Larry Taylor, Brandon Creighton, and Donna Campbell. Their days were filled with meeting Israeli technology companies and discussing how Texas can help Israel out with fossil fuel production, along with trips to Israeli settlement businesses. (ALEC, the energy companies, Shulkin, and the Texas state legislators did not respond to repeated requests for comment.)\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, a backer of Israeli settlements who met with the group on their first night in town, told the legislators that Texas oil and gas made \"all the difference in the world\" to Israel, according to an email sent by Christian, who as railroad commissioner regulates oil and gas production in Texas. From 2009 to 2010, Houston company Noble Energy discovered two huge gas fields off the coast of Israel, and subsequently partnered with Israeli companies to sell natural gas to Jordan and Egypt for at least $25 billion.\n\n\"Israel is one of our nation's greatest allies, yet historically due to our reliance on Middle Eastern oil, the US has been hesitant to fight alongside Israel on the battlefield (although we have been supportive),\" Christian wrote to Lisa Nelson, the CEO of ALEC, after he got back from the trip to Israel. \"Because of Texas oil and gas, we are now, for the first time in the 70 years of Israeli history, able to be bold in our support of this great Nation.\"\n\nThe Lone Star State's economic ties to Israel are expanding beyond fossil fuels.\n\n\"What drives the Texas economy is exactly where Israel innovates the most: energy efficiency, water conservation and treatment, cyber security, health care innovation,\" said Toba Hellerstein, CEO of the Texas-Israel Alliance.\n\nIsrael and Texas have also collaborated on the military-industrial complex. In 2014, Elbit Systems of America, the Texas-based subsidiary of Israeli company Elbit, landed a $145 million contract to build surveillance towers along the Arizona-Mexico border. The Fort Worth factory of Lockheed Martin, the American defense giant, built the stealth F-35 fighter jets that Israel first bought in 2010 for $2.75 billion .\n\n\"We put such heavy emphasis on our law enforcement here, on ICE, on securing the border, a wall; all things that are mirrored in Israel,\" said Mohamad Fattouh, a member of the executive board of Students for Justice in Palestine at the University of Houston. \"Texas sees itself in Israel and vice versa.\"\n\nTexas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller stands in front of a Texas flag in Tyler, Texas, on July 12, 2018.\n\nTexas' Christian right has, through its political activism, helped give credence to what most of the world considers illegitimate: Israeli settlements in the Palestinian West Bank and East Jerusalem. The Israeli military wrested control of those areas in 1967, and as the settlements have expanded over the past 52 years, the rights of the native Palestinians have eroded.\n\nIn March 2017, Miller, a conservative Christian who believes God gave Jews the land of Israel, made a trade trip to Israel to explore export opportunities for Texas agriculture companies and to meet with Israeli companies looking to invest in Texas.\n\nBy the end of Miller's trip, the agriculture commissioner had signed a one-of-a-kind trade agreement with the Shomron Regional Council, which provides municipal services to 35 Jewish-only settlements in the northern occupied West Bank. Settlements in what Israelis call the Shomron region are part of the ever-growing infrastructure for Israeli settlers whose presence has sliced through the Palestinian West Bank, cutting off towns from one another and killing the dream of an independent Palestinian state.\n\nRead our complete coverage Israel's War on Gaza\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\n\"I wanted them to know that the Department of Agriculture and Sid Miller stand in solidarity with them, recognizing Israel as a country, as a sovereign nation, a sovereign people, and push back on the BDS movement, which is absolutely terrible,\" Miller told The Intercept, referring to boycott, divestment, and sanctions, or the social movement trying to enact an economic price on Israel over its human rights abuses against Palestinians. \"What we did over there is now being mirrored by Trump and his peace plan for that part of the region. So we were kind of the leading edge of it.\"\n\nNow, Miller, who says he remains in contact with Trump, says he thinks the White House will follow his lead and recognize Israeli settlements, which would mark a sharp break from decades of U.S. policy that held that settlements are an obstacle to Palestinian statehood.\n\nMiller's approach aligns with the Christian right's backing of Israel's settlement project. U.S. Christian nonprofits have sent tens of millions of dollars to Israeli settlements over the past decade, and hundreds of evangelicals go to the occupied West Bank every year to volunteer in Israeli settlement farming projects . That commitment has led to a flowering of ties between Christian evangelicals, right-wing American Jewish groups that also back Israeli settlements, and Israeli settlers themselves.\n\n\"They're working openly, and have been for years, to argue there is no distinction between Israel and settlements, that all the land was given to them by God, and that making a distinction between settlements and Israel is anti-Semitic,\" said Lara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, a liberal think tank whose work focuses on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nA new housing project in the West Bank settlement of Naale on Jan. 1, 2019.\n\nThe power of the Christian right-Jewish alliance in Texas was put on full display two months after Miller's jaunt to West Bank settlements. In May 2017, the Texas legislature passed a sweeping bill that targeted Texans heeding the call for boycott, divestment, and sanctions of Israel because of its human rights abuses. Influential groups like Christians United for Israel, founded by John Hagee, a San Antonio preacher whose megachurch boasts 17,000 members, and the Texas Eagle Forum, another Christian right group, mobilized to support the legislation. Jewish and pro-Israel organizations like StandWithUs and the American Jewish Committee also lobbied for the bill.\n\n\"It was just natural. ... I'm very good friends with many people in the House and Senate in Texas,\" said Mike Isley, a supporter of the anti-BDS bill and the founder and president of Texans for Israel, an evangelical group that takes Christians to Israel. \"Four Price and John Smithee are two of my state reps in the counties I'm part of. So, of course I went to them, and both of them are wonderful, they're both lovers of Israel. So they were very supportive.\"\n\nHouse Bill 89, the anti-BDS law, prohibited the state from doing business with any companies or individual contractors who boycott Israel.\n\nThe bill was so popular that not a single member in the Texas House voted against it. In the Senate, it passed with overwhelming support from both parties, with only one Republican and four Democrats voting against it. Similar bills targeting boycotts for Palestinian rights have passed in 27 other states and are currently pending in others. (ALEC is one of the groups that has lobbied aggressively for these measures around the country.)\n\nIn an email to The Intercept, state Sen. Jose Rodriguez, a Democrat from El Paso who was one of the few to oppose HB 89, said the bill \"aim[s] to silence political expression, and do so at a financial cost that also erodes First Amendment rights. If a company can do the highest quality job at the lowest cost to the state, and we refuse to hire that company, Texas taxpayers pay more.\"\n\nBut for Abbott, the Texas governor, the bill was a political winner that pleased a key part of the Republican base that put him in power and major campaign donors to his campaign and the GOP in Texas.\n\nAt the signing ceremony for the bill held at the Jewish Community Center in Austin, Abbott was surrounded by pro-Israel advocates his staff had invited like Jerry Greenspan, the southwest regional political director of the American Israel Political Affairs Committee, or AIPAC; Sandra Hagee Parker, daughter of the San Antonio preacher John Hagee; and Shulkin, the Texas doctor who helped pay for the ALEC delegation to Israel.\n\nOthers who came to the signing ceremony included Zev Shulkin's father Allan Shulkin, a physician involved in pro-Israel advocacy who donated $2,500 to Abbott's campaign in 2014 and again in 2018, as well as $1,500 to Phil King, the Texas representative who co-authored the anti-boycott bill; Michael Dell, an Israel backer and the CEO of Dell Technologies, who has given $20,000 to Abbott's campaigns since 2004 and gave another $50,000 to the Republican Party of Texas in 2006; and Aryeh Natan Lightstone, a senior adviser to U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman. (Lightstone is a business partner of Phil King's and, in his previous role as head of pro-Israel group Shining City, lobbied for the Texas anti-BDS bill, according to ProPublica .) Paul Singer, the New York hedge fund CEO and bankroller of neoconservative causes who gave $275,000 to the GOP in Texas in 2008, was invited but could not attend the signing ceremony.\n\nAfter the bill's passage, state contracts added a clause that required contractors to pledge to abstain from boycotting Israel. The measure also required the Texas comptroller's office to compile a blacklist of companies supporting the boycott of Israel. In April, Texas divested $72 million of stock from DNB ASA, a financial services group that put a handful of Israeli companies on a list of companies it wouldn't invest in because of involvement in human rights violations.\n\nIn March of this year, the office added vacation rental website Airbnb to the blacklist after the company decided to remove listings from illegal Israeli settlers, who were profiting from land taken from Palestinians.\n\nThe decision to blacklist Airbnb had immediate impact. The University of Texas said no employee could use state funds to rent on Airbnb. Abbott similarly ordered that no public worker use Airbnb. Then, in April, Airbnb reversed the decision to remove its listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, and in May was taken off the Texas comptroller's list.\n\n\"The decision to stand up for human rights should have been applauded by state lawmakers,\" said Meera Shah, a senior staff attorney at Palestine Legal, a group that defends the speech rights of Palestinian rights advocates. \"Instead, they elected to punish the company and force its hand and force it to walk back that decision.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and the Council on American-Islamic Relations filed a lawsuit challenging the law in 2018. Their plaintiffs included Obi Dennar, a former University of Texas at Austin student who was asked to sign a no-boycott pledge as part of his work moderating high school debates; George Hale, the host of the popular crime podcast \"Buried,\" who was forced to sign the clause or forgo working on the show; and Bahia Amawi , a Palestinian American children's speech pathologist who was forced to end nine years of work in public schools when she refused to sign the pledge.\n\n\"I had to choose between continuing to express my support for Palestinian rights and the commitments I had made to sources as a journalist,\" said Hale, who ended up signing the contract but made a clear note of his disagreement in the margins.\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

Two weeks after the judge's decision, Abbott signed House Bill 793, a law amending the original bill to exclude individual contractors and narrow the law's focus to companies with state contracts over $100,000.\n\nCivil liberties experts say this law remains unconstitutional, though it may pave the way for Texas to get the current ACLU and CAIR lawsuit against the original bill dismissed because the amended law no longer applies to the plaintiffs. The Texas attorney general's office said it plans to defend the law on appeal.\n\nThe Texas anti-boycott law may eventually be thrown to the wayside as a result of legal challenges. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will retain a memento to remind him of the state's unwavering support for his government: A year after HB 89 was signed into law, state Sen. Brandon Creighton, who authored the Senate version of the bill, delivered the pen Abbott used to sign the anti-boycott law to Netanyahu.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Could Ted Cruz Lose?\n\nSerena Lin October 8, 2024\n\nMother Jones illustration; Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nMother Jones illustration; Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nThe suburbs of North Dallas were once the headquarters of a very particular pre-MAGA version of the Republican Party: genteel, gun-toting, and churchgoing. The men wore beaver-fur cowboy hats, and the women were hairsprayed to the high heavens. As we reported in 2011, the 75205 zip code-some of which falls into the 32nd Congressional District of Texas-was the \"most enthusiastically Republican enclave in the country.\" But then, changing racial demographics made the district ripe for Democratic picking. In 2018, a 35-year-old Black civil rights lawyer named Colin Allred ousted Pete Sessions, an 11-term Republican congressman. Allred, a stocky former NFL linebacker, has been reelected to the seat twice since, campaigning on his moderate sensibilities and willingness to reach across the aisle.\n\nNow, Allred is running that same play against US Sen. Ted Cruz, a hard-line Republican, in an ever-tightening race. At the Texas Tribune Festival in September, Allred seemed to be nostalgic for that fading Republican archetype who once populated the district he now represents. He described growing up with the \"real conservatives,\" whom Cruz, he said emphatically, is not. Allred paints Cruz as a divisive extremist and has been courting Republicans who \"don't see themselves reflected in this version of the Republican Party.\"\n\nAnd that strategy seems to be working-last week, the Cook Political Report shifted the race to \"lean Republican.\" Most polls show Allred within single digits of Cruz, and one has Allred leading by one point. With Democrats defending incumbents in Ohio and Montana, flipping Texas could make the difference in maintaining their governing majority in the Senate. After some Democrats pushed the party to invest more in Allred's campaign, both the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and Democratic National Committee announced investments in Texas.\n\nBut Texas Democrats have not won a statewide election since 1994. The closest they have come was former El Paso Rep. Beto O'Rourke's freewheeling 2018 campaign against Cruz. O'Rourke famously campaigned in all 254 counties , crisscrossing the state in his maroon Dodge Caravan. He livestreamed his every move on Facebook: chatting while getting a haircut, skateboarding in a Whataburger parking lot, and going on predawn jogs with supporters. O'Rourke ultimately lost by fewer than three points-which some Democrats count as a victory-and won a place as a mythic figure in the state party. He is the ghost haunting Allred's campaign. Every dollar raised, poll conducted, and door knocked inspires comparisons to 2018's high-water mark.\n\nBy most measures, Allred is a strong candidate and has assembled quite a war chest , having outraised Cruz this year. And the junior senator from Texas certainly appears concerned about the race-Cruz's campaign has called the election the \"fight of our lives.\" And in a surprising twist, the hyperpartisan Cruz, who built his career as a culture warrior, has attempted to gain an advantage by arguing that he has a bipartisan record.\n\nAllred, who can come off as stiff and overly scripted, hasn't inspired the kind of Democratic fervor that O'Rourke enjoyed. But he has been appealing to moderate Republicans and independents who may be alienated by Cruz's MAGA approach, talking openly about Democratic failures to address the border crisis. The central question: Is running a middle-of-the-road campaign the strategy for winning a race that O'Rourke so narrowly lost?\n\nCampaigning for statewide office in Texas, which is slightly larger than France and has a population of 30 million, is comparable to running for president of some countries. Hispanics are now the largest population group in the state, and the numbers of Black and Asian residents are also growing . Texas contains four of the most populous cities in the US and some of the most expensive media markets. Allred's robust campaign coffers have made it possible for him to blanket urban centers with television ads. But a more difficult challenge is what veteran journalist and editor of the website Quorum Report Scott Braddock called the \"imagination gap\": Texans under the age of 30 have never seen a Democrat win a statewide election.\n\nThe last Democrat to do so was Bob Bullock, who was reelected as lieutenant governor in 1994, the same year that former President George W. Bush first became governor. Since then, there have been a series of high-profile losses. From the \" dream team \" of statewide candidates in 2002 to popular Houston Mayor Bill White's gubernatorial campaign in 2010, Democrats have routinely raised their hopes, only to be crushed by Republicans. In 2014, they thought they had a real shot at the governor's mansion with Wendy Davis, the state senator who rose to national prominence when her marathon filibuster delayed a restrictive abortion bill. Bolstered by Battleground Texas, a new PAC launched by two Obama campaign alums, Davis ran on a compelling biography as a single mother who wound up at Harvard Law School. But her campaign struggled to stay on message and was outraised and outspent by Greg Abbott in his first gubernatorial campaign. She lost by 20 points.\n\nIn 2018, Texas Democrats found a new standard-bearer in O'Rourke, the lanky, indefatigable 46-year-old US congressman from El Paso. He made a point of throwing out the Democratic playbook, initially pledging to go without pollsters and consultants and to refuse donations from corporations and super-PACs. O'Rourke was a kind of political Rorschach test. Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University, said, \"O'Rourke was successfully able to be everything to everyone.\" He had progressive bona fides, supporting universal health care, abortion rights, and an assault rifle ban. He capitalized on Democratic outrage around former President Donald Trump's family separation policies, leading a Father's Day protest outside a detention facility for immigrant children. But he could also be, as Jones put it, a \"post-partisan pragmatist.\" He had a centrist voting record in Congress and a long-standing friendship with Republican US Rep. Will Hurd-the two livestreamed their road trip from San Antonio to Washington, DC, in 2017. Ignored by Cruz for the first several months of the campaign, O'Rourke's shifting and sometimes contradictory narratives went largely unchallenged.\n\n\"O'Rourke was successfully able to be everything to everyone.\"\n\nWith an army of volunteers and record-breaking fundraising from both inside and outside the state, O'Rourke came tantalizingly close to defeating Cruz, losing by 2.6 points. As Gus Bova wrote in the Texas Observer , O'Rourke \"broke the mold\" in 2018, defying political gravity and reinvigorating Texas Democrats. But after disappointing showings in the 2019 Democratic presidential primary and the 2022 gubernatorial race, some have wondered whether O'Rourke's political career is over. O'Rourke now leads a voter registration PAC and recently joined second gentleman Doug Emhoff on a fundraising turn through Texas-including a stop at his beloved Whataburger .\n\nWhen it comes to the prospect of a blue Texas, one can't blame Democrats for feeling like Charlie Brown winding up to kick the football again, despite knowing that Lucy is going to yank it away every time. And it might be hard to rustle up enthusiasm for a candidate who is decidedly less compelling than O'Rourke.\n\nFor the last eight years , Democrats have harbored hopes that, eventually, Trump and his allies will become so extreme that they will alienate their own base. And for many, Cruz could be the perfect example of a Republican who should have been jettisoned by the GOP long ago. When he arrived in the Senate in 2013, fueled by the insurgent tea party, he made a name for himself as a far-right obstructionist with a penchant for showmanship. That year, his long-shot attempt to undercut the Affordable Care Act-involving a 21-hour Senate speech and a reading of \"Green Eggs and Ham\"-led to a two-week government shutdown and was harshly criticized by other Republicans. Then there was his ill-fated and embarrassing presidential primary bid in 2016, which culminated in a surprising speech at the Republican National Convention during which he urged delegates to vote their consciences and declined to endorse Trump. But Cruz walked back his condemnation of Trump when it became apparent that it would irreparably harm his political career. And, of course, there is Democrats' favorite Cruz gaffe of them all: jetting off to Cancun, Mexico, during a deadly winter storm in 2021. (He apologized upon his return.) These days, Cruz also makes time to record his thrice-weekly podcast .\n\nNonetheless, polling finds that Cruz remains popular among Texas Republicans, and he may be bolstered by Trump's appearance on the ticket. But a June poll found that only 25 percent of self-identified independents, a key voting group, approved of him. His recent attempts to rebrand as an effective legislator and unsung bipartisan hero may speak to that concern.\n\nEarly in the race, Allred's campaign was so lackluster that it inspired a great deal of grumbling from within the Texas Democratic Party. \"Where is Colin Allred?\" a prominent West Texas lawyer and Democrat asked on X in August. Allred had done few public events and made even fewer media appearances before the final night of the Democratic National Convention, when he gave a speech shortly before Vice President Kamala Harris. For most people outside Texas (and even some within it), this was likely the first time they heard that Cruz was facing a challenger. In the weeks since then, Allred's campaign has picked up its pace. But Allred has mostly opted for smaller meetings over large rallies and town halls, and his campaign has organized mostly identity-focused coalition groups-including women, Asian Americans, and Black Texans. Last week, his campaign announced \"Republicans for Allred,\" chaired by former US Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a prominent anti-Trump Republican who also endorsed Harris.\n\nThe Allred campaign declined to make the candidate available for an interview and instead suggested I speak to Olivia Julianna, a social media activist who is advising the campaign on youth voter turnout. When asked why larger rallies haven't been a focus of his campaign, she replied, \"This is a more strategic, targeted way of reaching people and bringing them in on these very issue-focused events that are about [what] they care about the most.\"\n\nAt the Texas Tribune Festival, Allred was asked about a note from O'Rourke, who said in an interview that he'd like to see more of Allred, particularly in \"unscripted\" moments. It's difficult to campaign in such a large state, Allred said, a bit defensively, and pointed out that he had made 50 stops in 22 cities in the past month.\n\nAllred's restraint is underscored by comparisons with O'Rourke, who was endlessly available to voters. Even Cruz, perhaps relieved to know that he will not have to face O'Rourke again, has spoken with some admiration about O'Rourke and noted that he and Allred are \"very different candidates.\" In August, Cruz told the Texas Tribune : \"Beto O'Rourke was charismatic. He was tireless. He campaigned all over the state, and he became a phenom.\"\n\nMatt Angle, a longtime Democratic political strategist in Texas, said Allred's more traditional, buttoned-up campaign can still be successful, as having high message discipline is usually considered to be a good thing in a candidate. \"Some people like the excitement of someone who is spontaneous, [and] there's a lot to be said about leading a pep rally,\" Angle told Mother Jones. \"But I like candidates who are trying to figure out how to win.\"\n\n\"Democrats in Texas always face this a no-win situation: The more they appeal to moderate voters, the greater the risk they run that the base doesn't turn out for them...The more they focus on the base, the more they alienate moderate voters and push them over to the Republicans. \"\n\nSome Democrats have worried that Allred is taking the base for granted and focusing too much on moderates. Even though he endorsed Harris' presidential bid, he's largely kept her and other national Democrats at arm's length. In fact, it sometimes seems as though Allred would rather voters not view him as a Democrat at all. In May, he told Texas Monthly that the race is \"not about voting for Democrats. This race is about me versus Ted Cruz specifically.\"\n\nJones, the professor from Rice University, said the best strategy, which Allred seems to be employing, is relying on Harris to mobilize progressives while he targets moderate Republicans and independents. \"Democrats in Texas always face this a no-win situation: The more they appeal to moderate voters, the greater the risk they run that the base doesn't turn out for them,\" Jones said. \"However, the more they focus on the base, the more they alienate moderate voters and push them over to the Republicans. You're damned if you do, damned if you don't.\"\n\nAllred's policies are generally consistent with those of the Democratic Party: He wants to expand Medicaid, codify Roe v. Wade , and reduce gun violence. But he has attempted to distance himself when it comes to immigration and border security, which have become the centerpieces of his campaign. A June poll found that 47 percent of Texans strongly disapproved of President Joe Biden's approach to immigration and border security. Immigration has become a weak point for Democrats at large, as border crossings have risen to record levels and strained federal and local resources. To combat accusations of being weak on the border, Democrats have begun to support some immigration policies that they opposed under Trump, and, as many have pointed out, are sometimes indistinguishable from Republicans in their rhetoric of being \"tough\" on the border.\n\nAllred is not an exception, and he has been willing to go further than other members of his party. In January, he voted alongside two other Texas Democrats in support of a Republican-led congressional resolution that condemned Biden's border policies. On the campaign trail, he often cites his family connection to the Rio Grande Valley-his maternal grandfather was a customs agent at the Gateway International Bridge in Brownsville-and he's said current immigration policies have placed an undue \"burden\" on border communities.\n\nBut Allred's rhetoric on border security was not always so tough. In 2018, when he was running for the House of Representatives, he called Trump's border wall \"racist\" and pledged to tear it down. Yet last October, he commended Biden's decision to continue border wall construction, describing it as a \"necessary step.\" In a recent TV spot reminiscent of a Ford F-150 ad, Allred emerges from a white pickup truck to survey the border wall. The law enforcement officials accompanying him declare that Cruz has been \"all hat, no cattle\" on border security, while Allred has been \"tough\" and \"[stood] up to extremists in both parties.\"\n\nAllred's campaign declined to respond to specific questions from Mother Jones on border security. His campaign website says he supports \"common-sense\" immigration measures and pathways to citizenship for those who are \"obeying the law, working hard, [and] paying taxes.\"\n\nI asked Joaquin Castro, the Democratic congressman from San Antonio, about Allred's position on the border. He said his congressional colleague is trying to strike a \"reasonable balance,\" disagreeing \"with the dehumanization of people\" while pushing for more funding for border security.\n\nEarlier this year, a bipartisan border security bill failed to pass because of pressure from Trump. Described by Biden as the \"strongest border deal the country has ever seen,\" the measure was the result of negotiations with some of the most conservative members of Congress, including Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford. It would have increased funding for enforcement, restricted asylum applications, and expanded the government's authority to deport migrants. The bill's failure presented a unique opportunity for Democrats to turn the border blame game back on Republicans. Allred has campaigned widely on Cruz's opposition to the deal, saying Cruz voted against it only because, like the former president, \"he wanted to have the issue to run on in November.\"\n\nA persistent Democratic mantra is that Texas is not so much a red state as a non-voting blue one. In 2020, Manny Garcia, who was then the state Democratic Party's executive director, told Reuters , \"Texas is in play because there are more of us than there are of them.\" But organizers emphasize that electoral transformation takes time and investment. Michelle Tremillo, co-executive director of the Texas Organizing Project, said her group focuses on engaging Black and Latino first-time voters and \"building that cycle of participation is long-term work.\" Democrats already have made progress in county and district elections-such as with Lina Hidalgo, a 27-year-old Colombian immigrant who defeated a popular Republican incumbent to lead the Harris County Commissioners Court in 2018. \"With each election cycle, we are chipping away at a statewide gap,\" Tremillo said.\n\nSuch voter mobilization efforts are relatively new in Texas, particularly on the statewide level. A decade or so ago, political infrastructure for Democrats in Texas was like \"actual infrastructure in Afghanistan,\" said Braddock, the journalist. There were Democrats concentrated in large urban counties, but there was \"nothing to connect them,\" he said. State-level campaigns were largely left to do everything on their own: fundraising, coordinating events, and organizing volunteers for phone banks and door-knocking. Angle, the political strategist, told Mother Jones that back then, \"the resources to expand and coordinate to win a statewide race weren't available.\"\n\nThe 2018 O'Rourke campaign showed Democrats that a statewide grassroots effort was both possible and effective. There are now more progressive voter groups in Texas-some run by O'Rourke campaign alums. Katherine Fischer, who worked on O'Rourke's Senate campaign and now runs Texas Majority PAC, said, \"There's now a much stronger network performing organizing work, which lessens the campaign's burden.\"\n\n\"Success this year is not measured by who wins. It's measured by watching how much closer they get.\"\n\nThis past summer, Texas Democrats announced that Allred's campaign would bundle its efforts with downballot Democratic candidates, coordinating volunteers and sharing data. Called the \"Texas Offense,\" the campaign described it as the \"first statewide coordinated grassroots effort in 20 years.\" A recent press release reported that the coalition had logged 600 events and 3,000 volunteer shifts.\n\nDemocrats like to call Texas a \"game-over\" state-if they secure its 40 Electoral College votes, Republicans will find it very difficult to win the presidency. Although Jimmy Carter was the last Democratic presidential candidate to win in Texas in 1976, Democrats are quick to point out that the margins have progressively narrowed in the last decade. In 2012, Barack Obama lost Texas by 15.8 points. Hillary Clinton lost by nine, and Biden lost by 5.6. This year, Democrats are simply hoping to move the needle closer in the presidential race. \"Success this year is not measured by who wins. It's measured by watching how much closer they get,\" said Tory Gavito, president of Way to Win, a Democratic advocacy group.\n\nHowever much Democrats may hope for an Allred victory, not many are expecting one. After 30 years of being proven wrong, Democrats are tempering their optimism-and their low expectations might prove to be a real liability for Allred. On a recent episode of the Bulwark Podcast , O'Rourke told journalist Tim Miller that politics is a \"confidence game.\"\n\n\"Can [Allred] generate enough excitement to convince people that he can win?\" O'Rourke asked. \"If people believe this is possible, then they'll act like it's possible.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "How Ken Paxton Built the Foundation for the New Big Lie\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton Mother Jones illustration; Drew Angerer/Getty\n\nIt started, according to court filings , with a tweet. On August 18, Maria Bartiromo, the Fox News Host, alerted her 1.4 million followers on X to a development that might not, at first glance, seem like news: She was hearing troubling reports of lines at the DMV. The information had come to Bartiromo fourth-hand. The wife of a friend of a friend had recently taken her 16-year-old to three different offices to get a driver's license, which in Texas is administered by the Department of Public Safety. At the first two, she encountered \"a massive line of immigrants getting licenses\" inside, and \"a tent and table outside...registering them to vote.\" The post blew up on X, where it has been viewed 2.3 million times.\n\nThere was plenty of reason to be cautious about this particular game of telephone. A local Republican Party chair investigated Bartiromo's source's source's wife's claims himself and found no evidence they were true. A local election administrator also found the allegations unfounded. Nothing described in the tweet, on its face, was even illegal. But fears of renegade registrars would not die. The next day, an investigator working for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton arrived at a DPS facility outside San Antonio for an undercover operation. \"I was notified that voter registration was possibly occurring in or about the area surrounding the driver's license office,\" the officer wrote in his formal report.\n\nAs a test, the investigator asked the young man registering voters-a volunteer deputy registrar with a non-profit called Jolt, which promotes civic engagement among Latinos in the state-if he could bring a form home to his daughter. (He made positive identification of \"cards I have encountered multiple times in the execution of my duties,\" the investigator confirmed, sounding as if he had just unearthed a stash of fentanyl, \"which I recognize to be voter registration cards.\") The registrar said he could not-Texas has strict rules about handling such applications. Instead, he suggested that the investigator fill out a form on her behalf. The officer declined and walked away. The registrar's advice, he concluded, was \"not only incorrect, but illegal\"\n\nThis, Jolt would later argue in a lawsuit in federal court, was also wrong. The undercover agent could have registered his daughter on the spot, as long as she was eligible and he had her permission-both of which he would have been assenting to under penalty of perjury. It was all right there in the county's training video. But the attorney general's office was undeterred. Two days later, Paxton announced that there was an open investigation into possible unlawful efforts to register non-citizens to vote. And on August 30, after Jolt protested that Paxton was interfering with their work, he sent the group a formal request to open up its books or face the consequences. In court filings, the agency would later credit the initial tip to reporting from an \"award-winning journalist.\"\n\nMAGA leaders charged that NGOs, backed by shadowy left-wing funders, were facilitating the mass migration to help the Democratic Party win elections. Evidence of such a conspiracy has been lacking. Creating the illusion of such evidence has fallen to men like Paxton.\n\nThe Jolt investigation fit a years-long pattern. Four years ago, citing massive fraud but no evidence, Paxton carried water for Trump's Big Lie by filing a lawsuit asking the Supreme Court to strip four states Joe Biden won of their electors, so that Republican legislatures could appoint them instead. Now, the state's top law enforcement official has used the powers of his office to spin a new election conspiracy. Wielding dubious tweets and flimsy pretexts, he has used the myth of large numbers of non-citizens voting to intimidate aid groups on the border, interfere with voter-registration efforts, and purge real citizens from the rolls. For a man who has spent much of his nine years in office under a cloud of personal and professional scandal, his headline-seeking ploy has offered a chance at redemption-and perhaps even an inside track at a promotion.\n\nPaxton and other Texas Republicans have long sought to use fears of election malfeasance to their advantage. His predecessor as attorney general, the current Gov. Greg Abbott, once led an investigation into alleged voter fraud that involved spying on a woman i n her own bathroom . In the runup to the 2020 election, the Houston Chronicle reported, Paxton's office spent 22,000 hours to root out fraud that Trump and his allies claimed was rampant, but only produced 16 prosecutions , none of which resulted in jail time. But you could trace the start of Paxton's current crusade to the spring of 2022, when Paxton was locked in a bitter runoff primary and still managing fallout from his efforts to overturn the election.\n\nOn May 6 of that year, the State Bar of Texas sued Paxton's top deputy over his role in the Electoral College case, charging that he had violated ethics rules by participating in a knowingly frivolous lawsuit. (The bar would eventually sue Paxton too; both cases are still ongoing .) A few hours later, Paxton shot back with major news of his own: He was investigating the bar's charitable foundation, for \"possibly aiding and abetting the mass influx of illegal aliens.\"\n\nThe announcement was part of a pattern-a complaint from a prominent conservative served as a pretext for Paxton to go after his perceived opposition. In this case, the AG's office said it was acting off a complaint from Republican Rep. Troy Nehls, a former sheriff of Fort Bend County in the Houston suburbs who voted to overturn the 2020 election results. The issue was that the nonprofit had donated to legal-aid organizations that work with immigrants-which, in the AG's phrasing, meant that it was possibly \"providing grants to organizations that support, fund and encourage illegal immigration.\" That investigation was followed by an announcement of more probes, targeting three immigrant-rights nonprofits that the bar foundation had supported, again alleging that their work was possibly \"aiding and abetting the invasion of illegal aliens.\"\n\nPaxton's go-to weapon in those investigations was a consumer-protection tool called a Request to Examine, which allows the office-with limitations-to gain access to the books of corporations and nonprofits in the state. In February, his office sent an investigator to surveil Annunciation House, a 50-year-old Catholic shelter network in El Paso that offers food, clothes, and educational services to migrants, and then hand-delivered a request to examine its records, demanding it comply within 24 hours. After the organization asked for more time and clarification as to what it was actually obligated to produce, Paxton filed a lawsuit to try to shut the group down. His office argued that by providing aid services, the organization was operating a \"stash house\" and engaging in \"human smuggling.\"\n\nIt is not actually a great mystery why Catholics devote themselves to assisting those who need help. But Paxton's legal campaign tapped into a conspiracy that has become almost an article of faith on the right, spread by figures such as Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and JD Vance . The Biden administration hadn't just mismanaged the border-security apparatus. These MAGA leaders charged that NGOs, backed by shadowy left-wing funders, were facilitating the mass migration of people to the United States to help the Democratic Party win elections through some combination of massive fraud and demographic shifts. It is a plot to steal not just one election, Musk has argued, but every future election -because once this imagined conspiracy goes into effect, Democrats will be unstoppable. Evidence of such a conspiracy has been lacking. Creating the illusion of such evidence has fallen to men like Paxton.\n\nThe new election lie began on the border and expanded outward from there. In April, two brothers from Long Island, operating under the moniker of American Muckrakers, posted a photo of a flier they claimed to have found inside an outhouse in Matamoros, reminding migrants in the Mexican border city to vote for Joe Biden. The flier, which bore the name of a local migrant aid NGO, appeared to have been translated into Spanish via an app and featured an outdated phone number, according to the New York Times . The NGO called it a hoax. But the story traveled fast. After the Heritage Foundation's Project Oversight posted it, the story was picked up by Musk and Fox News. The flier was flown to Washington, where Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-Ga.) wielded it during the impeachment proceedings against Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. And within a few days, Paxton-citing the evidence of right-wing social media influencers-began investigating three more migrant aid organizations, one of which was operated in El Paso, and two in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nFor Paxton, these kinds of announcements were all in a day's work. But to the groups that find themselves on the receiving end, they've invited threats and harassment, and added new obstacles to fulfilling their mission. In a statement that she said she had been cleared by her lawyers, Andrea Rudnik, director of Team Brownsville, one of the nonprofits Paxton has sought records from, said that the campaign had \"made it more difficult to do our work, advocate for our clients, and freely express ourselves. It has also instilled a greater sense of fear in us that people in need won't be able to get basic assistance.\" The investigation, she said, was not just \"an abuse of power,\" but \"it shows a lack of empathy.\" She worried about who would do the work should they close.\n\n\"He's gone after a lot of these organizations that are very, very small, and he's using it for nefarious purposes to sow distrust in our electoral system by pushing a lie in order to create distrust in our elections.\"\n\nThe courts have mostly rejected Paxton's efforts. A judge blocked Paxton's attempts to depose Rudnick in August. In El Paso, he received a more stinging rebuke. A federal judge threw out his subpoena of Annunciation House and accused the AG of merely seeking \"a pretext to justify its harassment of Annunciation House employees and the persons seeking refuge.\" Paxton's behavior, he said, was \"outrageous and intolerable.\"\n\nPaxton was embarking on a cynical \"fishing expedition,\" says Rochelle Garza, president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, which is representing Team Brownsville and Las Americas, another border group that has been targeted by the AG. (She was also Paxton's 2022 Democratic opponent .)\n\n\"He's gone after a lot of these organizations that are very, very small, and he's using it for nefarious purposes to sow distrust in our electoral system by pushing a lie in order to create distrust in our elections.\"\n\nPaxton has not exactly run away from that assertion. \"The reality is, the plan from the beginning [was to] get these people here as fast as possible and get them voting,\" he said in a June interview with-who else?-Maria Bartiromo. It was the only thing that would make Democrats competitive this fall: \"This is the biggest threat to our democracy, our republic, that I think we've seen since who knows when.\"\n\nIf targeting Catholics and retired teachers prepping meals on the border was the foundation of Paxton's new election conspiracy, the next logical step was to target groups, like Jolt, that actively register voters in the state's larger metro areas-again, under the pretense that they were enabling illegal non-citizen voting. The AG's case has been sloppy. Paxton's attorneys asserted in court, for instance, that they launched their investigation in response not just to Bartiromo's Ferris Bueller tweet , but also a viral video posted on X by a self-described \"Alpha MAGA Male,\" who filmed himself asking a Jolt registrar if \"illegal aliens\" could vote. That's not just flimsy, but also impossible-the video was posted after the AG's office dispatched its investigator to Universal City.\n\n\"As best I can tell,\" says Mimi Marziani, an adjunct professor at the University of Texas and prominent civil rights litigator who is representing Jolt in the case, \"he is abusing the power of his office to do something that is promoting his own interest, and his allegiance to former President Trump.\"\n\nIt wasn't just Jolt. Paxton has gone after a wide swath of groups that organize Latino communities in the state. In August, he filed a lawsuit to shut down a Houston-based non-profit called Familias Inmigrantes y Estudiantes en la Lucha, or FIEL, ostensibly on the grounds that the group had violated rules on political speech by nonprofits by criticizing Abbott and Trump, as well as a new state law empowering law enforcement to arrest people they suspect of having entered the country illegally. That same month, his office initiated a series of early-morning raids that his office said was in response to allegations of vote-harvesting by a local political operative.\n\nAs part of that investigation, armed law enforcement agents showed up at the homes of elderly members of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), a century-old civil rights organization that runs voter registration drives and had filed a lawsuit against SB1 , a restrictive new voting statute Abbott signed into law in 2021. Among the people whose home was raided was Cecilia Castellano, a Democratic candidate for state representative in an open South Texas seat that Republicans are trying to flip. According to the Texas Tribune , the raid stemmed from an investigation that began in 2022. Castellano has not been charged with any crime, nor has anyone else.\n\nLater that summer, Paxton's office went to court to stop three of the state's biggest counties-Bexar (San Antonio), Travis (Austin), and Harris (Houston)-from using their offices to run voter-registration drives. They had approved plans, or (in the case of Harris were considering proposals), to send voter registration forms and other information to voting-age citizens the county had deemed eligible. Filling out a form was only the first part of the process. A county office would then have to verify the information. Then the Texas secretary of state's office-part of Gov. Greg Abbott's administration-would have to verify it too. Nonetheless, Paxton tried to stop them, arguing that informing people of their constitutional rights in such a manner could lead to fraudulent registrations from non-citizens.\n\n\"As best I can tell, he is abusing the power of his office to do something that is promoting his own interest, and his allegiance to former President Trump.\"\n\n\"[A]s you are aware, the Biden-Harris administration's open border policies have saddled Texas-and the entire country-with a wave of illegal immigration that has resulted in ballooning noncitizen populations across our State,\" Paxton wrote in a September letter to Bexar County officials. \"It is more important than ever that we maintain the integrity of our voter rolls and ensure only eligible voters decide our elections.\"\n\nBut the capstone to Texas Republicans' big push-and Paxton's years-long campaign to argue that immigrants, with the help of sinister left-wing forces, were poised to spoil the election through massive fraud-was the voter rolls themselves. Here he was tapping into an infamous tradition. In 2019, the Abbott-appointed secretary of state David Whitley resigned after an attempted voter purge incorrectly flagged at least 25,000 eligible voters as potential non-citizens. This summer, the governor announced that the state had found 6,500 non-citizen voters on the rolls and was referring 2,000 people to Paxton's office for prosecution for having voted as non-citizens. A subsequent investigation by the Texas Tribune and Pro Publica found that the actual number of people identified by the secretary of state was 581-not 6,500-and that at least some of the people on the list had documents proving their citizenship.\n\nPaxton aimed a bit higher. In September, he sent the federal government a list of 450,000 voters who did not include a Texas driver's license number on their voter registration forms, and asked Washington to cross-reference this list with immigration databases.\n\n\"This list is essentially anyone who doesn't have their driver's license number memorized or doesn't have an ID-which we know is disproportionately people of color-but there's no indication that people are non-citizens or that they have improperly registered to vote,\" says Ashley Harris, a staff atttorney with the ACLU of Texas, whose group urged the federal government not to comply with Paxton's request. \"It's just people that register with their Social Security number, or, in some cases, older voters who have been registered to vote for so long that it predates the federal requirements.\"\n\nThe immigration check would have opened up still more problems-for instance, that it might flag people who have been naturalized as citizens. And anyone caught up in this purge would have to \"jump through extra hoops to preserve their voter registration\" with just days or weeks left before the deadline. Ultimately, the Biden administration declined to cooperate, but Paxton still got what he wanted: He has cited the standoff as evidence that Democrats are willfully enabling massive fraud \"by enabling non-citizens to illegally vote.\"\n\nIn waging legal battle after legal battle with small nonprofits and community groups, and spreading fears about a stolen election that hasn't yet transpired, Paxton is helping not just his party but also himself. Paxton's subservience to Trump in the aftermath of the 2020 election may have got him in trouble with the state bar, but it might have also saved his job, as he survived a bitter primary and then an impeachment trial in successive years. Now, his willingness to do the bidding of Trump and his allies has earned him a possible seat at the table in a future Republican presidential administration. Trump said in May that he'd even consider Paxton to be his next attorney attorney general.\n\nIn the campaign's final days, Paxton has remained at the beck and call of conservative activists. Last week, after the Department of Justice ordered Musk to halt his $1 million daily lottery for Trump-supporting registered voters in swing states, the attorney general shot back.\n\nHe was filing a Freedom of Information Act Request, he announced , to \"investigate the federal agency's intimidation\" of the world's richest man, by \"selectively targeting Elon Musk's voter registration drive.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "What Ted Cruz Really Means When He Says \"Keep Texas, Texas\"\n\nTom Williams/CQ Roll Call/Zuma\n\nAt the end of every event on Ted Cruz's 53-stop campaign swing through Texas, the state's junior senator invites supporters to line up and sign his bus. People scrawl their names and their hometowns. Someone wrote \"End Human Trafficking\" behind the driver's side mirror. A lot of people write Bible verses; Psalm 91-\"No weapon forged against me shall prosper\"-is a popular one. People have plugged a plumbing company, a YouTube channel, and even Cruz's own podcast. A \"Free Palestine\" message has been crossed out. A \"Zodiac 2024\" message has not.\n\nThe campaign's slogan, emblazoned in big letters on the front, is \"Keep Texas, Texas.\" But as Cruz attempts to fend off Democratic Rep. Colin Allred in one of the year's tightest US Senate races , one simple message written in gold marker on the door captured the essence of his path to victory: \"CA Refugee 4 Ted!!\"\n\nThis is the great irony of the embattled Republican's reelection bid: For a party that complains about Democrats \"importing\" voters from across the border, it is Texas Republicans who are relying on migration to remain in power. The people he is seeking to protect Texas from, according to the data, are Texas-born residents (who backed his 2018 opponent, Beto O'Rourke). The people he is hoping will save him are, in no small part, transplants. The result is that the politics that Cruz pitches on the campaign trail is less about addressing the lived reality of Texas-a high-tax and low-services state with poor public health outcomes and a fragile power grid-than about preserving the image it projects to the world. It is a contest, in a sense, between Texas and TexasTM.\n\nIn the backyard of a brewery in the Hill Country town of Boerne on Saturday night, this sense of an imperiled legacy was palpable. It was not just the de rigueur \"Don't California My Texas\" T-shirts-I kept running into voters who had moved to the state in recent years, attracted by the particular brand of freedom that people like Cruz espouse. Cheryl Grosso moved from Washington state three years ago during the pandemic. \"My biggest thing is child sex trafficking,\" she said. I met a former Democrat who had supported Tulsi Gabbard in the 2020 presidential primary before fleeing California and its Covid-19 restrictions. \"The left went crazy,\" she said, \"thinking men can be women\" and \"shutting down businesses.\" I asked her if she'd consider voting for a Democrat again.\n\n\"I left that behind,\" she said. \"I shed it like an old skin.\"\n\nCruz's remarks were a constant reminder of this TexasTM that was under attack. \"How many of you all drove a truck here tonight?\" he asked. A mass of hands went up. \"This is Texas,\" he said. But Democrats' electric-vehicle mandates would threaten that frontier way of life. \"Who the hell is Kamala Harris and Colin Allred to tell you what kind of car or truck you buy for your family?\"\n\n\"If there were a vacancy on the city council in San Francisco Colin Allred would be one heck of a candidate-he'd be tough to beat,\" Cruz said, \"But thank God this is Texas!\"\n\nA supporter shouted that Allred should be given a one-way ticket to California.\n\n\"How about we just put him on a jackass, head it north and slap its ass?\" Cruz said.\n\nWho was this man, and why did he sound like he was in Blazing Saddles ?\n\n\"This is a battle between sane and crazy. These people are nuts. Tim Walz waves like this ,\" Cruz said at another point, opening and closing his hand somewhat like a bird, in what I took to suggest an effeminate manner. \"What the hell is that? You do that in Texas, you'll get your ass kicked.\"\n\nI don't think it's true that Texans will kick your ass if you wave at them like that, although I'm pretty sure I know who I'd call nuts if they did. But that we don't do that kind of thing around here is Cruz's message in a nutshell. Much of his rhetoric onstage-like the message on the accompanying campaign literature, and the message in tens of millions of dollars in campaign ads-was that Allred holds outsider values that make him a threat to their idea of Texas. In particular, he is a threat to Texas women and girls.\n\n\"He has voted repeatedly in favor of boys competing in girls' sports,\" Cruz said, \"in favor of men competing in women's sports...Colin Allred has voted not only in favor of boys' and girls' sports, but he's voted in favor of boys in girls' bathrooms, boys in girls' locker rooms, boys in girls' changing rooms.\"\n\nAllred and Kamala Harris \"are both open border radicals who are both desperately trying to cover up their record and lie to the voters,\" he said a little while later. What was the difference? \"Well, you might say he's a man, she's a woman. But do we know how he identifies ?\"\n\nIt is hard to overstate just how much of Cruz's attempt to win a Senate race in the world's eighth-largest economy is about the prospect of transgender students competing in high school sports. He talked about it a ton. Appended to the anti-trans panic was a countervailing vision of masculinity, TexasTM style.\n\n\"Did anyone happen to see Trump's speech at the Al Smith dinner?\" Cruz asked. \"I have to say my favorite line of it was he said, 'Have you guys seen this White Dudes for Kamala?' And he said, 'You know, I'm not really worried, because all their wives and all their wives' lovers, are voting for me.'\"\n\n\"Bring back alpha males!\" a woman behind me shouted.\n\nThis riff on cuckolded men was a sort of strange reference coming from Cruz, a guy who has devoted his recent life to the man who smeared his own wife. And amid all this bravado were obvious signs of weakness. The premise of \"Keep Texas, Texas,\" after all is that it's possible you might not. Historically, this sort of existential crisis seems to correlate most strongly with Cruz appearing on the ballot. He won reelection by less than 3 points in 2018, the same year Gov. Greg Abbott was reelected by 13. While some recent polls have shown Cruz and Allred within the margin of error, no one expects Donald Trump's final margin to be so close. Cruz is still a good bet to win-perhaps especially because Trump is a good bet to win by a wider margin-but he has become a high-floor, low-ceiling kind of guy; there is only so much juice you can really have as the guy who saved bathrooms.\n\nThe surest sign that Cruz still has real work in the final weeks of the race to do was the fact that he spent a fair bit of time talking about the work he actually does. Cruz, who has sought to depict himself during the campaign as a bipartisan leader in Washington, spoke at length about his efforts to deliver a nonstop flight between Washington, DC, and San Antonio. He'd worked hand in hand with leaders from heavily Democratic Bexar County. He'd even worked with Pete Buttigieg! It was the sort of deal that the bacon-delivering legislators of Texas' past-your LBJs, your Jims Wright-used to wrangle before breakfast. Cruz spoke of it like he'd just acquired Louisiana.\n\nIf the direct flights don't save him, the unceasing attack on Allred's stance on trans rights still might. The spots have hit hard enough that Allred recently responded with a direct-to-camera ad stating that he did not support \"boys in girls sports.\" It was one of the first things people would bring up when I asked about Allred. And it elicited some of the harshest reactions from the crowd during Cruz's remarks.\n\nAs I waited for the event to begin, I met a voter named Erica Herbert, who was holding a \"Women for Cruz\" sign. She acknowledged that she had reservations about the Republican candidate. Herbert supported abortion rights and was worried about the state's hard-right drift-fitting the profile of the kind of person Democrats are banking on to flip the seat. But after watching Cruz's recent debate with Allred, Herbert considered Cruz \"the lesser of two evils.\" She wasn't sure exactly what exactly to believe, but the high school sports issue settled the matter; she wasn't going to vote for a candidate who could do such a thing. Cruz can be a difficult politician to love, but he is never more adept than when he's telling voters what they have to lose.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Texas Republicans Pass Voting Restrictions to Solidify Anti-Democratic Hold on Power\n\nTexas House Speaker Dade Phelan opens the special session called by Gov. Greg Abbott on July 8 in Austin. Eric Gay/AP\n\nIt has long been assumed that as America heads toward a future in which people of color constitute a majority of the population , it will grow increasingly difficult for the Republican Party to win elections by appealing to a shrinking base of conservative white voters.\n\nTexas should be a case study for that theory: It became a majority-minority state in 2004, and over the past decade, 95 percent of its booming growth came from people of color, as it gained 11 Hispanic residents for every new white resident. But as the state becomes more diverse, the Republican Party is becoming more reactionary, cementing its hold on power by doubling down on anti-democratic tactics.\n\nThat's why Republicans have been so committed to passing some of the nation's toughest voting restrictions , which finally cleared the legislature on Tuesday after Gov. Greg Abbott called two special legislative sessions to outlast numerous Democratic attempts to kill the bill-including a 38-day walkout by Texas Democrats who decamped to Washington to lobby for federal voting rights legislation .\n\nRepublicans' clear goal is to prevent the state's changing demographics from leading to a shift in political power for as long as possible. The GOP doesn't need to have the support of a majority of the state's population if it skews the composition of the electorate to win a majority of votes. As the state becomes younger, more diverse, and more Democratic, power remains concentrated in the hands of politicians who represent constituencies that are whiter, older, more rural, and more conservative than the state as a whole.\n\nThough Donald Trump did better than expected among Latinos in 2020, particularly in South Texas, he still carried the state by winning two-thirds of white voters , while Biden won 90 percent of African Americans, 63 percent of Asian Americans, and 58 percent of Latinos, according to exit polls.\n\nThat's why the new law surgically targets the voting methods that proved most popular among voters of color in large urban areas like Houston's Harris County in 2020.\n\nIt eliminates innovative voting methods set up by Harris County, such as drive-thru voting and extended early voting hours, that were disproportionately used by voters of color during the presidential election.\n\nAfter mail voting increased across the country in 2020 among communities of color, who favored Joe Biden, the law bans mail ballot drop boxes and makes it a felony for election officials to distribute unsolicited absentee ballot applications.\n\nThe law greatly expands access for partisan poll watchers, affording them \"free movement\" inside a polling place and subjecting election workers to criminal penalties for removing them, after GOP operatives pledged earlier this year to recruit an \"army\" of poll watchers in Black and Latino neighborhoods in Houston.\n\nAnd it requires monthly citizenship checks of the voter rolls, which could lead to controversial new voter purges, like the failed effort in 2019 to delete the registrations of 100,000 overwhelmingly Latino voters, whom the state claimed were noncitizens but turned out to be naturalized US citizens.\n\nDespite this clear evidence of disparate racial impact, Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan instructed members not to use the word \" racism \" when debating the bill on the House floor. \"We can talk about racial impacts of this legislation without accusing members of this body of being racist,\" he said last week.\n\nDemocrats pointed out that courts had found 10 different instances in the past decade where Republicans were guilty of intentionally discriminating against Black and Latino voters.\n\n\"Intentional discrimination of people of a certain race, is that racism?\" asked state Rep. Gina Hinojosa.\n\nTexas is the hardest state to vote in precisely because its voting laws so consistently discriminate against communities of color.\n\nUnder a voter ID law passed by Republicans in 2011, a handgun permit is an acceptable form of identification but a state-university issued ID is not. A federal court later called it an \" unconstitutional poll tax \" that was passed \" because of and not merely in spite of the voter ID law's detrimental effects on the African-American and Hispanic electorate.\"\n\nThe state has closed 750 polling places since 2013, when the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act to allow states like Texas to change voting rules without federal approval, more than any other state. Seventy percent of the closures came in the 50 counties with the largest growth in Latino and Black residents from 2012 to 2018.\n\nMore than 70 percent of election fraud cases brought by Attorney General Ken Paxton have targeted individuals of color , in a state whose population is 40 percent white. Crystal Mason, a Black woman from Tarrant County, received a five-year prison sentence for casting a provisional ballot in 2016 while on supervised release. ( Her vote wasn't even counted.) Hervis Rogers, a Black man from Houston who waited six hours to vote during the 2020 presidential primary in March, faces 20 years in prison for casting a ballot just months before his parole expired. Before the law passed the legislature on Tuesday, Republicans stripped a part of the bill that was supported by both Democrats and Republicans in the state House, known as the \" Crystal Mason provision ,\" that would have required election judges to tell voters when they have a criminal conviction that makes them ineligible to vote.\n\nRepublicans are so invested in voter suppression for a very good reason: Texas has three million unregistered voters , far more than any other state. The vast majority are Latino and Black, and two million would likely vote Democratic if registered, according to an analysis by the Texas Democratic Party, more than enough to turn the state blue. That's why Texas Republicans have strenuously resisted basic voting reforms like online registration , which has been adopted in 40 other states.\n\nIndeed, during debate over the new voting restrictions, leading Republicans admitted they don't want the state to encourage increased political participation.\n\n\"I'm not sure the goal of the state is to actively seek out voters,\" said GOP state Rep Andrew Murr, the bill's lead sponsor. \"The state is not so proactive that it tries to grab all the voters.\"\n\nRepublicans can't outlast the state's changing demographics forever. But as long as they can control who does and doesn't get to vote, it will be very difficult to dislodge them from power.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Dan Patrick poses for photos with supporters during the first day of the Republican Party of Texas convention. Elizabeth Conley/Houston Chronicle/AP\n\nThousands of the Texas Republican party faithful voted yesterday on a state GOP platform that calls being gay an \"abnormal lifestyle choice,\" declares the 2020 presidential election results illegitimate, and urges the repeal of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe platform says that Texas students should be shown live ultrasounds as a way to deter against abortion and be taught that life begins at fertilization. At the same time, it demands that the state outlaw all sex and sexual health education-even abstinence-only sex ed. Meanwhile, it says that young people are the \"most likely to need to defend themselves\" and thus should have access to guns without waiting periods for \"emergencies such as riots.\"\n\nAnd, doubling down on the anti-LGBTQ hate, the platform says the party \"oppose[s] all efforts to validate transgender identity,\" calling for bans on gender-affirming care for trans children and the passage of a \" Don't Say Gay\" bill stronger than Florida's. (The high-profile Florida bill, signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis in March, prohibits references to sexual orientation or gender identity in schools and is just one of at least 190 bills trying to silence speech about LBGTQ or other minority identities in schools that have been introduced since January 2021, according to Jeremy Young, senior manager of free expression and education at PEN America .)\n\nPeppered with references to Fox News culture war talking points, the platform lurches a hardline conservative party even further rightward; its \"abnormal lifestyle choice\" language, for example, did not appear in the party's last two platforms in 2018 and 2020 . Votes are still being tallied on the platform's planks, but it's rare for any to be rejected, a party spokesperson told the Texas Tribune. Voting took place at the Texas Republican Convention on Saturday, a biennual event that this year brought 5,100 GOP delegates and alternatives to Houston for a three-day conference.\n\nWhile it's little surprise for the most engaged members of the Texas GOP base to embrace hard-line conservative stances in their largely symbolic party platform, the platform is \"important as a measure of ideological drift,\" University of Houston political scientist Brandon Rottinghaus told the Texas Tribune . Extremely conservative platforms are also a useful political tool for far-right challengers in Republican primaries, who can use them to attack more moderate Republican opponents. The platform does not change any policy or law in Texas, as the Tribune explains :\n\nParty platforms are mission statements rather than legal doctrines and, in Texas, they have long reflected the opinions of the most activist wings of the parties. Republican elected officials are not bound to adhere to the platform, and party activists at times have expressed frustration that some parts of their platform and legislative priorities have not become law, despite complete Republican control of the state Legislature.\n\nBut the platforms are broad indicators of the sentiments of the most active Republican voters - those who dominate party primaries. Republicans have controlled every statewide elected office in Texas since 1999 and both houses of the Legislature since 2003, so the wishes of the party's populist, pro-Trump base inevitably affect actions taken in Austin.\n\nThe ruling party's political hostility to the existence of trans Texans has already had severe consequences in the state. Early this year, Gov. Greg Abbott directed the state's Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate parents who appeared to have allowed their trans kids to receive life-saving medical care. Labeling such care a form of \"child abuse,\" the directive led some families to begin planning to flee the state. (A state court judge in Austin has issued an order putting most investigations temporarily on hold .)\n\nThe embrace of anti-LGBTQ ideology among Texas Republicans is a part of a national trend of hostile legislation and political hate mongering that is now leading to a surge of anti-gay violence. As the Washington Post reported this week, right-wing politicians and preachers have recently called for killing LGBTQ people or parents and teachers who support them. Anti-LGBTQ demonstrations and attacks have quadrupled over the last year, from 15 to 61 incidents; and a white supremacist attack on a Pride celebration in Idaho this month was only narrowly avoided .\n\nCorrection, June 21: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized the bills targeting speech about minority identities in schools.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "What Would the Future of Birth Control Be Under Trump? Ask Texas.\n\nMother Jones; Matt Bishop/imageSPACE/Zuma; Getty\n\nWhen Wendy Davis wanted to get birth control as a teenager in the 1980s, she went to her local Planned Parenthood in Fort Worth, Texas, with a friend. \"There is absolutely no way I would have asked my mother for her permission to do that,\" says Davis, the former Texas state senator who famously filibustered an anti-abortion bill for 11 hours in a pair of pink sneakers. \"That's just not something that's possible for many, many, many teenage girls.\"\n\nForty years later, with abortion banned in wide swaths of the country, access to reliable contraception is more important than ever. Yet for Texas teens, getting prescription birth control is arguably harder now than it was when Davis was an adolescent. Over the past two years, federal courts-including the notoriously conservative 5th Circuit-have ruled that minors must have parental consent to obtain prescription birth control from Texas clinics subsidized by a federal family planning program known as Title X. Flush with victory, Texas Republicans have made it clear: They have no intention of stopping there. In late July, Attorney General Ken Paxton filed suit to overturn a new federal rule that reaffirmed teens' ability in other states to get contraception without their parents' consent. \"The Biden Administration continues to prove they will do anything to implement their extremist agenda,\" Paxton said in a press release .\n\nTo anyone paying even a modicum of attention, the far right's plans to limit access to birth control have long been hiding in plain sight. When the Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in the Dobbs decision in 2022, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the court \" should reconsider \" other rulings with similar legal principles, including Griswold v. Connecticut , the 1965 decision establishing a right to contraception (and, more fundamentally, a constitutional right to privacy). The ultra-conservative strategists behind Project 2025 - including Roger Severino, longtime anti-abortion movement lawyer, and Russell Voght , an avowed Christian nationalist-have spelled out a plan for how a Republican-led White House could gut or rewrite key federal birth-control regulations, building on efforts that began during the first Trump administration . (While Trump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, even claiming he doesn't know who wrote it, at least 140 members of Trump's team, including Severino and Voght, had a hand in drafting it.)\n\nBut what has escaped many Americans is that these threats aren't just terrifying what-if-this-happens scenarios. As the Texas lawsuits show, in some parts of the United States, that scary future has already arrived. States have been passing laws allowing pharmacies to refuse to fill birth control prescriptions based on moral objections, or proposing legislation that unscientifically classifies emergency contraception and IUDs as \"abortifacients.\" Reproductive Health and Freedom Watch has found that since 2021, at least 21 states have directed a total of $513 million to religiously affiliated crisis pregnancy centers and \"alternatives to abortion\" programs that actively spread misinformation about birth control and discourage its use.\n\nAnd though contraception is supported by around 90 percent of voters, when Congress had the chance earlier this year to pass a law protecting access to birth control, Republican senators blocked it, claiming it was unnecessary.\n\nThe Biden administration has repeatedly pushed back-most recently, with a new proposed rule under the Affordable Care Act to require private insurance to cover 100 percent of the cost of over-the-counter birth control and offer patients more choices for prescription contraception. In a statement , Vice President Kamala Harris described the move as \"the largest expansion of contraception coverage in more than a decade.\" But the regulations won't be finalized until after the presidential election, and the new rules are virtually certain to be challenged in GOP-packed federal courts even if Harris wins.\n\nAnd what if she doesn't?\n\nA new Trump administration and its right-wing allies are expected to escalate attacks on contraception on a multitude of fronts, including appointing extremists to key government positions. Rather than outright bans, we should expect more subtle incursions-regulatory changes, limits on insurance coverage, and funding reductions for family planning, as well as rules like the parental consent requirement for teens, according to reproductive health policy experts interviewed by Mother Jones . \"It would be cleaner if there was some direct attack on the right to contraception that opponents of reproductive healthcare were pursuing,\" says Kelly Baden, vice president for public policy at the Guttmacher Institute. \"They're not. It is much more behind-the-scenes, around the margins. And yet, the impact is still potentially devastating.\"\n\n\"It would be cleaner if there was some direct attack on the right to contraception that opponents of reproductive healthcare were pursuing. They're not.\"\n\n\"That's what happened to abortion,\" adds Amanda Stevenson, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado-Boulder who studies the impact of family planning policy. \"Death by a thousand cuts.\"\n\nHere are four key strategies we can expect under a new Trump administration intent on undermining access to contraception:\n\nOne of the most common attack lines against contraception is the claim that certain methods-notably IUDs and morning-after pills-are abortifacients, which is to say they cause abortion, purportedly by preventing fertilized eggs from implanting in the uterus. In fact, decades of research show that these methods block fertilization from ever happening-by preventing the release of eggs, for instance, or stopping sperm from reaching them. Yet the belief that IUDs and emergency contraception, like Plan B and Ella, end pregnancies rather than preventing them has become distressingly common, thanks in part to rampant misinformation spread by the anti-abortion movement- including appointees in the first Trump administration.\n\nThe falsehoods have made their way into Food and Drug Administration policy, with decades-long repercussions for reproductive health. Back in the early 2000s, when the FDA was trying to decide whether Plan B should be sold over the counter, it relied on an advisory committee that included several abortion opponents. Over the objections of their colleagues, those committee members persuaded the agency to include language in Plan B's packaging that stated the drug \"may also work\" by preventing implantation. Not until 2022 did the FDA finally update the Plan B label to clarify the drug \"does not terminate a pregnancy.\" But anti-abortion groups could challenge that update in a second Trump administration.\n\nMeanwhile, since 2015, the \"abortifacient claim\" has inspired lawmakers in at least seven states to vote to cut off funding for contraception or block bills to protect access to it, USA Today found in a recent investigation . Project 2025 also continues this line of attack, describing Ella as a \"potential abortifacient\" and proposing to wipe out mandatory insurance coverage for it. Some anti-abortion organizations, including the influential Students for Life, even falsely claim that the daily birth control pill is an abortifacient. As my colleague Kiera Butler has written, it's all part of a growing right-wing movement to persuade women that hormonal contraception is just plain bad for them. If Trump wins, his appointees are likely to bring those arguments with them to the agencies they oversee, further threatening birth control access.\n\nAttacking government subsidies for contraception has been part of the GOP playbook for decades. A favorite target is Title X, a federal safety-net program that underwrites free reproductive health services-birth control, cervical cancer screenings, and STI screening and treatment, but not abortion-for low-income and uninsured people. Planned Parenthood clinics, a common provider of these services, receive about 20 percent of Title X funds.\n\nNo surprise: Texas has led the way in attacking the federal program since 2011, when the legislature slashed state funding for reproductive health care and redirected Title X money to primary care providers. The changes that year-designed to kneecap Planned Parenthood-forced scores of reproductive health clinics to close, and others to reduce hours, charge patients new fees, or ration the most effective (but expensive) forms of contraception, such as IUDs. As a result of the changes, the number of clients served by Texas family planning organizations fell by more than half, and the teen birth rate rose an estimated 3.4 percent . \"It shredded the safety net for women's health care in our state,\" says Davis, now a senior adviser to Planned Parenthood Texas Votes. \"Tens of thousands of women literally lost the only health care they had ever known, overnight. It was devastating, and slowly, we've been building our way back.\"\n\n\"Tens of thousands of women literally lost the only health care they had ever known, overnight.\"\n\nTrump's first-term appointees, following Texas' lead, set about dramatically reshaping the entire Title X program. The administration's \"gag rule,\" first proposed under Ronald Reagan but never fully implemented, which forbids any clinics that took Title X money from referring patients to abortion providers. It also required them to keep separate books and separate facilities from their abortion services, if they offered them-a logistical nightmare. Some 1,300 reproductive health facilities, including 400 Planned Parenthood clinics, withdrew from the program rather than withhold abortion referrals from patients who wanted them, and roughly 1.6 million patients lost access to federally subsidized birth control. \"It was a very difficult time in the program,\" says Clare Coleman, president of the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association . \"Of course, the numbers plummeted.\" What happened to the freed-up Title X money? The Trump administration sent some of it to a chain of Christian \"crisis pregnancy centers\" that refused to provide contraception or even referrals for birth control, as my colleague Stephanie Mencimer found in a 2019 investigation .\n\nWhen Joe Biden took office, his administration promptly revoked the Trump rule, and the Title X network started rebuilding. But Vice presidential candidate Ohio Sen. JD Vance has already signaled that a second Trump administration would try again to defund Planned Parenthood-code for attacking Title X. Project 2025 urges the next president to \"quickly\" reissue the gag rule. It also advocates that Title X be \"reframed with a focus on better education around fertility awareness\"-a less-reliable method of cycle tracking favored by anti-abortion activists and wellness influencers -with grants opened up once again to anti-abortion religious organizations.\n\nIn anticipation of a Trump win, Coleman's organization has been working with reproductive health clinics to prepare for the old gag rule to be reissued and even expanded soon after Inauguration Day. Not only could the next version of the rule pick up on Texas' efforts to require parental consent for teenagers, Coleman warns Trump appointees are also likely to attack gender-affirming care. (Title X does not explicitly fund such care but some providers offer those services separately, just as they do abortion.) \"They may say, if you take Title X, you can't provide any of that care,\" Coleman speculates. \"We are quite concerned about them trying to enforce not only a gender binary-because we also do see men in the Title X program-but to recast it as: 'This is a program about biological sex.'\"\n\nThat's if Title X survives at all: House Speaker Mike Johnson's budget bill in September 2023 would have defunded the program entirely .\n\nBefore the Obama administration passed the Affordable Care Act, birth control accounted for around a third of women's out-of-pocket healthcare expenses, according to the National Women's Law Center . Monthly copays deterred women from getting the Pill, while an IUD could have an up-front cost of $1,000.\n\nThe ACA changed all that for over 62 million women . Starting in 2012, the law classified contraception as a form of preventive care and made it mandatory for private insurance to cover a wide range of prescription birth control at no cost to consumers. Last year, responding to the fallout from Dobbs , the Biden administration directed agencies to find ways to strengthen the contraception mandate and make sure insurers follow it; last month's announcement on coverage of over-the-counter contraception follows that effort.\n\nFighting the contraception mandate has been one of the key ways conservatives and religious groups have sought to erode access to birth control. In 2014, the Supreme Court's infamous Hobby Lobby ruling blew a crater in the ACA's contraception mandate in the name of protecting religious freedom. There had always been a religious exemption for churches and houses of worship. But Hobby Lobby expanded that exemption to include 90 percent of US businesses-letting them deny coverage for birth control in employee insurance plans if the owners had a religious objection.\n\nTrump broadened the exemption even further in his first term, allowing employers to decline to provide birth control based on moral, not just religious, objections . \"It opens the door wide for any employer that provides health insurance to pick and choose what kind of contraception they would like to cover,\" says Dana Singiser, cofounder of the Contraceptive Access Initiative .\n\nOf course, there's always the chance that a Republican White House and Congress would wipe out the ACA altogether, as Trump tried to do in 2017. Trump has since made conflicting statements about whether he would try again for a repeal or impose \" concepts of a plan \" to replace it. In late October, Speaker Johnson promised a \"massive reform \" of the ACA if Trump is elected.\n\nEven with the ACA still on the books, experts say Trump could do significant damage, bypassing Congress by issuing new regulations or guidance from executive-branch agencies. Project 2025 leans in on this idea, urging the next president to make regulatory moves that would hobble the contraceptive mandate. \"It's not flashy,\" says Lauren Wallace, senior counsel for reproductive rights and health at the National Women's Law Center. \"Every administration is allowed to put out proposed rules, put out guidance. So those are the ways this coverage can be stripped.\"\n\n\"Every administration is allowed to put out proposed rules, put out guidance. So those are the ways this coverage can be stripped.\"\n\nThe Biden administration is currently finalizing a replacement to Trump's rule allowing moral objections to the contraceptive mandate; it's safe to say that Trump would block or revoke it. He could also issue other regulations to make the contraceptive mandate \"unworkable,\" Wallace says. He could give insurers more agency to make rules around which types of birth control they choose to insure or require patients to try certain methods, before covering more expensive ones.\n\nProject 2025's authors, of course, have their own ideas about which forms of birth control are preferable. Their blueprint urges the next president to require the Department of Health and Human Services to issue new regulations about what is covered by the ACA contraceptive mandate. In: \" fertility awareness\" methods . Out: male condoms and Ella.\n\nBack to Texas.\n\nOver the past decade or so, at the same time the state was attacking family planning clinics, it found a way to mess with the most common way people pay for birth control: Medicaid. And Davis sees what it did as a potential model for other states should Trump win.\n\nFirst, the state passed a law banning abortion providers and their affiliates from participating in the state's Medicaid-funded family planning program. The law conflicted with a federal rule allowing Medicaid patients to choose any \"willing\" provider. That meant Texas had to apply to the Obama administration for a waiver of the rule. \"They got into a standoff,\" Davis recalls. \"The Obama administration said, 'We're going to remove all of your funding if you do this.' And Texas said, 'Fine, do it.'\"\n\nFor the next few years, Texas ran a shrunken version of the program using state funding. Then Trump appeared, installing a National Right to Life Committee lobbyist to oversee national family planning policy. Texas applied for the Medicaid waiver again-and this time, received it. The Trump administration also gave the state permission not to cover emergency contraception in its Medicaid-funded program.\n\nDavis predicts that other states will use the same maneuver to sever Planned Parenthood from Medicaid, should Trump return to office. Tennessee, which bans virtually all abortions, and South Carolina, which bans them at six weeks, have already applied for similar waivers. And Missouri recently enacted a law to ban all Medicaid reimbursements for abortion providers and their affiliates-even though the state's abortion ban means they now only provide services like contraception and cancer screening.\n\nProject 2025 proposes making federal Medicaid family planning funding conditional on states participating in a frighteningly detailed abortion surveillance system. \"Because liberal states have now become sanctuaries for abortion tourism,\" the blueprint says, \"HHS should use every available tool, including the cutting of funds, to ensure that every state reports exactly how many abortions take place within its borders.\" The database would include the gestational age at which the abortion was performed, the method, and the reason for it.\n\nThe proposal would force states to make an \"impossible choice,\" says Madeline Morcelle, senior attorney at the National Health Law Program. Participating in that \"weaponized program,\" she says, \"would likely be used to criminalize pregnant people,\" particularly immigrants, Black, Indigenous, and other people of color, young people, and people with disabilities. But dropping out would likely mean losing federal funding for vital Medicaid services affecting millions of those same low-income people.\n\nDavis, in Texas, says she knows that predictions about losing access to birth control can sound exaggerated. She's heard such criticisms before-from people who believed that Roe would never fall. \"There are those out there who believe that this is hyperbole,\" she says. But as a Texan who has witnessed how what appears radical becomes normalized, she has no illusions about the potential dangers. \"I don't think it's unlikely at all that as Republicans become more and more extreme, and governed in a more and more extreme way by their rightward flank, that we are going to see these things become a reality.\"\n\nCorrection, October 31: An earlier version of this story misstated which funds Project 2025 suggests withholding from states that don't participate in an expanded abortion surveillance program.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Republicans Are Trying to Seize Control Over Voting in Texas' Largest Democratic County\n\nSpeaker of the House Dade Phelan, R-Beaumont, during session in Austin, Texas, Jan. 18, 2023. Eric Gay/AP\n\nThe Texas legislature passed a series of bills on Monday that amounted to a sweeping power grab giving Republicans more control over how elections are run and administered in the state's most populous Democratic county, which includes the city of Houston and is home to nearly 5 million people.\n\nOne bill would allow the secretary of state, who is appointed by the state's Republican governor, Greg Abbott, to remove local election officials for \"good cause\" based on a \"recurring pattern of problems with election administration.\" Under SB 1933, a person involved in the election process could submit a complaint about a county election office to the secretary of state's office, which could then usurp the power of local officials for something as minor as a voting machine malfunction that prevents someone from casting a ballot. There would be no opportunity for the county to challenge or appeal the decision. The bill applies solely to \" large urban areas \" with 4 million people or more. Only Houston's Harris County, the state's largest blue county , falls into that category.\n\nA second bill, SB 1750, abolishes the position of election administrator in counties with a population of more than 3.5 million. Once again, only Harris County fits that definition.\n\nVoting rights experts said it was unprecedented for the legislature to single out one county against its wishes-let alone the third largest county in the country, which covers an area that is larger than Rhode Island-and could open the door to broader power grabs by Republicans. \"If they can do this in Houston, they can do it in Austin, they can do it in Dallas,\" says Emily Eby French, a voting rights attorney for the Texas Civil Rights Project. \"Targeting one official in one county is a horrible precedent to set.\"\n\nHarris County has become the epicenter for what Common Cause Texas calls the \"Texas Edition of the Big Lie.\" After losing close elections in the county in 2022, Republicans seized on reports of a shortage of paper ballots at some polling places to argue that Democrats intentionally tried to disenfranchise Republican voters . They claimed, based on local news reporting, that 121 of the county's 782 polling locations ran out of paper ballots in disproportionately Republican areas. In fact, subsequent reporting by the Houston Chronicle found that only 20 polling places ran out of paper ballots and the shortages were only slightly more likely to occur in areas that favored Donald Trump over Joe Biden in 2020. There was no evidence that the problems swung any close elections.\n\nNonetheless, Republicans continued to exaggerate the scope of voting issues in Harris County to build support for abolishing the election administrator position and transferring that authority to the county clerk and tax assessor, offices that are presently held by Democrats but where Republicans believe they can exert more influence. The unfounded claims also laid the groundwork for the legislation passed Monday giving the secretary of state power to potentially take over election operations there. The bill initially applied to all counties in the state, but was amended on the House floor to apply only to Harris County. (The Texas Senate passed a bill a few weeks ago that would have allowed the secretary of state to order new elections if 2 percent of polling places ran out of paper ballots, but the House failed to take it up.)\n\nDuring the legislative debate, Republicans displayed a stunning lack of knowledge about how Harris County elections actually operate. When asked if he knew who the county election administrator was, the lead GOP sponsor of the bill in the Texas House, State Rep. Briscoe Cain, said he did not.\n\nthe TX house tonight debating a bill to abolish the elections administrator in harris county\n\nrep. nicole collier asks rep. briscoe cain (he's house sponsor of the bill) who the harris county elections administrator is. he doesnt know. pic.twitter.com/0o18V5Quwh\n\n- jen rice (@jen_rice_) May 23, 2023\n\nThe real purpose of the bills, Democrats and voting rights advocates say, is to give Republicans more sway over how elections are conducted in large and diverse urban areas that are trending away from the GOP. Harris County, where a majority of residents are people of color, was once reliably Republican, but it favored Biden by 13 points in the last presidential election. \"Now that Republicans are losing elections in large counties, they want to take over those election offices or strong arm those officials,\" says Rose Clouston, an adviser to the Texas Democratic Party on voting rights issues.\n\nThe bills must be approved once more by the state House and reconciled with the state Senate's versions before they are sent to Gov. Abbott.\n\nThe measures add to the restrictions Texas Republicans have placed on voting in recent years. Two years ago, the legislature enacted a sweeping voter suppression bill that eliminated the voting methods used by Harris County to increase voter participation in 2020, such as 24-hour voting sites, drive-thru polling places, and sending mail ballot applications to voters.\n\nAfter Texas Republicans limited voting access in 2021, the new bills seek to further subvert fair election outcomes. \"It's a really intentional form of partisan takeovers of local election offices,\" says Katya Ehresman, voting rights program manager for Common Cause Texas.\n\nAnd despite their oft-stated concern about preventing voter fraud, Republicans passed a third bill on Monday that will allow Texas to become the ninth state to withdraw from the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a multistate compact that seeks to keep voter rolls clean and accurate by comparing voter registration data among states. Election deniers have falsely claimed that the organization is controlled by George Soros and have criticized the organization's efforts to sign up unregistered voters.\n\nTexas is already the most difficult state in the country to vote in. Unlike 40 states, it has no online voter registration, and an individual must be deputized by the state every election cycle to register voters, which makes large-scale voter registration drives nearly impossible. Under the state's voter ID law, a handgun permit is an acceptable form of identification but a student ID is not. Only voters who are over 65, out of town during the election, or have a physical condition that prevents them from going to the polls can cast a ballot by mail.\n\nThese laws explain why Texas ranks near the bottom in voter turnout every election cycle-and why the state's changing demographics have yet to lead to a shift in political power in a red state that should be a political battleground.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "14 GOP-Controlled States Have Passed Laws to Impede Free Elections\n\nMaricopa County ballots cast in the 2020 general election are examined and recounted by contractors working for Florida-based company Cyber Ninjas on May 6 in Phoenix. Matt York/AP\n\nDonald Trump will not be \"reinstated\" as president by August, as some of his supporters and allegedly the former president himself seem to believe. But Republicans are rushing to change the rules to make it easier for their party to overturn the will of the voters in future elections.\n\nWhile GOP-controlled legislatures rush to make it harder for Democratic constituencies to vote , they are also intensifying their control over how elections are run and how votes are counted, after Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election results. Twenty-four new laws have been passed in 14 states this year that will allow state legislatures to \"politicize, criminalize, and interfere in election administration,\" according to a report released Thursday by three voting rights groups, States United Democracy Center, Law Forward, and Protect Democracy. Overall, 216 bills have been introduced in 41 states to achieve these ends.\n\nWhen Texas Republicans scrambled to pass a massive voter suppression bill over Memorial Day weekend, they included a provision written behind closed doors with no public scrutiny that would make it easier for judges to throw out election results . Under the plan, losing candidates would no longer have to prove that individual fraudulent votes swung the election but rather that the number of allegedly fraudulent votes exceeded the margin of victory-which is exactly what Trump falsely alleged in 2020. The measure would also lower the burden of proof needed to demonstrate illegal voting, so that candidates only have to show a \"preponderance of evidence\" instead of \"clear and convincing evidence.\"\n\n\"They could use this to overthrow the voice of the people,\" Democratic state Rep. John Bucy III said on the House floor. \"We no longer have to prove voter fraud to overthrow an election result, we can simply do it.\" Though the bill failed to pass when House Democrats staged a dramatic walkout, denying Republicans the quorum needed to approve it, it is expected to be resurrected at a special legislative session later this year.\n\nOther GOP-controlled states have already changed their laws to make it easier to void election results. As part of its sweeping voter suppression law , Georgia's heavily gerrymandered legislature removed Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger as the chair and a voting member of the state election board after he rebuffed Trump's attempt to overturn Joe Biden's victory. The legislature will now appoint a majority of board members, and the board, in turn, can take over up to four county election boards it deems \"underperforming\"-raising the prospect that Republicans could assume control of election operations in heavily Democratic areas like Atlanta's Fulton County. In concert with a provision allowing right-wing groups to mount an unlimited number of challenges to voter eligibility, these changes will make it easier for Republicans to contest close elections and possibly overturn the results.\n\nA similar law passed in Arkansas would allow the State Board of Election Commissioners, which has a strong GOP majority, to decertify election results if they find a \"violation of the voter registration laws or election laws\" and to take over county election operations in \"severe\" cases. The state police would also be authorized to look into alleged cases of illegal voting, which could have a chilling effect on voter participation.\n\n\"I'm very worried that now we have a new playbook that partisans across the country are going to start using to try to affect and influence the outcome of elections,\" Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman, a Republican, said on a call with reporters on Thursday.\n\nIn five GOP-run states-Georgia, Florida, Kansas, Kentucky, and Montana-the legislature has usurped election authority that previously belonged to other state officials, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. These moves include measures to prevent governors or secretaries of state from modifying election laws or procedures without legislative approval, even in an emergency situation like a pandemic or natural disaster. Some of these efforts are nakedly partisan: In Arizona, where the state Senate has authorized a sham \"audit\" of 2.1 million ballots in Maricopa County designed to weaponize Trump's Big Lie about fraud in 2020, a House committee recently passed a provision preventing the Democratic secretary of state from defending state election laws and transferring that power to Arizona's Republican attorney general-but only through the 2022 election, in case the partisan composition of the offices is reversed after that. Meanwhile, Republicans in states like Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Michigan are attempting to replicate Arizona's discredited audit .\n\nAs GOP-controlled legislatures take control over election administration , they are also criminalizing efforts by election officials that would make it easier to vote. A provision in Texas's voter suppression bill would make it a felony for election officials to give a mail ballot request form to a voter who has not requested one. Overall, the Texas law could subject election officials to criminal penalties for 14 kinds of actions, such as obstructing access for partisan poll watchers and modifying state election procedures. Election officials in Iowa could face a $10,000 fine for \"technical infractions\" of election law. Arizona passed a law making it a felony for an election official to modify an election-related date or deadline unless ordered by a court to do so. Bills passed in Georgia, Florida, and Arkansas would make it a crime for volunteer groups to pass out water or food to voters waiting in line.\n\nThese bills are part of the greatest assault on voting rights since the end of Reconstruction. (During the Jim Crow era, segregationist white Democrats also consolidated control over election administration.) And they raise the likelihood of a nightmare scenario where GOP-controlled state legislatures use their increased power to override a Democratic victory in 2024 or persuade Republicans in Congress, if they regain power in 2022, to do the same.\n\n\"The 2021 state legislative season may ultimately prove to be a turning point in the history of America's democracy,\" the new report states. \"These are the ingredients for a democracy crisis.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Tried to Overturn the Election. Now He's Going After Roe.\n\nTim Murphy January+February 2022 Issue\n\nOlivier Heiligers\n\nOlivier Heiligers\n\nIt was hardly the keynote slot-before Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, before Eric and Lara Trump, before Rudy Giuliani calling for \"trial by combat,\" before John Eastman, dressed for some reason like Indiana Jones, and long before President Donald Trump, who would speak for more than an hour and incite an insurrection against Congress. But Ken Paxton didn't mind being an afterthought when he took the stage at the \"Save America\" rally in Washington on the morning of January 6. The Republican attorney general of Texas was happy just to be there at all.\n\nThe 58-year-old Paxton wore a thick tartan scarf with a long black coat and no gloves, and his gray hair, stubbornly parted for decades, drifted haphazardly across his forehead in the stiff January wind. When he was 12, Paxton nearly lost his right eye in a freak accident during a game of hide-and-seek. It left permanent damage-it's a different color from his left one, and the lid above it is half-closed. The effect is that whether he is posing for a mugshot or addressing a large group of people preparing to hang Mike Pence, Paxton's face appears fixed in a mischievous half-smirk.\n\nBut as he stood on the podium that morning, Paxton had good reason to smile. One month earlier, beset by a damning series of allegations from his own staffers of personal and professional wrongdoing, Paxton's career seemed to be free-falling. Then he found a parachute. Rejecting centuries of constitutional law and democratic traditions, Paxton filed a lawsuit arguing that Pennsylvania and three other states won by Joe Biden had harmed Texas by expanding mail- and early-voting access during the pandemic. He asked the Supreme Court to strip those states of their Biden electors and instruct their legislatures to replace them with new ones, effectively making Trump the victor of the 2020 election. Paxton's gambit was one level removed, legally speaking, from one of those ransom notes they send in movies with all the letters cut out from magazine headlines. His brief miscalculated the number of electoral votes at play and, citing the calculations of one random man in Berkeley , falsely asserted that \"the statistical improbability of Mr. Biden winning the popular vote in these four States collectively is 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000.\" But that did not stop many of the gop's most prominent figures from endorsing it. A majority of the House Republican conference signed their names to an amicus brief . So did 17 other Republican state attorneys general. Trump truly believed it could work, and Sen. Ted Cruz promised to argue the case before the Supreme Court.\n\nThe justices unanimously rejected Paxton's argument. Only two of them even believed he had standing to make it. In normal circumstances, such a defeat would have been a great embarrassment. But here in front of the White House, looking out on a sea of red hats and flak jackets, Paxton was taking a victory lap. With his wife, Angela, a Republican state senator, standing silently beside him, Paxton sped through his record in the frenzied cadence of a French cinematographer wrapping up at the Oscars. Texas had stayed red when states such as Georgia had flipped, he explained, because he had been willing to \"fight\" by filing lawsuits to restrict voting. \"We kept fighting in Texas,\" Paxton said. \"We will not quit fighting,\" he promised. His speech was over in three minutes. And then, not long after, the crowd made its way to the Capitol and kept fighting there.\n\nIf you put all the component parts of Trump-era conservatism in a fridge and went away for a while, Ken Paxton is what you'd get when you finally opened the door. In a state that's produced some of the most significant political personalities of the last half-century, Paxton is a mediocre mess. He is not one of the Republican Party's big thinkers. He has not, like Cruz or Josh Hawley , his partners in the would-be coup, been groomed since his teenage years for the national stage. He has never had to appeal to the unconverted or deviate from what passes for the norm in Texas Republican politics. He has been under indictment for six years. As the crowd at the Ellipse witnessed, he has all the charisma of a writ of certiorari. Even the lawsuit he championed in Washington was borrowed from somebody else. Prior to his election as attorney general, the most notable thing he'd done at a courthouse was filch a $1,000 pen from another lawyer.\n\nBut you don't need to be brilliant or ethical or charming to wield a lot of power in state government; you just need to keep the right people happy for long enough. And Paxton, for all his transgressions, has been a dependable vehicle for reactionary interests, inside and outside his state, for years. He's led a legal crusade against immigrants, voting rights, environmental regulations, health care access, and trans equality. He's scuttled local efforts to protect citizens from gun violence and COVID-19. And he's taking an axe to Roe v. Wade .\n\nPaxton's persistence in the face of endless scandal makes him a model apparatchik for the current moment. He will never be president, but in a golden age of Republican corruption, in which anyone with ambition must bend the knee to an aspiring autocrat, a warm body with nothing to lose can do a lot of damage. By laundering the theories of conspiracists and hacks, he did as much as anyone short of Trump to make the Big Lie the new party orthodoxy. And in the process, he held a black light up to the rest of the conservative legal movement-the institutions and officials and donors who have turned jobs like his into some of the most powerful in state politics, and the compromises they've made to do it. There are a lot of Ken Paxtons out there, it turns out, and they were all just waiting to fall in line.\n\nLike many of Texas' loudest Republican leaders, Warren Kenneth Paxton Jr. came from somewhere else. The son of a B-52 pilot, Paxton spent his childhood on the move, living with his family in a trailer without air conditioning in six different states in 10 years. Paxton was raised Christian but traces his personal religious awakening to a summer he spent as a teenager at Falls Creek, the city-sized Baptist youth camp in Oklahoma. \"I realized as I saw people coming to Christ that I didn't have what they had,\" he said in a 2017 interview with the Christian broadcasting mogul Joni Lamb, whose late husband , Marcus, flew the Paxtons to Trump's 2017 inauguration.\n\nTeenage Paxton was anxious about committing himself to Christ, fearful that \"God would send me somewhere like Africa.\" Instead, he ended up in Waco, where he was elected Baylor's student body president, raised a live bear cub-the school mascot-in his apartment, and met his wife. They soon moved to Charlottesville, where Angela taught public school and Ken studied law at the University of Virginia.\n\nPaxton went to UVA rather than the University of Texas, he later explained, believing he would have to compete with fewer classmates for jobs in Texas after graduation. On a campus that nurtured egos-Fox News host Laura Ingraham was in Paxton's class-Paxton \"wasn't somebody who would draw attention to himself,\" recalls Neil Rowe, a fellow law student who belonged to a small Christian fellowship with the Paxtons and about a dozen other students and spouses. Paxton wasn't on the law review. He didn't send letters to the Cavalier Daily . Most of the fellowship's members were married, and they would meet at each other's homes once a week to have dinner and play board games, and sometimes chip in to assist fellow law students facing financial difficulties. \"He was kind, he was caring-he cared about people who had different needs than we have,\" Rowe says. \"Every time he opens his mouth, I'm disappointed all over again.\"\n\nPaxton's faith was a natural conduit to politics in North Texas, where the family settled in the mid-1990s-initially, to help plant a church in the small city of Frisco. Ken worked as a lawyer for J.C. Penney. Angela homeschooled their four children, then taught math at a private Christian academy they later sent their own children to. Suburbs like Collin County, north of Dallas, were the launchpad of the Christian conservative takeover in the state, and the Paxtons were deeply involved in the anti-­abortion movement that powered it. Ken served on the board of a crisis pregnancy center attached to a megachurch called Prestonwood Baptist (which they eventually joined); Angela, deeply influenced by her own adoption, has worked with an organization that sells upscale clothing and uses the proceeds to pay for sonograms.\n\nAngela, everyone who has met both of them seems to agree, is the family member with the more evident political talent. But Ken is a common denominator, a white man in institutions made for them, carried along on the current of conservative politics and privilege. He once said that the key to his political success is that he has a three-­syllable name. So when Angela told him one morning in 2001 that she'd had a dream that he would run for office, it was only a matter of time before Ken acquiesced.\n\n\"I don't know what happens when you ask God for an answer and you don't do it,\" he explained later, \"but I don't want to find out.\"\n\nPaxton was an unremarkable legislator in his first half-decade in Austin-a backbencher whose highest-profile stunt was a law adding President George W. Bush's name to \"Welcome to Texas\" signs. But while Paxton's political career was idling, his business career was never busier.\n\nIn Texas, where the legislature convenes for a few months every two years, members often keep whatever jobs they hold in private life. This leaves the chamber rife with conflicts of interest. The legislature's ethical guidelines, says Andrew Wheat, research director at Texans for Public Justice , a nonprofit that has filed numerous complaints against Paxton over the years, are \"basically a joke.\" It is a perfect place for a lawmaker with few scruples to leverage new connections.\n\nWhen Paxton took office in 2003, his financial disclosure listed just one venture, a small law firm specializing in estate planning. By 2014, the Dallas Morning News revealed , Paxton was involved in 26 businesses. There was a real estate scheme with his local district attorney, which netted $1 million by flipping property to the county. Paxton was a major investor in a startup that produced dashcams-and then voted for a law making them mandatory for cops. People who stopped by Paxton's law office for some estate planning might come away with a referral to a donor's investment firm-which, unbeknownst to them , was paying Paxton a commission.\n\nPaxton had a nose for business ideas, but they were not always good ones. Take Pirin Electric. In that case, he and three other Republican state representatives were part of a group of investors who lost $2.5 million to a Prestonwood member who had become a local celebrity after claiming to have found the possible remains of Noah's Ark in Iran. The scheme, which involved speculating in the state's deregulated utility market, offered a window into Paxton's world-a tight network of suburban white men, linked closely by politics and faith, playing a little too fast with money. As one Collin County resident who was a member of the Rotary Club with Paxton during this time told me, \"Jesus is involved in every deal.\"\n\nThen, in 2010, Republicans took huge majorities in the legislature, powered by tea party-fueled margins in North Texas. But the speaker of the House was Joe Straus, a moderate Republican (and to the consternation of some , a Jew) who had cut a deal with Democrats to land the job. Paxton, reading the winds, decided to challenge him. It was never much of a contest, but he won by losing. By the time the crowded 2014 primary for attorney general rolled around, the resources of the party's anti-­Straus right, including the National Rifle Association and anti-abortion groups such as Texas Right to Life, were at his disposal. Empower Texans, a PAC funded by the billionaire oilman Tim Dunn, who has spent huge sums waging an intraparty civil war on behalf of Texas conservatives, guaranteed a million-dollar loan to Paxton's campaign during the primary. The campaign blanketed the airwaves with clips of Cruz hailing him as a defender of \"religious liberty.\"\n\nA primary opponent dug up a lawsuit from a couple alleging that Paxton, after being hired to prepare a postnuptial agreement, had pushed them to make a bad investment with a financial manager he was friends with-without revealing he'd get a commission. The couple dropped the suit, but a few years later Paxton was caught acting as an unregistered securities broker again. Paxton admitted to wrongdoing and paid a small fine to the state securities regulator. His opponent in the primary runoff-a Straus ally-talked up the story, to no avail. In November the party closed ranks around Paxton. The job was just too important to fall into the wrong hands.\n\nDuring the Obama years, state attorneys general took on an exalted status on the right, as checks against the scary federal government in Washington. Measured in campaign dollars, the growth was practically vertical. The Republican Attorneys General Association, formed in the 1990s by lawyers who believed the landmark tobacco settlements could have a chilling effect on big business, raised less than half a million dollars for its campaigns in 2002. In 2014, when Paxton won, it hauled in $16 million. Four years later, it raised more than double that.\n\nThose investments stemmed from a growing recognition among corporate donors and strategists of the vital role state AGs could play in a broader national agenda-a bridge between the right-wing takeover of the courts and the increasingly reactionary and gerrymandered state governments. Republican AGs filed 56 multistate lawsuits against the Obama administration, according to Paul Nolette, a professor of political science at Marquette University, winning major victories on everything from immigration to health care to environmental regulation. And Texas led the way. Gov. Greg Abbott, Paxton's predecessor as attorney general-and Cruz's boss in that role-once described his job in three steps: \"I go into the office in the morning, I sue Barack Obama, and then I go home.\"\n\nPaxton promised more of the same. But seven months into his term, a Collin County grand jury indicted him-on two counts of securities fraud and one count of acting as an unregistered securities broker. Not long after, the US Securities and Exchange Commission brought charges of its own. This time, it was a company called Servergy, which Paxton had pitched to his friends as a can't-miss opportunity, that landed him in trouble. Its signature product, a purportedly game-changing server for data centers, was nothing of the sort, and a much-hyped deal with Amazon didn't exist. A former Republican state representative named Byron Cook blew the whistle. Cook had been Paxton's roommate for a time in Austin, and they'd done deals together before, including the dashcam business. Paxton had persuaded Cook and other acquaintances to sink a combined $840,000 into the venture. What Cook didn't realize was that Paxton had not purchased any shares in the company himself. Over lunch at a Dairy Queen, the company's founder had instead offered him a stake in the company as a \"gift\"-which prosecutors alleged was compensation for bringing others on board. \"God doesn't want me to take your money,\" the company's founder told him.\n\nFrom the moment the indictments dropped, Paxton's tenure in office was consumed by a desire to survive what he called-in a glimpse of the world to come-a \"witch hunt.\" While Paxton's staff held down the fort in Austin and supporters financed an ad blitz denouncing the prosecution, \"the general\" (as he prefers to be called) was increasingly holed up at home. Paxton portrayed himself as a persecuted Christian, beset by the forces of darkness.\n\n\"I could immediately feel it the day I stepped in,\" he told Joni Lamb, the Christian broadcaster. He was engaged in a \"spiritual battle.\"\n\nPaxton circumvented anti-bribery statutes by accepting large sums of money from \"family friends\" and \"former clients\" for a legal defense fund , including $100,000 from the CEO of a company that was under investigation by the AG's office and the Department of Justice for Medicaid fraud. (The company eventually settled , with no admission of wrongdoing.) At the same time, his allies moved to defund the prosecution. Taking advantage of a new Texas law that moved public-­integrity prosecutions out of Austin and onto elected officials' home turf, a Paxton campaign donor named Jeff Blackard sued the all-­Republican Collin County commission, alleging that the cost of a trial would be an imposition on taxpayers like himself.\n\nAt a commissioners' meeting in 2017, one Paxton supporter after another stood up to attack the case . The lawyers going after Paxton, said one, were as sleazy as O.J. Simpson's. \"Jesus Christ,\" said another, \"would not want to see a man like General Paxton, who had done no harm and no wrong, prosecuted.\" The speakers included Blackard and his wife (who told the commissioners she had partied with the Paxtons the previous week at Trump's inaugural) and a former Paxton staffer. The tactic worked-the commissioners voted to cut off funds for the case, and special prosecutors have now spent years fighting to overturn the decision in court. Two more Paxton friends- the trustee of his blind trust and a pastor at Prestonwood -are suing Cook and another witness for allegedly defrauding them in a land deal. (Paxton had been both a manager and a lawyer for the company involved in the venture; even the efforts to exonerate Paxton dragged him into the mud.)\n\nPaxton has scored one major blow already. The federal charges were dismissed in 2017 on the grounds that he never explicitly told his friends he was buying shares, and he did not actually know that his claims about Servergy were false. (A judge eventually ordered Servergy's former ceo to pay a $22,500 fine for having \"negligently violated\" securities law.) But the county case is different-Paxton has already admitted in writing to acting as an unregistered broker. It is hard to keep track of where that case even stands at this point, and that, as much as winning, is sort of the point-the docket is so impenetrable, the delays a result of so many intervenors and appeals, that it allows Paxton to present himself as the real victim. He just wants a speedy trial, Paxton insists. Isn't this America?\n\nWhen Paxton was first indicted, his days in Austin seemed numbered. But in 2018, Republicans dragged Paxton's limp campaign to victory again, by the narrowest margin of any statewide elected official. Groups including Texas Right to Life and the state's Fraternal Order of Police threw their support behind him. So did Texans for Lawsuit Reform, a corporate-backed kingmaker that had helped cement Republican control of the state in an unending push for tort reform.\n\nFor all the turmoil, Paxton's office was giving these varied conservative constituencies their money's worth. Over the last decade, Texas politics has revolved around increasingly severe anti-abortion rules and legislation. And Paxton, a product of the anti-abortion movement, delivered for those activists in office, harassing abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood and defending the state's crackdown on reproductive rights in federal courts. He sued to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (which conferred some protections on undocumented immigrants who had come to the United States as children), led a push to kill the Affordable Care Act, and moved to gut the Obama administration's anti-smog rules. After the US Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that same-sex marriage bans violated the Constitution's equal protection clause, Paxton told Texas judges to ignore the ruling. Angela, who would soon win election to the state Senate, sometimes appeared at rallies on the attorney general's behalf, strumming an acoustic guitar and crooning a country twist on Abbott's mantra: \"I'm a pistol-packin' mama, and my husband sues Obama.\"\n\nJason Ravnsborg (S.D.) After killing 55-year-old Joseph Boever with his car in 2020, Ravnsborg told police he kept driving because he thought he hit a deer. Police found the victim's glasses on Ravnsborg's front seat the next day. He pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor traffic charges and paid minor fines. And yes, he kept his driver's license.\n\nAfter killing 55-year-old Joseph Boever with his car in 2020, Ravnsborg told police he kept driving because he thought he hit a deer.

Rutledge also teamed up with Paxton to challenge the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, the Biden administration's prohibition on LGBTQ workplace discrimination, and DACA. She helped draft legislation barring transgender high school athletes from competing in girls' sports and, in August, published an official opinion stating that the teaching of \"antiracism\" violates the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nRutledge also teamed up with Paxton to challenge the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, the Biden administration's prohibition on LGBTQ workplace discrimination, and DACA.

Texas was once more at the vanguard of the nation's conservative movement. And in the sitting Republican president, Paxton had a worthy ally-two men of dubious motives who had something to gain from the other.\n\nWith Texas emerging as a battleground in the November presidential election, Paxton challenged efforts in large Democratic-leaning counties to expand voting access, while zealously prosecuting even the most minor cases of voter fraud. Although a Houston Chronicle analysis found that more than 22,000 hours of investigative work by Paxton's office had netted just 16 cases in 2020, the outcomes of those prosecutions mattered less than the story that national Republicans wanted to tell: The election must be secured so it could not be \"stolen.\"\n\nOn September 24, Paxton triumphantly announced the indictment of a commissioner in a small East Texas county for alleged absentee ballot fraud in a local Democratic primary election. It was proof, he said , that \"mail ballots are vulnerable to diversion, coercion, and influence by organized vote harvesting schemes.\" One week later, seven Paxton staffers-including some of his top subordinates-left the office after an early lunch and reported their boss to the FBI.\n\nThe staffers later texted Paxton, informing him they had \"made a good faith report of violations of the law by you\" and demanding a meeting with him. Paxton declined. Instead, in the days and weeks that followed, he fired or forced out each of those staffers, and a scandal simmering behind the scenes for months boiled over into public view.\n\nIn the formal complaint the whistleblowers filed with the FBI, and in a subsequent lawsuit for wrongful termination brought by four of them, Paxton's staffers detailed a \"bizarre\" pattern of behavior from their boss on behalf of an Austin real estate developer named Nate Paul, \"with whom the Attorney General has formed a strong personal bond, and with whom the Attorney General increasingly spends large portions of his free time.\"\n\nPaul, whose properties ranged from a collection of parking garages to a downtown bikini bar, was the kind of figure many politicians-to say nothing of an attorney general-would have kept at arm's length. More than a dozen businesses associated with his real estate empire have gone bankrupt in recent years, and the FBI had raided his home and offices in 2019 as part of an unspecified investigation. But during the summer of 2020, the whistleblowers alleged, Paxton had gone to extraordinary lengths to help his friend. The AG had intervened in a lawsuit between Paul and a charity he owed money to. When some of Paul's foreclosed properties were set to be auctioned, Paxton's office issued a last-minute opinion stating that such auctions must be suspended during the pandemic. That in itself was suspicious; he has sued to block virtually any institution that attempts to take proactive steps to reduce COVID-19 transmission.\n\nMost glaringly, in the eyes of his aides, Paxton had hired a special prosecutor to investigate Paul's claims that various state and federal officials were engaged in a criminal conspiracy against him. (In October, Paul sued the state and federal agents investigating him, alleging that the raids had violated his civil rights and damaged his reputation.) That move alarmed staffers, who believed the hiring might have been illegal. Citing Paxton's \"frantic\" and \"obsessive\" activity, his penchant for cycling through personal \"burner\" phones, and his closeness with Paul, they feared that Paxton was performing his duties \"under duress.\" In the wrongful termination lawsuit, they speculated that the moves might have been \"an effort to repay Paul\" for a $25,000 donation to Paxton's reelection campaign. Their most intriguing theory was one that cut at the core of the Paxtons' power-couple brand: Sometime in 2019 or 2020, they stated, Paxton had admitted that he'd had an extramarital affair with a former aide to a Republican state senator-and Paul had subsequently given the aide a job. (In a deposition in late 2020 as part of the ongoing litigation with the charity, Paul confirmed that Paxton had recommended the woman.) The whistleblowers \"reasonably concluded,\" they stated in their lawsuit, that Paxton's desperate need to cover up the alleged affair might explain his behavior. Paxton, who speaks almost exclusively to conservative TV and radio hosts, has managed to avoid answering any questions about the alleged affair for more than a year. But in a statement immediately following the complaint, he accused the staffers of making \" false claims .\" Eventually, his office released a report exonerating him of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe whistleblowers were no deep-state moles. One had even been denied a federal judgeship after reporters dug up a speech in which he called transgender kids \" Satan's plan .\" They had eagerly signed up to work for the flagship of reactionary federalism; instead, they worried they had become Paxton's accomplices.\n\nThe criminal complaint-followed by the confirmation that the FBI was now poking around-cracked the dam that had prevented Paxton's previous foibles from swamping his political career. Some Texas Republicans, including Rep. Chip Roy, a former Paxton deputy, called for him to resign. Allies in Collin County began to inch away.\n\nBut in the Trump era, with its obsession over deep-state corruption and witch hunts, this latest scandal came with a built-in language of rationalization for Paxton to tap into. Emboldened by Trump, scandal-plagued sycophants paraded their legal problems the way candidates once touted endorsements. Grave allegations of wrongdoing became almost a shield against consequences-proof, in fact, that you must be doing something right. So Paxton kept going. Having already been accused once of selling out his office to a real estate developer with a history of bankruptcies, Paxton decided simply to do it again on a bigger stage.\n\nThe November election offered Paxton a shot at redemption. As soon as the results were in, Paxton embarked on a media tour to plant doubts about the outcome, hinting that Texas had detected something off about Dominion's voting machines and amplifying false allegations of a vast conspiracy in key swing states. A succession of lawsuits from the Trump campaign were laughed out of court , and the RNC's own counsel privately called their arguments a \" joke .\" But the post-election landscape was shaped by the increasingly perverse incentives of Republican politics: The fact that there was no legal basis for such claims made it even more imperative that someone with power make those claims. On December 8, less than a week before the Electoral College would meet, Paxton, on behalf of the state of Texas, sued Pennsylvania and three other swing states that had gone for Biden, calling for their results to be thrown out.\n\n\"It's hard to understand just how radical and frankly insane the lawsuit was,\" says Steve Vladeck, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nPaxton's arguments had already been rejected in other courts. He produced no evidence of fraud, and he recycled absurdities. But beyond the slapstick lawyering, the willful disregard for the constitutional order portended something ominous. It was a post-legal document-less a sincere constitutional argument than a coup threat in legalese. Paxton was not just providing cover to a desperate president; he was driving the conservative legal apparatus into new territory and setting the stage for the next election challenge to come.\n\nHere, again, Paxton was a vessel of convenience-someone willing to cross a line so others might follow. As the New York Times later reported, the lawsuit had first been distributed by Michael Farris, a homeschooling activist and president of the Arizona-based Alliance Defending Freedom. Texas embraced it after South Carolina balked. (Paxton did make some changes-for instance, his lawyers inserted the embarrassing \"one-in-a-quadrillion\" claim.) When staffers in the Florida attorney general's office first saw Paxton's brief, they began emailing frantically back and forth. The argument was \"batshit,\" one attorney wrote in an email, noting that Paxton's own solicitor general did not sign his name to the document. \"Perhaps this is Paxton's request for a pardon,\" speculated another. But Paxton was trading legal credibility for political cover. After Trump hailed the suit as \"the big one,\" South Carolina, Florida, and 15 other states eventually signed on. Paxton dashed off to Washington to meet with Trump to discuss what his schedule cryptically referred to as \"state-federal matters.\"\n\nReporters asked Paxton the obvious question: Did he discuss a pardon with Trump? \"I've had no discussions with anything about...anything like that,\" Paxton said , although the White House later confirmed that Paxton had lobbied the president to grant clemency to a major donor to his legal defense fund, who had previously pleaded guilty to tax evasion.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court unanimously rejected Paxton's case the next day, he was at the White House Christmas party. And in the weeks that followed, as Trump pursued every avenue to thwart the certification of the election results and the peaceful transfer of power, Paxton was one of his most eager allies. By the morning of January 6, Paxton was back in DC. The visit was purportedly official business, although his office won't say who paid for his flights and hotel, nor will it release any communications from his time there, claiming that every email and text he sent in DC was covered by \"attorney-client privilege,\" even though it's not really clear what the \"client\" or \"case\" could be. (The congressional committee investigating the insurrection has subpoenaed these records.) His schedule called for an appearance on the Mall, followed by an afternoon and evening of media hits-and another visit to the White House the next morning.\n\nIn December , days after Paxton filed his election lawsuit, Kevin Moran, a retired journalist and Democratic activist in Galveston, dashed off a complaint to the State Bar of Texas. Paxton's case was not only a fool's errand, he argued; it was malpractice on Texans' behalf. Dozens more complaints followed. In June, in an unprecedented gesture, a coalition of former bar presidents and officers lodged their own complaint. Paxton's election lawsuit is now the focus of a formal bar investigation.\n\nPaxton has defended himself against the probes by arguing that it is unconstitutional to lodge a bar complaint against the attorney general. This is a familiar Paxton tactic: His lawyers in the securities case argued that the entire securities-registration law was unconstitutional. He defended himself against the whistleblower complaint by arguing that the whistleblower law does not apply to him, because the attorney general is not a public employee. (An appeals court disagreed .) A public official is traditionally held to a higher standard than a private person. Paxton contends that he should actually be held to a lower one, acting as a sort of anti-lawyer, entirely unconstrained by institutions and traditions. It is the state-level analog to the position Trump's lawyers took in his impeachment trials: If an attorney general does it, it must be legal.\n\nGiven the various cases against him, Paxton might not keep his job much longer. Texans for Lawsuit Reform-Paxton's top donor over the course of his career, to the tune of $1.4 million-is calling for a replacement. \"The Texas Attorney General's Office is too important to operate under a cloud of suspicion and without adequate legal talent to represent the best interests of Texans,\" the group's spokesperson, Lucy Nashed, said in a statement. Three serious primary challengers are already running against him, most notably George P. Bush, the state land commissioner and nephew of President George W. Bush. Some of Paxton's other donors are beginning to defect, and a number of powerful conservative groups, such as the National Border Patrol Council, have thrown their support behind the state's most famous Republican heir. In August, George P. Bush visited Prestonwood Baptist Church-posing for photos with Paxton's own pastor. These Republican opponents present themselves as Paxton without the baggage.\n\nIn November, Paxton's team was back at the Supreme Court for another big case-a defense of the state's abortion law, which bans procedures before many women even know they're pregnant. The wrinkle was that ordinary citizens, rather than the state, would take responsibility for enforcing it, by suing anyone who so much as drove an ineligible woman to a clinic. Like the election lawsuit before it, the law was a radical and cynical gambit attempting to exploit cracks in the existing constitutional framework. His office argued that the ban was \"stimulating\" interstate commerce by compelling patients to travel to Oklahoma. Once again, despite others' initial misgivings, it wasn't long before many in his party fell in line. And this case wasn't going to be laughed out of court-in December, the Supreme Court ruled that the law could stay on the books while legal challenges from abortion providers move forward.\n\nWhen I spoke with Cecile Richards, the former president of Planned Parenthood who is now co-chair of the Democratic super-­pac American Bridge, she pushed back on the idea that Paxton was an \"outlier\" who could be separated from his peers so easily. In defending the abortion law, after all, he was once more carrying water for his colleagues. \"It's not just about Ken Paxton,\" she told me. \"How could someone this corrupt, this incompetent, this unengaged, and with such extreme politics, continue to get elected in the state of Texas? That really goes back to the complete control of the Republican Party by the most far-right elements of our state.\"\n\nPaxton's legacy can't be so easily undone because it was never really his legacy to begin with. It took a village to create someone like this, and he is molded in the image of his creators. Most of the people and organizations that seeded Paxton's rise-the forces that created not just one Ken Paxton, but many-have continued on the trajectory that brought a mob to the Capitol. Only the fringiest of lawyers have faced sanction. Only a handful of dissenters have broken ranks. The Federalist Society has taken no public steps to reckon with how close its members brought the country to a coup. The Republican Attorneys General Association, whose political arm ran robocalls advertising the \"Stop the Steal\" rally, promoted the man who signed off on them. And the Republican attorneys general themselves simply got back to work. Someone, after all, still has to go into the office, sue Joe Biden, and go home.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

You can read our Privacy Policy here.\n\nAmanda Zurawski and her husband were \"beyond thrilled\" to soon welcome their first child, a daughter named Willow, last fall following more than a year of \"grueling\" fertility treatments. However, things took a tragic turn for the Texas couple. During her second trimester, Zurawski began experiencing odd symptoms and, after a medical exam, learned that she had dilated prematurely because of a condition known as cervical insufficiency. Shortly after the diagnosis, her water broke at just 17 weeks, leading doctors to inform the aspiring mother that the loss of her daughter was inevitable. While Zurawski needed an immediate pregnancy termination last August to protect her life-now acutely vulnerable to deadly complications-Texas imposed a full criminal \"trigger\" ban that month that carried punitive consequences for providers, including revocation of their license, a penalty of at least $100,000 per violation, and up to 99 years in prison. With no exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or severe fetal abnormality, the law holds a carve-out for medical emergencies, vaguely defined as \"risk of death or a substantial impairment of a major bodily function.\" Texas hospitals and doctors have been erring on the side of extreme caution to avoid liability by either failing to intervene completely or waiting until a patient's life is at immediate risk-or as one Texas physician put it, \" on death's door .\" Until she was ill enough for the hospital's ethics board to consider her life in danger, Zurawski's doctors' felt their hands were tied by the law. And traveling out of state for care wasn't a safe option for the 35-year-old Austin woman, who was instructed to stay within a 15-mile radius of the hospital: With the nearest clinic in Albuquerque, N.M., an 11-hour drive from home, developing an infection in the middle of vast swaths of the Texas desert could have meant certain death. In Texas today, residents must travel an average of nearly 500 miles to obtain care. \"I cannot adequately put into words the trauma and despair that comes with waiting to either lose your own life, your child's-or both,\" Zurawski testified before a congressional panel on reproductive rights in a post- Dobbs America in late April. \"For days, I was locked in this bizarre and avoidable hell. Would Willow's heart stop, or would I deteriorate to the brink of death?\" Related Article \"She Had a Heartbeat Too\": Waiting for One Dead Woman Amy Littlefield Her health quickly eroded. After developing a high fever and dangerously low blood pressure, Zurawski was rushed to the ICU and diagnosed with septic shock, a blood infection that can lead to death within an hour. Zurawski stabilized just enough to deliver her stillborn daughter, before crashing again and spending the next three days in the ICU where medical professionals battled to save her life. She is now left with emotional and physical scars, including the loss of one fallopian tube, that have made it difficult to have another child.

Nearly a year prior to the demise of Roe v. Wade , Texans began to feel the impact of severe abortion laws when the state's six-week \"bounty hunter\"-style ban took effect. Left in the wake of the state's draconian bans is a trail of horrific stories about the grisly and life-threatening medical complications -including sepsis, organ failure, and hemorrhaging-pregnant patients must face before receiving pregnancy termination intervention, underscoring the need for a repeal of the state's ban, or at the very least clarification of its medical emergency clause. In her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Zurawski shared her harrowing story and directly addressed Texas Republican US Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, saying they held the \"power\" to fix this. (Cornyn, while acknowledging that she should not have had to wait to receive abortion care, later minimized the traumatizing ordeal as a case of medical malpractice rather than an institutional problem directly inflicted by the anti-abortion laws, saying Zurawski had a \" good lawsuit \" on her hands.) Current Issue View our current issue \"I nearly died on their watch,\" she said with both senators absent from the room at the time. \"And furthermore, as a result of what happened to me, I may have been robbed of the opportunity to have children in the future.\" However, while the senators ardently support abortion restrictions by continually voting against bills that would legalize care, Texas legislators crafted the state's abortion law. The power to change the laws, at present, lies within the Texas Legislature, which convened its biannual session in January. Onlookers were cautiously optimistic that the Republican-dominated body would potentially consider measures that help clarify the nebulous maternal health exceptions, especially in light of the myriad medical studies and media reports highlighting the grave dangers they have posed for Texas patients. Last fall, Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott recognized that pregnant patients facing complications were not receiving timely intervention under the state's abortion bans, as the language in the law gave doctors pause. \"Something that really does need to be done [during the legislative session] is clarify what it means to protect the life of the mother,\" Abbott told a Dallas news station in October . \"There's been too many allegations that have been made about ways in which the lives of the mother are not being protected. That must be clarified. That's our focus.\" However, during the 2023 Texas legislative session-which concludes at the end of May, absent a special session-the GOP failed to introduce or pass any such legislation. Abbott did not make this a legislative priority, or even bring it up again publicly after getting reelected during the November midterm elections. (Requests for comment from his office were not returned.) Two Republican lawmakers who previously expressed support for creating exceptions in the laws for survivors of rape and incest also never pursued legislation to actually codify those changes. In fact, a handful of Texas Republicans recently stood with one of the largest anti-abortion groups in the state to reaffirm that they would not be pursuing these exceptions. \"Our laws are very clear,\" said Amy O'Donnell of Texas Alliance for Life. \"We have heard stories of doctors who say they need further clarification but we believe that that clarification should come...from various [hospital] boards. The laws do not need to be changed.\" Meanwhile, nearly a dozen bills filed by Democrats that would offer exceptions haven't even been given committee hearings. For instance, Austin-based state Senator Sarah Eckhardt offered a proposal to ensure that doctors prioritize the life of the pregnant patient over that of the fetus. The bill and its House counterpart have sat idle since March. \"I wish I didn't need to file this kind of bill, meant to help protect the life of the mother,\" said Eckhardt. \"But the willful ignorance of reproductive health facts by those who supported these laws have led us here. Women in Texas are suffering horrible consequences and yet no action is being taken on these bills. Our leadership sees no reason to rectify this cruelty.\" Eckhardt points out that Texas Republicans are turning a blind eye to the fact that the majority of Texans-including those who identify as Republicans-support abortion access in cases of rape or incest, if there is a strong chance of a serious birth defect, or if the pregnant patient's life is seriously endangered, findings reaffirmed by a February poll from the Texas Politics Project. Missing the opportunity to offer this clarification today, the Texas Legislature is instead focusing on banning gender-affirming care for transgender children, pushing bills that would make it easier to remove district attorneys who have taken a stand against prosecuting abortion providers, and supporting ostensible \"family planning\" services like infusing a program that includes crisis pregnancy centers-riddled with transparency and accountability problems -with an unprecedented $200 million. The inaction is especially frustrating for advocates because the state suffers from a crisis of preventable maternal deaths , which is expected to worsen under these laws. All the while, a climate of fear perpetuated by the consequences of these laws grows in Texas, where abusers appear empowered to inflict harm on their abortion-seeking partners. Earlier this year, a man-accused of \" serial \" abusive behavior in a countersuit- filed a \"wrongful death\" lawsuit against his ex-wife's friends for allegedly helping her access medication abortion. And just last week, a Texas man choked and then fatally shot his girlfriend in a Dallas parking lot after she returned from obtaining an abortion in Colorado. Dr. Ghazaleh Moayedi, a Texas ob-gyn and board member with Physicians for Reproductive Health, stresses that hospitals and doctors are overinterpreting the law's exceptions to avoid risk, leaving patients in complicated medical situations that require \"incredible resources\" amid a weak health care infrastructure and physician shortage . In a state that holds the highest percentage of uninsured residents of reproductive age, some 159 Texas counties have no ob-gyn. What constitutes a medical emergency should be determined by the patient in conversation with their doctor, and harm reduction should be the focus-not the last resort, she says. \"Physicians are being put in an impossible position where we have to choose between our freedom and livelihood and the oath we've taken to do no harm,\" said Moayedi. \"We should absolutely not be forced to wait to intervene once a life-threatening condition has occurred. Gaining clarity on these exceptions is really critical for physicians to feel protected when providing necessary care.\" F ollowing the reversal of Roe , the Biden administration has sought to ensure that hospitals and doctors receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds do not turn away patients in need of emergency abortion care, by arguing that federal law under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act supersedes state laws. The federal government recently cracked down on hospitals in Kansas and Missouri that placed a pregnant woman's life in jeopardy by refusing to offer emergency pregnancy termination after she went into premature labor. However, it's unclear how effective the administration will be at actually convincing physicians-who face prison time and hefty fines in some states-to intervene without fear. And in Texas, doctors face the added threat of the state's bounty-hunter law, which leaves them additionally vulnerable to civil suits.Moreover, hope that the federal government may come to the rescue was short-lived for Texans: In August, a Trump-appointed federal judge blocked the Biden administration's emergency abortion guidance, following a lawsuit filed by zealously anti-abortion Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton. In Texas, the state courts may now be the only avenue to address the glaring problem. In the first lawsuit of its kind in the wake of Roe 's reversal, Zurawski and four other Texas women who faced similar traumatic experiences filed suit in March to force the state to offer clarification on the scope of medical emergencies. The suit points to \"inconsistencies\" in the language of the laws, the use of non-medical terminology, and \"sloppy legislative\" drafting that has resulted in \"understandable confusion\" throughout the medical profession. \"The Texas abortion ban has been in effect much longer than other states with similar laws, so the harms have been collecting for a really long time in Texas,\" said Molly Duane, plaintiff attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights. \"Yet none of the politicians in power have done anything to clarify what the law means or provide guidance to medical professionals who desperately need it. Real lives are at risk, and we are asking the courts to step in since all the other branches of government have failed to do so.\" Suit hearings may begin later this summer, said Duane. In the meantime, Texans will continue to suffer as doctors and hospitals receive no guidance. Despite still reeling from the physical and \"paralyzing\" psychological trauma today including PTSD and depression, Zurawski, incredibly, considers herself among the \"lucky\" as she had the privilege of a supportive husband and employer who allowed her to \"grieve for three days\" as she \"waited to almost die.\" In her closing testimony before the Senate committee, she offered a grave warning. \"The barbaric restrictions that are being passed across the country are having real life implications on real people,\" she said. \"I may have been one of the first who was affected by the overturning of Roe in Texas, but I'm certainly not the last. More people have been-and will continue to be-harmed until we do something about it.\"\n\nWhile Zurawski needed an immediate pregnancy termination last August to protect her life-now acutely vulnerable to deadly complications-Texas imposed a full criminal \"trigger\" ban that month that carried punitive consequences for providers, including revocation of their license, a penalty of at least $100,000 per violation, and up to 99 years in prison. With no exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or severe fetal abnormality, the law holds a carve-out for medical emergencies, vaguely defined as \"risk of death or a substantial impairment of a major bodily function.\" Texas hospitals and doctors have been erring on the side of extreme caution to avoid liability by either failing to intervene completely or waiting until a patient's life is at immediate risk-or as one Texas physician put it, \" on death's door .\" Until she was ill enough for the hospital's ethics board to consider her life in danger, Zurawski's doctors' felt their hands were tied by the law. And traveling out of state for care wasn't a safe option for the 35-year-old Austin woman, who was instructed to stay within a 15-mile radius of the hospital: With the nearest clinic in Albuquerque, N.M., an 11-hour drive from home, developing an infection in the middle of vast swaths of the Texas desert could have meant certain death. In Texas today, residents must travel an average of nearly 500 miles to obtain care. \"I cannot adequately put into words the trauma and despair that comes with waiting to either lose your own life, your child's-or both,\" Zurawski testified before a congressional panel on reproductive rights in a post- Dobbs America in late April. \"For days, I was locked in this bizarre and avoidable hell. Would Willow's heart stop, or would I deteriorate to the brink of death?\" Related Article \"She Had a Heartbeat Too\": Waiting for One Dead Woman Amy Littlefield Her health quickly eroded. After developing a high fever and dangerously low blood pressure, Zurawski was rushed to the ICU and diagnosed with septic shock, a blood infection that can lead to death within an hour. Zurawski stabilized just enough to deliver her stillborn daughter, before crashing again and spending the next three days in the ICU where medical professionals battled to save her life. She is now left with emotional and physical scars, including the loss of one fallopian tube, that have made it difficult to have another child.

Nearly a year prior to the demise of Roe v. Wade , Texans began to feel the impact of severe abortion laws when the state's six-week \"bounty hunter\"-style ban took effect. Left in the wake of the state's draconian bans is a trail of horrific stories about the grisly and life-threatening medical complications -including sepsis, organ failure, and hemorrhaging-pregnant patients must face before receiving pregnancy termination intervention, underscoring the need for a repeal of the state's ban, or at the very least clarification of its medical emergency clause. In her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Zurawski shared her harrowing story and directly addressed Texas Republican US Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, saying they held the \"power\" to fix this. (Cornyn, while acknowledging that she should not have had to wait to receive abortion care, later minimized the traumatizing ordeal as a case of medical malpractice rather than an institutional problem directly inflicted by the anti-abortion laws, saying Zurawski had a \" good lawsuit \" on her hands.) Current Issue View our current issue \"I nearly died on their watch,\" she said with both senators absent from the room at the time. \"And furthermore, as a result of what happened to me, I may have been robbed of the opportunity to have children in the future.\" However, while the senators ardently support abortion restrictions by continually voting against bills that would legalize care, Texas legislators crafted the state's abortion law. The power to change the laws, at present, lies within the Texas Legislature, which convened its biannual session in January. Onlookers were cautiously optimistic that the Republican-dominated body would potentially consider measures that help clarify the nebulous maternal health exceptions, especially in light of the myriad medical studies and media reports highlighting the grave dangers they have posed for Texas patients. Last fall, Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott recognized that pregnant patients facing complications were not receiving timely intervention under the state's abortion bans, as the language in the law gave doctors pause. \"Something that really does need to be done [during the legislative session] is clarify what it means to protect the life of the mother,\" Abbott told a Dallas news station in October . \"There's been too many allegations that have been made about ways in which the lives of the mother are not being protected. That must be clarified. That's our focus.\" However, during the 2023 Texas legislative session-which concludes at the end of May, absent a special session-the GOP failed to introduce or pass any such legislation. Abbott did not make this a legislative priority, or even bring it up again publicly after getting reelected during the November midterm elections. (Requests for comment from his office were not returned.) Two Republican lawmakers who previously expressed support for creating exceptions in the laws for survivors of rape and incest also never pursued legislation to actually codify those changes. In fact, a handful of Texas Republicans recently stood with one of the largest anti-abortion groups in the state to reaffirm that they would not be pursuing these exceptions. \"Our laws are very clear,\" said Amy O'Donnell of Texas Alliance for Life. \"We have heard stories of doctors who say they need further clarification but we believe that that clarification should come...from various [hospital] boards.

Our leadership sees no reason to rectify this cruelty.\" Eckhardt points out that Texas Republicans are turning a blind eye to the fact that the majority of Texans-including those who identify as Republicans-support abortion access in cases of rape or incest, if there is a strong chance of a serious birth defect, or if the pregnant patient's life is seriously endangered, findings reaffirmed by a February poll from the Texas Politics Project. Missing the opportunity to offer this clarification today, the Texas Legislature is instead focusing on banning gender-affirming care for transgender children, pushing bills that would make it easier to remove district attorneys who have taken a stand against prosecuting abortion providers, and supporting ostensible \"family planning\" services like infusing a program that includes crisis pregnancy centers-riddled with transparency and accountability problems -with an unprecedented $200 million. The inaction is especially frustrating for advocates because the state suffers from a crisis of preventable maternal deaths , which is expected to worsen under these laws. All the while, a climate of fear perpetuated by the consequences of these laws grows in Texas, where abusers appear empowered to inflict harm on their abortion-seeking partners. Earlier this year, a man-accused of \" serial \" abusive behavior in a countersuit- filed a \"wrongful death\" lawsuit against his ex-wife's friends for allegedly helping her access medication abortion. And just last week, a Texas man choked and then fatally shot his girlfriend in a Dallas parking lot after she returned from obtaining an abortion in Colorado. Dr. Ghazaleh Moayedi, a Texas ob-gyn and board member with Physicians for Reproductive Health, stresses that hospitals and doctors are overinterpreting the law's exceptions to avoid risk, leaving patients in complicated medical situations that require \"incredible resources\" amid a weak health care infrastructure and physician shortage . In a state that holds the highest percentage of uninsured residents of reproductive age, some 159 Texas counties have no ob-gyn. What constitutes a medical emergency should be determined by the patient in conversation with their doctor, and harm reduction should be the focus-not the last resort, she says. \"Physicians are being put in an impossible position where we have to choose between our freedom and livelihood and the oath we've taken to do no harm,\" said Moayedi. \"We should absolutely not be forced to wait to intervene once a life-threatening condition has occurred. Gaining clarity on these exceptions is really critical for physicians to feel protected when providing necessary care.\" F ollowing the reversal of Roe , the Biden administration has sought to ensure that hospitals and doctors receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds do not turn away patients in need of emergency abortion care, by arguing that federal law under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act supersedes state laws. The federal government recently cracked down on hospitals in Kansas and Missouri that placed a pregnant woman's life in jeopardy by refusing to offer emergency pregnancy termination after she went into premature labor. However, it's unclear how effective the administration will be at actually convincing physicians-who face prison time and hefty fines in some states-to intervene without fear. And in Texas, doctors face the added threat of the state's bounty-hunter law, which leaves them additionally vulnerable to civil suits.Moreover, hope that the federal government may come to the rescue was short-lived for Texans: In August, a Trump-appointed federal judge blocked the Biden administration's emergency abortion guidance, following a lawsuit filed by zealously anti-abortion Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton. In Texas, the state courts may now be the only avenue to address the glaring problem. In the first lawsuit of its kind in the wake of Roe 's reversal, Zurawski and four other Texas women who faced similar traumatic experiences filed suit in March to force the state to offer clarification on the scope of medical emergencies. The suit points to \"inconsistencies\" in the language of the laws, the use of non-medical terminology, and \"sloppy legislative\" drafting that has resulted in \"understandable confusion\" throughout the medical profession. \"The Texas abortion ban has been in effect much longer than other states with similar laws, so the harms have been collecting for a really long time in Texas,\" said Molly Duane, plaintiff attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights. \"Yet none of the politicians in power have done anything to clarify what the law means or provide guidance to medical professionals who desperately need it. Real lives are at risk, and we are asking the courts to step in since all the other branches of government have failed to do so.\" Suit hearings may begin later this summer, said Duane. In the meantime, Texans will continue to suffer as doctors and hospitals receive no guidance. Despite still reeling from the physical and \"paralyzing\" psychological trauma today including PTSD and depression, Zurawski, incredibly, considers herself among the \"lucky\" as she had the privilege of a supportive husband and employer who allowed her to \"grieve for three days\" as she \"waited to almost die.\" In her closing testimony before the Senate committee, she offered a grave warning. \"The barbaric restrictions that are being passed across the country are having real life implications on real people,\" she said. \"I may have been one of the first who was affected by the overturning of Roe in Texas, but I'm certainly not the last. More people have been-and will continue to be-harmed until we do something about it.\"\n\nAmy Littlefield\n\nHer health quickly eroded. After developing a high fever and dangerously low blood pressure, Zurawski was rushed to the ICU and diagnosed with septic shock, a blood infection that can lead to death within an hour. Zurawski stabilized just enough to deliver her stillborn daughter, before crashing again and spending the next three days in the ICU where medical professionals battled to save her life. She is now left with emotional and physical scars, including the loss of one fallopian tube, that have made it difficult to have another child.

Nearly a year prior to the demise of Roe v. Wade , Texans began to feel the impact of severe abortion laws when the state's six-week \"bounty hunter\"-style ban took effect. Left in the wake of the state's draconian bans is a trail of horrific stories about the grisly and life-threatening medical complications -including sepsis, organ failure, and hemorrhaging-pregnant patients must face before receiving pregnancy termination intervention, underscoring the need for a repeal of the state's ban, or at the very least clarification of its medical emergency clause. In her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Zurawski shared her harrowing story and directly addressed Texas Republican US Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, saying they held the \"power\" to fix this. (Cornyn, while acknowledging that she should not have had to wait to receive abortion care, later minimized the traumatizing ordeal as a case of medical malpractice rather than an institutional problem directly inflicted by the anti-abortion laws, saying Zurawski had a \" good lawsuit \" on her hands.) Current Issue View our current issue \"I nearly died on their watch,\" she said with both senators absent from the room at the time. \"And furthermore, as a result of what happened to me, I may have been robbed of the opportunity to have children in the future.\" However, while the senators ardently support abortion restrictions by continually voting against bills that would legalize care, Texas legislators crafted the state's abortion law. The power to change the laws, at present, lies within the Texas Legislature, which convened its biannual session in January. Onlookers were cautiously optimistic that the Republican-dominated body would potentially consider measures that help clarify the nebulous maternal health exceptions, especially in light of the myriad medical studies and media reports highlighting the grave dangers they have posed for Texas patients. Last fall, Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott recognized that pregnant patients facing complications were not receiving timely intervention under the state's abortion bans, as the language in the law gave doctors pause. \"Something that really does need to be done [during the legislative session] is clarify what it means to protect the life of the mother,\" Abbott told a Dallas news station in October . \"There's been too many allegations that have been made about ways in which the lives of the mother are not being protected. That must be clarified. That's our focus.\" However, during the 2023 Texas legislative session-which concludes at the end of May, absent a special session-the GOP failed to introduce or pass any such legislation. Abbott did not make this a legislative priority, or even bring it up again publicly after getting reelected during the November midterm elections. (Requests for comment from his office were not returned.) Two Republican lawmakers who previously expressed support for creating exceptions in the laws for survivors of rape and incest also never pursued legislation to actually codify those changes. In fact, a handful of Texas Republicans recently stood with one of the largest anti-abortion groups in the state to reaffirm that they would not be pursuing these exceptions. \"Our laws are very clear,\" said Amy O'Donnell of Texas Alliance for Life. \"We have heard stories of doctors who say they need further clarification but we believe that that clarification should come...from various [hospital] boards. The laws do not need to be changed.\" Meanwhile, nearly a dozen bills filed by Democrats that would offer exceptions haven't even been given committee hearings. For instance, Austin-based state Senator Sarah Eckhardt offered a proposal to ensure that doctors prioritize the life of the pregnant patient over that of the fetus. The bill and its House counterpart have sat idle since March. \"I wish I didn't need to file this kind of bill, meant to help protect the life of the mother,\" said Eckhardt. \"But the willful ignorance of reproductive health facts by those who supported these laws have led us here.

The bill and its House counterpart have sat idle since March. \"I wish I didn't need to file this kind of bill, meant to help protect the life of the mother,\" said Eckhardt. \"But the willful ignorance of reproductive health facts by those who supported these laws have led us here. Women in Texas are suffering horrible consequences and yet no action is being taken on these bills. Our leadership sees no reason to rectify this cruelty.\" Eckhardt points out that Texas Republicans are turning a blind eye to the fact that the majority of Texans-including those who identify as Republicans-support abortion access in cases of rape or incest, if there is a strong chance of a serious birth defect, or if the pregnant patient's life is seriously endangered, findings reaffirmed by a February poll from the Texas Politics Project. Missing the opportunity to offer this clarification today, the Texas Legislature is instead focusing on banning gender-affirming care for transgender children, pushing bills that would make it easier to remove district attorneys who have taken a stand against prosecuting abortion providers, and supporting ostensible \"family planning\" services like infusing a program that includes crisis pregnancy centers-riddled with transparency and accountability problems -with an unprecedented $200 million. The inaction is especially frustrating for advocates because the state suffers from a crisis of preventable maternal deaths , which is expected to worsen under these laws. All the while, a climate of fear perpetuated by the consequences of these laws grows in Texas, where abusers appear empowered to inflict harm on their abortion-seeking partners. Earlier this year, a man-accused of \" serial \" abusive behavior in a countersuit- filed a \"wrongful death\" lawsuit against his ex-wife's friends for allegedly helping her access medication abortion. And just last week, a Texas man choked and then fatally shot his girlfriend in a Dallas parking lot after she returned from obtaining an abortion in Colorado. Dr. Ghazaleh Moayedi, a Texas ob-gyn and board member with Physicians for Reproductive Health, stresses that hospitals and doctors are overinterpreting the law's exceptions to avoid risk, leaving patients in complicated medical situations that require \"incredible resources\" amid a weak health care infrastructure and physician shortage . In a state that holds the highest percentage of uninsured residents of reproductive age, some 159 Texas counties have no ob-gyn. What constitutes a medical emergency should be determined by the patient in conversation with their doctor, and harm reduction should be the focus-not the last resort, she says. \"Physicians are being put in an impossible position where we have to choose between our freedom and livelihood and the oath we've taken to do no harm,\" said Moayedi. \"We should absolutely not be forced to wait to intervene once a life-threatening condition has occurred. Gaining clarity on these exceptions is really critical for physicians to feel protected when providing necessary care.\" F ollowing the reversal of Roe , the Biden administration has sought to ensure that hospitals and doctors receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds do not turn away patients in need of emergency abortion care, by arguing that federal law under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act supersedes state laws. The federal government recently cracked down on hospitals in Kansas and Missouri that placed a pregnant woman's life in jeopardy by refusing to offer emergency pregnancy termination after she went into premature labor. However, it's unclear how effective the administration will be at actually convincing physicians-who face prison time and hefty fines in some states-to intervene without fear. And in Texas, doctors face the added threat of the state's bounty-hunter law, which leaves them additionally vulnerable to civil suits.Moreover, hope that the federal government may come to the rescue was short-lived for Texans: In August, a Trump-appointed federal judge blocked the Biden administration's emergency abortion guidance, following a lawsuit filed by zealously anti-abortion Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton. In Texas, the state courts may now be the only avenue to address the glaring problem. In the first lawsuit of its kind in the wake of Roe 's reversal, Zurawski and four other Texas women who faced similar traumatic experiences filed suit in March to force the state to offer clarification on the scope of medical emergencies. The suit points to \"inconsistencies\" in the language of the laws, the use of non-medical terminology, and \"sloppy legislative\" drafting that has resulted in \"understandable confusion\" throughout the medical profession. \"The Texas abortion ban has been in effect much longer than other states with similar laws, so the harms have been collecting for a really long time in Texas,\" said Molly Duane, plaintiff attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights. \"Yet none of the politicians in power have done anything to clarify what the law means or provide guidance to medical professionals who desperately need it. Real lives are at risk, and we are asking the courts to step in since all the other branches of government have failed to do so.\" Suit hearings may begin later this summer, said Duane. In the meantime, Texans will continue to suffer as doctors and hospitals receive no guidance. Despite still reeling from the physical and \"paralyzing\" psychological trauma today including PTSD and depression, Zurawski, incredibly, considers herself among the \"lucky\" as she had the privilege of a supportive husband and employer who allowed her to \"grieve for three days\" as she \"waited to almost die.\" In her closing testimony before the Senate committee, she offered a grave warning. \"The barbaric restrictions that are being passed across the country are having real life implications on real people,\" she said. \"I may have been one of the first who was affected by the overturning of Roe in Texas, but I'm certainly not the last. More people have been-and will continue to be-harmed until we do something about it.\"\n\nHowever, while the senators ardently support abortion restrictions by continually voting against bills that would legalize care, Texas legislators crafted the state's abortion law. The power to change the laws, at present, lies within the Texas Legislature, which convened its biannual session in January. Onlookers were cautiously optimistic that the Republican-dominated body would potentially consider measures that help clarify the nebulous maternal health exceptions, especially in light of the myriad medical studies and media reports highlighting the grave dangers they have posed for Texas patients. Last fall, Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott recognized that pregnant patients facing complications were not receiving timely intervention under the state's abortion bans, as the language in the law gave doctors pause. \"Something that really does need to be done [during the legislative session] is clarify what it means to protect the life of the mother,\" Abbott told a Dallas news station in October . \"There's been too many allegations that have been made about ways in which the lives of the mother are not being protected. That must be clarified. That's our focus.\" However, during the 2023 Texas legislative session-which concludes at the end of May, absent a special session-the GOP failed to introduce or pass any such legislation. Abbott did not make this a legislative priority, or even bring it up again publicly after getting reelected during the November midterm elections. (Requests for comment from his office were not returned.) Two Republican lawmakers who previously expressed support for creating exceptions in the laws for survivors of rape and incest also never pursued legislation to actually codify those changes. In fact, a handful of Texas Republicans recently stood with one of the largest anti-abortion groups in the state to reaffirm that they would not be pursuing these exceptions. \"Our laws are very clear,\" said Amy O'Donnell of Texas Alliance for Life. \"We have heard stories of doctors who say they need further clarification but we believe that that clarification should come...from various [hospital] boards. The laws do not need to be changed.\" Meanwhile, nearly a dozen bills filed by Democrats that would offer exceptions haven't even been given committee hearings.

And in Texas, doctors face the added threat of the state's bounty-hunter law, which leaves them additionally vulnerable to civil suits.Moreover, hope that the federal government may come to the rescue was short-lived for Texans: In August, a Trump-appointed federal judge blocked the Biden administration's emergency abortion guidance, following a lawsuit filed by zealously anti-abortion Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton. In Texas, the state courts may now be the only avenue to address the glaring problem. In the first lawsuit of its kind in the wake of Roe 's reversal, Zurawski and four other Texas women who faced similar traumatic experiences filed suit in March to force the state to offer clarification on the scope of medical emergencies. The suit points to \"inconsistencies\" in the language of the laws, the use of non-medical terminology, and \"sloppy legislative\" drafting that has resulted in \"understandable confusion\" throughout the medical profession. \"The Texas abortion ban has been in effect much longer than other states with similar laws, so the harms have been collecting for a really long time in Texas,\" said Molly Duane, plaintiff attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights. \"Yet none of the politicians in power have done anything to clarify what the law means or provide guidance to medical professionals who desperately need it. Real lives are at risk, and we are asking the courts to step in since all the other branches of government have failed to do so.\" Suit hearings may begin later this summer, said Duane. In the meantime, Texans will continue to suffer as doctors and hospitals receive no guidance. Despite still reeling from the physical and \"paralyzing\" psychological trauma today including PTSD and depression, Zurawski, incredibly, considers herself among the \"lucky\" as she had the privilege of a supportive husband and employer who allowed her to \"grieve for three days\" as she \"waited to almost die.\" In her closing testimony before the Senate committee, she offered a grave warning. \"The barbaric restrictions that are being passed across the country are having real life implications on real people,\" she said. \"I may have been one of the first who was affected by the overturning of Roe in Texas, but I'm certainly not the last. More people have been-and will continue to be-harmed until we do something about it.\"\n\nEckhardt points out that Texas Republicans are turning a blind eye to the fact that the majority of Texans-including those who identify as Republicans-support abortion access in cases of rape or incest, if there is a strong chance of a serious birth defect, or if the pregnant patient's life is seriously endangered, findings reaffirmed by a February poll from the Texas Politics Project. Missing the opportunity to offer this clarification today, the Texas Legislature is instead focusing on banning gender-affirming care for transgender children, pushing bills that would make it easier to remove district attorneys who have taken a stand against prosecuting abortion providers, and supporting ostensible \"family planning\" services like infusing a program that includes crisis pregnancy centers-riddled with transparency and accountability problems -with an unprecedented $200 million. The inaction is especially frustrating for advocates because the state suffers from a crisis of preventable maternal deaths , which is expected to worsen under these laws. All the while, a climate of fear perpetuated by the consequences of these laws grows in Texas, where abusers appear empowered to inflict harm on their abortion-seeking partners. Earlier this year, a man-accused of \" serial \" abusive behavior in a countersuit- filed a \"wrongful death\" lawsuit against his ex-wife's friends for allegedly helping her access medication abortion. And just last week, a Texas man choked and then fatally shot his girlfriend in a Dallas parking lot after she returned from obtaining an abortion in Colorado. Dr. Ghazaleh Moayedi, a Texas ob-gyn and board member with Physicians for Reproductive Health, stresses that hospitals and doctors are overinterpreting the law's exceptions to avoid risk, leaving patients in complicated medical situations that require \"incredible resources\" amid a weak health care infrastructure and physician shortage . In a state that holds the highest percentage of uninsured residents of reproductive age, some 159 Texas counties have no ob-gyn. What constitutes a medical emergency should be determined by the patient in conversation with their doctor, and harm reduction should be the focus-not the last resort, she says. \"Physicians are being put in an impossible position where we have to choose between our freedom and livelihood and the oath we've taken to do no harm,\" said Moayedi. \"We should absolutely not be forced to wait to intervene once a life-threatening condition has occurred. Gaining clarity on these exceptions is really critical for physicians to feel protected when providing necessary care.\" F ollowing the reversal of Roe , the Biden administration has sought to ensure that hospitals and doctors receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds do not turn away patients in need of emergency abortion care, by arguing that federal law under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act supersedes state laws.

They're framing the even Bigger Lie that Trump and his cabal hope to tell about the next presidential election. If they succeed, Republicans will be positioned to do in 2024 what they could not do in 2020: overturn an election. Even before voters began to cast ballots that decided last year's presidential race in favor of Democrat Joe Biden, Trump was saying , \"The only way we're going to lose this election is if the election is rigged.\" Trump knew that wasn't the case, and so did Republicans who echoed his claim. After four years of racism, xenophobia, scandal, and chaos, the president's failed response to the coronavirus pandemic had sealed his fate. He was going to lose. The point of the talk about a \"rigged\" election was to prepare his supporters to refuse to accept the results, which Trump's legal team planned to challenge in the courts, state legislatures, and Congress. Trump was successful in getting gullible Republicans to embrace the Big Lie- 53 percent of them now believe the former president actually won the 2020 election and is the legitimate leader of the country. But he and his lawyers were notably unsuccessful in getting judges-at the federal, state, and local levels-to overturn an election that the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency determined to have been \" the most secure in American history .\" Dozens of judges rejected cases brought by Trump's lawyers. Among the jurists who said no to the disgraced former president were Republican appointees to the federal bench and elected Republican judges in the states. Even jurists who it was feared would look for an avenue to support Trump's claims refused to do so, to the immense frustration of Rudy Giuliani and the other lawyers for the ousted president. The judges followed the law, which has historically set a high bar for challenging election results. But what if the law made it easier to mount such challenges? What if the law gave judges leeway to overturn elections based on partisan desires as opposed to proven facts? That's the prospect Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Republican legislators in the state have put on the table with their sweeping proposal to rewrite election laws in response to Trump's ranting about voter fraud. The Texas legislation has gained considerable attention for voter suppression elements that are so draconian that US Representative Colin Allred (D-Tex.) says, \"This isn't legislation. It's discrimination.\" But there is more to the Republican agenda in Texas than the usual scheming to erect barriers to voter participation by Blacks, Hispanics, students, and others who might vote Democratic. What is especially jarring is a section of the plan to make it dramatically easier for a Texas judge to overturn an election result to which Republican \"poll watchers\"-or former presidents-object.

But under the law that Republican legislators plan to enact-in a special session that will be required after Texas Democratic legislators walked out of the regular session, denying leaders of the Republican-controlled state House a quorum-Texas would dumb down the burden of proof. The new \"evidentiary standard\" outlined in the proposed Texas law would allow a partisan who is contesting an election result to \" prove \" their allegation of fraud \"by a preponderance of the evidence.\" In addition to this far lower standard, the legislation declares that \"if the number of votes illegally cast in the election is equal to or greater than the number of votes necessary to change the outcome of an election, the court may declare the outcome of the election void without attempting to determine how individual voters voted.\" Read that last phrase again: \"the court may declare the outcome of the election void without attempting to determine how individual voters voted.\" What that means is that, on the basis of claims by partisan poll watchers that they saw what they thought to be wrongdoing, a partisan judge could cancel an election result without conducting the sort of review that is necessary to confirm that the alleged fraud actually influenced the result. Marc Elias, a Democratic lawyer who is broadly recognized as one of the nation's top experts in election law, reviewed the text of the Texas legislation and determined that if it were enacted, \"an election challenger [would] no longer [be] required to show that fraudulent votes resulted in a win.\" Elias says , \"When combined with the rest of Texas law, this bill will make Texas the easiest state in which to overturn an election via post-election contest.\" The fight to block this invitation to a constitutional crisis will play out in Texas in coming weeks, as Abbott seeks to call the legislature back for a special session, and as legislative Democrats attempt to identify new tactics for upending the Republicans. Trump will cheer Abbott on, and Republicans in other states will notice. It would be absurd to imagine that the Texas scheme for making it easier to overturn election results-in 2022 and 2024-will not be exported to other battleground states, such as Georgia, Florida, and Arizona, where Republican governors and legislatures have already been advancing Big Lie strategies for reworking election laws. If enough states open up these new avenues for canceling election results, what Americans saw in the fall of 2020, and on January 6, 2021, will come to be understood as the prelude to a far more serious threat to the republic. It is impossible to overstate the urgency of the moment. Republicans are no longer gambling on voter suppression to give them the election results they covet; they are now writing laws that open the way for overturning results that go against them. There is still time to push back against Republican overreach, as Democratic legislators in Texas have been doing. Elias and his team will battle in the courts. But that is an arduous and uncertain task. \"We need help,\" says the lawyer, who is urging Senate Democrats to approve the voting rights and election integrity protections contained in HR 1/S 1, the For the People Act. This is an urgent moment, explains Elias. \"Our democracy is at stake.\"\n\nIf they succeed, Republicans will be positioned to do in 2024 what they could not do in 2020: overturn an election. Even before voters began to cast ballots that decided last year's presidential race in favor of Democrat Joe Biden, Trump was saying , \"The only way we're going to lose this election is if the election is rigged.\" Trump knew that wasn't the case, and so did Republicans who echoed his claim. After four years of racism, xenophobia, scandal, and chaos, the president's failed response to the coronavirus pandemic had sealed his fate. He was going to lose. The point of the talk about a \"rigged\" election was to prepare his supporters to refuse to accept the results, which Trump's legal team planned to challenge in the courts, state legislatures, and Congress. Trump was successful in getting gullible Republicans to embrace the Big Lie- 53 percent of them now believe the former president actually won the 2020 election and is the legitimate leader of the country. But he and his lawyers were notably unsuccessful in getting judges-at the federal, state, and local levels-to overturn an election that the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency determined to have been \" the most secure in American history .\" Dozens of judges rejected cases brought by Trump's lawyers. Among the jurists who said no to the disgraced former president were Republican appointees to the federal bench and elected Republican judges in the states. Even jurists who it was feared would look for an avenue to support Trump's claims refused to do so, to the immense frustration of Rudy Giuliani and the other lawyers for the ousted president. The judges followed the law, which has historically set a high bar for challenging election results. But what if the law made it easier to mount such challenges? What if the law gave judges leeway to overturn elections based on partisan desires as opposed to proven facts? That's the prospect Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Republican legislators in the state have put on the table with their sweeping proposal to rewrite election laws in response to Trump's ranting about voter fraud. The Texas legislation has gained considerable attention for voter suppression elements that are so draconian that US Representative Colin Allred (D-Tex.) says, \"This isn't legislation. It's discrimination.\" But there is more to the Republican agenda in Texas than the usual scheming to erect barriers to voter participation by Blacks, Hispanics, students, and others who might vote Democratic. What is especially jarring is a section of the plan to make it dramatically easier for a Texas judge to overturn an election result to which Republican \"poll watchers\"-or former presidents-object.

But under the law that Republican legislators plan to enact-in a special session that will be required after Texas Democratic legislators walked out of the regular session, denying leaders of the Republican-controlled state House a quorum-Texas would dumb down the burden of proof. The new \"evidentiary standard\" outlined in the proposed Texas law would allow a partisan who is contesting an election result to \" prove \" their allegation of fraud \"by a preponderance of the evidence.\" In addition to this far lower standard, the legislation declares that \"if the number of votes illegally cast in the election is equal to or greater than the number of votes necessary to change the outcome of an election, the court may declare the outcome of the election void without attempting to determine how individual voters voted.\" Read that last phrase again: \"the court may declare the outcome of the election void without attempting to determine how individual voters voted.\" What that means is that, on the basis of claims by partisan poll watchers that they saw what they thought to be wrongdoing, a partisan judge could cancel an election result without conducting the sort of review that is necessary to confirm that the alleged fraud actually influenced the result. Marc Elias, a Democratic lawyer who is broadly recognized as one of the nation's top experts in election law, reviewed the text of the Texas legislation and determined that if it were enacted, \"an election challenger [would] no longer [be] required to show that fraudulent votes resulted in a win.\" Elias says , \"When combined with the rest of Texas law, this bill will make Texas the easiest state in which to overturn an election via post-election contest.\" The fight to block this invitation to a constitutional crisis will play out in Texas in coming weeks, as Abbott seeks to call the legislature back for a special session, and as legislative Democrats attempt to identify new tactics for upending the Republicans. Trump will cheer Abbott on, and Republicans in other states will notice. It would be absurd to imagine that the Texas scheme for making it easier to overturn election results-in 2022 and 2024-will not be exported to other battleground states, such as Georgia, Florida, and Arizona, where Republican governors and legislatures have already been advancing Big Lie strategies for reworking election laws. If enough states open up these new avenues for canceling election results, what Americans saw in the fall of 2020, and on January 6, 2021, will come to be understood as the prelude to a far more serious threat to the republic. It is impossible to overstate the urgency of the moment. Republicans are no longer gambling on voter suppression to give them the election results they covet; they are now writing laws that open the way for overturning results that go against them.

Officials in the Oregon city are hoping the boycott spreads. \"We urge other leaders and elected bodies around the nation to join us in condemning the actions of the Texas state government,\" says Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler. Undoubtedly, Wheeler will get takers. But don't imagine that Republicans in Texas, or nationally, will abandon the course they have charted. What's happening in Texas is about much more than the fight over reproductive rights. The state is implementing a template for the authoritarian future Republicans propose for all Americans. The recent enactment of a right-wing wish list of extreme measures by the state's legislature-denying a pregnant person's rights to choose, limiting what's taught in schools about racism, permitting people to carry unlicensed firearms in public-is one piece of an ambitious GOP strategy going into the 2022 midterm elections. The other piece involves the restrictions on voting rights that Republican Governor Greg Abbott signed Tuesday . Republicans have marginalized their party's popular appeal. Yet gerrymandering and voter suppression schemes have kept the GOP competitive nationally and in most states. The party has grown comfortable with pluralities as opposed to majorities. Republicans are satisfied with minority rule-as long as their minority is ruling. In Texas, where Democrats have gained ground in recent years, it is now abundantly clear that the Republican strategy is to make it harder for probable Democratic voters to cast ballots while, at the same time, advancing a legislative agenda designed to encourage maximum turnout by voters who make up their party's social-conservative base. More than 40 years ago, Republican political operative Paul Weyrich told a right-wing gathering, \"I don't want everybody to vote. Elections are not won by a majority of people. They never have been from the beginning of our country, and they are not now. As a matter of fact, our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down.\" Weyrich died in 2008, but his vision lives on. Indeed, it animates the Republican strategy in Texas, where the party has won every statewide election since 1994. Current Issue View our current issue I n 2018, Democrat Beto O'Rourke won more than 48 percent of the vote in his challenge to Republican Senator Ted Cruz, and Democratic newcomer Justin Nelson won more than 47 percent in his bid for the critical post of attorney general. Democrats made significant gains in state legislative races that year and picked up several US House seats. In 2018, Texas Monthly observed , \"The [O'Rourke-Cruz] contest ended in a narrow loss that felt like a win to Democrats, and the results down-ballot gave the party paths to expand the electoral map and perhaps even take control of the state House.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Texas Republicans got the wake-up call. Their reaction was to go full Weyrich. Instead of trying to expand their appeal, they decided to narrow it with what The Dallas Morning News described as a plan to \"steamroll Democrats to pass their conservative agenda.\" Despite widespread protests and a high-profile decision by Democratic legislators to leave the state in order to deny the legislature a quorum, Republicans have now succeeded in making Texas what the News refers to as \"the most conservative one-party state in America.\" In a state that is rapidly becoming more diverse, more liberal on most issues, and a good deal more Democratic-in 2020, Joe Biden won the highest percentage of the vote for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter-the Republicans' strategy would seem misguided. And it would be, if Abbott and his legislative allies intended to compete in a fair fight. But they don't. The package of voting rights restrictions that the governor has approved includes a ban on drive-through voting and 24-hour voting, which had been used to increase turnout (even during the coronavirus pandemic) in Houston's Harris County. It also expands voter ID requirements, limits early voting hours, and places new restrictions on mail-in voting. State Representative John Bucy, an Austin Democrat, notes that the bill also outlines new avenues for criminally prosecuting voters who make mistakes. \"There are increased crimes and penalties throughout this bill just for participating in the process,\" says Bucy , \"and there is not explanation as to why.\" Voting rights advocates fear the threat of prosecution will be used to intimidate potential voters, and to undermine efforts to boost turnout among communities of color, students, and other groups that might be more likely to vote Democratic. At the same time, the law empowers partisan poll watchers to aggressively monitor and challenge voting procedures-effectively codifying the approach taken by Donald Trump and his allies during and after the 2020 presidential election. T exas Republicans are not outliers; they are trendsetters. Republicans in other states are going all in on voter suppression, as part of a national strategy in anticipation of 2o22 midterm elections that could expand GOP control of statehouses and restore GOP control of Congress. \"While laws that make it more taxing to vote are not new, the current onslaught of voting restrictions and changes to how elections will be administered is not something we've grappled with on this scale,\" notes a FiveThirtyEight analysis from May. \"Additionally, there is their nakedly partisan origins-nearly 90 percent of the voting laws proposed or enacted in 2021 were sponsored primarily or entirely by Republican legislators-and the fact that these laws are likely to have a greater impact on Black and brown voters , who are less likely to vote Republican.\" Related Articles Will the Biden Administration Get Bolder on Improving Abortion Access? Amy Littlefield \"Roe v. Wade\" Will Functionally Cease to Exist in Texas Elie Mystal and The Nation If \"Roe v. Wade\" Is Overturned, the Future Will Be Worse Than the Past Katha Pollitt The FiveThirtyEight analysis suggests that making it harder to vote could have a blowback effect for Republicans, who even in a constricted democracy need to turn out their voters. But that's where these new limits on abortion rights, the effort to stir backlash against teaching the legacies of slavery, and expanding gun rights come in. The new laws in Texas are \"red meat\" for the Republican base. GOP legislators are creating controversies and responding to them with an eye toward ginning up turnout by their base voters. Republicans in other states are taking notice. In addition to the push to restricts voting rights, they're ramping up fights over abortion, guns, and Critical Race Theory. The Associated Press reports that a \"network of conservative groups with ties to major Republican donors and party-aligned think tanks is quietly lending firepower to local activists engaged in culture war fights in schools across the country.\" Comparing the approach to that of the Tea Party in the run-up to the 2010 midterm elections, conservative lawyer Dan Lennington openly admits , \"These are ingredients for having an impact on future elections.\" Texas Republicans are grabbing the headlines. But something much bigger is going on. Restricting voting rights for those who might cast Democratic ballots in 2022 while at the same time stoking outrage among social conservatives who are likely to cast Republican ballots is a cruel, if politically potent, strategy. Paul Weyrich only imagined a scenario where Republicans could rule without broad support. Forty years on, Lone Star Republicans have introduced the template for making Weyrich's scenario a reality-a template that will not stay in Teaxs.\n\nUndoubtedly, Wheeler will get takers.

Paul Weyrich only imagined a scenario where Republicans could rule without broad support. Forty years on, Lone Star Republicans have introduced the template for making Weyrich's scenario a reality-a template that will not stay in Teaxs.\n\nThe state is implementing a template for the authoritarian future Republicans propose for all Americans. The recent enactment of a right-wing wish list of extreme measures by the state's legislature-denying a pregnant person's rights to choose, limiting what's taught in schools about racism, permitting people to carry unlicensed firearms in public-is one piece of an ambitious GOP strategy going into the 2022 midterm elections. The other piece involves the restrictions on voting rights that Republican Governor Greg Abbott signed Tuesday . Republicans have marginalized their party's popular appeal. Yet gerrymandering and voter suppression schemes have kept the GOP competitive nationally and in most states. The party has grown comfortable with pluralities as opposed to majorities. Republicans are satisfied with minority rule-as long as their minority is ruling. In Texas, where Democrats have gained ground in recent years, it is now abundantly clear that the Republican strategy is to make it harder for probable Democratic voters to cast ballots while, at the same time, advancing a legislative agenda designed to encourage maximum turnout by voters who make up their party's social-conservative base. More than 40 years ago, Republican political operative Paul Weyrich told a right-wing gathering, \"I don't want everybody to vote. Elections are not won by a majority of people. They never have been from the beginning of our country, and they are not now. As a matter of fact, our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down.\" Weyrich died in 2008, but his vision lives on. Indeed, it animates the Republican strategy in Texas, where the party has won every statewide election since 1994.

And it would be, if Abbott and his legislative allies intended to compete in a fair fight. But they don't. The package of voting rights restrictions that the governor has approved includes a ban on drive-through voting and 24-hour voting, which had been used to increase turnout (even during the coronavirus pandemic) in Houston's Harris County. It also expands voter ID requirements, limits early voting hours, and places new restrictions on mail-in voting. State Representative John Bucy, an Austin Democrat, notes that the bill also outlines new avenues for criminally prosecuting voters who make mistakes. \"There are increased crimes and penalties throughout this bill just for participating in the process,\" says Bucy , \"and there is not explanation as to why.\" Voting rights advocates fear the threat of prosecution will be used to intimidate potential voters, and to undermine efforts to boost turnout among communities of color, students, and other groups that might be more likely to vote Democratic.

In 2018, Texas Monthly observed , \"The [O'Rourke-Cruz] contest ended in a narrow loss that felt like a win to Democrats, and the results down-ballot gave the party paths to expand the electoral map and perhaps even take control of the state House.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Texas Republicans got the wake-up call.

(Photo by Chandan Khanna / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nTexas gubernatorial contests have been unbalanced for decades, as increasingly reactionary Republicans have elbowed their way onto center stage-drawing all the energy and attention to themselves-while Democrats have struggled to get off the sidelines. Even when they have had dynamic candidates, like Wendy Davis in 2014, Democrats have had a hard time building the coalitions that are necessary to compete with a Republican machine that has so dominated the ballot that no Democratic gubernatorial contender since 1994 has won more than 43 percent of the vote. But this year could be different. Beto O'Rourke-who in his 2018 bid for the US Senate won more than 48 percent of the vote and gave Republican Senator Ted Cruz a major scare-is running a no-holds-barred campaign that is taking the risks that grab attention and just might rewrite the narrative of Texas politics. In a state where Democrats have been knocked down again and again, O'Rourke is on his feet and ready for a fight. That was obvious Wednesday, when the Democratic nominee for governor interrupted a media event organized by Governor Greg Abbott and his cronies, where the fierce foes of gun control had hoped to fool Texans into thinking they were interested in taking action to prevent more horrors like Tuesday's massacre of 19 school children and two teachers in the city of Uvalde. More From John Nichols The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" April 25, 2025 The Pope Who Decried the Savage Inequalities of Billionaire-Class Capitalism April 21, 2025 A Pope Who Prays for Palestine April 20, 2025 In the midst of the carefully choreographed event, O'Rourke strode to the front of the room before Abbott, Cruz, and their Republican apologists, and calmly explained that the shooting at Robb Elementary School was \"totally predictable\" and \"preventable.\" \"You are doing nothing,\" O'Rourke declared. \"You are offering up nothing.\" As the governor's henchmen shouted obscenities, and demanded that O'Rourke be removed, the former representative from El Paso spoke the truth that could not be denied. Pointing at the governor, the ardent supporter of measures to address gun violence said, \"This is on you until you choose to do something different. This will continue to happen. Somebody needs to stand up for the children of this state or they will continue to be killed just like they were killed in Uvalde yesterday.\" The peddlers of political platitudes grew agitated. \"Sit down and don't play this stunt,\" cried Cruz. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick shouted, \"You're out of line and an embarrassment.\" The mayor of Uvalde, a right-wing Republican , lost control and started screaming that O'Rourke was \"a sick son of a bitch\" who wanted \"to make a political issue\" of the gun violence that has plagued Texas -a state that saw 27 people die in a mass shooting in 2017 at a Sutherland Springs Baptist Church and 23 die after a 2019 mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso. At the same time, cries of \"Let him speak!\" erupted from the room. Amid the chaos, O'Rourke was making a point that a great many Texans know to be true. That is why parents of the murdered children invited O'Rourke into their homes on Wednesday. That is why members of the community welcomed him at a vigil for the dead. O'Rourke explained to reporters after he left why he interrupted the governor's media event: \"After every one of these [mass shootings, Abbott] holds a press conference just like this. And I wish to hell when he came to El Paso that someone would have stood up and held him to account and confronted him and shocked the conscience of this state into doing something. Because if we do nothing, we will continue to see this. Year after year, school after school, kid after kid. This is on all of us, every single one of us to do something.\" Democrats have struggled for decades to get a strong reaction for their gubernatorial candidates. But when O'Rourke stood up Wednesday, people listened-and wanted to hear more. \"Let Beto speak,\" said one woman in the crowd. \"He has a lot to say!\" And when O'Rourke stood up, the confrontation was televised. Clips trended immediately on social media. He showed after the event that he's not letting up. When O'Rourke learned that Abbott attended a campaign fundraising event hours after the massacre, he tweeted , \"He was counting dollars while they were counting bodies.\" The events of this week do not guarantee that O'Rourke will win in November. After all, while he came close to beating Cruz in a midterm election year that was good for Democrats, there are a lot of indications that 2022 could be a rough one for the party. Texas Republicans have implemented draconian voter suppression strategies that are designed to make casting a ballot harder for the voters O'Rourke needs to turn out-people of color, college students, and young women who are concerned about the assault on abortion rights. It's clear that O'Rourke knows he is going to have to be more aggressive and confrontational if he is going to upend Abbott. So he is pushing beyond the boundaries of traditional politics-and, undoubtedly, beyond the comfort zones of traditional Democratic consultants. Polls on gun control by the Texas Politics Project at the University of Austin regularly show that a plurality of Texans favor stricter gun laws, and that at some points in recent years a majority have supported tougher standards. But the numbers are fluid, and the NRA and its allies are so well organized in the state that taking a stand for gun control is seen as risky. What O'Rourke recognizes is that avoiding the risk cedes the issue to Republicans like Abbott. By talking about the issue, in blunt and unapologetic terms, he enters the debate in a way that can mobilize his base, while perhaps changing the minds of swing voters. An edgier politics that calls out Republican hypocrisy might be just the ticket for Texas Democrats this year. And there's a precedent that says it might work. Back in the 1980s and early '90s, when a Bush from Texas occupied the White House, Democrat Ann Richards took on conservative Democrats and corporate Republicans with sharp and unapologetic language. She was honest, funny, and fiercely effective when it came to mounting populist appeals. Richards never let her rivals off the hook-even mocking the accents of Bushes who \"summered\" on the Maine coast-and it threw the Republicans off-balance. Conservatives and corporatists said she went too far. But the people listened. And in November of 1990, they elected her as the state's first woman governor. Ann Richards was the last Democratic governor of Texas. Beto O'Rourke, if he keeps interrupting the Republican narrative, could be the next one.\n\nBut this year could be different. Beto O'Rourke-who in his 2018 bid for the US Senate won more than 48 percent of the vote and gave Republican Senator Ted Cruz a major scare-is running a no-holds-barred campaign that is taking the risks that grab attention and just might rewrite the narrative of Texas politics. In a state where Democrats have been knocked down again and again, O'Rourke is on his feet and ready for a fight. That was obvious Wednesday, when the Democratic nominee for governor interrupted a media event organized by Governor Greg Abbott and his cronies, where the fierce foes of gun control had hoped to fool Texans into thinking they were interested in taking action to prevent more horrors like Tuesday's massacre of 19 school children and two teachers in the city of Uvalde.

Back in the 1980s and early '90s, when a Bush from Texas occupied the White House, Democrat Ann Richards took on conservative Democrats and corporate Republicans with sharp and unapologetic language. She was honest, funny, and fiercely effective when it came to mounting populist appeals. Richards never let her rivals off the hook-even mocking the accents of Bushes who \"summered\" on the Maine coast-and it threw the Republicans off-balance. Conservatives and corporatists said she went too far. But the people listened. And in November of 1990, they elected her as the state's first woman governor. Ann Richards was the last Democratic governor of Texas. Beto O'Rourke, if he keeps interrupting the Republican narrative, could be the next one.\n\nAs the governor's henchmen shouted obscenities, and demanded that O'Rourke be removed, the former representative from El Paso spoke the truth that could not be denied. Pointing at the governor, the ardent supporter of measures to address gun violence said, \"This is on you until you choose to do something different. This will continue to happen. Somebody needs to stand up for the children of this state or they will continue to be killed just like they were killed in Uvalde yesterday.\" The peddlers of political platitudes grew agitated. \"Sit down and don't play this stunt,\" cried Cruz. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick shouted, \"You're out of line and an embarrassment.\" The mayor of Uvalde, a right-wing Republican , lost control and started screaming that O'Rourke was \"a sick son of a bitch\" who wanted \"to make a political issue\" of the gun violence that has plagued Texas -a state that saw 27 people die in a mass shooting in 2017 at a Sutherland Springs Baptist Church and 23 die after a 2019 mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso. At the same time, cries of \"Let him speak!\" erupted from the room. Amid the chaos, O'Rourke was making a point that a great many Texans know to be true. That is why parents of the murdered children invited O'Rourke into their homes on Wednesday. That is why members of the community welcomed him at a vigil for the dead. O'Rourke explained to reporters after he left why he interrupted the governor's media event: \"After every one of these [mass shootings, Abbott] holds a press conference just like this. And I wish to hell when he came to El Paso that someone would have stood up and held him to account and confronted him and shocked the conscience of this state into doing something. Because if we do nothing, we will continue to see this. Year after year, school after school, kid after kid. This is on all of us, every single one of us to do something.\" Democrats have struggled for decades to get a strong reaction for their gubernatorial candidates. But when O'Rourke stood up Wednesday, people listened-and wanted to hear more. \"Let Beto speak,\" said one woman in the crowd. \"He has a lot to say!\" And when O'Rourke stood up, the confrontation was televised. Clips trended immediately on social media. He showed after the event that he's not letting up. When O'Rourke learned that Abbott attended a campaign fundraising event hours after the massacre, he tweeted , \"He was counting dollars while they were counting bodies.\" The events of this week do not guarantee that O'Rourke will win in November.

Greg Casar, D-Texas,  speaks during a Vigil and Thirst Strike for Workers' Rights on the House steps of the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, July 25, 2023.\n\nThermometers in Texas have been logging all-time record high temperatures this summer. The sun is scorching, the air is stagnant and Corpus Christi recently recorded a heat index of 125 degrees . Yet outdoor labor goes on at construction sites and other workplaces across Texas, which, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, has seen more heat-related deaths of workers than any other state over the last decade.\n\nSo what's been the response from Texas Governor Greg Abbott and the Republicans who control the state legislature? In June, at roughly the same time that the heat index reached 125, Abbott signed legislation that will bar cities and counties in Texas from enacting measures to guarantee that workers get regular breaks for relief from the heat. The Republican preemption measure was drafted with the specific intent of overturning existing ordinances in Austin and Dallas that require workers to get 10-minute water breaks every four hours. (For those doing the math, that's just 20 minutes over the course of a full eight-hour day of physical labor.)\n\n\"Bought-and-paid-for politicians like Governor Abbott are stripping workers of their right to a water break in the middle of a historic heat wave,\" says US Representative Greg Casar, a former workers-rights organizer and Austin City Council member who fought to establish the protections that Texas Republicans are now gutting. \"It's insane.\"\n\nCasar is not about to let Abbott's insanity prevail. So the congressman who was elected to the House last year on a promise to shake things up in Washington is doing just that, with a high-profile push for federal intervention before the law signed by Abbott goes into effect on September 1 . On Tuesday, a campaign to protect workers from extreme heat saw Casar and veteran labor activist Dolores Huerta launch a daylong vigil and thirst strike on the steps of the US Capitol. It was a dramatic gesture, but one that the former community organizer with the Texas Worker Defense Project (Proyecto Defensa Labora) said was essential to saving lives.\n\nCasar says he knows that the Biden administration sympathizes with the plight of workers in Texas and other states that are experiencing blistering heat waves this summer. But that sympathy needs to be coupled with a sense of urgency.\n\nTo that end, Casar and a number of other members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus got more than 100 congressional Democrats to sign a letter on Monday calling on the Biden administration to move immediately to implement a national Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) workplace heat standard that would apply in all states-including Texas. A number of senators, including Democrats Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, and Alex Padilla of California, have joined the call, as has Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, who says , \"It is beyond belief that in the middle of what is expected to be the hottest year on record, right-wing politicians want to take away basic rights like water breaks.\" Major unions have chimed in as well, with National Nurses United reminding members of Congress and the administration that \"heat kills more people annually in the U.S. than hurricanes, tornados, and flooding.\"\n\nDeclaring that \"extreme heat is a matter of life and death,\" the letter from Casar and his colleagues, which was addressed to Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su and Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health Douglas Parker, argued that there is no time to waste. Pushing for urgent action by OSHA, the members explained:\n\nThis summer will be particularly dangerous for both public and private sector American workers exposed to heat. Examining Bureau of Labor Statistics data and other relevant research, Public Citizen estimates that occupational heat stress causes on average 700 deaths and 170,000 illnesses and injuries annually in the U.S. This year is expected to be the hottest on record, demonstrated by the hottest days on record on Earth in the first week of July, following the hottest ever month of June. Heat waves are associated with increases in death rates, driven not only by deaths directly caused by extreme heat but also by increases in deaths from heart attacks, respiratory illnesses, and cerebrovascular diseases. Heat waves are also associated with increased hospital admissions for cardiovascular, kidney, and respiratory disorders. As you know, many workers whose jobs require prolonged exposure to extreme heat are not afforded paid time off or sick days. Thus, any health complications caused by heat exposure can lead to missed work, missed wages, and financial instability for families.\n\nTo highlight the letter's urgent call for action, Casar borrowed a page from the historic struggles of the United Farm Workers union, which saw leaders fast, mount long marches, and employ a variety of other strategies in order to draw attention from the media and regulators to neglected issues. In this instance, the representative decided to go without water himself, outside, on a steamy day in Washington. On the steps of the Capitol, as temperatures soared, the Texan was joined by union activists and workers. Huerta, the 93-year-old cofounder of the United Farm Workers Association and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, held aloft a sign that read, \" Working shouldn't be a death sentence .\" Through the course of the day, they were joined by progressive members of the House and Senate, including US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who tweeted : \"Texas just passed a law blocking water breaks for construction workers. President Biden can stop it by implementing a heat stress rule. It's time for the President to act.\"\n\nAfter nine hours without water, Casar finally took a cool drink, confident that he had made his point. \"The Biden administration has the opportunity-and responsibility-to protect workers and save lives.\" And confident that a federal standard will be established before Abbott and Texas Republicans get their way. Putting his faith in an organizing tradition that began long before he was born, the 34-year-old representative said, \"When a legend like Dolores Huerta is with us, nothing can stop us.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Martin Luther King Jr. (Central Press / Getty Images)\n\nRepublicans are using the debate about Critical Race Theory as an excuse to rewrite American history. How far will that rewrite go if they get away with it? Consider last week's Bloomberg Law report from the Texas statehouse: The Texas Senate on Friday passed legislation that would end requirements that public schools include writings on women's suffrage and the civil rights movement in social studies classes. Among the figures whose works would be dropped: Susan B. Anthony, Cesar Chavez, and Martin Luther King Jr., whose \"I Have a Dream\"speech and \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail\" would no longer make the curriculum cut. This is what it has come to. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has already signed legislation that requires educators to avoid instruction that suggests \"slavery and racism are anything other than deviation from, betrayals of, or failures to live up to, the authentic founding principles of the United States.\" The initial measure even barred instruction based on The New York Times ' Pulitzer Prize-winning 1619 Project . And the Senate bill goes even further, as the Texas Tribune notes : The previous bill also lists documents, figures and events that must be included in the social studies curriculum. But SB 3, authored by state Sen. Bryan Hughes, strips out most mentions of women and people of color in that section. That includes more than two dozen requirements that include Native American history, work by civil rights activists Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, historical documents related to the Chicano movement and women's suffrage, and writings by Martin Luther King Jr., Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass. SB 3 also expands the restrictions on how current events and America's history of racism can be taught in schools from social studies teachers to all teachers. Despite an outcry from educators, the Texas Senate backed SB 3 on a 18-4 vote. The measure now heads to the state House. It won't be acted upon immediately, because the chamber lacks a quorum. That's because Democratic members left the state in order to block action on Republican moves to suppress the votes of people of color, students, and others who might cast Democratic ballots.

More From John Nichols The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" April 25, 2025 The Pope Who Decried the Savage Inequalities of Billionaire-Class Capitalism April 21, 2025 A Pope Who Prays for Palestine April 20, 2025 The latest Republican crusade isn't about Critical Race Theory, an academic construct taught mostly in law schools and graduate programs. The core idea of CRT, as EdWeek explains , \"is that race is a social construct, and that racism is not merely the product of individual bias or prejudice, but also something embedded in legal systems and policies.\" That's not a debatable point. But the facts have not stopped Donald Trump, his amen corner on Fox News, and Republican legislators from stirring up a debate about CRT as part of a broader effort to threaten teachers who seek to provide students with an honest history of a country that permitted slavery, Jim Crow segregation, and scorching inequality in education, employment opportunities, housing, and access to capital. James Grossman, the executive director of the American Historical Association, has explicitly rejected the fantasy that teaching about racism and white supremacy creates division in society, arguing , \"You cannot heal divisions by pretending they don't exist. The way to address divisions is to understand the history of those divisions.\" American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten says the attacks on CRT are really attacks on our understanding of history, and on the ways in which that understanding frames contemporary debates about voter suppression, policing reforms, and other issues. \"These culture warriors want to deprive students of a robust understanding of our common history. This will put students at a disadvantage in life by knocking a big hole in their understanding of our country and the world,\" Weingarten told union members two weeks ago. \"Yale historian Timothy Snyder likens it to the 'memory laws' of Soviet and other repressive regimes. Authoritarians take actions designed to manipulate interpretation of the past, assert a mandatory view of events and forbid discussions of accurate historical facts. But you, the professionals in the classroom, the people who use your expertise to help our students succeed-you know better. We teach history, not hate.\" But what happens if essential history is canceled out of the curriculum? Texas Republicans say they aren't banning instruction about Dr. King and the civil rights movement. But when they require that teachers say slavery, segregation, and racism were only \"deviations\" from an otherwise noble project, they create confusion about the motivations of King and others who suffered, struggled, and died in the fight for equal justice. And when they cancel requirements that King's greatest statements be included in teaching plans, they dumb down the discourse and leave history to chance. That's a dangerous road to go down. It raises the prospect that Texas students could finish K-12 education with scant knowledge of the civil rights movement as a necessary response to lynchings, bombings, KKK attacks, segregation, poll taxes, voter suppression, and all the other manifestations of systemic racism. It raises the prospect that high school graduates will know the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as little more than a name associated with a three-day weekend. This attack on our history has nothing to do with Critical Race Theory and everything to do with the fact that Dr. King spoke in the \"I Have a Dream\" speech -the very speech Texas Republicans seek to strike from the curriculum-about the \"millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice.\" And about the fact that, a century after Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, \"the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land.\" That is the honest truth that must be taught. So, too, is the truth contained in the other King text that would be dropped from the curriculum, \" Letter from a Birmingham Jail ,\" in which the pastor wrote, \"Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.\" That lesson is the one the proponents of conservative cancel culture fear the most. Because if students learn the real history of injustice and inequality, they might conclude, as King did: We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity. N\n\nHow far will that rewrite go if they get away with it?

The core idea of CRT, as EdWeek explains , \"is that race is a social construct, and that racism is not merely the product of individual bias or prejudice, but also something embedded in legal systems and policies.\" That's not a debatable point. But the facts have not stopped Donald Trump, his amen corner on Fox News, and Republican legislators from stirring up a debate about CRT as part of a broader effort to threaten teachers who seek to provide students with an honest history of a country that permitted slavery, Jim Crow segregation, and scorching inequality in education, employment opportunities, housing, and access to capital. James Grossman, the executive director of the American Historical Association, has explicitly rejected the fantasy that teaching about racism and white supremacy creates division in society, arguing , \"You cannot heal divisions by pretending they don't exist. The way to address divisions is to understand the history of those divisions.\" American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten says the attacks on CRT are really attacks on our understanding of history, and on the ways in which that understanding frames contemporary debates about voter suppression, policing reforms, and other issues. \"These culture warriors want to deprive students of a robust understanding of our common history.

We teach history, not hate.\" But what happens if essential history is canceled out of the curriculum? Texas Republicans say they aren't banning instruction about Dr. King and the civil rights movement. But when they require that teachers say slavery, segregation, and racism were only \"deviations\" from an otherwise noble project, they create confusion about the motivations of King and others who suffered, struggled, and died in the fight for equal justice. And when they cancel requirements that King's greatest statements be included in teaching plans, they dumb down the discourse and leave history to chance. That's a dangerous road to go down. It raises the prospect that Texas students could finish K-12 education with scant knowledge of the civil rights movement as a necessary response to lynchings, bombings, KKK attacks, segregation, poll taxes, voter suppression, and all the other manifestations of systemic racism. It raises the prospect that high school graduates will know the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as little more than a name associated with a three-day weekend. This attack on our history has nothing to do with Critical Race Theory and everything to do with the fact that Dr. King spoke in the \"I Have a Dream\" speech -the very speech Texas Republicans seek to strike from the curriculum-about the \"millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice.\" And about the fact that, a century after Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, \"the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land.\" That is the honest truth that must be taught. So, too, is the truth contained in the other King text that would be dropped from the curriculum, \" Letter from a Birmingham Jail ,\" in which the pastor wrote, \"Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.\" That lesson is the one the proponents of conservative cancel culture fear the most. Because if students learn the real history of injustice and inequality, they might conclude, as King did: We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity. N\n\nThe previous bill also lists documents, figures and events that must be included in the social studies curriculum. But SB 3, authored by state Sen. Bryan Hughes, strips out most mentions of women and people of color in that section. That includes more than two dozen requirements that include Native American history, work by civil rights activists Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, historical documents related to the Chicano movement and women's suffrage, and writings by Martin Luther King Jr., Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass. SB 3 also expands the restrictions on how current events and America's history of racism can be taught in schools from social studies teachers to all teachers.\n\nSB 3 also expands the restrictions on how current events and America's history of racism can be taught in schools from social studies teachers to all teachers.\n\nDespite an outcry from educators, the Texas Senate backed SB 3 on a 18-4 vote. The measure now heads to the state House. It won't be acted upon immediately, because the chamber lacks a quorum. That's because Democratic members left the state in order to block action on Republican moves to suppress the votes of people of color, students, and others who might cast Democratic ballots.

Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity. N\n\n\"These culture warriors want to deprive students of a robust understanding of our common history. This will put students at a disadvantage in life by knocking a big hole in their understanding of our country and the world,\" Weingarten told union members two weeks ago. \"Yale historian Timothy Snyder likens it to the 'memory laws' of Soviet and other repressive regimes. Authoritarians take actions designed to manipulate interpretation of the past, assert a mandatory view of events and forbid discussions of accurate historical facts. But you, the professionals in the classroom, the people who use your expertise to help our students succeed-you know better. We teach history, not hate.\" But what happens if essential history is canceled out of the curriculum? Texas Republicans say they aren't banning instruction about Dr. King and the civil rights movement. But when they require that teachers say slavery, segregation, and racism were only \"deviations\" from an otherwise noble project, they create confusion about the motivations of King and others who suffered, struggled, and died in the fight for equal justice. And when they cancel requirements that King's greatest statements be included in teaching plans, they dumb down the discourse and leave history to chance. That's a dangerous road to go down. It raises the prospect that Texas students could finish K-12 education with scant knowledge of the civil rights movement as a necessary response to lynchings, bombings, KKK attacks, segregation, poll taxes, voter suppression, and all the other manifestations of systemic racism. It raises the prospect that high school graduates will know the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as little more than a name associated with a three-day weekend. This attack on our history has nothing to do with Critical Race Theory and everything to do with the fact that Dr. King spoke in the \"I Have a Dream\" speech -the very speech Texas Republicans seek to strike from the curriculum-about the \"millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice.\" And about the fact that, a century after Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, \"the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land.\" That is the honest truth that must be taught. So, too, is the truth contained in the other King text that would be dropped from the curriculum, \" Letter from a Birmingham Jail ,\" in which the pastor wrote, \"Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.\" That lesson is the one the proponents of conservative cancel culture fear the most.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

The new law makes it harder to obtain mail-in ballots, prohibits drop boxes to turn in those ballots, limits early voting times, and eliminates drive-through voting. Texas Republicans claim that these measures are necessary to secure elections from threats of voter fraud, even though those same Republicans could find no evidence of voter fraud during the last election. The real reason the Texas GOP has taken these measures is to suppress the voting strength of people of color-and we know that because all these methods have been empirically shown to disproportionately suppress the participation of people of color in elections. When state legislators do something that intentionally discriminates on the basis of race, it's fair to call those legislators \"racist,\" even if they would rather people whitewash their true intentions. Unfortunately, the corporate media has accepted the idea that discriminating against voters of color is just one valid policy option among many. Pieces in both The Washington Post and The New York Times , for instance, framed SB1 as a legitimate side of a \"fierce\" battle between competing political views, as opposed to the triumph of Jim Crow-style political apartheid. A big part of the Republican game plan is getting their media enablers to treat their racist policies as \"normal,\" and they've been largely successful at cowing the corporate press into doing exactly that. While Texas Republicans race backward toward 1859, there is nothing Congress, controlled by the Democratic Party, is doing to stop them. In July, Texas Democrats literally fled the state in an attempt to stop SB1 from passing. They went to Washington, begging for help. But none came. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema remained unmoved and unwilling to break the filibuster to protect the right of people of color to vote. Neither the For the People Act nor the John Lewis Voting Rights Act is close to becoming law. The Senate seems content to allow whites in Texas to have more voting power and access than nonwhites. One can almost understand why the Roman Emperor Caligula once appointed a live horse to his era's Senate. When an elective body is this useless, mocking it feels like wisdom. As for President Biden, executive powers alone aren't enough to stop voter suppression. Our system of government has always placed the power to hold elections squarely under the authority of the individual states. Only the Reconstruction Amendments-specifically the 14th and 15th amendments, as well as the 19th Amendment-are supposed to place limits on what the states can do to their elections. That leaves the courts. In response to SB1, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund has sued the state of Texas (on behalf of the Houston Area Urban League, Houston Justice, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., and The Arc of Texas), alleging the new law violates: The Voting Rights Act, the American with Disabilities Act, and the 14th and 15th Amendments. If federal courts in Texas or the Supreme Court cared about these laws and amendments, the Texas voter suppression bill would be stopped. Again, that's because all of Texas's new restrictions are designed to suppress the votes of people of color, not combat (nonexistent) voter fraud. And the restrictions accomplish this racially discriminatory goal with precision. Current Issue View our current issue The problem is that the conservatives in the judiciary do not care about some of our most crucial laws and amendments. They were picked by Republican presidents in large part because of their hostility to voting rights, not in spite of it. This past June, the six conservative justices on the Supreme Court ruled that laws designed to suppress the votes of people of color were perfectly constitutional so long as the states behind those laws were only a little bit racist. And, oh yes, the measure of how much racism is acceptable is apparently defined only by Samuel Alito's tolerance for bigotry. So, here we are. Republican state legislatures are actively trying to discriminate against people of color to suppress their votes, and Democrats in Congress are doing nothing. Conservatives on the Supreme Court are actively ignoring the Reconstruction Amendments, just as earlier whites-only versions of the Supreme Court once did, and the Biden administration is doing nothing to rebalance the judiciary. The forces of white supremacy have risen again to do exactly what they always do to ensure white dominance in the electoral process, and the white people who run corporations and media conglomerates just shrug their shoulders and leave people of color to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous bigotry. Later, when the twin forces of Republican voter suppression and total federal inaction from Democrats conspire to get Democrats curb-stomped in the midterm elections, the same white people who today do nothing will blame me, or some other Black person, or most likely Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for being too \"liberal\" and turning off white people at brunch. People of color can only save America from becoming a white ethnostate if you let us.\n\nTexas Republicans claim that these measures are necessary to secure elections from threats of voter fraud, even though those same Republicans could find no evidence of voter fraud during the last election.

Our system of government has always placed the power to hold elections squarely under the authority of the individual states. Only the Reconstruction Amendments-specifically the 14th and 15th amendments, as well as the 19th Amendment-are supposed to place limits on what the states can do to their elections. That leaves the courts. In response to SB1, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund has sued the state of Texas (on behalf of the Houston Area Urban League, Houston Justice, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., and The Arc of Texas), alleging the new law violates: The Voting Rights Act, the American with Disabilities Act, and the 14th and 15th Amendments.

      "text": "How Texas Republicans Politicized the Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nBy the time that Sylvester Turner, the mayor of Houston, shut down the Republican Party of Texas Convention-the enormous biennial meeting of Texas Republicans , which was scheduled to take place this week-the event had been delayed once before. The convention had originally been planned for May, but COVID -19 had arrived in the United States, and the Republican Party moved quickly to do the right thing. \"We are going to make sure that we flatten the curve,\" James Dickey, the chairman of the R.P.T., said. \"It is the duty of all Texans to take deliberate action to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\" When the Party announced that the convention would have to wait until July, no one cried politics. It was early March, and no one had yet uttered the words \"Wuhan Virus.\" Donald Trump had yet to embark on a campaign characterizing the national response to the pandemic in terms of toughness rather than preparedness, in which rallies and conventions serve as a show of strength and defiance.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic in the U.S., it seemed as if Texas was going to be spared the worst. There were outbreaks in rural areas of the state, mostly centered on meat-packing plants and prisons, but those populations were isolated. Once Trump prioritized getting back to work, posting tweets that urged governors to \"liberate\" their constituents, Texas's governor, Greg Abbott , started reopening the state's economy. Just a month had passed since it had first shut down. When municipalities asked for the ability to require masks in their cities, or to follow their own schedules for reopening, Abbott refused. When an owner of a hair salon disobeyed orders to shut down, the state's lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, paid her seven-thousand-dollar bail. During an interview with Fox News's Tucker Carlson , Patrick said that the state should continue opening, while people over the age of seventy should take care of themselves. \"Don't sacrifice the country,\" he said. \"Don't ruin this great American dream.\"\n\nAs part of the reopening process, the rescheduled Republican convention would proceed as planned. The George R. Brown Convention Center, a huge glass-and-steel building in downtown Houston, was still available. The July date, the R.P.T. would later note, was well within the C.D.C. window that had been established back in March. A smattering of events started to show up on the Party's Web site. Delegates could attend \"lunch and learns\" and hear speeches from, among others, Abbott, Patrick, and the Texas land commissioner, George P. Bush (the son of Jeb ). There would also be a gala banquet and a breakfast to celebrate grassroots activists. And then, as Texas moved into the last phase of its reopening, and unmasked people packed into restaurants and bars over the Memorial Day weekend, COVID -19 came back.\n\nThe first indisputable sign of trouble for Republicans might have been the Kaufman County district meeting. When the state convention had been delayed, Dickey had encouraged district meetings to be rescheduled as well, in the name of safety. Kaufman County, which is just outside of Dallas, had selected a date in early June and convened its meeting in a church. Masks were recommended but \"NOT required.\" The church was allowed to fill only to fifty-per-cent capacity, and there was ample hand sanitizer available. Jimmy Weaver, a mustachioed district-level delegate, opened the meeting with a joke about the pandemic. \"In one way, the Democrats did us a favor,\" he said . \"They cured the coronavirus!\" A few days later, one of the attendees, a seventy-five-year-old man named Bill Baker, fell ill. By the end of the month-on June 25th-he died of COVID -19.\n\nThis time, however, the R.P.T. did not reschedule its convention. Even as the state Democratic Party took its convention online, the Republicans forged ahead. The day after Baker's death, the executive director of the Party, Kyle Whatley, told an online town-hall meeting, \"All systems are go, folks. This is happening.\"\n\nOutside of the Republican Party's leadership, however, concerns about the convention were growing. It would be a six-thousand-person indoor meeting-an event that would fill hotels and restaurants around the venue-and was scheduled to take place at the current epicenter of the outbreak. By the end of June, there were more than thirty thousand documented cases of COVID -19 in Harris County, which contains Houston. A mandatory mask order had been in place in the city since June 19th, requiring businesses to enforce mask-wearing, but not requiring them for individuals. The Republican Party, because it was not a business, would not have to enforce the rule.\n\nOn June 23rd, Abbott issued an order limiting the size of outdoor gatherings but put no limits on those held indoors. A week later, the Texas Medical Association called for the G.O.P. to cancel the convention. On the same day, Turner, the Houston mayor, rejected calls that he cancel the gathering. He would leave it up to the Republican organizers, he said, to make \"wise decisions.\"\n\nOn July 2nd, Dickey called an emergency meeting on Zoom to discuss the convention. \"This is an unprecedented time, and we face unprecedented challenges,\" he said, while commenters on the live stream joked about technical difficulties. (\"Who that hacking up a lung?\" someone asked, while one of the delegates coughed. \"Please mute when you're not talking,\" someone else wrote.) A few delegates advocated holding the convention online. Most, however, urged the Party to press forward. \"I think the biggest optic we need is within our own party,\" Randall Dunning, a member of the State Republican Executive Committee, said. \"What we need is to demonstrate courage. . . . We are being perceived as pushed around by the media. We need to stand up for these things.\" The coronavirus, he added, was \"one of the most feeble epidemics ever.\" Dunning, who has been known to brag about wearing body armor, is an outspoken party member , but his position was widely supported. The controversy over the convention was not about safety, he said. It was about politics.\n\nThere is a kind of machismo inherent in taking risks during a pandemic-an attitude that has been on display nationally every time Trump plans (or attempts to plan) a rally-which is particularly potent in a state like Texas, where the appeal of strongman politics mixes easily with the come-and-take-it troublemaking of gun-rights circles. The Web site for the R.P.T. notes that \"early Texans lived, loved and died entirely by their own efforts without relying on government to fulfill their needs. Just like modern Texans, early settlers believed in families, churches and neighbors, not in bureaucracy. That sense of self-respect and self-reliance is still the envy of the world.\"\n\nTexas, which has not elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1994, refused to implement the Affordable Care Act and has repeatedly cut the budget for Medicaid and education funding. (There is also no state income tax.) Leaders speak the language of individual freedoms and emphasize strength over social compacts. Protesters will decry a mask-wearing requirement as nearly Communist, and yet their beloved sense of self-reliance has landed the state in the middle of a dark comedy that echoes the situations in authoritarian-led nations like Brazil (where the President, Jair Bolsonaro , used a gay slur to describe mask-wearing, before contracting COVID -19 himself). Fierce independence, when valued above all else, it seems, is almost as potent as the density of New York when it comes to spreading a virus.\n\nTurner, a Democrat, did not, he said, want to politicize the virus. When an article in the Houston Chronicle noted his refusal to shut down the convention, Turner tweeted in response, \"Easier for the reporter to criticize me than the Governor who is the political head of the Republican Party.\" And then, during the July 2nd Zoom meeting, the R.P.T. took a vote and decided, by a count of 40-20, to go ahead with the event. The next day, Turner said that he was reviewing his options. \"Now that the Executive Committee has made the decision to move forward, the City will decide what steps must be taken to protect the health and safety of employees, visitors, and the general public,\" he noted in a press release. Three days later, he sent a letter to Dickey and the R.P.T., formally asking the G.O.P. to cancel. \"The world is experiencing a once-in-a century biologic event,\" he wrote. More than forty-four per cent of the I.C.U. patients in Harris County hospitals were positive for COVID -19. \"While these statistics are quite worrisome, let us not forget they represent people who are suffering,\" Turner added.\n\nIn response, Dickey insisted that \"Mayor Turner must not have had the information about the measures being voluntarily implemented.\" The following day, Turner received a letter from the Public Health Authority, which called the convention \"a clear and present danger to the health of convention attendees, workers, local hotel and restaurant owners and Houstonians because of the surging pandemic.\" The Republican Party made an announcement: the convention would go on, but all the speeches would be made virtually. Rank-and-file Party members would be allowed inside the building; the featured speakers, including Abbott, Patrick, and Bush, would call in from the safety of their homes. \"They're doing that for us in order to focus all the attention on the business of the meeting,\" Whatley, the Party's executive director, said.\n\nAnd so, on the morning of July 8th, Turner announced that he was looking for a way to cancel the event himself. \"We closed down the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, and this convention is no greater or better,\" he said. His mother had worked as a hotel maid, he added, and he wouldn't have wanted her working during a convention like this. Dickey, who no longer seemed so interested in flattening the curve, had a press release ready: \"After allowing tens of thousands of protestors to peaceably assemble in the same city, in the same area, without any of the safety precautions and measures we have taken, he is seeking to deny a political Party's critical electoral function that should be equally protected under the constitution.\"\n\nThe comparison to protests over the killing of George Floyd , a Houston native , Turner said, was irrelevant. \"When people are marching or demonstrating, they are walking, they are moving,\" he tweeted. \"Nobody is making their breakfast or serving them.\" Turner contacted Houston First, the public nonprofit that runs the convention center, which soon found a way to cancel the Republicans' contract. What was happening in Houston amounted to a \"force majeure,\" the group explained, as the city had nearly forty thousand confirmed coronavirus cases, overwhelmed hospitals, and a documented continuing spread of the virus. The next day, the R.P.T. attempted to obtain an injunction that would let the convention go on. \"It should go without saying that a political viewpoint cannot be the basis for unequal treatment,\" Dickey said, again alluding to the Black Lives Matter protests that had filled Houston's streets in June. \"Mayor Turner publicly stated his intention to interrupt the convention process and disenfranchise Republicans around the state, and yesterday he put his scheme into action.\"\n\nLater that day, a Harris County judge denied the injunction. In response, the R.P.T. issued a press release titled \"No Surprise-Harris County Court Denies RPT Request for Relief.\" \"We thank them for a speedy denial so we can move forward with the appeal we had prepared,\" Dickey said in the statement. On Monday morning, the Texas Supreme Court denied the Party's appeal, in a 7-1 decision. \"The Party argues it has constitutional rights to hold a convention . . . that is unquestionably true,\" the court's opinion reads. \"But those rights do not allow it to simply commandeer use of the Center.\" In the meantime, coronavirus cases in Houston had reached forty-five thousand, area hospitals had run out of I.C.U. beds, and the R.P.T. was discussing its options. Messages came in from conservative counties offering to host the event. \"I believe that being able to protest is a First Amendment right, and I support that right,\" Mark Keough, a judge from Montgomery County, said in a Facebook video. \"But you know what else I support? I support the fact that political speech is also a First Amendment right.\" Montgomery County, which is Harris County's neighbor to the north, was open for business, Keough announced, and would not exert any political pressure on the organizers. Instead, on Monday, the Party's executive committee took another vote and decided that the 2020 Texas State Republican Convention will kick off on Thursday, entirely online.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Unchecked Authority of Greg Abbott\n\nThe Wall Ranch, in Eagle Pass, Texas, occupies a thousand acres of scrubland along the Mexican border. Several times a day, freight trains coming from Mexico stop on the southern edge of the property, where a large X-ray machine scans the cars to check if people are hiding inside. One morning in early January, the ranch's owner, Martín Wall, a forty-five-year-old cattleman and a seventh-generation Texan, showed me around. Between 2022 and 2023, he said, more than two hundred migrants crossed through his land each day to board the trains and travel farther north. Discarded clothes and trash piled up in the brush. A tractor was vandalized. Wire fences that Wall had erected to keep his cattle from wandering into the road were repeatedly cut. Once, Wall came inside for lunch and found two men in his kitchen. \"Hell, you can grab their phones and they have pins,\" he told me. \"They have my house marked.\"\n\nWe were sitting in Wall's pickup truck. The muzzle of a hunting rifle poked out from the back seat, and a water bottle on the front console was filled with the brown swill of chewing tobacco. Wall, who is tall and burly, with long hair and a salt-and-pepper beard, told me that he'd spent more than three hundred thousand dollars making repairs on the ranch. \"I've been totally crippled by this,\" he said. The problem began \"as soon as Biden went in. We got forgotten about down here.\"\n\nBy the end of last year, the number of migrants arriving at the border was at its lowest ebb since 2020, owing in large part to a dramatic increase in apprehensions in Mexico, and a series of stricter policies adopted in the final months of the Biden Administration. In February, after Donald Trump's first month back in office, the U.S. Border Patrol recorded fewer encounters with migrants than at any other time in at least a quarter century. But Wall, who flies a large Trump flag at the entrance to his ranch, attributed the change to a single person: Greg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas.\n\nIn the spring of 2021, Abbott announced that Texas would \"not be an accomplice to the open border policies\" of the Biden Administration. He issued a disaster declaration and launched an eleven-billion-dollar enforcement crackdown called Operation Lone Star. Thousands of state troopers from the Department of Public Safety were dispatched to arrest migrants in the borderlands. The Texas National Guard placed floating buoys in the Rio Grande to make it harder to swim across, and strung up more than a hundred miles of razor wire to ensnare anyone who did. Both moves prompted federal lawsuits. \"The only thing that we are not doing is we're not shooting people who come across the border,\" Abbott said in a radio interview. \"Because, of course, the Biden Administration would charge us with murder.\"\n\nThe following spring, Abbott began busing migrants to New York, Chicago, Denver, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. More than a hundred thousand people arrived in those cities as a result-an influx that overwhelmed government resources, stoked local resentments, and deepened divisions among Democrats. Abbott's strategy was to inflict the pain felt by constituents like Wall on liberal voters who lived far from the border. In response, congressional Democrats backed legislation to increase border security and restrict asylum. When the Biden White House asked other cities to help take in migrants, local officials privately told the President's aides they were worried that Abbott would target them next. A senior Biden Administration official told me, \"Greg Abbott single-handedly changed the national politics around immigration.\"\n\nThe federal government has the sole authority to enforce the country's immigration laws. But Biden, Abbott said, had \"broken the compact between the United States and the States\" by failing to enforce immigration laws passed by Congress. When Biden stopped construction on Trump's border wall, Abbott directed his state to keep building. Invoking Article I of the Constitution, he declared that the state had been \"invaded\" and therefore had the \"authority to defend and protect itself.\"\n\nLast January, on orders from Abbott, the state seized control of Shelby Park, a public plot in Eagle Pass on the Rio Grande. Border Patrol agents, who had long operated inside the park, were barred. The following month, with the Presidential campaign under way, Trump gave a speech alongside Abbott in front of the park's razor-wire fences. Abbott was a \"spectacular man,\" Trump said afterward. More than a dozen Republican governors, in a show of support for Abbott, had sent their own guardsmen to the border. When I visited Shelby Park recently, with a chaperon from the Texas National Guard, an airboat from Florida still floated in the water.\n\nMartín Wall's ranch had become ground zero for Operation Lone Star. He and his wife were among the first landowners to agree to let state troopers onto their property. The Department of Public Safety was \" our Border Patrol,\" Wall told me. National Republicans treated Eagle Pass like it was the site of a partisan pilgrimage. Senators visited, as did the Speaker of the House and Elon Musk, who'd recently moved to Texas himself. Wall and I got out of his truck and walked through a grove of mesquite trees. Dense coils of concertina wire snaked through the brush. Without Abbott, Wall said, \"my family wouldn't still be here.\"\n\nOn January 20th, the day of Trump's second Inauguration, the President was telling an overflow crowd at the Capitol how he'd won-immigration was his \"No. 1 issue,\" he said-when he caught sight of Abbott. The Governor, a paraplegic who has used a wheelchair since an accident in his twenties, was sitting toward the back of the audience, in a dark suit. At sixty-seven, he has a full head of wispy gray hair, a muted speaking style, and an air of conventionality which belies his far-right politics. \"We couldn't get you up in the front row?\" Trump asked, with a grin.\n\nAbbott, who is in his third term as governor and is poised to run for a fourth, is an unlikely MAGA hero. He has spent three decades in government, first as a justice on the state Supreme Court and then as the longest-serving attorney general in Texas history. In style, he is the antithesis of the President-highly scripted and canny. \"He's not flashy or well spoken,\" Beto O'Rourke, a Democrat who ran against Abbott for governor in 2022, told me. \"He's rarely memorable.\" State politicians tend to describe Abbott as a run-of-the-mill Republican who once had more in common with the Chamber of Commerce than with the Party's raucous, populist base. As one Democratic operative in Texas put it, \"He could always associate himself with the bomb throwers and not ever look like one.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nTexas is home to about thirty-one million people, but statewide elections are effectively decided by just one and a half million of them-the average turnout in the Republican primary. In the past decade, as that constituency moved right, Abbott refashioned himself as a conservative crusader and a culture warrior. He has signed some of the country's harshest anti-abortion bills, restricted the rights of transgender people, and fought diversity initiatives at state universities. Since the COVID pandemic, Abbott has made liberal use of the governor's power to declare statewide emergencies, which has allowed him to circumvent judicial and legislative checks. His longevity in office has conferred additional powers: thousands of state officials owe their jobs to Abbott appointments, and his campaign war chest, which dwarfs those of his closest rivals, has brought him to the edge of political invincibility. \"He's a tough motherfucker, and don't believe otherwise,\" Bill Miller, a Republican lobbyist, told me. \"As governor, he has begun exercising power in a way that's not previously been seen.\"\n\nLast year, in a move that was unprecedented in the history of Texas politics, Abbott attacked reliable members of his own party. Twenty-one Republicans in the state House had broken with him on a policy that he'd elevated as a priority in the 2023 legislative session: vouchers for religious schools, an issue known among supporters as \"school choice.\" Conservatives aren't usually strong opponents of vouchers, but in Texas's rural communities public schools are often both the only option for students and a major source of local employment. The state, where some six million students attend public schools, ranks near the bottom in education funding nationally. Each time a bill to establish a statewide voucher system has come up in the House, it has failed; the 2023 legislative session was no different.\n\nFor most of Abbott's career, he had barely mentioned the issue, but a few things had changed. Frustration with public schools during the pandemic, one of the Governor's advisers told me, had begun to \"turn the tide\" in favor of \"parents' rights.\" The state's top political fund-raisers-a pair of Christian nationalists-were bankrolling the effort. So were out-of-state donors like the TikTok investor Jeff Yass, from Pennsylvania, who contributed more than six million dollars, and a group affiliated with Betsy DeVos, Trump's former Education Secretary, which added another four million dollars.\n\nAfter the bill was defeated, Abbott called a special session, forcing lawmakers to return to the capitol to weigh his proposal for a second time. The Governor, according to one of his top staffers, \"was out there saying, 'We can do this the easy way or the hard way. Pass this thing or I'm going to go after you.' \" Hugh Shine, a Republican in the House who voted against the voucher measure, told me, \"My colleagues and I were with the governor 99.9 per cent of the time. When I came up, in the Reagan years, I was told, If someone's with you eighty per cent of the time, they're your friend.\" When the legislation again failed in the special session, Abbott targeted the bill's Republican opponents with primary challengers, not only campaigning with them but flooding the districts with ads. The attacks themselves, though, had little to do with vouchers. \"He accused us of being weak on the border, that we were weak on property taxes, that we wanted to raise taxes,\" Steve Allison, a Republican from San Antonio, said. \"That was absolutely false.\"\n\nWhen eleven of the incumbents targeted by Abbott-including Shine and Allison-lost or dropped their candidacies the following year, Abbott said, \"The overall message from this year's primaries is clear: Texans want school choice.\" The vast sums of money that Abbott unleashed, along with his zero-sum assessment of political loyalty, has proved persuasive. The measure is almost certain to pass this year. \"He had to flex his muscles,\" Miller said. \"Make people respect you, which is really what it's all about. The rule is: nothing succeeds like success.\"\n\nTrump's plans to carry out mass deportations face a number of logistical obstacles. The Department of Homeland Security lacks the resources to detain and deport undocumented immigrants at a scale that meets the President's ambitions. Any path to achieving his aims runs through Texas. At the U.S. Capitol in January, Trump went off on a tangent about the border wall but kept returning to Abbott, praising him for his actions on immigration. \"You didn't do that for politics-you did it because you wanted to do the right thing,\" Trump said. \"But it sure as hell worked for politics.\" Abbott beamed. By way of reply, he mouthed, \"Self-preservation.\"\n\nJuly 14, 1984, was a muggy, overcast day in Houston. Abbott, then twenty-six and studying for the Texas bar exam, decided to go for a run. He and his wife, Cecilia, who'd been married for three years, were living a couple of miles from downtown, where Abbott was due to start a job as an associate at one of the city's most prestigious law firms. \"Running was a refreshing break from sitting at a desk,\" Abbott later wrote in a memoir. He had been a competitive runner in high school; in college, at the University of Texas, and then in law school, at Vanderbilt, he jogged obsessively. On this particular afternoon, his study partner joined him, and they ran side by side on the streets of a leafy, affluent neighborhood.\n\nAfter about a mile, the sidewalk narrowed. Abbott went ahead. A loud crack rang out, and Abbott was knocked to the ground. A giant oak tree in the front yard of a divorce attorney had collapsed on him. \"The good news was that I was still conscious,\" he later wrote. \"The bad news was that I had not lost consciousness.\" While his friend sprinted off to call an ambulance, Abbott, lying on his back, remembered a movie that he and Cecilia had recently watched about a man who'd been paralyzed in a tragic accident. \"If that ever happened to me,\" Abbott had told her, \"just put me to death.\"\n\nAbbott had grown up in a family of modest means in East Texas, before moving, as a young teen-ager, with his churchgoing parents and his brother to Duncanville, a small suburb of Dallas. His father died of a heart attack when Abbott was sixteen, and his mother went to work as a real-estate agent to support the family. Abbott mowed lawns and stocked shelves at a general store after school. A scholarship from the Duncanville Police Department helped him get through college. The night before his accident, Abbott and his wife had attended a lavish gala hosted by his law firm. As he later put it, \"This was the beginning of the life we'd been striving for.\"\n\nAbbott spent ten days in intensive care, and another month in the hospital. Surgeons had to remove bone fragments from his back, fuse together his damaged vertebrae, and insert two steel rods along his spine. Eventually, he regained use of his arms and his hands, but he would spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. \"Think about how young they were,\" a close family friend told me. \"Cecilia was twenty-four when he had his accident. That's young to be figuring out all the things-the hospitals and all that.\"\n\nColleagues at Abbott's law firm introduced him to a well-regarded personal-injury attorney named Don Riddle, who agreed to represent him when other lawyers had refused. \"Look at the bare facts,\" Riddle told me. \"A tree falls on a young man and paralyzes him. That doesn't look like much of a case. Who are you going to collect against?\"\n\nIt turned out that the homeowner had hired a deep-pocketed company to inspect the tree, which was rotted at its core. \"Things got better once we did discovery,\" Riddle said. He remembered Abbott as upbeat, pleasant, and not the least bit self-pitying: \"One of the things he said early on was 'I will walk again.' He was very confident.\" When Riddle eventually secured a lucrative settlement in the case, Abbott wanted it all in cash. \"He never had any money, so the few million that they were willing to put up looked like a lot,\" Riddle told me. He persuaded Abbott to opt for a structured settlement, worth the equivalent of eight million dollars, with tax-free payments accruing for the rest of his life.\n\nAbbott's work ethic has always been a personal point of pride. In his memoir, he recalls taking the bar exam in a wheelchair, in July, 1985, only a year after his accident, and going to work at his law firm each day in a body brace, arriving before his colleagues and leaving after them. In the courtroom, he fashioned himself as a tenacious litigator. At one point, he represented a hospital sued by a man who alleged an injury in a \"slip and fall incident.\" During a tense cross-examination, the man rushed from the witness box and beat Abbott's wheelchair with his cane. \"I was on my way,\" Abbott wrote. A few years later, when Abbott was thirty-four, he was elected as a district judge in Harris County, where he earned a reputation as a fair-minded jurist with a doctrinaire conservative bent. The Texas Association of Civil Trial and Appellate Specialists voted him Trial Judge of the Year.\n\nThe nineties were a period of political realignment in Texas. Since Reconstruction, the state had been run by Democrats, though intraparty fissures grew throughout the sixties and seventies. \"Republicans were in the Democratic Party, because there was only one party,\" Ann Richards, the last Democrat to serve as the state's governor, once said. \"We wanted them out of the Democratic Party, and they got out in spades.\" In 1994, George W. Bush upset Richards in the governor's race. Eight years later, Republicans won the state House for the first time since 1872. The new Republican speaker, Tom Craddick, partnered with Tom DeLay, a former exterminator from Sugar Land who'd become the Majority Whip in the U.S. House, to force through a redistricting plan that put Republicans on a path to long-term dominance in the state. \"Texas became a model for how to get control,\" Craddick later said, as my colleague Lawrence Wright wrote in his book \"God Save Texas.\"\n\nThe architect of the Republican takeover was Karl Rove, who served as a top adviser to Governor Bush. In 1995, when a vacancy opened on the state Supreme Court, Rove suggested that Bush invite Abbott to the governor's mansion for a meeting. \"He's young, he's Republican, and he's in a wheelchair,\" Rove told him. According to Texas Monthly , Bush was impressed by Abbott's positive outlook on life after the accident. Rove said, \"I knew when he finished, he was the guy Bush was looking for.\"\n\nIn Texas, Supreme Court justices are elected, and Abbott demonstrated an immediate facility for the more overtly political elements of the job. He published a newsletter called The Abbott Advisor , which provided updates on the court's activities, and he routinely gave speeches to Republican groups across the state. Colleagues and political insiders consider him to be the best fund-raiser in Texas history. Abbott raised close to three hundred million dollars in his first decade as governor, according to ProPublica. This may be a function of his trademark persistence rather than of tact. When one donor cut him a six-figure check, Abbott replied, \"Now you're in my top one hundred closest friends.\" Someone recalled a meeting in which another donor handed Abbott an envelope containing his contribution. \"He couldn't wait to tear that envelope open,\" the person told me. \"I've delivered a million checks to a million people. The one thing that's gauche is to open the check. He does that.\"\n\nAbbott's judicial philosophy tracked with the prevailing views of mainstream Republicans. But one issue was awkward for him personally. Like Bush, he was a proponent of tort reform, a Republican-led effort to fight \"frivolous lawsuits\" by capping the dollar amounts of personal damages won in civil court. When asked about his own sizable payout, Abbott maintained that he wasn't trying to block legitimate injury claims. Riddle considered the argument disingenuous. Tort-reform advocates were backed by powerful interest groups, such as the Texas Association of Business and Texans for Lawsuit Reform, which was made up of large insurers, doctors, construction companies, and retailers. \"Frivolous cases were not their enemy,\" Riddle said. \"Good, honest cases were the ones that the insurance companies had a problem with.\"\n\nRiddle and Abbott had become friends in the years after Riddle handled his case. To their mutual amusement, Riddle once argued a case before Abbott in court. But their friendship soured \"around the time that the tort-reform thing came along,\" Riddle told me. \"If Abbott's case had come along after the reform of the tort system, we could not have achieved a settlement like the one we got.\" He and Abbott never spoke again.\n\nIn 1997, most states required sitting judges to resign before running for nonjudicial office. That year, every member of the Texas Supreme Court voted to adopt such a policy-except Abbott. When he left the court, in 2001, to run for attorney general, roughly a quarter of the money that he raised for his campaign came from groups such as Texans for Lawsuit Reform, Texas Monthly reported. He outspent his opponent, won handily, and held on to the office for the next thirteen years.\n\nAs attorney general, Abbott took a number of positions that would surprise his present-day supporters. He opposed a legislative proposal to tax remittances sent home by immigrants living in Texas and a push to end birthright citizenship. According to Texas Public Radio, his office brought more than seventy cases against fraudsters who preyed on undocumented immigrants. In 2007, when Texas legislators tried to pass a series of bills toughening the state's treatment of undocumented immigrants, Abbott blocked the effort, saying that such enforcement was \"not Texas's job\" but, rather, that of the federal government.\n\nLink copied\n\nIn other areas, Abbott confirmed his partisan bona fides. In 2003, he named Ted Cruz, then a former Justice Department lawyer, as the state's solicitor general. Three years later, he created an investigative unit to uncover instances of voter fraud. Despite a $1.5-million investment, his office struggled to find any serious perpetrators; instead, it pursued people such as Gloria Meeks, a sixty-nine-year-old Black woman from Fort Worth who had helped a neighbor vote by mail. Meeks had failed to include her name and her signature on the back of her neighbor's ballot, prompting two agents from Abbott's office to visit her at home. In a sworn statement, Meeks said that the agents \"peeped into my bathroom window not once but twice while I was in my bathroom drying off from my bath.\"\n\nTexas politicians have a rich tradition of resisting the federal government, but Abbott may have done more than anyone else to professionalize the practice. This was partly a result of a new dynamic in Washington, where Congress was growing increasingly polarized. After Republicans retook the House in 2010, the view among conservatives was that President Barack Obama was overstepping his powers out of frustration with congressional inaction. \"Now we have the President acting like a king,\" Abbott said at the time. One study found that Republican attorneys general took part in legal challenges against the federal government just five times during Bill Clinton's Presidency; in the first seven years of the Obama Administration, they intervened ninety-seven times. Texas was at the center of at least thirty of these cases while Abbott was attorney general. \"I go into the office in the morning, I sue Barack Obama, and then I go home,\" he liked to say.\n\nBy 2016, the attorney general's office had spent more than six million dollars suing the White House. When critics in Texas objected to the cost, Abbott told his staff, \"Don't read the paper, don't become victim to someone else's narrative,\" John Scott, a deputy attorney general at the time, told me. Abbott's office sued the White House over the Affordable Care Act, environmental regulations, transgender rights, education policy, and immigration enforcement. In 2014, during Abbott's final month as attorney general, he challenged a federal program called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA , which would have shielded some five million people from deportation. A judge in the Southern District of Texas ultimately ruled in favor of the state.\n\nAbbott often based his legal arguments on an obscure statute called the Administrative Procedure Act, which allowed federal judges to block policies for being \"arbitrary\" and \"capricious.\" During Trump's first term, invoking the Administrative Procedure Act became the primary means by which Democratic attorneys general, as well as groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, halted the President's policies. Republicans took the same approach once Biden entered the White House. But before Abbott, Scott told me, \"nobody had ever really done that.\" To justify Texas's standing in such cases, Abbott's attorneys solicited comments from state officials affected by the President's policies. \"We went to state agencies and said, 'This is how it's going to affect you,' '' Daniel Hodge, then a top deputy in the office, said. \"We inserted ourselves as a check and balance.\"\n\nThe headquarters of Abbott's political operation is on the third floor of a nondescript building a few blocks from the capitol, in Austin. When I visited, earlier this year, campaign paraphernalia decorated the walls, and Abbott-family Christmas cards were piled on a table in the lobby, underneath a large photo of Trump after last year's assassination attempt, his face spattered with blood. I was there to meet the most influential political operative in Texas, who, luckily for me, was in town. Dave Carney, Abbott's top adviser, lives in New Hampshire. Since 1997, he has commuted to Austin every other week. \"I never thought of moving,\" he said. \"Texas is hot as hell, and they have snakes.\"\n\nCarney, who's sixty-five, is more than six feet tall, heavyset, and profane, with a gray goatee and a rumpled appearance. He served as the White House political director under President George H. W. Bush and is credited with helping Republicans win back the Senate in 1994. A Bush Cabinet member once described him as \"temperamental and a bit nuts, but he defines action-he gets stuff done.\" In 1998, Carney ran Rick Perry's successful bid for lieutenant governor. Perry, a former agriculture commissioner and state legislator, went on to serve three terms as governor. Now, with Abbott on the eve of a fourth term, Carney has been the main adviser to the two longest-serving governors in the state's history.\n\nPerry and Abbott are a study in contrasts. Perry was, as Carney put it, \"a chitchatter,\" magnetic and outgoing, with a talent for remembering names and relating to people. \"When he would meet with someone, there would be a ten-minute conversation, trying to find one thing that you and he had in common,\" Carney said. Abbott's chief characteristic, on the other hand, is lawyerly discipline. \"He reads every bill before he signs it, which is unusual,\" Carney said. Because of a quirk in the state's legislative schedule, that amounts to some eleven hundred bills in roughly twenty days. \"He does find stuff, and he'll put a note on it,\" Carney said. \"That's one of the things about Abbott. He thinks everything is going to go to court, and so, the things that he cares about, he's literally hyper-focussed on making sure that it will pass constitutional scrutiny.\"\n\nIn 2014, most of liberal America was familiar with Abbott's opponent in the governor's race: Wendy Davis, a Democratic state senator from Fort Worth who had filibustered an anti-abortion bill on the floor of the legislature for thirteen hours. Democrats from across the country poured money into her campaign, and a team of Obama-aligned operatives set up a group called Battleground Texas to help run it. \"The national media wanted the story that Texas was turning purple, that the great red bastion was being broken,\" Wayne Hamilton, who managed Abbott's campaign, told me. Davis was intent on debating Abbott, but he would do so only with strict conditions; their first debate was on a Friday night, in an auditorium without an audience. \"They definitely didn't want any attention on the real issues,\" Davis told me. Abbott linked Davis to Obama, and went on to defeat her by twenty points. Matt Angle, the director of the Lone Star Project, a Democratic PAC, told me, \"Once you get tagged as a national Democrat or a national liberal, you can't get from here to there.\"\n\nIn Abbott's first six months as governor, he vetoed more than two hundred million dollars' worth of legislative directives, but his own policy aims were largely undefined. As one former state official told me, \"He's always been an enigma. He often lacks strong opinions, unless forced to develop them by others.\" His predecessors, the person said, \"had a definitive idea of what they wanted to achieve. Abbott's often not steering. He looks at currents in the water to see which way his boat is going.\"\n\nLawmakers in Austin had considered Perry \"House trained,\" Sarah Davis, a former Republican representative from Houston, told me. \"His office would call and say he's not going to sign this bill. With Abbott, you'd get a call after it was vetoed.\" Staffers in the governor's office sometimes referred to Abbott's review of legislation as his \"ruling period.\" \"What I found interesting is the similarity between being a judge and being a governor,\" Abbott later told the Austin American-Statesman . \"You have lawyers on each side representing different interests and 99 percent of the time those interests work themselves out and the judge never really has to get involved.\"\n\nIn Texas, the governor's powers are somewhat constrained, in part because the lieutenant governor, who is elected independently, presides over the state Senate. When Abbott took office, one of his political rivals, Dan Patrick, became lieutenant governor. Patrick, a Republican ideologue with ties to Rush Limbaugh, was a former radio host who once broadcast his own vasectomy live on air. If Abbott represented Texas's Republican mainstream, Patrick was an embodiment of the Tea Party wing. Many political insiders regarded Patrick, not Abbott, as the ascendant figure in Austin.\n\nThe 2017 legislative session, which began the same month that Trump entered the White House, was dominated by causes championed by Patrick, most notably a fractious bill requiring trans students to use bathrooms that corresponded to the gender they'd been assigned at birth. A year earlier, a similar bill in North Carolina had provoked national boycotts that cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. Abbott kept his distance from the debate in Texas, leaving the speaker of the state House, a moderate Republican named Joe Straus, to fight off the effort. \"He will stay out of the conflicts where he doesn't see a clear gain for himself,\" James Henson, the director of the Texas Politics Project, at the University of Texas, told me. \"On the trans-bathroom bill, Abbott let Straus take all the heat.\"\n\nAbbott, however, was playing both sides. The chairman of the committee responsible for the bathroom bill got word from the governor's office that Abbott \"didn't want to see that bill on my desk,\" Sarah Davis told me. But when the regular session ended without the bill's passage, Abbott blamed Straus, called a special session, and added the bill back on to the agenda. Many Republican lawmakers were resigned to Abbott's public posturing. But forcing them to reconsider legislation that he didn't want passed felt like a betrayal. \"That frayed a lot of feelings,\" an Abbott staffer told me.\n\nIn the spring of 2017, Abbott signed into law a measure that allowed local law-enforcement officers to check the immigration status of anyone they arrested. Arizona had passed a similar law, but Texas's version included a component that punished sheriffs and police chiefs who didn't inquire about immigration status, by fining them or removing them from office. Several months earlier, the Travis County sheriff, Sally Hernandez, had defended Austin's sanctuary policy, which limited the city's coöperation with federal immigration enforcement. Abbott called her \"Sanctuary Sally\" and cut off more than a million dollars in grant money to the county. The new legislation, he said on Fox News, \"will put the hammer down on Travis County as well as any sanctuary-city policy in the state of Texas.\"\n\nA federal appeals court ultimately froze the provision mandating penalties for local law enforcement. But Abbott had succeeded in putting his stamp on one of the signal fights of the early Trump era. The Governor has long recognized the political utility of the immigration issue. Randall Erben, Abbott's first legislative director, said, \"He would tell us, 'This is a big deal. I want eight hundred million dollars for border security.' We'd say, 'That's a lot of money,' and he'd say, 'Yes, it is, and that's what we need.' \" When I asked O'Rourke what it was like to debate Abbott, he told me, \"If I raise the issue of poor performance in public schools or the exodus of teachers or the fact that our education lags in the state, he'll say there are Mexicans coming to kill you. If you point to the failure of the power grid, he'll point to the border.\"\n\nAs Abbott prepared for his 2018 reëlection campaign, he and Carney decided to target a region that most other Texas Republicans considered a lost cause: the borderlands, which are heavily Hispanic and historically Democratic. Carney had commissioned a focus group of Latino voters in McAllen, in South Texas, and made two unexpected findings-the voters wanted less gun control and more border security. Many of them were especially hostile to new immigrants. \"They're resentful about them taking up classroom space. They're resentful about people thinking they're illegal,\" Carney said. \"The Democrats ignore the Hispanics. They believe that demography is destiny or whatever.\" The key for Abbott and the Republicans was to increase G.O.P. turnout in South Texas, Carney said, and \"it's hard to get turnout when you don't have local candidates.\"\n\nAbbott's super PAC hired Eric Hollander, a young consultant from South Carolina, to recruit candidates for offices such as justice of the peace and county judge in places along the border where Democrats hadn't faced Republican challengers in years. \"Because Abbott would dominate in 2018, I could tell people that they could win on his coattails,\" Hollander said. With money from the PAC , Hollander paid the candidates' filing fees. His reports went to Carney, who updated the Governor each week. Ultimately, seventeen candidates backed by Abbott's PAC won their races that year. The effort benefitted Republicans in other ways, too. Early in his travels, Hollander heard from local Party members that Ted Cruz, who was running for reëlection to the U.S. Senate, was falling behind his opponent, Beto O'Rourke. \"Abbott saved Ted Cruz,\" Angle, the Democratic operative, told me. \"Cruz would have lost if it weren't for the Abbott field operation.\"\n\nThe recruitment effort, known as Project Red TX, is still operating today. In 2024, it focussed on persuading Democrats who had grown disgruntled during the Biden years. After the election, in which Trump carried almost every South Texas county and local Republicans made inroads throughout the region, I spoke with Wayne Hamilton, who runs Project Red TX. Democrats act like immigration is a \"racial thing,\" he told me. But \"it's about people who are not supposed to be here taking up resources from Texans. And Texans are the ones who have to pay for it.\" As the veteran political reporter Scott Braddock put it, \"If anyone should get credit for flipping South Texas, it's Abbott, not Trump.\"\n\nEarly one morning in July, 2023, a Venezuelan family of five hid in the brush along the banks of the Rio Grande, in the Mexican city of Piedras Negras. Cartel members patrolled the area in search of migrants to extort. On the opposite side of the river, in Eagle Pass, a phalanx of Texas guardsmen stood watch with rifles. Crossing was \"a marathon,\" a thirty-two-year-old Venezuelan man, whom I'll call Antonio, told me. He was a student organizer who'd been forced to flee the country with his wife, his sister, a one-year-old nephew, and a seven-year-old stepson. \"I came prepared on the issue of political asylum,\" he told me. He knew, in other words, that anyone who arrived in the U.S. had a legal right to seek it.\n\nWhen the family reached the shore, the guardsmen told Antonio that only women and children could enter the country. \"I don't have anywhere to go back to,\" he said. His wife began to cry. The soldiers put thick plastic cuffs on his wrists and ankles and led him away. \"You're committing the crime of trespassing,\" one of them told him.\n\nLink copied\n\nOperation Lone Star was devised to counter the legal premise that only the federal government is allowed to make immigration arrests. The governor's office, prompted by complaints from ranchers like Martín Wall, found a work-around by charging undocumented migrants with the misdemeanor of trespassing. Abbott asked landowners to sign agreements giving agents from the state's Department of Public Safety permission to make arrests on their properties. Some declined, but most didn't. Since 2021, according to the D.P.S., the state has arrested more than fifty thousand people as part of the effort.\n\nAntonio was loaded onto a van with six other men and driven to a temporary processing center. \"We didn't think this was going to be that serious,\" he said. After a day or two of sleeping on the floor of a large cell, he and the others boarded another bus and were driven two hours southeast to the Briscoe Unit, one of three retrofitted prisons that the state was using to detain people charged under Operation Lone Star. There have been widespread complaints of abysmal conditions at these facilities: rampant mold, rodent and insect infestations, spoiled food. Antonio was most bothered by being treated as a criminal. He told me that he'd never been to jail before, and that it was several days before he was allowed to speak with his wife. After a week, he posted bond and was handed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. At that point, he was given a preliminary asylum screening, which he passed. He was released with a future court date. When we spoke, in early February, he was working as a foreman on a roofing job in Utah.\n\n\"Much of Operation Lone Star feels like a very expensive form of political theatre,\" Amrutha Jindal, the executive director of Lone Star Defenders, told me. Based in Houston, she leads a group of public defenders who coördinate representation for people who are charged under Operation Lone Star and can't afford lawyers. The organization has helped some seventeen thousand defendants to date. Roughly seventy-five per cent of the cases involve trespassing.\n\nWhen Abbott first announced the initiative, he said that Texas was being forced to do the job that the federal government had shirked. But, although the state could arrest and charge migrants for trespassing, it eventually had to return them to federal immigration authorities. In effect, Jindal said, Texas was creating an elaborate \"detour.\" It was paying for thousands of agents to make arrests, for jails and processing centers and the personnel to staff them, and for dozens of judges to hear the trespassing cases. The migrants often ended up where they had started. Many, like Antonio, had credible asylum claims; others were simply released because ICE resources were limited.\n\nAt the same time, the state still had to deal with people who were eventually deported. To get out of criminal detention, roughly forty per cent of migrants charged with trespassing under Operation Lone Star pleaded out. About half of them posted bond, which on average was twenty-seven hundred dollars, an unusually steep sum. Even after being deported, defendants were required to attend virtual hearings with a Texas judge; those who failed to appear forfeited their bond. \"There are thousands of cases in Kinney and Maverick Counties where the clients are no longer in the country,\" Jindal told me. \"On Zoom, you see the background behind a defendant, and it's a ranch in Honduras or Guatemala.\"\n\nDavid Martínez, a warm and voluble lawyer in his sixties, is the attorney for Val Verde County, about an hour north of Eagle Pass. His brother, Joe Frank Martínez, is the sheriff. Both are lifelong Democrats, with moderate politics that have allowed them to survive the steady rightward shift in Del Rio, a border city of about thirty-five thousand people, where the brothers grew up and now live. Shortly after Operation Lone Star was announced, the D.P.S. section chief from Laredo came to town to explain the new policy. David told him, \"I don't ever have a problem prosecuting a case when I've got a good case to prosecute.\"\n\nProblems emerged a few months later, when he started receiving case files. Footage from the body and dashboard cameras of D.P.S. troopers showed them leading migrants from public to private land, where they could be arrested for trespassing. \"A D.P.S. trooper would direct a group of people to walk through that gate right there, or to sit under that tree and to wait until someone comes,\" David told me. \"I probably ended up dismissing or rejecting close to sixty per cent of the cases.\" He dropped other cases because people were languishing in pretrial detention. By law, the county attorney had a month to press charges against someone before it had to release them. David said, \"There were way too many occasions where, when I got the file, I would learn that that person had already been sitting in jail for sixty days, ninety days, or one hundred and twenty days.\"\n\nAt meetings of the Texas District and County Attorneys Association, David raised his concerns. \"Voices like mine were being drowned out by the louder voices of 'We've got to get behind the Governor, we've got to put a stop to this illegal-immigration problem,' \" he said. A friend with connections to Abbott's office called David one day to tell him that he was \"on the Governor's radar.\" David replied, \"He can call me and I'm happy to discuss why I'm making the decisions that I'm making.\" The call never came.\n\nJoe Frank, his brother, was on better terms with Abbott. When he expressed misgivings about the county's limited detention space, Abbott called him personally, on a Saturday, and offered to erect a large processing center in the parking lot of the county jail. People are now detained there before the state buses them to the Briscoe Unit, at virtually no cost to the county. \"I appreciate what the Governor did,\" Joe Frank told me. Three years later, on the eve of his reëlection bid for sheriff, he received a call from Project Red TX, inviting him to switch parties. When he declined, the group tried to unseat him. He won, but the race was unexpectedly tight. During the campaign, Project Red TX highlighted a photo of him helping to pull a young mother and her child from the Rio Grande. The image neglected to show the full context: he was standing in front of a large group of D.P.S. and Border Patrol agents, who were waiting to take her into custody.\n\nAbbott's supporters and detractors can all agree on one point central to his political rise: the Biden Administration, by mishandling the situation at the border, created a vacuum for the Governor to exploit. In the summer of 2021, shortly after Abbott launched Operation Lone Star, he held a summit in Del Rio. Owing to smuggling routes and migration patterns, the city historically has been spared the humanitarian emergencies that have flared up elsewhere along the border. But that was changing. In September, 2021, fifteen thousand migrants, most of them from Haiti, got trapped under a bridge between Del Rio and Ciudad Acuña, Mexico. The next year, the Border Patrol released forty-nine thousand people to a city shelter; in 2023, it was fifty-seven thousand.\n\nClose to a thousand people showed up to the summit, including officials, ranchers, and residents from outside the county. Local Democrats and Republicans approached Abbott with different versions of the same plea: to transfer the newly arrived migrants to bigger cities with more resources. When several people suggested sending buses to places like Dallas, Abbott dismissed the idea. \"That doesn't help,\" Gardner Pate, then a senior aide to Abbott, told me. \"You take them from Del Rio and you send them to Corpus Christi, or you send them to Houston. It's the same from a Texas point of view.\"\n\nBack in Austin, Abbott began holding meetings with top staffers from the Texas Division of Emergency Management. They concluded that it would be better to send migrants not only out of the state but to sanctuary cities. The question was how. \"We could not get big enough planes to land on runways in Eagle Pass and Del Rio,\" Luis Saenz, Abbott's chief of staff at the time, told me. Someone suggested chartering smaller planes, but that was too expensive. \"Why don't we send buses?\" Abbott said.\n\nThe busing strategy, he told his staff, couldn't be just a \"one-time thing.\" It needed to withstand federal scrutiny. \"Before we put one person on a bus, Abbott and the legal team were looking at us and saying, 'We can't be accused of kidnapping,' \" Saenz told me. \"We knew the Biden Administration would prosecute anyone if they could. So that's when we came up with notices in English, Spanish, and other languages and had people sign them saying that they knew where they were going.\"\n\nThe federal government can't hold all the migrants it takes into custody. It usually releases a large share of them to local shelters, many of which are bootstrap operations that rely on donations to provide clothes, food, and other assistance. The lone shelter in Del Rio, the Val Verde Border Humanitarian Coalition, can't even house migrants overnight. On a cold morning in January, Tiffany Burrow, the head of the shelter, met with me in an unheated room with racks of clothes and shoes. Three years earlier, W. Nim Kidd, the head of the state's Division of Emergency Management, had visited Val Verde with a proposition for Burrow. The state wanted to bus migrants to Washington. Would she help them do it?\n\nBurrow was skeptical of Kidd's pitch, but the situation was dire enough that she made a counterproposal. \"We can't have buses running 24/7,\" she said. \"There has to be a curfew. There has to be coördination and contingency plans for drivers, in case of a flat tire or if a woman goes into labor. And I needed to have someone I could speak with in the receiving city.\" It was unsettling that Texas didn't seem to be making arrangements with state or local authorities farther north, Burrow said, but that was beyond her control. Without some form of intervention, she told me, \"this area would have been overrun.\"\n\nKidd offered to let Burrow travel on one of the first buses to Washington. \"That trip set the baseline,\" Burrow said. \"We weren't aligned on the why. But there was a sense of decency, and it matched the motive of humanitarian aid that we had here.\"\n\nAbbott staffers insist that the busing program was as much a policy necessity as it was a political maneuver. But the Governor's advisers admitted that they'd expected a more dramatic response when the earliest buses arrived in Washington. \"No one in D.C. seemed to care,\" Carney said. \"So we sent them to the Naval Observatory\"-where Vice-President Kamala Harris lived-\"and it got a little attention.\"\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Times , Texas sent some six thousand migrants to Washington before it bused a single person to New York. But that didn't mean New York wasn't feeling a new sort of strain. As the over-all number of arrivals at the border increased, the federal government was forced to release more people in nearby towns and cities. \"The nonprofits couldn't keep up,\" Saenz told me. These groups, together with local officials, started sending their own buses to cities outside the state. That, rather than Abbott's busing program, is what appears to have first led New York's mayor, Eric Adams, to call out Abbott publicly, in July, 2022. \"Adams says, you know, Governor Abbott is a mean bastard or whatever, sending these people up here, using people as political pawns,\" Carney recalled. \"But we hadn't fucking sent anybody to New York.\" (Kayla Mamelak Altus, a spokesperson for Adams, told me, \"We asked people who sent you here, and they told us the Texas government.\")\n\nAdams's statements helped generate headlines and \"nationalize\" the scheme, a former Abbott aide said. Carney told me that, when Abbott saw the news, \"he said, 'If I'm going to get blamed, then I'm going to get the fucking credit.' So we asked people, 'Who wants to go to New York?' Everyone wanted to go. So we just started up the buses.\" Eventually, Abbott would send forty-five thousand people to New York, most of them Venezuelans, along with another thirty-seven thousand people to Chicago, nineteen thousand to Denver, and twelve thousand to Washington.\n\nBy the middle of September, Abbott hadn't just confounded Democrats; he'd inspired Republican copycats. Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, who was preparing to run for President the following year, spent $1.5 million flying forty-nine migrants to Martha's Vineyard. DeSantis's office had paid an operative who recruited migrants in San Antonio, often by misleading them about where they were going. After a county sheriff in Texas filed kidnapping charges, DeSantis's chief of staff called Abbott's office to admit that they'd made a mistake. He then asked if Abbott might say that both governors had been working together all along. Abbott declined, but he and his staff kept quiet about the request.\n\nLink copied\n\nThe busing continued for more than two years, but Burrow participated for only eighteen months. She pulled out, she told me, when it became clear that the priorities in Austin had changed. \"They got big in the head,\" she said. \"They said, We're going to make a command center. We're going to send buses to every state in the country. We're going to run them 24/7, and we don't want to say where the buses were going.\" City officials in Del Rio continued the busing, but, by the start of 2024, arrivals started to decrease. The governor's office \"wanted the headlines to explode,\" Burrow said. \"But, at that moment, the actual number was about to take a dive.\"\n\nIn December and January, when I travelled along the border, the general atmosphere was sleepy, but evidence of Operation Lone Star was everywhere. The Governor had set up two \"forward operating bases\" for the Texas National Guard, in Eagle Pass and Del Rio. D.P.S. pickup trucks filled parking lots and roadways. I asked the manager at a La Quinta Inn where I was staying why everything in the hotel seemed so new. The hotel had been built just two years earlier, he told me, to accommodate all the state agents staying in town because of Operation Lone Star.\n\nThe flood of agents brought their own problems. In El Paso, a heavily Democratic city in West Texas, local officials have been documenting a rise in high-speed car chases initiated by the D.P.S. in pursuit of alleged human smugglers. There was a six-hundred-and-twenty-five-per-cent increase in such chases between 2022 and 2023, according to the El Paso County attorney's office. Most of them began in the western end of town, along the border with New Mexico, where D.P.S. troopers were getting tipped off by sympathetic Border Patrol agents. Eighty-five per cent of the incidents started with a routine traffic violation, but about half involved pursuits that reached more than a hundred miles per hour. Residents have complained about chases in their neighborhoods and around schools, hospitals, and places of worship. \"It all coincided with Operation Lone Star,\" Christina Sanchez, the county attorney, told me.\n\nJust before Christmas, I visited Sanchez at her office downtown, next to the county jail. She and her staff were seeing markedly more accidents as a result of the chases, some of them fatal. One of them, in July, 2023, resulted in a collision with two other cars on the road, sending nine people to the hospital. Another, in October, 2024, led to a crash that killed a forty-four-year-old mother on her way to work. A Human Rights Watch investigation found that, in communities where Operation Lone Star was in effect, vehicle pursuits have caused a hundred and six deaths and more than three hundred injuries. \"There are no D.P.S. policy guidelines for how they conduct these chases,\" Sanchez told me. \"We have the buoys, the concertina wire, we have the troopers. But that increased activity doesn't necessarily equate to a safer environment for the community.\"\n\nThe city and county governments in El Paso have clashed with Abbott before. During the pandemic, a local judge challenged an order from the Governor that banned mask mandates and required businesses to reopen. County officials have joined lawsuits against some of the state's immigration policies. Abbott's repeated claims that the state was being \"invaded\" by migrants were especially jarring to city residents. In 2019, a twenty-one-year-old from a small town outside Dallas had travelled to a Walmart in El Paso and opened fire with a semi-automatic assault rifle, killing twenty-three shoppers. In an online post before the attack, the shooter had written about the \"Hispanic invasion of Texas\" and claimed to be \"simply defending my country.\"\n\nTo qualify for state grants under Operation Lone Star, the city and the county had to issue disaster declarations. Sanchez told me that officials initially \"held off at the local level because there really was this concern about what we're saying to our community with language like 'invasion.' \" Their hesitation was costly. El Paso gets money from the U.S. government for holding federal inmates in county jails-typically, about thirty-three thousand dollars a day. By law, however, El Paso had to give priority to state detainees, including those arrested under Operation Lone Star. The city declared an emergency in December, 2022, and the county finally followed suit in July, 2024. But the sums that they eventually received from state grants didn't cover the budget shortfalls.\n\nLate last year, Sergio Coronado, an El Paso County commissioner, met with D.P.S. representatives to communicate his concerns. His constituents, in addition to complaining about the high-speed chases, had reported being racially profiled. One evening in October, 2023, a family of four was driving on the west side of the city when a blue Silverado abruptly stopped in front of their car. According to a statement taken by the county commissioner's office, a white vehicle then boxed them in from behind. Agents got out and surrounded the car with their guns drawn. They were looking for smugglers and had stopped the wrong vehicle. In 2023, a forty-eight-year-old El Paso resident was taking medicine to her grandmother when she was arrested by state troopers on a stakeout, who had mistaken her for a smuggler. \"They heard us out,\" Coronado told me of the D.P.S. agents. \"But I didn't get the feeling that they were going to be responsive.\"\n\nAt one point, Coronado asked the agents why, with the state spending more than eleven billion dollars on Operation Lone Star, the D.P.S. didn't use helicopters to conduct the chases in a more responsible manner. \"Our helicopter is in Lubbock,\" he was told. \"It needs repairs.\"\n\nIn the same special session in which Abbott's voucher proposal was defeated, the legislature passed a sweeping and audacious immigration-enforcement bill. \"These measures were deliberately paired,\" a senior House aide told me. \"The immigration bill kept things more or less in line.\"\n\nThe measure, known as Senate Bill 4, allows state officials to arrest anyone they suspect of crossing the border illegally and, if they're undocumented, to deport them. The bill appeared to contradict a 2012 Supreme Court ruling that struck down sections of a similar law in Arizona, on the ground that it preëmpted federal authority over immigration. (Antonin Scalia, in a forceful dissent, wrote, \"As a sovereign, Arizona has the inherent power to exclude persons from its territory.\") The Biden Justice Department sued Texas, arguing that the state was usurping the powers of the federal government, and the case went to a federal appeals court. Last March, on the same day that Texas's solicitor general defended S.B. 4 before the appellate judges, Abbott spoke at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a right-wing think tank in Austin. \"We found ways to try to craft that law to be consistent with the dissent that was wrote in the Arizona case by Justice Scalia,\" he said.\n\nWith Trump in the White House, the Justice Department is no longer expected to contest S.B. 4 in court. Lucas Guttentag, a former senior adviser at the Justice Department and a professor at Stanford Law School, told me that the Trump Administration \"will abandon the principle that the U.S. fought for and won before the Supreme Court in the Arizona case-namely, that the federal government must have sole authority over the enforcement of immigration laws.\"\n\nThere are strategic reasons for this reversal. The new Administration's first set of executive orders made the same argument that Abbott did when he declared a state emergency: the country is in the midst of an \"invasion.\" But ICE has already struggled to deliver on the deportation numbers that Trump campaigned on. Three top officials at the agency have been demoted as a result. Thomas Homan, the President's so-called border czar, has said that he is \"not happy.\" The most obvious way for the federal government to boost arrests is to enlist states in its wider enforcement effort.\n\nTexas will almost certainly be a key partner. The state's land commissioner, Dawn Buckingham, has offered the Administration a fourteen-hundred-acre ranch in Starr County to build a detention facility. \"We have thirteen million acres around the state,\" she said. \"We want them to be able to utilize that.\" In January, Homan spent a night at the governor's mansion before he and Abbott visited members of the Texas National Guard in Eagle Pass. \"The cavalry is here,\" Abbott told them.\n\nThe D.P.S. agents who'd been policing private land were now, on Abbott's orders, working with the Department of Homeland Security to \"track down the thousands of illegal immigrants with active warrants across Texas and deport them from our country.\" The Texas National Guard, for its part, has radically broadened its remit. On January 31st, the Trump Administration signed an agreement with Abbott that relied on a previously unused section of the Immigration and Nationality Act called the \"mass-influx provision,\" which gives state law-enforcement officers the powers of federal immigration agents. According to the agreement, the Texas National Guard can now deport migrants. This will not only \"massively increase the government's resources beyond what's currently appropriated\" by Congress, Guttentag told me. \"It unleashes this separate immigrant-detention-and-deportation force at the state level.\" Operation Lone Star, he added, \"is a preview of the illegality, inhumanity, and sheer cruelty that results.\"\n\nIn 2021, Abbott's disaster declaration automatically suspended laws governing how the state spent money on Operation Lone Star. Four years later, those temporary measures have essentially become permanent. The Texas Observer recently reported that at least $3.5 billion in Operation Lone Star funding has gone to no-bid contracts and emergency procurement orders. Executives at some of the companies benefitting from the state's largesse have made generous donations to Abbott's campaign fund. Operation Lone Star, in the meantime, has become a significant part of the Texas economy. Already, the state legislature is proposing another $6.5 billion for border security. A few weeks ago, with migrant-arrival numbers at historic lows, Starr County declared a border disaster. It hadn't done so at any point in the past four years, but, according to the Texas Tribune , the county wanted money for more prosecutors because a state program had been cut. Its best chance of accessing the funds was applying through Operation Lone Star.\n\nIn mid-February, while the Trump Administration was slashing the federal budget and firing thousands of government employees, Abbott travelled to Washington to make a request. In meetings with Trump, and then with House Speaker Mike Johnson, he explained that he wanted Congress to reimburse Texas for the cost of Operation Lone Star, which he called \"services rendered.\" \"This is a payment for real-estate assets and improvements provided by the state,\" he said. Carney, Abbott's political adviser, put it more simply. \"It wasn't a Texas thing as much as an American thing,\" he told me. \"I think everybody recognizes that Texas went above and beyond.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Are Texas Republicans Budging on Gun Control?\n\nDon McLaughlin, the Mayor of Uvalde, got his first gun at age fourteen-a pistol his parents bought for him. \"I just fell in love with it,\" he told me last week, as we spoke in Uvalde's stately brick city hall, across the street from a memorial for the nineteen students and two teachers who were killed at Robb Elementary School by a teen-age gunman on May 24th. McLaughlin's preferred home-defense weapon is a shotgun, which he keeps in the closet. He has a license to carry from both Texas and Virginia, and he often wears a concealed pistol, although he hasn't been doing so recently. \"I wouldn't carry one in Uvalde right now, with all this tragedy, for anything,\" he said. \"There's one in my car, though.\"\n\nSince the shooting in his home town, however, McLaughlin has been wondering if there's something amiss in the American approach to firearms. While state officials talk about arming teachers and \"hardening\" schools, he's been having conversations about gun-control policies. He's not the only one. Last week, more than two hundred and fifty self-identified gun enthusiasts, including some prominent Republican donors, published a letter in the Dallas Morning News calling for a more robust set of proposals-expanded background checks and red-flag laws; raising the age to purchase a rifle to twenty-one-than the ones included in the bipartisan legislation currently under discussion in the Senate. \"Most law enforcement experts believe these measures would make a difference,\" the letter read.  After a decade of political capitulation to the most uncompromising fringe of the gun-rights lobby, some gun enthusiasts are uneasy with where it's led them.\n\nTexas, home of the first mass shooting of the modern era (the tower shooting at the University of Texas, in 1966), has, in the past decade, amassed a grim and growing list of communities marked by similar tragedies: Sutherland Springs , Santa Fe , Dallas , Midland, El Paso , and now Uvalde. At the same time, the state's gun laws have become increasingly permissive. In 2015, Texas began allowing permit holders to carry weapons openly in most public places. Last year, the state removed the requirement for a permit; now, nearly anyone older than twenty-one who is legally allowed to purchase a handgun can carry it, openly or concealed, in almost all public places. (Texas does not limit the public carrying of long guns.) That change was part of a wave of permitless-carry bills passed in more than two dozen states, most recently Georgia and Ohio. Despite their rapid proliferation, such laws were not overwhelmingly popular, even among gun owners. According to a 2015 poll by the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, only eighteen per cent of Texas voters who identified as \"extremely conservative\" believed that Texans should be able to publicly carry a handgun without a license.\n\nIn the days after the Uvalde shooting, protesters gathered outside the National Rifle Association 's convention in Houston. But the real energy driving today's gun policy, and gun rhetoric, comes from newer, more aggressive groups, such as Gun Owners of America and the National Association for Gun Rights. The N.R.A., for all its bombast, has been willing to negotiate on gun-control measures; G.O.A. and its ilk seem less interested in cutting deals than in waging a permanent war, and have no qualms about attacking Republicans who show an inclination to compromise. \"The idea that the Republican constituency wants unrestricted gun ownership and gun rights is not quite accurate,\" Jim Henson, the director of the Texas Politics Project, told me. \"But it illustrates the degree to which a minority of Republican public opinion, the most conservative, is driving politics and policy within the Party.\" The N.R.A. has not yet made a statement about the Senate gun-control bill, but G.O.A. decried its tepid reforms as \"gun grabbing,\" and the N.A.G.R. told supporters that it would \"strip\" them of the \"right to keep and bear arms.\"\n\nIn 1993, when Jerry Patterson was a state senator and \" the gun guy in Texas,\" as he put it to me, he wrote legislation that would allow permit-holding Texans to carry a concealed handgun in public. Ann Richards, the governor at the time, vetoed the bill and, in short order, was voted out; Texas hasn't elected a Democrat to the office since. \"We passed it, and she vetoed it, and that was-if not the reason-then one of the major reasons she lost to George W. Bush,\" Patterson said. \"So I like to think I made George W. Bush President.\"\n\nPatterson's concealed-carry bill eventually passed, but he is now in the uncomfortable position of questioning his party's stance on gun rights. \"Somebody said, 'You're bold for a Republican,' \" he told me. \"Well, I'm not on the ballot ever again.\" (Patterson left state office in 2015.) Since the nineties, Patterson said, gun rights have become solidly aligned with the Republican Party. \"Back then, we had a lot more Democrats who were pro-gun, and some Republicans that were not,\" he said. \"What's happened since is the polarization of the parties in every subject, on everything. And that's because we've made the legislative and congressional districts competitive only in the primary.\" To win over primary voters, Republican candidates pushed gun-rights policies-even what Patterson called \"silly stuff\"-to endear themselves to the base. Gun-control measures, even those with widespread popular appeal, such as expanded background checks and red-flag laws, were off the table.\n\n\"I don't think we did anything to make [shootings like Uvalde] more likely,\" he said. \"But we didn't do anything to make it less likely.\" I asked how it felt to be behind his fellow-Republicans on gun-rights issues, after having once been out in front. \"I think the Party is behind me ,\" he said, explaining that he thinks Republicans will come around to enacting some gun-control measures-perhaps establishing red-flag laws, or a repeal of unlicensed concealed carry-in the next few years. \"How many people will die in that interim? I don't know.\"\n\nPatterson is equivocal on the AR-15, the semi-automatic rifle that, in its polarizing magnetism, has become the focus of the gun debate: emblazoned on bumper stickers, T-shirts, and yard signs by its supporters; deemed a \"death machine\" by its detractors. AR-style rifles aren't a great choice for hunting, unless you're going after big groups of feral hogs, for which it is the weapon of choice. The gun-rights advocacy of the eighties and nineties was handgun-centric; advocates believed that law-abiding citizens needed a weapon close at hand to defend themselves against rampant street crime. For those who came of age in that era, the AR, in its brash unconcealability, functions more as a symbol than as a tool. \"I don't really like them. I don't use them,\" Patterson said. \"It's a look-at-me gun.\" (He nonetheless thinks that a ban would be practically ineffective and a waste of political capital.)\n\nHis feelings were echoed by McLaughlin, who said he bought his AR-15 \"after Obama got elected President and they talked about outlawing them.\" \"It's still got the tags on it in the safe. I've never taken it out. I don't like shooting it. I hunt with an over-and-under shotgun or a bolt-action deer rifle. I'm not a fan of that deal.\" (He, too, opposes a ban.)\n\nMcLaughlin told me that he doesn't identify as a Republican: \"Do I lean more to the red? Yes. Do I agree with everything they do? No.\" (He regularly appears on Fox News and, earlier this year, declined to endorse Greg Abbott for governor in the Republican primary, opting instead for a challenger who accused Abbott of being soft on border security and supporting \"transgender ideology.\") After the shooting at Robb Elementary School, McLaughlin thought about the roles of social media, the lack of mental-health care in rural areas, and violent video games. But he was also coming to believe that gun-control measures would be necessary. \"Mental health and gun control-they go hand in hand,\" he told me.\n\nHe checked his ideas with his twenty-two-year-old son, who regularly uses an AR-15 to shoot hogs and targets out on the family ranch. \"He said, 'There's nothing wrong with an expanded background check, nothing wrong with raising the age to twenty-one. I might even go so far as to say that you have to take an extra class before you get that AR. What's wrong with that?' \" McLaughlin told me. \"Let's regulate it in a way that's safe for everyone.

      "text": "The Supreme Court's Abortion Decision Has Given Beto O'Rourke a Fighting Chance\n\nLast year, the Texas legislature passed a law to ban nearly all abortions in the state if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The Court did, and, on August 25th, Texas's law went into effect: people who are convicted of performing an abortion in the state now face a sentence of up to life in prison, and a fine of at least a hundred thousand dollars. That morning, Beto O'Rourke , who is running for governor, stopped by Houston Women's Reproductive Services, an abortion clinic that is no longer providing abortions, where he decried what he called \"the most extreme law in the country.\"\n\nEven before the trigger law went into effect, Texas's punitive abortion policies were generating uncertainty and fear-and political opportunities for Democrats. O'Rourke appeared alongside Elizabeth Weller, one of a number of Texas women carrying nonviable fetuses who have been forced to continue their pregnancies despite physical and emotional risks. In May, during Weller's eighteenth week of pregnancy, her water broke. Doctors determined that her amniotic sac had ruptured; the fetus would not survive outside the womb. After consulting with her physician, Weller and her husband decided to have the pregnancy terminated, but, because of uncertainty about the legal circumstances in Texas, the hospital refused to perform the procedure unless she developed certain severe symptoms, she said. \"The administration of the hospital told me that I was not sick enough at the time that this happened to me,\" she said. \"And they sent me home to wait for either my baby to die or for me to incur an infection.\" After several days, as Weller's symptoms worsened, an ethics board finally determined that she could undergo the procedure .\n\nA few months ago, Governor Greg Abbott had a double-digit lead over O'Rourke, but during the summer that gap shrank significantly. The new law and the shooting in Uvalde have kept Texas's policies on abortion and guns in the news. \"That's not optimal for the Governor,\" James Henson, of the University of Texas at Austin's Texas Politics Project, said. \"That's not the election environment they were looking for.\" Fifty-nine per cent of Texans believe that the state is on the wrong track, according to a survey by the Texas Politics Project, the highest number since the poll started, in 2009. \"There's a lot of discontent out there,\" Henson said. \"The stock Republican campaign of the last decade, decade and a half, has been talking about Texas prosperity. That doesn't land quite as well when the mood is so sour.\"\n\nO'Rourke ran for Senate in 2018, against Ted Cruz, and narrowly lost. He largely declined to make negative comments about Cruz until the final weeks of that campaign, but this time he has pointedly blamed Texas's woes on Abbott. The O'Rourke campaign's first two TV ads, released in late August, condemn the trigger law in manifestly Texan terms. \"This is a free country,\" a man, identified in the ad as a lifelong Republican, says. \"We need a governor who gets that.\" The recent vote on a ballot measure in Kansas, where voters overwhelmingly chose to keep the right to abortion in the state constitution, gave new hope that the issue could be a mobilizing factor, even in states that skew conservative. \"I watch the polls. It's made a difference,\" Laran Vondo, an attendee at an O'Rourke rally in Fort Bend County on a late-August afternoon, told me. \"I believe in my heart that Roe v. Wade-they gave us a gift when they overturned that.\"\n\nIf O'Rourke, or any Democrat vying for statewide office, is to win, persuading suburban voters will be essential. Fort Bend County, a sprawl of developments southwest of Houston, illustrates both the possibilities and the limitations of banking on the suburbs. The once rural area voted reliably Republican for half a century until, boosted by Houston's supercharged growth, it more than doubled in population between 2000 and 2020, becoming one of the more diverse counties in the nation. In 2016, Hillary Clinton was the first Democratic Presidential candidate to win Fort Bend since Lyndon Johnson. Two years later, O'Rourke doubled her margin, winning the county by about twelve points.\n\nO'Rourke outperformed expectations in the suburbs, and his close loss to Cruz seemed to portend the long-awaited purpling of Texas, where no Democrat has been elected to statewide office since 1994. In 2020, Democrats made a splashy effort to win control of the Texas House, targeting twenty-two seats they considered vulnerable. One was in District 28, in Fort Bend, where a moderate Republican had just resigned, triggering a special election. Democrats spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on the off-season campaign. Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren endorsed the Democratic candidate, Eliz Markowitz, and O'Rourke and Michael Bloomberg block-walked on her behalf. But Markowitz lost the special election by sixteen points and didn't do much better in the regular election a few months later. Democrats needed to pick up nine seats to flip the House; they didn't win a single new one. \"Why did we not do better? I think Democrats were frankly outworked by Republicans,\" O'Rourke told me, last week. \"Democrats, in the middle of a pandemic, were literally phoning it in. And the Trump campaign, and Republicans statewide, were really hungry. That's why what you see from us in 2022 is making sure that we go everywhere, earn every vote, write nobody off, and take nobody for granted.\"\n\nEven as Texas suburbs trend more competitive, they've become the sites of the state's most vicious culture wars. Ultraconservative groups have successfully taken over ostensibly nonpartisan school boards in the North Texas suburbs and have said that they hope to expand elsewhere in the state. The big news in Fort Bend County the week I visited was about a mother in the city of Katy who'd filed a criminal complaint, citing a book in a high-school library that she considered \"harmful.\" (The book, \" Flamer ,\" by Mike Curato, is a semi-autobiographical graphic novel about a closeted teen-ager at Boy Scout camp; it won a Lambda Literary Award in 2021.)\n\nBut Texas Republicans' pandering to their radical fringe has offered O'Rourke an opportunity to position himself as the reasonable alternative, and the abortion law provides him with a particularly strong case. Eighty per cent of Texans, including more than seventy per cent of Republicans, support access to abortion for victims of rape and incest-for whom the law makes no allowance-according to the Texas Politics Project's polling. O'Rourke is making an overt play for these voters, releasing a series of social-media posts featuring former Republican voters who have switched allegiance. \"I've always been a bit more conservative-leaning, but I find his passion intriguing,\" a middle-aged woman in a floral blouse told me, at an O'Rourke event in a San Antonio bookstore. When I asked her about the abortion law, she sighed. \"That's a hard one. For me to lean toward the middle on that is . . . \" she said, widening her eyes theatrically. \"But I've come to see there are gray areas.\"\n\nIn his campaign appearances, O'Rourke is emphasizing another area in which some of his views align with the majority of Texans': gun restrictions. During its 2021 session, the legislature removed many limits on carrying firearms in public. In the aftermath of the Uvalde shooting, perpetrated by a young man who bought two AR-style rifles days after his eighteenth birthday, O'Rourke has been pushing to raise the minimum age for buying such weapons to twenty-one. The idea is broadly popular in Texas, even with the notably conservative mayor of Uvalde, who is no fan of O'Rourke. Families of Uvalde victims, as well as the Uvalde city council and the school board, have asked Abbott to call a special session to enact the policy; so far, he has declined to. (O'Rourke is also advocating red-flag laws and universal background checks, which are likewise supported by a majority of Texans.)\n\nRepublicans have done their best to paint O'Rourke as a gun-seizing radical. But not everyone is buying it. \"I'm anti-government, and she's more left,\" Tyrel Dunaway told me at the event in Fort Bend, gesturing at his girlfriend, who was wearing a pink Beto 2022 shirt. \"She gets mad at me for going around the house saying, 'Taxation is theft!' But I agree with most of his policies.\" Dunaway, a hunter and a fan of sport-shooting, said that he found O'Rourke's views on guns \"very sensible\": \"I have kids in school. After Uvalde, for two days I couldn't sleep, just thinking that we could've done something, but we didn't.\"\n\nTo win, O'Rourke will have to overcome the obstacle of negative partisanship, which is strong in Texas-and particularly so when it comes to him. But his opponent faces similar challenges; Abbott's disapproval rating is higher than Ted Cruz's was in the months before O'Rourke lost to him. \"It's one thing for a Republican to not agree with the abortion law, but it's another thing entirely to vote for Beto O'Rourke,\" Henson said. \"But there's a lot more uncertainty about that now than there was six months ago.\"\n\nOutside the venue where the Fort Bend rally had happened, a group of about ten protesters held signs with slogans that included \"Defund the Media\" and \"Unborn Lives Matter.\" The head of the Fort Bend County Young Republicans, a freckled woman with a delicate gold necklace, told me that her group was there to protest O'Rourke, but had also recently protested on behalf of the unborn, for instance, at a Planned Parenthood in Fort Bend County. With abortion essentially banned in Texas, some Republicans are considering even more radical action. The state has already got creative with its anti-abortion legislation, most notably via S.B. 8, which allows private citizens to file civil suits against anyone who \"aids and abets\" an abortion in the state, with a minimum award of ten thousand dollars. The Texas Freedom Caucus, a group of the most conservative state legislators, has threatened to propose a number of additional measures: making it a felony to pay for abortions or abortion-related expenses in another state; criminalizing employers who cover abortion in their health plans. One legislator intends to introduce a bill that would allow district attorneys to prosecute across jurisdictions in abortion cases, after some Texas D.A.s said that they wouldn't pursue charges against people seeking abortions.\n\nInside the venue, O'Rourke painted his candidacy in historical terms, invoking the Voting Rights Act, Appomattox, Selma. Fifty years ago, he noted, women in Texas didn't have the right to an abortion, either. \"No one rode to our rescue or saved the day,\" he said, pointing out that it was a Dallas woman, known as Jane Roe, and her two Texan lawyers, who took Roe v. Wade to the Supreme Court. \"And I bet you it's going to be Texas women today who win it back.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "America's Future Is Texas\n\nWhen Frederick Law Olmsted passed through Texas, in 1853, he became besotted with the majesty of the Texas legislature. \"I have seen several similar bodies at the North; the Federal Congress; and the Parliament of Great Britain, in both its branches, on occasions of great moment; but none of them commanded my involuntary respect for their simple manly dignity and trustworthiness for the duties that engaged them, more than the General Assembly of Texas,\" he wrote . This passage is possibly unique in the political chronicles of the state. Fairly considered, the Texas legislature is more functional than the United States Congress, and more genteel than the House of Commons. But a recurrent crop of crackpots and ideologues has fed the state's reputation for aggressive know-nothingism and proudly retrograde politics.\n\nI've lived in Texas for most of my life, and I've come to appreciate what the state symbolizes, both to people who live here and to those who view it from afar. Texans see themselves as a distillation of the best qualities of America: friendly, confident, hardworking, patriotic, neurosis-free. Outsiders see us as the nation's id, a place where rambunctious and disavowed impulses run wild. Texans, it is thought, mindlessly celebrate individualism, and view government as a kind of kryptonite that weakens the entrepreneurial muscles. We're reputed to be braggarts; careless with money and our personal lives; a little gullible, but dangerous if crossed; insecure, but obsessed with power and prestige.\n\nTexans, however, are hardly monolithic. The state is as politically divided as the rest of the nation. One can drive across it and be in two different states at the same time: FM Texas and AM Texas. FM Texas is the silky voice of city dwellers, the kingdom of NPR. It is progressive, blue, reasonable, secular, and smug-almost like California. AM Texas speaks to the suburbs and the rural areas: Trumpland. It's endless bluster and endless ads. Paranoia and piety are the main items on the menu.\n\nTexas has been growing at a stupefying rate for decades. The only state with more residents is California, and the number of Texans is projected to double by 2050, to 54.4 million, almost as many people as in California and New York combined. Three Texas cities-Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio-are already among the top ten most populous in the country. The eleventh largest is Austin, the capital, where I live. For the past five years, it has been one of the fastest-growing large cities in America; it now has nearly a million people, dwarfing the college town I fell in love with almost forty years ago. Because Texas represents so much of modern America-the South, the West, the plains, the border, the Latino community, the divide between rural areas and cities-what happens here tends to disproportionately affect the rest of the nation. Illinois and New Jersey may be more corrupt, and Kansas and Louisiana more out of whack, but they don't bear the responsibility of being the future.\n\nI've always had a fascination with Texas's outsized politics. In 2000, I wrote a play that was set in the state's House of Representatives. The protagonist, Sonny Lamb, was a rancher from West Texas who represented House District 74, which, in real life, stretches across thirty-seven thousand square miles. (That's larger than Indiana.) While I was doing research for the play, I met in Austin with Pete Laney, a Democrat and a cotton farmer from Hale County, who, at the time, was the speaker of the House. Laney was known as a scrupulously fair and honest leader who inspired a bipartisan spirit among the members. The grateful representatives called him Dicknose.\n\nWe sat down in the Speaker's office, at the capitol. I explained that I was having a plot problem: my hero had introduced an ethics-reform bill, which triggered a war with the biggest lobbyist in the state. How could the lobbyist retaliate? Laney rubbed his hands together. \"Well, you could put a toxic-waste dump in Sonny's district,\" he observed. \"That would mess him up, right and left.\"\n\nLaney's suggestion was inspired by an actual law that the Texas House of Representatives had passed in 1991. It allowed sewage sludge from New York City to be shipped, by train, to a little desert town in District 74, Sierra Blanca, which is eighty miles southeast of El Paso. The train became known as the Poo-Poo Choo-Choo.\n\n\"Another thing,\" I said. \"I'd like my lobbyist to take some legislators on a hunting trip. What would they likely be hunting?\"\n\n\"Pigs,\" Laney said.\n\n\"Pigs?\"\n\n\"Wild pigs-they're taking over the whole state!\" Laney said. Feral pigs are a remnant of the Spanish colonization, and now we've got as many as three million of them, tearing up fences and pastureland and mowing down crops, even eating the seed corn out of the ground before it sprouts. They can run twenty-five miles per hour. \"You ever seen one?\" Laney went on. \"Huge. They got these tusks out to here.\"\n\n\"How do you hunt them?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't hunt 'em myself, but I got a friend who does.\" He punched an intercom button on his phone. \"Honey, get Sharp on the line,\" he said.\n\nIn a moment, John Sharp was on the loudspeaker. The former state comptroller of public accounts, he is now the chancellor of the Texas A. & M. system. \"Sharp,\" Laney said, \"I got a young man here wants to know how you hunt pigs.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Sharp cried. \"Well, we do it at night, with pistols. Everybody wearing cutoffs and tennis shoes. We'll set the dogs loose, and when they start baying we come running. Now, the dogs will go after the pig's nuts, so the pig will back up against a tree to protect himself. So then you just take your pistol and pop him in the eye.\"\n\nAnd these were progressive Democrats. More or less.\n\nFor more than a century, Texas was under Democratic rule. The state was always culturally conservative, religious, and militaristic, but a strain of pragmatism kept it from being fully swept up in racism and right-wing ideology. Economic populism, especially in the rural areas, offered a counterweight to the capitalists in the cities.\n\nBut in the nineteen-seventies the state began shifting rightward. Bill Miller, a lobbyist in Austin and a longtime student of Texas politics, dates the change to May, 1976, when Ronald Reagan beat Gerald Ford in the Texas Republican primary. \"Reagan won every Texas delegate and the popular vote two to one,\" Miller told me. \"He smoked an incumbent Republican President and his mainstream followers with a heretofore unknown coalition of conservatives. That day lit the conservative fuse. Suddenly, they knew they had the numbers to win.\" Ford went on to gain the nomination, but he lost the Presidency to Jimmy Carter-the last Democratic nominee to carry Texas.\n\nIn 1978, Bill Clements became the first Republican governor of Texas since Reconstruction. To help him reach constituents, Clements hired a young direct-mail wizard named Karl Rove, who became a central figure in Texas's transformation from blue to red. Rove attributes the change to the growth of the suburbs and the gradual movement of the rural areas into the Republican column: \"They went from being economic populists, who thought the system was rigged against them by Wall Street, to being social and conservative populists, who thought that government was the problem.\"\n\nModerate and conservative Democratic politicians followed the voters to the Republican Party. Rick Perry, for one, served three terms in the Texas House as a Democrat, and even campaigned for Al Gore in his 1988 Presidential run, before changing parties, in 1989. In 1994, Texas elected its last statewide Democrat. \"It was a complete rout of a political party,\" Miller said.\n\nWhile George W. Bush was governor, between 1995 and 2000, a cordial détente between the political parties prevailed. The lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock, and Speaker Laney were both Democrats, and, when Bush ran for President, they became exhibits in his argument that he would be a bipartisan leader. Like Lyndon Johnson, Bullock had a huge, battered face and an unbridled love of Texas, which allowed him to see past the barriers of party loyalties. (His legend was only enhanced by his ruinous personal life: alcoholism, cancer, chronic depression, five marriages.) At Bush's fiftieth-birthday party, at the governor's mansion, in July, 1996, Bullock offered a toast to the Governor as \"the next President of the United States.\" As far as I know, that was the first time such a statement had been made about Bush in public, and it was by the highest Democratic official in the state.\n\nIn January, 2003, the Republicans finally took over the Texas legislature, and Laney lost the speakership to Tom Craddick, an ultraconservative Republican from Midland, the oil capital. More than anyone, Craddick was responsible for securing a Republican majority in the House, through clever fund-raising and indefatigable campaigning. \"There were eight other Republicans in the House when I got elected, in 1969, and two in the Senate,\" Craddick told me recently. \"The first time I tried to introduce a bill, they told me I couldn't, because I was a Republican.\"\n\nWhen he entered the House, he was twenty-five-the youngest member. \"Back then, most of the other members were retired, and they ran for office as a civic duty,\" he said. Now, at seventy-three, he is the longest-serving legislator in Texas history.\n\nCraddick is slight and white-haired, wry and friendly, with a slur in his speech and a shuffle in his step. He's easy to miss in the crowd of vigorous young legislators, few of whom were in office when Craddick turned the House into a Republican domain. His crusade started in the late eighties, he recalled. Initially, the Party had barely any infrastructure, and so he helped to organize candidates' campaigns, requiring them to report how many doors they had knocked on and how many mailers they had sent out.\n\nCraddick was the first Republican speaker since 1873. With his election to the post, the coup was complete. \"But it wasn't just about winning elections,\" he told me. \"We had a redistricting plan.\"\n\nIn the 2002 elections, fifty-six per cent of Texans who voted for a U.S. representative chose a Republican, but Democrats nevertheless held more seats in the U.S. House-seventeen seats to the Republicans' fifteen. Craddick worked with Congressman Tom DeLay, who was then the Majority Whip, to put into motion a sweeping plan to create a permanent Republican majority in the U.S. House.\n\nUnder Craddick's leadership, the Texas legislature began carving historical congressional districts into new fiefdoms. Taking care not to violate Supreme Court guidelines on minority representation, lawmakers jigsawed Texas into shapes that would decisively capture the state for the right.\n\nIn May, 2003, the redistricting plan came up for a vote in the Texas House. Fifty-three Democrats, sensing a lethal threat to their party, fled to Oklahoma, denying Craddick a quorum. He locked the capitol chamber, to prevent any more defections, and called out state troopers to hunt down the missing members, who became known as the Killer Ds.\n\nLink copied\n\nIn the midst of this hubbub, Pete Laney, the former speaker, flew his Piper turboprop from the Panhandle to Ardmore, Oklahoma, where he joined his Democratic colleagues at the local Holiday Inn. Someone from DeLay's office obtained Laney's flight plan from the Department of Homeland Security by implying that Laney's plane was overdue to land and might have crashed or been seized by terrorists. Texas troopers and national reporters swarmed into Ardmore. The Democratic faction remained in Oklahoma for four days, until the deadline for considering new legislation had passed. The governor, Rick Perry-by then a stalwart Republican-called a special session for late June, whereupon eleven Democratic state senators decamped to New Mexico. It took two more special sessions to ram the vote through.\n\nThe redistricting had a revolutionary effect. Today, the Texas delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives includes twenty-five Republicans and eleven Democrats-a far more conservative profile than the political demography of the state. The Austin metropolitan area, the heart of the Texas left, was divvied up into six congressional districts, with city residents a minority in each. All but one of these districts are now held by Republicans. I'm currently represented by Roger Williams, a conservative automobile dealer from Weatherford, two hundred miles north of Austin. Another Republican congressman, Lamar Smith, lives in San Antonio, but his district includes-and neutralizes-the liberal area surrounding the University of Texas at Austin. Smith, a member of the Tea Party Caucus, in Washington, denies that human activity affects global warming. He heads the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, which oversees NASA , the Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Lloyd Doggett is the only Democrat representing the Austin area, and his district runs along I-35, from East Austin to East San Antonio, scooping up as many Democrats as possible in one basket.\n\nTexas's redistricting process has since been replicated in statehouses around the country, creating congressional districts that are practically immune to challenge and giving Republicans an impregnable edge in Washington. \"Texas became a model for how to get control,\" Craddick told me.\n\nIn 2005, DeLay was prosecuted for money laundering and conspiracy, in connection with the illegal use of corporate funds. Craddick was also questioned, but he was never indicted. DeLay's conviction was overturned on appeal, in 2013, but by then he had resigned from Congress and made an unexpected appearance on \"Dancing with the Stars.\" The show has become a pathway to redemption for disgraced Texas politicos. In 2014, Rick Perry was indicted for abusing gubernatorial power, after he threatened to defund an anti-corruption agency. He was later cleared, and he, too, celebrated his comeback on \"Dancing with the Stars.\" Now he heads the Department of Energy. I wonder if Ted Cruz can dance.\n\nTexas has always had a burlesque side to its politics. The columnist Molly Ivins made a national reputation as a humor writer by lampooning the people we elect to office. One of my favorites in this category was Mike Martin, a state representative from Longview. In 1981, someone shotgunned the trailer he lived in during his months in Austin. Martin was inside, and was slightly injured. He declared that the shooting was in reprisal for an investigation he was pursuing involving a satanic cult. Later, his cousin admitted that he had fired the weapon at Martin's behest, ostensibly to gain Martin sympathy votes. (Martin was running for reëlection.) Martin fled Austin, but, as Ivins noted , the police \"tracked him to earth at his momma's house, where he was found hiding in the stereo cabinet.\" She added, \"He always did want to be the Speaker.\"\n\nIvins, who died in 2007, would have loved writing about Mary Lou Bruner, a seventy-year-old retired schoolteacher from Mineola, who last year ran as a Republican for an open seat on the Texas State Board of Education-a frequent battleground of the culture wars. Because ten per cent of American public-school students live in Texas, the state exerts a great influence on the textbook-publishing industry. During her campaign, Bruner posted on Facebook that Barack Obama had worked as a male prostitute in his twenties. \"That is how he paid for his drugs,\" she reasoned. Bruner went on to assert that climate change is a \"ridiculous hoax,\" and that dinosaurs are extinct because the ones on Noah's Ark were too young to reproduce. Somehow, she made it to a runoff, which she then lost.\n\nIn March, 2016, a man named Robert Morrow was elected the Republican Party chairman of Travis County, which contains Austin. Like many reporters in Texas, I received wild e-mails from Morrow for several years. He once claimed that George H. W. Bush was \"a seriously addicted homosexual pedophile\" who was also involved in a C.I.A. drug-smuggling ring with the Clintons. In 2011, Morrow took out a full-page ad in a local newspaper:\n\nHAVE YOU EVER HAD SEX WITH RICK PERRY?\n\nAre you a stripper, an escort, or just a \"young hottie\" impressed by an arrogant, entitled governor of Texas?\n\nNothing came of the ad, which, Morrow said, was designed to expose Perry as \"a Christian-buzzwords-spouting, 'family values' hypocrite and fraud.\"\n\nMorrow, a fifty-three-year-old Princeton graduate with an M.B.A. from the University of Texas, describes himself as an independent investor. In 2015, he wrote a book with Roger Stone, the political operative and occasional adviser to Donald Trump, called \"The Clintons' War on Women.\" The Austin American-Statesman noted that it appeared \"to be serving as a playbook for Trump\" in his attacks on Hillary Clinton. (Upon its publication, Trump tweeted, \"The latest book on Hillary-Wow, a really tough one!\") Mainstream Party officials were mortified when Morrow won the Travis County election, with fifty-six per cent of the vote. They promised to \"explore every single option that exists\" to remove him from office. Morrow responded, \"They can go fuck themselves.\" In June, he tweeted, \"Top priority for Travis GOP: beautiful Big Titty women!!\"\n\nTexas Republicans were having an unhappy time of it in 2016. Rick Perry, who retired from the governorship the previous year, was K.O.'d early in the Presidential primaries, and Senator Ted Cruz, probably the most unpopular politician in Washington, was eventually overmatched by Trump. Compounding the embarrassment, Morrow announced that he was running for President himself. This turned out to be against the rules for the Travis County chairman. At a meeting held in August, the Party deposed him. Morrow, who was present at the meeting, wearing a floppy motley-fool hat, did not object.\n\nThat month, Trump campaigned in Austin, and Morrow, who had not endorsed a candidate besides himself, protested his party's nominee by carrying a giant red sign that said \" TRUMP IS A CHILD RAPIST. \"\n\nRoger Stone, who was present at Trump's campaign event, claimed that he had the police escort his co-author away from the rally. To add to the insult, Stone tweeted that Morrow was a \"Clinton quisling.\"\n\nThe Texas capitol, constructed of red granite, was completed in 1888. The state was destitute then, and paid for the building with three million acres of public land in the Panhandle-about the size of Connecticut. At the time, the capitol was said to be the seventh-largest building in the world, and, as one would expect, it is somewhat taller than its uncle in Washington, D.C. During the summer in Austin, nighthawks swirl around the crowning statue on the dome: the Goddess of Liberty, holding aloft a golden star.\n\nThe legislature meets every other year for a hundred and forty days, reflecting the state's native aversion to government. The sessions begin on the second Tuesday in January and end around Memorial Day. The legislature's only mandated task is to produce a two-year balanced budget. In the 2015 session, the state budget worked out to about a hundred billion dollars per year. This year, a drop in the price of oil and a rise in population augured substantial cutbacks and a struggle to meet the health and safety needs of citizens.\n\nWhen I visited the capitol in January, a group of high-school girls stood on a terrazzo mosaic in the middle of the rotunda. In the center was the seal of the Republic of Texas, a lone star wreathed in branches of olive and live oak. \"It's two hundred and eighteen feet from this star to the one above,\" a guide told them, gesturing to its mate, on the ceiling of the dome. \"You could fit the Statue of Liberty in here.\"\n\nOn the walls of the rotunda hang portraits of our former governors. When the current governor, the staunchly conservative Greg Abbott, leaves office, his portrait will go where Rick Perry's is now, and those of all the previous forty-seven governors will take one step to the left. When a portrait arrives at the end of the circle on the ground floor, it moves to the wall of the floor above, and then higher and higher and further into obscurity.\n\nThe next portrait that will ascend from the lobby is that of W. Lee (Pappy) O'Daniel. In some respects, O'Daniel, a Democrat, was a precursor of Donald Trump. When he successfully ran for governor, in 1938, he was a political naïf who had never cast a ballot, and he wasn't even eligible to vote in that election, because he hadn't paid his poll tax. He passed himself off as a rube, but he was a savvy operator. He had become famous as the host of a radio show in which he performed with his band, the Light Crust Doughboys. Radio was his Twitter. His only real platform was to stir things up. When his opponents staged a rally, hundreds would attend, but O'Daniel's speeches attracted tens of thousands. In his first race, he defeated eleven contenders, without a runoff.\n\nAs governor, he reneged on promises he had made to abolish the death penalty, block the sales tax, and raise pensions. He was a scaremonger, railing against \"Communistic labor-leader racketeers\" and politically controlled newspapers. He was terribly ineffectual but such a compelling showman that, in 1941, voters sent him to the U.S. Senate over a young man named Lyndon Johnson-the only election Johnson ever lost. The portrait of O'Daniel in the rotunda shows a handsome, full-faced man with slicked-back hair and a \"Who, me?\" look in his eye.\n\nNext to him is O'Daniel's calmer successor, Coke Stevenson, and the bon vivant Beauford Jester, who, according to legend, died in the arms of his mistress, on the midnight sleeper to Houston.\n\nOf all the governors on the rotunda walls, Ann Richards, who served from 1991 to 1995, was the most memorable, at least in my lifetime. She had stark-white hair that was swept and sprayed into a blinding pompadour-Molly Ivins called it \"hard hair\"-and a switchblade sense of humor that was honed on the primitive male chauvinism she had grown up with. She became a national figure when, as the state treasurer, she gave the keynote address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention. \"Poor George,\" she said of the Republican nominee, George H. W. Bush. \"He can't help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth.\" She wasn't nice, but she had a wonderful smile, and batted her icy-blue eyes as she stuck the knife in.\n\nHer rise to governor, as a recovered alcoholic and a divorced mother of four, was a near-miracle. Her wealthy Republican opponent-the West Texas rancher and oilman Clayton Williams, Jr.-had a double-digit lead in the polls when the general election began. He blew that lead with a series of character-revealing gaffes. He told reporters that inclement weather was like rape: \"If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy it.\" He had to fight off persistent rumors that he had invited his ranch hands and clients to join in \"honey hunts,\" which involved scattering prostitutes on his property like Easter eggs. Then, at a forum in Dallas, he met Richards, who stuck out her hand and said, \"Hello, Claytie.\" He declined the gesture, violating the cowboy code that is deeply ingrained in every Texan. In that instant, he lost the election.\n\nRichards wore designer suits but picked her teeth, and she cleaned her fingernails with a Swiss Army knife. She always seemed a little surprised to find herself in the seat of power, but she cherished the comedy of the play she was cast in. Ivins once told me that, after the A.C.L.U. filed suit against a manger scene in the capitol, she called Governor Richards and asked, \"Annie, is it really necessary to remove the crèche?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so,\" Richards replied. \"And it's a shame, because it's about the only time we ever had three wise men in the capitol.\"\n\nRichards had the most amazing drawl-devastatingly comic, but with a cut-the-crap edge to it. She was a flirt, and she loved dirty jokes and risqué stories. Once, we both took part in a fund-raiser at the Four Seasons in Austin, and the writer Kinky Friedman-who is also the lead singer of Kinky Friedman and the Texas Jewboys-seized the opportunity to tell a story about going to the beach with a family friend, who wore a swimsuit that was so tight it squeezed one of his balls into view. It's not that funny when I tell it, but Governor Richards laughed so hard that she could barely stay in her chair.\n\nTexas has a reputation for being super-religious, but there has always been a tolerance for the sexual misdemeanors of elected officials. Charlie Wilson, the U.S. representative from the Second District, in East Texas, one of the most conservative parts of the state, was a drunk, a drug user, and the most energetic playboy on Capitol Hill, who enjoyed lounging in hot tubs with showgirls and cocaine. He was elected to twelve terms.\n\nTexans' tolerance for sexual liberty didn't extend to Richards, however. She surrounded herself with a coterie of very powerful women, which led to countless innuendos about her sexual orientation. She complained to a lobbyist I know, \"I could be fucking Charlie Wilson on Sam Houston's bed, and they'd still call me a lesbian.\" After one term, Richards was defeated by George W. Bush, marking the end of the Democratic Party as a force of any consequence in the state.\n\nTexans are notorious for loving guns, but when I was young it was illegal for residents to carry weapons outside their home or vehicle. In 1991, George Hennard, a thirty-five-year-old unemployed man, drove his Ford pickup through the plate-glass window of the Luby's cafeteria in Killeen, Texas, where some eighty people were having lunch. At first, everyone thought that it was a freakish accident. Then Hennard shot a customer. \"Is it worth it, Texas?\" he cried. \"This is payback day.\"\n\nSuzanna Hupp, a chiropractor, was having lunch with her parents. \"My father and I got down on the floor and put the table up in front of us,\" she later testified before Congress. She reached for her purse, where she kept her revolver, then realized that she had left her gun in her car, fearing that she might lose her chiropractor's license if she were caught carrying a concealed weapon.\n\nHer father confronted the shooter, but he was shot. Hupp told her mother that they needed to make a break for it, then climbed out a rear window. When she looked back, she realized that her mother had gone to comfort her dying husband. Hennard put a bullet in her mother's head. He shot fifty people, killing twenty-three of them before killing himself. It's the fourth-deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.\n\n\"I'm not really mad at the guy who did this,\" Hupp told lawmakers in Washington. \"That's like being mad at a rabid dog.\" She continued, \"I'm mad at my legislators for legislating me out of the right to protect myself and my family.\" In 1996, Hupp was elected to the Texas House of Representatives, and she subsequently passed a law that allowed concealed weapons to be carried.\n\nSince then, it's also become legal to carry guns openly. I've yet to see anyone in public strapping a sidearm, but the law is tremendously popular. Especially among Texas politicians, there's a locker-room lust for weaponry that belies noble-sounding proclamations about self-protection and Second Amendment rights. In 2010, Governor Perry boasted of killing with a single shot a coyote that was menacing his daughter's Labrador. Perry was jogging at the time, but naturally he was packing heat: a .380 Ruger. The gun's manufacturer promptly issued a Coyote Special edition of the gun, which comes in a box labelled \" FOR SALE TO TEXANS ONLY .\"\n\nAn eccentric feature of Texas's new gun laws is that people entering the state capitol can skip the long lines of tourists waiting to pass through metal detectors if they show guards a license-to-carry permit. In other words, the people most likely to bring weapons into the building aren't scanned at all. Many of the people who breeze through are lawmakers and staffers who tote concealed weapons into offices or onto the floor of the legislature. But some lobbyists and reporters have also obtained gun licenses, just to skirt the lines. I recently got one myself.\n\nOne winter day at the capitol, early in the 2017 session, I was bypassing the metal detectors when Governor Abbott rushed by in his wheelchair. At fifty-nine, he is an energetic man; his aides were racing across the rotunda to keep up with him. Abbott was a track star in high school-he is said to have never lost a race-but in 1984 a tree fell on him while he was jogging through the wealthy enclave of River Oaks, in Houston, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. He had just graduated from law school and had no health insurance. Fortunately, he won a nine-million-dollar judgment against the homeowner whose tree had fallen and the company that had inspected the tree and failed to recommend its removal. Later, Abbott, as a member of the Texas Supreme Court, and then as attorney general, supported measures that capped pain-and-suffering damages in medical-malpractice cases at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\n\nAbbott's overarching issue is fending off the malevolent influence of California, which is widely seen as Texas's political antithesis: it is more regulated and highly taxed, whereas Texas is relatively unfettered, with one of the lowest tax burdens in the country. Every statewide officeholder in California is a Democrat; in Texas, none are. Nevertheless, in 2015, Abbott declared, \"Texas is being California-ized, and you may not even be noticing it.\" He went on, \"This is being done at the city level, with bag bans, fracking bans, tree-cutting bans. We're forming a patchwork quilt of bans and rules and regulations that is eroding the Texas model.\" He warned that the \"Texas miracle\" could become a \"California nightmare.\"\n\nThe obsession with California puzzles me. I play the keyboards in a blues band, and our drummer has a sticker on his kit saying \"Stop Californication of Texas Music.\" The mayor of Austin, Steve Adler, is a Democrat, but he recently warned that, if our city stays on its current path, \"we'll end up like San Francisco,\" with out-of-control housing costs. The newspapers often feature gloating stories about the number of Californians fleeing to Texas (eight per day to Austin alone), as an indication of the vast superiority of the Texas way of life.\n\nAlthough Abbott has a lower national profile than his predecessors Rick Perry and George W. Bush, he clearly has similar ambitions. In January, when the legislative session began, he latched on to a proposal, already adopted by ten other states, to call a constitutional convention aimed at reining in the power of the federal government. Abbott rebranded it as the Texas Plan. It would require the federal government to balance its budget, as Texas does, and would prohibit federal agencies-such as the E.P.A. and the Department of Labor-from issuing regulations that override state laws. As Texas's attorney general, from 2002 to 2015, Abbott was on the losing end of many lawsuits that he filed on behalf of the state against the U.S. government-he objected to the Affordable Care Act, and to many federal environmental controls. Under the Texas Plan, the U.S. Supreme Court would need a supermajority of seven Justices to strike down a state law. Abbott designated the Texas Plan an emergency item, and it quickly passed the legislature and was signed into law, worrying mainstream Republican lawmakers in Washington, who fear that, in the current political climate, such efforts could lead to a runaway assault on federal authority.\n\nAnother emergency item on the Governor's list for the 2017 session was ethics reform, but many legislators saw the move as hypocritical. Lyle Larson, a centrist Republican state representative from San Antonio, told me, \"Some of the most egregious violations are in the governor's office. It's well known that pay-for-play has been going on in that office for years. For you to be on the Parks and Wildlife board, for instance, or to be a regent at the university, you have to make significant contributions\"-to Abbott's campaign fund. \" That's not in the Governor's bill.\" (Abbott's press secretary, John Wittman, said, \"Governor Abbott selects and appoints individuals he believes are the most qualified and capable of bringing excellence to the organizations in which they serve. Any suggestion to the contrary is absurd.\") Little came of Abbott's ethics-reform attempt.\n\nFor all of Abbott's initiatives, the legislature's agenda is dominated by Dan Patrick, an evangelical Christian and a former radio talk-show host from Houston, who has been the lieutenant governor since 2014. In Texas, the lieutenant governor is also the president of the Senate, and, because the Senate currently has a Republican majority, Patrick has total control over it. He appoints bills to specific committees, and no legislation comes onto the floor without his say-so. He is unquestionably the most important political figure in the state.\n\nDuring his radio days, Patrick developed a knack for self-promotion; he once got a vasectomy on the air. (He now owns a radio station in Houston.) Clever and relentless, Patrick brought with him to Austin the AM Texas platform of anti-abortion absolutism and hostility to same-sex marriage and undocumented immigrants. He was first elected to the Senate in 2006, running as an outsider. \"It was as if Rush Limbaugh were running,\" Bill Miller, the lobbyist, told me. Patrick crushed three well-known candidates in the Republican primary, and won the general election with nearly seventy per cent of the vote.\n\nSince Patrick became lieutenant governor, one of his signature accomplishments has been the passage of the open-carry gun law; he also successfully pushed to legalize the carrying of concealed weapons on public-college campuses. During the 2016 Presidential race, he deftly pivoted from supporting Ted Cruz to becoming Donald Trump's campaign chair in Texas. Evan Smith, the co-founder of the Texas Tribune, an online journal dedicated to state politics, told me, \"Dan Patrick is the most conservative person ever elected to statewide office in the history of Texas.\" (Patrick himself declined to speak to The New Yorker. )\n\nPatrick has driven his chamber in a far more radical direction. Even Democratic senators are loath to cross him. In this year's session, Patrick worked on lowering property taxes and addressing some obscure matters, such as hailstorm-lawsuit reform. But the heart of his agenda was legislation that spoke to the religious right, such as a bill that would provide vouchers for homeschooling and private-school tuition, and a \"sermon safeguard\" bill, which would prevent state and local officials from issuing subpoenas to members of the clergy or compelling them to testify. He also worked to toughen the state's voter-I.D. law. Patrick's legislative agenda, if passed in its entirety, would bend Texas farther in the direction of the affluent and, above all, would fortify the political strength of white evangelicals who feel threatened by the increasing number of minorities and by changing social mores.\n\nLink copied\n\nPatrick's extremism is often countered by Joe Straus, the speaker of the House, a centrist, business-oriented conservative from San Antonio. Whereas the lieutenant governor is elected by the voters of the state, the speaker is chosen by the members. That makes a crucial difference in the way that Patrick and Straus govern. \"Dan Patrick rules by fear,\" Representative Gene Wu, a Houston Democrat, told me. \"Joe Straus rules by consensus.\"\n\nThe 2017 session in Austin proved to be a bruising example of raw politics waged by two talented people, Straus and Patrick, who fervently believe in their causes. The story in Texas both reflects and influences the national scene. At a time when Democratic voices have been sidelined-\"We're lost in the wilderness,\" Wu told me-the key struggle is within the increasingly conservative Republican Party, between those who primarily align with business interests and those who are preoccupied with abortion, gay marriage, immigration, religion, and gun rights.\n\nPoliticians seldom pay a price for the damage that their legislation may do in the name of popular causes, such as declaring war or slashing taxes at the expense of vital social programs. In 2011, Governor Perry vetoed a bill that would have banned texting while driving, saying that it was \"a government effort to micromanage the behavior of adults.\" Texas is always above the national average in the number of highway fatalities. According to the Texas Department of Transportation, more than four hundred Texans are killed every year in crashes related to distracted driving, often because they are texting.\n\nTo my surprise, the sponsor of the bill that Perry vetoed was Tom Craddick, the ultraconservative former speaker. This year, he put the measure forward again, for the fourth time. He compares it to Texas's seat-belt law, which, he notes, \"is very unpopular\" in his district. \"But they say that ninety-five per cent of the people obey the law.\"\n\nOn March 29, 2017, in the middle of the legislative session, a welder named Jody Kuchler called the sheriff's offices in Uvalde County and Real County to say that a white truck was driving recklessly down a two-lane highway, swerving all over the road. Kuchler, who was following the truck, told the cops, \"He's going to hit somebody head on or he's going to kill his own damn self.\" He then watched helplessly as the truck rammed into a bus carrying members of the First Baptist Church of New Braunfels. Thirteen people were killed. The driver of the truck was twenty-year-old Jack Dillon Young, who was largely unhurt. \"He said, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was texting,' \" Kuchler told reporters. \"I said, 'Son, do you know what you just did?' \" (Young also had Ambien and other medications in his system.) The accident was one of many that might have been prevented had Governor Perry signed the 2011 texting bill into law.\n\nThat year, the Republican state legislature turned its attention instead to defunding women's-health programs. \"This is a war on birth control and abortions,\" Representative Wayne Christian, a Tea Party stalwart from East Texas, admitted. \"That's what family planning is supposed to be about.\"\n\nThe long-term goal of cultural conservatives is to cut off access to abortion in Texas, to end state subsidies for birth control, and to gut state funding for Planned Parenthood-which, in 2011, served sixty per cent of the health needs of low-income women in the state. The legislators slashed the family-planning budget from $111.5 million to $37.9 million. Eighty-two family-planning clinics subsequently shut down.\n\nTexas has the highest rate of uninsured people in the nation, and, according to the Center for Public Policy Priorities, about seventeen per cent of Texan women and girls live in poverty. After the family-planning budget was cut, there was a disproportionate rise in births covered by Medicaid, because so many women no longer had access to birth control. By defunding Planned Parenthood, the legislature also blocked many women from getting scans for breast cancer and ovarian cancer.\n\nIn May, 2011, Governor Perry, who was gearing up for his first Presidential race, signed a bill requiring all women seeking an abortion to have a sonogram at least twenty-four hours before the procedure. Carol Alvarado, a Democratic state representative from Houston, pointed out on the House floor that, for a woman who is eight to ten weeks pregnant, such a law would necessitate a \"transvaginal sonogram.\" She then displayed the required instrument to the discomfited lawmakers: a white plastic wand resembling an elongated pistol, which would be inserted into the woman's vagina. \"Government intrusion at its best,\" she observed.\n\nNonetheless, the bill passed in the House, 107-42. When the Senate approved the bill, Dan Patrick, then a state senator, declared, \"This is a great day for Texas. This is a great day for women's health.\"\n\nBetween 2010 and 2014, the proportion of women who died in childbirth in Texas doubled, from 18.6 per hundred thousand live births to 35.8-the worst in the nation and higher than the rate in many developing countries. These figures represent six hundred dead women.\n\nResearchers say that it's not entirely understood what accounts for the rise in maternal mortality in Texas, because the rate was already rising before the 2011 laws went into effect. Obesity, heart disease, drug overdoses, and a lack of health insurance-all serious problems in the state-play a role. Nevertheless, a report in the September, 2016, issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology noted , \"In the absence of war, natural disaster, or severe economic upheaval, the doubling of a mortality rate within a two year period in a state with almost 400,000 annual births seems unlikely.\"\n\nThe mystery might be cleared up if Governor Abbott released records about how these women died. In 2011, when he was attorney general, he issued an opinion stating that information about the deceased would be withheld, supposedly to prevent fraud.\n\nDan Patrick, Rick Perry, and other Texas lawmakers who have called their bills a victory for women's health have shown no compassion for the women who have suffered, and perhaps died, because of them. Their legislation has been equally heartless toward children. A fifth of the uninsured children in the U.S. are in Texas. In 2004, the Texas Education Agency lowered the percentage of children who can be enrolled in special-education classes from thirteen per cent (about the national average) to eight and a half per cent (the lowest in the country). According to the Houston Chronicle , tens of thousands of children have been denied the education they need because of this arbitrary limit.\n\nIn 2015, a federal judge, Janis Graham Jack, ruled that, in Texas, foster children \"almost uniformly leave State custody more damaged than when they entered.\" The state, she said, was violating the children's constitutional rights by exposing them to an unreasonable risk of harm. Judge Jack declared that state oversight agencies had adopted an attitude of \"deliberate indifference\" toward the plight of the children in their care, even in the face of repeated abuse and, sometimes, homicide. \"Rape, abuse, psychotropic medication, and instability are the norm,\" she added.\n\nGovernor Abbott promised to overhaul the child-welfare system, but things have only worsened. In the 2016 fiscal year, at least two hundred children in Texas died of maltreatment, compared with a hundred and seventy-three the previous year, and those figures don't include more than a hundred other deaths that are still being investigated. Child Protective Services, the state unit charged with investigating cases of abuse, is in chaos. Nevertheless, Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, appealed Judge Jack's decision to appoint a special master to oversee the state's foster-care system, claiming that it would amount to a \"federal takeover.\"\n\nNearly a year after the judge's ruling, Child Protective Services acknowledged that caseworkers had not even visited more than forty-seven hundred children at high risk of abuse or severe neglect. Hundreds of children have been sleeping in hotels or emergency shelters, or on air mattresses in government offices, because the state has nowhere else to put them. Hundreds of caseworkers have quit, complaining that they were overworked, demoralized, poorly paid, and often placed in dangerous situations. Union leaders have said that higher pay would help attract more applicants to the job, which offers a starting salary of thirty-seven thousand dollars, but state officials countered with a plan to lower the educational requirements for caseworkers. During the 2017 legislative session, while bills addressing the child-welfare crisis were being considered, a teen-age girl who was being housed in a state office building fled in the middle of the night. She was hit by a van and killed.\n\nFed up with the callous treatment of women and children, Jessica Farrar, a liberal state representative from Houston, filed House Bill 4260, the Man's Right to Know Act. It satirically employed the kind of patronizing, \"we're doing this for your own good\" language that characterizes the many bills directed at abortion and women's health-for instance, requiring a sonogram and a rectal exam before prescribing Viagra. Then, there was this:\n\nSec. 173.010. FINES RELATED TO MASTURBATORY EMISSIONS. Masturbatory emissions created in health or medical facilities will be stored for the purposes of conception for a current or future wife.\n\n(a) Emissions outside of a woman's vagina, or created outside of a health or medical facility, will be charged a $100 civil penalty for each emission, and will be considered an act against an unborn child, and failing to preserve the sanctity of life.\n\nThe bill never made it to the House floor.\n\nLobbyists got their name because they stand in the lobby. When I returned to the capitol on February 7th, about fifty of them, almost all dark-suited men, stood outside the Senate chamber, forming a mosh pit for any legislator who might appear. Although they seem like supplicants, lobbyists actually write much of the legislation and corral the votes.\n\nBill Miller has been working in the lobby for three decades. When he first arrived, he noticed that all the political leaders had animal heads mounted on their walls. Miller had a papier-mâché sea-lion head made up for his office. \"Wow, you killed a sea lion?\" an impressed legislator asked. \"Yeah,\" Miller said. \"With a surfboard.\"\n\nInside the chamber, a crucial debate was under way about Senate Bill 4, known as the sanctuary-cities bill. One of Governor Abbott's priorities, it essentially required Texas officials to join the Trump Administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants. There are about a million such immigrants in Dallas and Houston alone.\n\nA few days earlier, four hundred and fifty people had lined up to testify before the State Affairs Committee in protest of S.B. 4, which they saw as a discriminatory measure. The line snaked around the rotunda floor and up to the second level. The hearing lasted more than sixteen hours, and broke up well after midnight. The police chiefs of Austin and San Antonio testified that S.B. 4 would harm their ability to work with immigrant communities. A young woman spoke about attempting suicide after her father was deported. In the end, the bill passed out of committee, 7-2, on partisan lines.\n\nIn 2016, Sally Hernandez, a political novice of Anglo descent, was elected sheriff of Travis County, having promoted Austin as a \"sanctuary city.\" Federal immigration authorities often ask local law-enforcement officials to put a \"detainer\" on people in their custody-that is, to hold off on releasing them until their citizenship status can be verified-but Hernandez declared that she would honor such requests only in cases in which individuals were charged with a violent crime. Otherwise, people who posted bond would be released.\n\nIt was as if Hernandez had opened the door to a ravenous mob of flesh-eating zombies. Perhaps she didn't fully appreciate how suspiciously Travis County is viewed by the Republican establishment-which, increasingly, is the Tea Party establishment. Governor Abbott abruptly cut off $1.5 million in state grants to the county. He went on Bill O'Reilly's show and said of S.B. 4, \"Today, we introduced legislation that will put the hammer down on Travis County as well as any sanctuary-city policy in the state of Texas.\"\n\nO'Reilly said of Sheriff Hernandez, \"I don't understand her motivation.\"\n\n\"She is doing it to pander to the ideology of the left, just like what you see in California ,\" Abbott responded.\n\nS.B. 4 was loaded up with punitive amendments, all of which were endorsed by the entirely white Republican majority. (Of the thirty-one members of the Texas Senate, only eleven are Democrats; seven are Latino.) Under one amendment, Sheriff Hernandez-whom Abbott began calling Sanctuary Sally-could be jailed for up to a year if she refused to grant a detainer.\n\nOn the Senate floor, Brian Birdwell, a Republican from Granbury, southwest of Fort Worth, rose to speak in favor of the bill. Birdwell is a retired Army colonel who was badly burned in the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon. He has undergone thirty-nine operations and numerous skin grafts. He said that he was worried about \"a culture of insubordination\" emerging in Texas, adding that the next step would be outright insurrection. \"What you tolerate today you'll endorse tomorrow, and subsidize the day after.\"\n\nJuan (Chuy) Hinojosa, a Democratic senator from the fertile South Texas region known as the Valley, spoke against the bill. \"I agree one hundred per cent that we as a nation have the right to define our borders,\" he said. But the bill, he warned, could become an excuse for the wholesale expulsion of undocumented immigrants who had committed no crimes. \"I was deported when I was five,\" he said. He and his father were American citizens, but his mother was undocumented. She was picking tomatoes in Hidalgo County, which abuts Mexico, when the Border Patrol arrived. \"They put us in a paddy wagon, and we didn't even have time to notify my father,\" he later told me. \"We lived in Mexico for a year while my father was looking for us.\"\n\nHinojosa tried to find a middle ground during the debate. \"Our biggest problem, when we talk about border security, it is politicized right away,\" he said. He called Sheriff Hernandez naïve and inexperienced. \"She talked about honoring detainers only in cases of violent crime, but suppose you've got somebody who smuggled in a hundred kilos of cocaine? If you got caught committing a burglary-hell, yeah, you ought to be detained.\"\n\nHernandez defended herself in an op-ed : \"Tasking our community police forces with the job of federal immigration agents creates a strain, which is why the detainer policy on nonviolent criminals is optional.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) began a national dragnet that ostensibly targeted undocumented criminals and violent offenders. Undocumented bystanders were also picked up. Fifty-one people were seized in Austin, fewer than half of whom were criminals-a lower proportion than in any other city in the country-leading residents to believe that the city had been singled out.\n\nIn an open letter, Mayor Adler said, \"These raids are sowing distrust, not just with ICE but even with local law enforcement, and that makes our community less safe.\"\n\nMany Mexican-Americans in Texas support stricter enforcement of immigration laws. \"As long as there is no profiling of Hispanics, we understand the process,\" Hinojosa told me. \"Since 9/11, the whole culture has changed.\" Under current practice, however, undocumented migrants crossing from Mexico often simply surrender to the Border Patrol; they are then given a court date, a year or two in the future. Hinojosa said that it makes no sense to allow undocumented people into the country, let them go wherever they want, and then conduct raids to root them out. \"It's a real broken system,\" he said.\n\nIn session after session, the Texas legislature has sought to impose strict rules on voter identification, with the putative goal of preventing election fraud. A 2011 law required voters to present a U.S. passport, a military identification card, a state driver's license, a concealed-weapon permit, or a Texas election identification certificate. The same law excluded federal and state government I.D.s, as well as student I.D.s, from being used at polling stations. In 2014, a federal judge, Nelva Gonzales Ramos, in the Southern District of Texas, struck down the law, calling it \"an unconstitutional poll tax.\" Texas appealed, but the appeal was rejected, in part because there was no actual evidence of voter fraud. (The Supreme Court refused to hear the case.) The appeals court sent the case back to Judge Ramos, asking her to determine if the law was intentionally discriminatory. If Ramos said yes, it could trigger federal monitoring of the state's election laws under the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe question of voter fraud became a national issue after the 2016 Presidential election. Gregg Phillips, a former official of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, gave Trump the false idea that he would have won the popular vote if illegal votes were discounted. Phillips, the founder of a group called VoteStand, tweeted that three million unqualified voters had cast ballots in the election. He refused to provide proof, though he told CNN that he had developed \"algorithms\" that could determine citizenship status. Trump soon demanded a widespread investigation into voter fraud.\n\nIn February, 2017, while Judge Ramos was still considering the Texas voter-I.D. law, a resident of a Fort Worth suburb was found to have voted illegally: Rosa Maria Ortega, a thirty-seven-year-old mother of four with a seventh-grade education. She had lived in the U.S. since she was an infant, and was a legal resident, entitled to serve in the military and required to pay taxes. She assumed that she could also vote, and had done so previously, in 2012 and 2014. The local prosecutor decided to make an example of her, and she was sentenced to eight years in prison. When she gets out, she may be deported to Mexico. I suppose it's an irony that she is a Republican, and voted for Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, who has made voter fraud a signature issue.\n\nIn April, Judge Ramos issued her opinion: the Texas voter-I.D. law was intentionally designed to discriminate against minorities. Almost simultaneously, a panel of federal judges in San Antonio ruled that three of the state's thirty-six U.S. congressional districts were illegally drawn in order to disempower minorities.\n\nEvan Smith, of the Texas Tribune, has closely followed thirteen legislative sessions. He noted that, even as Dan Patrick and his Republican allies slashed government services, they allocated eight hundred million dollars for border security. \"White people are scared of change, believing that what they have is being taken away from them by people they consider unworthy,\" he told me. \"But all they're doing is poking a bear with a stick. In 2004, the Anglo population in Texas became a minority. The last majority-Anglo high-school class in Texas graduated in 2014. There will never be another. The reality is, it's all over for the Anglos.\"\n\nTexas leads the nation in Latino population growth. Latinos account for more than half the 2.7 million new Texans since 2010. Every Democrat in Texas believes that, if Latinos voted at the same rate in Texas as they do in California, the state would already be blue. \"The difference between Texas and California is the labor movement,\" Garnet Coleman, a Houston member of the Texas House, told me. In the nineteen-sixties, Cesar Chavez began organizing the California farmworkers into a union; that kind of movement didn't happen in Texas, a right-to-work state. \"Labor unions create a culture of voting and political participation,\" Coleman observed. In Texas politics, he says, \"everything is about race-it's veiled as public policy, but it encourages people to believe that their tax dollars are going to support lazy black and brown people.\" Political views have become more entrenched because of redistricting, and yet the demographic majority in Texas is far more progressive than its representatives. Coleman predicts a showdown: \"This is a battle about the future of the country, based on a new majority, and we have to have this out.\"\n\nThe most contentious item on Dan Patrick's list of priorities for the 2017 session was the \"bathroom bill,\" S.B. 6, which would bar transgender people in public schools and government buildings from using rest-room or locker-room facilities that did not correspond to the sex listed on their birth certificates. It would also overturn any local antidiscrimination ordinances that permit transgender citizens to choose which bathroom to use.\n\nIn 2016, a similar bill was signed into law in North Carolina. In response, musicians such as Bruce Springsteen and Pearl Jam cancelled concerts in the state, and sporting associations, including the N.B.A. and the N.C.A.A., dropped plans to hold events there. Governor Pat McCrory, who supported the law, lost his bid for reëlection, in part because of the national outcry. Dan Patrick contends that his bill will have no economic effect on the state of Texas, and that the only people opposed to it are journalists and \"the secular left.\" At a prayer rally on the capitol steps, in February, he declared, \"They don't want prayer in public schools, they're not pro-life, they see nothing wrong with boys and girls showering together in the tenth grade, or a man being in a women's bathroom.\" Attorney General Paxton, who was also present, added, \"This is a spiritual war.\"\n\nThe bathroom bill was drafted after the superintendent of schools in Fort Worth announced, in April, 2016, that transgender students could henceforth use the rest room or the locker room that corresponded to their gender identity. This was in accordance with federal guidelines. The superintendent additionally instructed teachers and administrators to refer to students as \"scholars,\" rather than as \"boys and girls.\" At the rally, Patrick called for his resignation, suggesting that this sort of policy would represent \"the end of public education\" and ignite a mass revolt by parents. \"I believe it is the biggest issue facing families and schools in America since prayer was taken out of public school,\" he concluded.\n\nThe business community in Texas fiercely opposed S.B. 6, and produced a report suggesting that its passage could cost the state up to eight and a half billion dollars. (PolitiFact determined that this figure was hyperbolic.) A month after the Texas legislature began the 2017 session, the Super Bowl was held in Houston, and the National Football League intimated that, were S.B. 6 to pass, the championship might not be held in Texas again. Governor Abbott, who had been keeping his head down as the legislature debated the issue, told the N.F.L. to mind its own business.\n\nBathrooms have been an issue in Texas before. At my first Willie Nelson concert, in Austin, in the nineteen-eighties, I was in the men's room when a dozen women barged in and laid siege to the stalls. It was actually a rather jolly moment. There were similar episodes at other Texas events, and, in 1993, Governor Ann Richards signed a \"potty parity\" bill, which mandated that, in new sports and entertainment facilities, there be two toilets in women's rest rooms for every one in the men's.\n\nLink copied\n\nThe debate over S.B. 6 was a much grimmer matter. Although a dozen other states have similar bills pending, Patrick's legislation embodied the meanness and the intolerance that many Americans associate with Texas. In Austin, the bill was being sold as a way to protect women against sexual predators who might pose as transgender-a problem that scarcely exists. Laws already on the books protect women from being accosted or spied on. The sponsors of the bill claimed that S.B. 6 was not meant to discriminate against transgender Texans, although the law would do just that. The only remedy for trans people would be to change their birth certificates, a costly and time-consuming process. The bill proposed fining schools and state agencies up to ten thousand five hundred dollars per day for violations. Even in the Texas Senate, there were doubts about the need for such a bill. \"How are they going to enforce it?\" Chuy Hinojosa asked me. \"Would a woman have to raise her dress?\"\n\nAs S.B. 6 made its way through the legislature, I noticed a new sign outside a bathroom in the Austin airport. It said \" ALL GENDERS .\"\n\nOn March 2nd, I returned to the capitol to have lunch with the speaker of the House, Joe Straus. It was the hundred-and-eighty-first anniversary of the day that Texas became independent of Mexico, and the beginning of the \"high holy days\" among Texas historians. The climax comes on March 6th, the anniversary of the fall of the Alamo, where, in 1836, some two hundred and fifty \"Texians\" gathered to block the advance of the Mexican forces.\n\nThe capitol rotunda was filled with schoolchildren wearing frontier bonnets and Davy Crockett coonskin hats, getting ready to perform Marty Robbins's song \"Ballad of the Alamo.\" Kids from the Texas School for the Deaf would sign as the other children sang. Four retirees representing Buffalo Soldiers-the black cavalrymen who made their mark in the Indian Wars-had come to present the state colors. A tall man wearing a top hat paced about, preparing to recite the letter that William Barret Travis, the lawyer who led the Texian forces at the Alamo, wrote during the battle. (\"I shall never surrender or retreat,\" he declared, in one of the most famous passages in Texas history. \" Victory or death .\")\n\nOn the House floor, resolutions were offered to honor the \"sacrifice of the heroes of the Alamo\" and to commend notable citizens. A member proposed that the breakfast taco become the official state breakfast item.\n\nI met Straus in his office. He switched on a closed-circuit TV to watch a press conference by a new group of a dozen cultural conservatives, the Texas Freedom Caucus, which is led by Matt Schaefer, a state representative from Tyler, in East Texas. The group, which models itself on the similarly named body of far-right House Republicans in Washington, had formed, in part, because the term \"Tea Party\" had lost its meaning-in Texas, at least-as nearly every Republican in the legislature claimed to be unimpeachably conservative. What distinguished this group was that the members were all vociferously anti-Straus. The declared mission of the group is to \"amplify the voice of liberty-minded grassroots Texans who want bold action to protect life, strengthen families, defend the Bill of Rights, restrain government, and revitalize personal and economic freedoms in Texas.\"\n\nAs he watched the conference, Straus shot me a weary look.\n\nWe moved to the dining room, which had Audubon bird prints on the wall. \"The thing that concerns me is the near-total loss of influence of the business community, which allows really bad ideas like the bathroom bill to fill the void,\" Straus said, as we sat down to plates of delicious crab cakes. \"C.E.O.s have stopped coming to the capitol to engage directly,\" he continued. \"They now work only through lobbyists.\"\n\nStraus comes from a longtime Republican family in San Antonio. One of his ancestors founded the L. Frank Saddlery Company, which made saddles, harnesses, and whips. Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders stopped in San Antonio in 1898 to equip themselves with L. Frank gear on their way to fight in the Spanish-American War. The company's slogan was \"The horse-next to woman, God's greatest gift to man.\"\n\nWhen Joe Straus is not in Austin, he is an executive in the insurance and investment business. He entered that industry after a spell in Washington, where his wife, Julie Brink, worked in the Reagan White House and on George H. W. Bush's 1988 Presidential campaign. During that period, Straus served in the Commerce Department.\n\nHe is trim and dapper, like an account executive on \"Mad Men,\" and is the most prominent Jewish politician in Texas history. In campaigns, his opponents have mentioned his religion, to little effect. This is his fifth term as speaker, which ties the record. It's a surprise to many observers that the laconic and even-tempered Straus has persevered. Evan Smith told me, \"All the things they said about him-'He'd show up at a gunfight with a butter knife,' 'He can't make a fist'-they were all wrong. Joe Straus is so much tougher than he appears.\"\n\nHis speakership has focussed on providing the workforce and the infrastructure that Texas businesses need, by protecting public education, building roads, establishing more top-tier universities, and expanding job training. Perhaps his biggest victory was in 2013: in the middle of a devastating drought, he ushered through a two-billion-dollar revolving loan fund for state water projects.\n\nWith each session, Straus has watched the Republican Party drift farther away from the \"compassionate conservatism\" of the Governor Bush era and become increasingly dominated by Christian ideologues, such as Patrick, for whom economic issues are secondary. Although Democrats and non-Tea Party Republicans alike see Straus as a brake on the controversial cultural agenda being pushed by Abbott and Patrick, he worries that his supporters have unreasonable expectations. \"I can only do so much to keep the focus on fiscal issues and away from the divisive stuff,\" he told me. \"A few loud and fanatical people occasionally unsettle the majority of Republicans, who are really mainstream.\"\n\nUnlike Patrick, who decides which bills come to the floor in the Senate, Straus has to exercise influence by artfully appointing committee members, who can dull the fangs of fearsome bills (or let them languish until there's no time to consider them). Sometimes he thinks that his moderation, along with the relative centrism of the Texas House, is being used as a foil for the Senate radicals. \"The confidence that people seem to have in the House to serve as a stopper only enables the Senate to run hotter than it ever has before,\" he said.\n\nStraus believed that most Republicans in the House didn't want to vote for the bathroom bill, but, like their conservative colleagues in Washington, they worried about being challenged from the right in primaries. \"If it gets to the floor, it could be a close vote,\" Straus observed. \"I can't imagine anyone really wanting to follow North Carolina's example, but I can't guarantee that's not going to happen.\" Meanwhile, he was pressing his own legislative agenda, which included securing additional funds for public schools, improving Child Protective Services, and devoting more resources to mental health-even though the state budget had been hit because of the fall in oil and gas revenues.\n\nBefore the session began, Straus spoke out against the bathroom bill. \"I've become more blunt than ever,\" he told me. He frequently urges business leaders to remain firm in their opposition to such legislation. \"I try to be diplomatic but clear-that if you give in on the bathroom bill to preserve a tax break, there's another equally awful idea right behind it.\"\n\nAs the bathroom bill was moving through the Texas legislature, Mack Beggs, a seventeen-year-old transgender high-school student from Euless, Texas, won the girls' state wrestling championship, in the hundred-and-ten-pound weight class. He had been taking testosterone supplements as he transitioned to male, and he had won fifty-six matches in a row. Although he wants to wrestle boys-\"because I'm a guy,\" he told ESPN-the University Interscholastic League, which oversees the athletic programs in Texas public schools, recently adopted a rule that requires wrestling opponents to have the same sex listed on their birth certificates.\n\nIn February, the Trump Administration withdrew the protections that President Obama had instituted for transgender students in public schools. On March 6th, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case of a transgender student from Virginia, Gavin Grimm, who had sued to be allowed to use the boys' bathroom at school. That left the issue up to individual states, at least for now.\n\nDan Patrick said that the Texas bill would be a model for the rest of the nation. On March 7th, the bill had its first public hearing before the State Affairs Committee. Transgender Texans, along with their families, came to the capitol to speak, as did preachers, business leaders, and moral crusaders of all types. More than four hundred people signed up to testify at the hearing. The bill's author, Senator Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham, said that it was designed to \"find the balance of privacy, decency, respect, and dignity, to protect women, children, and all people.\"\n\nDana Hodges, the state director of a right-wing Christian organization called Concerned Women for America, was the first to testify in favor of the bill. She cast the issue as a matter of women's safety. \"I myself was the victim of being videotaped by a hidden camera placed in a women's bathroom stall by a man,\" she said, her voice trembling. She held up a plastic coat hook that, she said, was embedded with the kind of miniature camera that had been used to spy on her. Under questioning, she acknowledged that a non-transgender man had hidden the camera inside her stall, and that he had been punished under existing laws. Kolkhorst also conceded that she knew of no crimes committed in Texas bathrooms which had been attributed to transgender people. But her intent, she said, was to prevent nefarious people from taking advantage of inclusive bathroom policies. (Crimes against transgender people, meanwhile, are routine; according to Texas Monthly , a quarter of all transgender Texans have been physically assaulted.)\n\nDan Forest, the lieutenant governor of North Carolina and a strong advocate of that state's bathroom bill, came to Austin to testify that no businesses had actually left his state because of the bill, and that its economy had been hurt by \"less than one tenth of one per cent of North Carolina's annual G.D.P.\" (The Associated Press, after examining public records and interviewing business leaders who said that they had cancelled projects because of the bill, estimated that North Carolina would lose nearly four billion dollars over a dozen years.) On March 30th, the North Carolina legislators, assailed on many fronts, partially repealed their bill.\n\nIn Austin, the vast majority of witnesses spoke against the bathroom bill. One of them was Colt Keo-Meier, a transgender psychologist, who is currently enrolled in medical school at the University of Texas at Galveston. He wore a white lab coat, and a stethoscope around his neck. He said, \"If you pass this bill, my gender identity will be further invalidated, as I will not be able to continue attending medical school in the state of Texas. I would not be able to enter the men's rooms legally.\" Keo-Meier, who has a full beard, added, \"Look at me-I would not be able to enter the women's rest rooms safely.\" Concerns about voyeurism, he argued, were misplaced: \"I used the women's rest room for twenty-three years, and I used the men's rest room for ten years. I have not once seen any genitalia.\"\n\nA woman in a short-sleeved black dress identified herself as Jess Herbst, the mayor of New Hope, a tiny town north of Dallas, in a firmly Republican section of the state. A few weeks earlier, Mayor Herbst had written to her constituents to tell them that she was taking hormone-replacement therapy and transitioning to female. She had received overwhelming support, she told the committee. \"I just want to be able to use the women's room and not have someone ask me at the door for my papers,\" she said.\n\nThe testimony continued until nearly five in the morning. The committee voted to support the bill, 8-1.\n\nLink copied\n\nOn the evening of April 6th, I went to the capitol to watch the legislature struggle to fulfill its mandatory duty to pass a budget. House members had been at it all day, and, yet again, the discussion would go on until the early morning. The air-conditioning was merciless; one of the members showed me the long johns poking out from under his shirt cuffs. I saw 5-Hour Energy shots arrayed on some desks.\n\nDesperation suffuses the chamber on Budget Night-the last stand for bills that have not been funded. The trick is that, in order to get the money for your legislation, you have to take it from somewhere else. The members were on guard, lest their own bills be raided. More than four hundred amendments to the budget were awaiting their turn. One baffling amendment-offered by Valoree Swanson, a freshman Freedom Caucus member from a suburb of Houston-would prevent state funds from being used to renovate bathrooms in order to \"allow or enable a man to enter a women's restroom facility.\"\n\nThere are some extraordinary people in the House. Senfronia Thompson is a seventy-eight-year-old former teacher from Houston. Known as Ms. T., she is in her twentieth term, and is one of the few Democrats with real power: she chairs the Local and Consent Calendars Committee, one of the gateways many bills must pass through in order to reach the floor. Unlike a lot of other state legislatures, the Texas legislature still follows a tradition of awarding important posts to members of the minority party. This is true even in Dan Patrick's Senate.\n\nThompson once told me that, when she was a girl, African-Americans were not welcome in the capitol. Now she is the longest-serving woman and black person in Texas legislative history. Among her many accomplishments is a hate-crimes act, passed in 2001, that includes protections for homosexuals. She has also fought against racial profiling and passed measures to help low-income Texans pay their utility bills.\n\nArmando Martinez, a forty-one-year-old Democratic member from the Valley, is a firefighter and a paramedic. He showed up on the first day of the session with a bandage on his head; on New Year's Eve, he'd been hit by a stray celebratory bullet. Martinez filed a bill to prohibit the \"reckless discharge of a firearm.\"\n\nDr. John Zerwas, a Republican anesthesiologist from Richmond, Texas, is the chair of the Appropriations Committee. A business conservative in the Straus mold, he is deeply respected in the legislature, and Straus selected him to craft the House version of the budget. The main difference between the House's budget and the Senate's was that Zerwas proposed dipping into the Rainy Day Fund. The fund, which is amassed largely from oil and gas taxes, is designated for emergencies. It is projected to grow to twelve billion dollars by 2019, which is more than the annual budget of a dozen other states. Patrick maintains that the fund should not be used for \"ongoing expenses,\" but Zerwas wanted to take two and a half billion dollars out of the pot, in part to finance health care and public schools-Joe Straus priorities.\n\nAn incident in the afternoon had suggested how the budget fight would play out. A freshman member, Briscoe Cain, presented an amendment to shut down an advisory panel on palliative care. Normally, freshmen keep quiet, but Cain is an assertive member of the insurgent Freedom Caucus. Thirty-two years old, he is proudly bratty, like Matthew Broderick in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\" \"This amendment seeks to get rid of what I've kind of nicknamed the 'advisory death panel,' \" Cain said, using a term for end-of-life counselling that is popular among the far right.\n\nSoon afterward, Zerwas came to the microphone and stood there, giving Cain what Jonathan Tilove, in his blog for the Austin American-Statesman , jokingly called the morem pellis hispidus distentione nervorum: the hairy eyeball.\n\nIt's fascinating to watch the choreography of the members when deep political chords are struck. The Freedom Caucus members gathered with Cain at a microphone in the front of the chamber; the traditional Republicans, along with some Democrats, stood beside Zerwas at a microphone in the rear. It was the Texas version of the Montagues versus the Capulets.\n\n\"Would you please describe for me what a death panel is?\" the mighty chairman of appropriations demanded.\n\n\"A death panel is whereby a group of individuals unrelated to the person in the hospital decide whether or not that person should live or die,\" Cain replied.\n\n\"Have you ever understood, really, what palliative care is?\" Zerwas asked.\n\n\"Mr. Zerwas, being in your profession, I am sure you could inform this body better than I could,\" Cain replied.\n\nThe old warhorses in the House knew, if Cain did not, that Zerwas had lost his first wife to brain cancer. He wore a ring on his right hand in her memory. Zerwas said, \"You could probably ask fifty, sixty, seventy, a hundred members in this House who have had somebody with a serious illness who has dealt with this particular issue.\"\n\nZerwas forced Cain, several times, to admit having made false or uninformed statements. \"You know about this, and I don't,\" Cain finally said. \"My apologies.\" The amendment was withdrawn.\n\nCain later saved face when he offered an amendment that would block the Texas Department of Criminal Justice from paying for a \"sex reassignment or gender transitioning\" operation-something that has never actually happened. Cain's battle cry: \"Don't California my Texas!\"\n\nI caught the eye of Pat Fallon, a Republican member from Frisco, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. He lives in a wealthy, intensely conservative bedroom community that was all cow pasture when I was growing up nearby. Many young legislators, like Fallon, are not originally from Texas. I asked him how he came to live in the state. He said that, after playing football for Notre Dame, he joined the Air Force, and was stationed in Texas. \"They asked me my state of residence, and I said, 'Massachusetts.' The payroll officer informed me that Massachusetts has a 5.6-per-cent income tax, but there's no income tax in Texas. So I said, 'I'm a Texan!' \"\n\nThis term was his third. So far, he's best known for co-authoring a bill, in 2013, that reasserted the right of students and employees at public schools to say \"Merry Christmas\" rather than \"Happy Holidays.\"\n\n\"Have you got an amendment?\" I asked Fallon.\n\n\"Yeah, it's No. 152, in which we defund the portion of the Travis County Public Integrity Unit's investigation of insurance fraud and motor-vehicle tax fraud.\" The unit has been under attack for years, because it also addresses crimes committed by state officials. Of course, anything attacking Austin-a spore of the California fungus that is destroying America-is popular.\n\n\"Who would do the investigating, then?\" I asked.\n\n\"The attorney general,\" Fallon responded.\n\nKen Paxton, I reminded Fallon, was under indictment for securities fraud. (He has pleaded not guilty.)\n\n\"I would prefer it not be that way,\" Fallon said. \"But he hasn't been convicted.\"\n\nFallon ranks high on the conservative \"report cards,\" compiled by watchdog groups, by which modern right-wing legislators live and die. One of the most feared is the Fiscal Responsibility Index, a powerful weapon against less than ultra-radical Republicans. It is produced by Empower Texans, a group led by Michael Quinn Sullivan, who is known by his initials, M.Q.S. Some members pronounce it \"Mucus.\"\n\nSullivan is tall and friendly. He likes to talk about the Boy Scouts (he was an Eagle Scout), the Aggies (he was in the A. & M. Corps of Cadets), and his three children. A right-wing zealot, he is sometimes described as the most powerful non-elected political figure in Texas. Several years ago, Sullivan and I had lunch, and he told me, \"I'm not there to get a seat at the table. I'm there to get rid of the table.\" In other words, he wants to destroy the government.\n\nEmpower Texans is funded largely by a reclusive Midland oilman named Tim Dunn, an evangelical Christian who hopes to create in Texas an example of small government that could be replicated by other states and countries. Even people who hate Dunn's politics consider him the most effective moneyman in the state. He has steadily pushed Republican lawmakers farther right, eliminating the kind of middle-ground figures who support Joe Straus. Dunn has made it a mission to bring down the Speaker.\n\nWhile Fallon and I were talking, Jonathan Stickland approached the front microphone. Stickland, a member of the Freedom Caucus, is generously supported by Empower Texans. He is a former pest-control technician from Bedford, near Arlington, who now calls himself an oil and gas consultant. Stickland is plump, with an imposing beard, narrow-set brown eyes, and an occasional broad smile revealing beautiful teeth. He made news in the 2015 session by posting a sign outside his office:\n\nRepresentative\n\nJonathan Stickland\n\nFORMER FETUS\n\nDistrict 92\n\nStickland's amendment was to defund the state's feral-hog-abatement program, which kills thousands of the rampaging beasts each year. Stickland called the program ridiculous and a waste of money. \"It has not worked, and it never will work!\" he declared, infuriating rural lawmakers, who consider wild pigs a nearly existential menace. They converged on Stickland from all sides. Everything came to a dead stop.\n\nA brass rail circumscribes the chamber; only members, pages, and clerks can go inside. I was hovering around the rail, and Speaker Straus came over to say hello. He seemed totally at ease: smiling, hands in his pockets. He said, \"I guess all the hogs are going to move to Arlington\"-which is partly in Stickland's district. Straus was in no hurry to impose order. He looked at the scrum of lawmakers around Stickland. \"Just think,\" he said. \"These are the people responsible for spending two hundred and eighteen billion dollars.\"\n\nAt the rear microphone stood Drew Springer, a Republican from North Texas, whose district-twice the size of Maryland-is copiously supplied with wild pigs. He proposed attaching an amendment to Stickland's amendment. It would cut nine hundred thousand dollars in funds for roads and highways-the same amount as the hog-abatement program-but only in Stickland's home town. The measure passed, with undisguised enthusiasm. Stickland pulled his amendment down, but then charged toward Springer. They met in the middle of the chamber, nose to nose. Stickland is known to carry a concealed weapon, so I was a little worried. But other members separated the men, and Straus reluctantly gavelled the House to order.\n\nI left before the budget was passed, long after my bedtime. By dawn, it was clear that Dan Patrick and the Tea Party had suffered one defeat after another in Joe Straus's House. Earlier in the session, Patrick had demanded an up-or-down vote on subsidizing tuition for private schools, and it was crushed, 103-44. A proposal to \"zero out\" money for the Texas Commission on the Arts was brushed aside.\n\nGovernor Abbott's \"enterprise fund,\" which he used to lure businesses to the state, would be emptied, and its budget of forty-three million dollars would be dispersed between Child Protective Services and therapy for disabled children. Paxton, the attorney general, would lose more than twenty million dollars from his budget for lawsuits; that money would be redirected to foster-care programs. None of these changes had become law yet-they had to be ratified by the Senate first.\n\nThe exhausted Democrats and Republicans made a deal: the Democrats agreed to provide only nominal opposition to the defunding of Planned Parenthood, which was going to happen in any case; in return, the bathroom amendment was pulled from consideration. Other controversial amendments were placed in Article 11 of the budget, a kind of wish list of things to be debated in the future. Legislators call Article 11 \"the graveyard.\" But in the Texas legislature the dead have been known to walk.\n\nThe relationship between the capitol and the city of Austin is antagonistic. The city has long been known as a blue dot in a red state. It sees itself as standing apart from the vulgar political culture of the rest of Texas, like Rome surrounded by the Goths. Republican politicians bridle at the disdain. \"It's great to be out of the People's Republic of Austin,\" Governor Abbott declared recently, at a Republican dinner in Bell County. \"Once you cross the Travis County line, it starts smelling different. And you know what that fragrance is? Freedom. It's the smell of freedom that does not exist in Austin, Texas.\"\n\nThis tirade was apparently triggered by a local ordinance that requires a permit to cut down a \"heritage tree\"-one whose trunk diameter exceeds nineteen inches. When Abbott was attorney general and living in Austin, he was infuriated when he had to compensate the city before cutting down a pecan tree that stood in the way of his future swimming pool.\n\nMany residents of Austin don't mind its image as a lonely liberal outpost. I'm part of a group that puts up statues in Austin, and our most recent work was a bronze replica of Willie Nelson. At Nelson's request, it was unveiled, in 2012, on April 20th-National Marijuana Day. He stood in front of his giant likeness and sang \"Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die.\"\n\nOn the Sunday after Trump was elected President, about a hundred and fifty people gathered on the capitol steps and marched down Congress Avenue. A small group of Trump supporters was staging a counter-protest. According to news reports, one man was especially conspicuous: Joseph Weidknecht, a laid-off sheet-metal worker, who is six feet six and weighs three hundred and fifty pounds. He was wearing a \" MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN \" cap and carried a sign that said \" PROUD TO BE DEPLORABLE \"-a reference to Hillary Clinton's derogatory remark about Trump supporters. A number of the anti-Trump marchers, some wearing Guy Fawkes masks, ripped the sign out of his hands, grabbed his hat, and tried to set his shirt on fire. \"I can handle myself in a brawl,\" Weidknecht later told the Austin American-Statesman . \"But when they brought out the lighters I was genuinely scared for my life.\"\n\nA small woman wearing a hijab forced herself between Weidknecht and the people assaulting him. She was Amina Amdeen, a nineteen-year-old student at the university, who had immigrated to the U.S. from Iraq when she was ten. \"She stood there like a mountain, trying to stop the violence,\" Weidknecht said. The police arrested six of the protesters.\n\n\"I do not stand for what he stands for,\" Amdeen remarked. \"But I know his fears and concerns are valid. I love this country so much, and I don't like what I see coming.\"\n\nIn February, two weeks after the Trump Administration began its attempts to block Muslims from entering the U.S., anti-immigrant posters started appearing outside buildings at the University of Texas at Austin. \" IMAGINE A MUSLIM-FREE AMERICA ,\" one said. Around this time, a mosque was firebombed in Victoria, two hours southeast of Austin. Sid Miller, the state's agricultural commissioner, told the BBC that he worried about America becoming a Muslim country. (Muslims account for about one per cent of the U.S. population.) He previously advocated dropping nuclear bombs on the Muslim world.\n\nMy wife, Roberta, has a close friend, a writer, who is married to a professor. They are Jewish, and they have a \" BLACK LIVES MATTER \" sign in their yard. As the sanctuary-cities bill, S.B. 4, was being debated in the capitol, an unsigned letter was left at their front door. It threatened the lives of their children, by name. \"Is this Austin?\" Roberta cried.\n\nIn April, S.B. 4 progressed to the House. Among Republicans who vote in Texas primaries, the hottest issue is immigration. Many state legislators who otherwise might not support the bill seemed intimidated by the political environment, and it was apparent that Straus and his team had no battle plan. Meanwhile, Patrick's counterparts, frustrated by their losses in the budget battles, began adding amendments to make S.B. 4 even tougher. Matt Schaefer, of the Freedom Caucus, amended the bill to allow police officers to question a suspect's immigration status-a \"show me your papers\" provision. Law-enforcement authorities in Texas's major cities had loudly opposed such an idea, saying that it would make immigrants less likely to report crimes. Art Acevedo, Houston's police chief, said that the number of Hispanics reporting rape in his city was already down forty-three per cent-apparently a result of Trump's crackdown on undocumented immigrants. Schaefer's amendment was similar to a 2010 Arizona law that had been partly struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\"This is something that Texans in our district have been asking for,\" Schaefer said. \"This is good policy.\"\n\nGene Wu, the Democratic House member from Houston, who was born in China, spoke against the bill, tearfully comparing it to the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, the country's first major anti-immigration law. \"This topic is painful for me, because I'm an immigrant,\" he said. \"My parents are immigrants. I represent a district filled with immigrants.\" As he spoke, supportive Democrats surrounded him. \"Some are here as refugees. Some are here as citizens. Some are here without papers. But they are all my people.\"\n\nFor Wu, the sanctuary-cities bill was the natural culmination of the \"bigoted, racist mentality\" that has emerged in Texas, which he calls the epicenter of the Tea Party. \"Trump is simply the most visible manifestation of that mentality,\" he told me. \"It's been percolating up in the Republican Party for the past decade.\"\n\nAnother Democratic lawmaker, Ana Hernandez, of Houston, recalled coming to this country as a child: \"I remember the constant fear my family lived with each day, the fear my parents experienced each day, as their two little girls went to school, not knowing if there would be an immigration raid that day.\"\n\nBehind the scenes, the Republican and Democratic caucuses met for hours, trying to find a way to dodge Schaefer's amendment. \"The Republicans came to us and said, 'Some of us are going to have a hard time voting against it,' \" Wu told me. Knowing that the law would inevitably be challenged in court, Republicans offered to shelve the amendment if the Democrats made some minor concessions. But the Democrats took too long to agree on terms, and the Republicans withdrew the offer.\n\nAfter sixteen hours of emotional debate, the House passed S.B. 4 with the \"show me your papers\" amendment. A week later, Governor Abbott signed it into law, on Facebook Live. \"Citizens expect law-enforcement officers to enforce the law,\" he said. \"Citizens deserve lawbreakers to face legal consequences.\"\n\nAs usual, the Texas legislature passed anti-abortion bills. One bans the safest and most common procedure for second-trimester abortions: dilation and evacuation. Supporters of the legislation call this a \"dismemberment abortion.\" The law also requires health-care facilities to bury or cremate aborted fetuses.\n\nIn addition, the legislature passed several bills to reform the agencies overseeing abused and endangered children-one of Governor Abbott's priorities. In the first seven months of the state's fiscal year, the number of foster children spending two or more consecutive nights in hotels or government office buildings had risen to three hundred and fourteen. The new legislation gave raises to the underpaid caseworkers, but in some ways it was yet another anti-government measure. The bill partially stripped the state of responsibility for its wards, handing them off to contractors. Abbott said that Janis Graham Jack, the federal judge who had ruled that Texas's foster-care system violated children's rights, should dismiss the case before her, because the new legislation \"completely transforms the system in ways that will make it better.\" Child-welfare advocates have criticized the new legislation, saying that private groups may not have the expertise to take over case-management duties, particularly when dealing with troubled children. \"I expect the Texas Child Protective Services and the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to strive for, achieve, and to accomplish No. 1 ranking status in the United States of America,\" Abbott said, as he signed the legislation.\n\nOn April 6th, the hog-abatement funds were approved, despite Jonathan Stickland's attempts at sabotage. And a new law allowed the hunting of wild pigs from hot-air balloons. \"We've got a problem here, and we are willing to fix it,\" Mark Keough, a Republican from the Woodlands, told the Texas Observer . \"We have that Western, swashbuckling, cowboying type of way to deal with things.\" Texans already could legally shoot pigs from helicopters-even with machine guns-but who knew that it was ever against the law to shoot pigs from balloons?\n\nSpeaker Straus continued to sideline the bathroom bill. He remained certain that most Republicans in the House didn't really favor the measure, though they also didn't want to be seen as opposing it. He asked Governor Abbott to stand with him against the measure. Abbott is better known as a business conservative, like Straus, than as a cultural conservative, like Patrick, but he showed little interest in choosing a side, because he was bound to create enemies in either case. Finally, Abbott blandly stated that he favored a bill \"to protect privacy in bathrooms.\" He signalled that a bill then headed for a committee hearing in the House, H.B. 2899, was a \"thoughtful proposal.\" Although it would not mandate bathroom use based on biological sex, H.B. 2899 would impede the enforcement of local nondiscrimination ordinances, and it would not stop businesses or lawmakers from imposing bathroom bans in the future.\n\nOn May 21st, the House began debating the measure. Once again, hours of anguished testimony ensued. Half a dozen female members wandered into the men's bathroom just off the House floor. \"We're feeling like making trouble today,\" one of the women, Gina Hinojosa, a Democrat from Austin, told reporters. \"It's that kind of mood.\"\n\nShortly before dawn, the House committee members retired without a vote, effectively killing the measure. At the last minute, several lawmakers had asserted their conservative bona fides by signing on as co-sponsors of the doomed legislation. It was the most desirable outcome imaginable.\n\nThere were still eight days left in the session.\n\nOne of the major forces behind the bathroom bill, and a big supporter of Dan Patrick, was Steve Hotze, a Houston physician and a longtime ultraconservative kingmaker. Starting in the mid-nineties, he made a fortune from alternative hormone-replacement therapies and the sale of controversial supplements, such as colloidal silver, which he recommends for treating colds and the flu, and for promoting pet health. Colloidal silver can cause argyria, in which a patient's skin permanently turns the color of a blue jay.\n\nIn 1986, Hotze signed the manifesto of an evangelical Christian group called the Coalition on Revival, which endorses the idea that \"the ultimate cause of all disease, deformity, disability, and death is the sin of Adam and Eve.\" As for government: \"We deny that any final authority outside the Bible (e.g., reason, experience, majority opinion, elite opinion, nature, etc.) ought to be accepted as the standard of government for any individual, group, or jurisdiction.\"\n\nIn the aughts, Hotze hosted a show on the talk-radio station that Patrick now owns in Houston. He recently released a couple of songs-perhaps they should be called lamentations-such as \"God Fearing Texans Stop Obamacare\":\n\nWhat would Sam Houston do?\n\nWhat would Davy Crockett do?\n\nI know what I'm going to do.\n\nI'm going to fight Obamacare,\n\nI'm going to defeat Obamacare.\n\nHotze's main cause is attacking homosexuals, or \"homofascists,\" as he calls them. \"The homosexual political movement will force churches, schools, businesses, and individuals to accept, to affirm, and even celebrate those who participate in anal sex,\" he has said. Sodomy, he went on, \"will be mandated to be taught to the children in the schools at an early age, starting in kindergarten.\" It goes without saying that homosexuals \"want to make Texas a clone of California.\"\n\nIn 2014, Dan Patrick ran for lieutenant governor, and Hotze became one of his chief fund-raisers. In a video endorsement, he stood next to Patrick and said, \"Dan Patrick's leadership will keep Texas the most conservative state in the country.\" Patrick added, \"The Democrats understand that, if they can take Texas, we will never have a Republican in the White House again. They will control the country. There's not another Texas to move to, folks. This is it.\"\n\nPatrick was referring to the fact that, as Texas's liberal cities have burgeoned, the state has grown markedly less red. All of its major urban areas except Fort Worth are Democratic and have been for decades. Dallas went for Obama in both elections. In Houston, America's most diverse city, the country's first openly lesbian big-city mayor was succeeded by the city's second black mayor. (Harris County, however, which encompasses Houston, has Republican judges in the courthouse.) San Antonio has always been a progressive stronghold, though it often votes Republican in statewide races. In the 2016 election, Trump garnered fifty-two per cent of the vote in Texas, compared with sixty-five per cent in neighboring Oklahoma. Texas is more purple than many Americans realize, and that's what keeps conservatives in the state on edge.\n\nHotze runs a political-action committee called Conservative Republicans of Texas. He also maintains the group's Web site, and on May 16th he wrote of the bathroom bill, \"There are Texas legislators . . . who would allow perverted men and boys, who sexually fantasize that they are women, to enter women's and girls' bathrooms, showers and locker rooms.\" He implored his readers to pray with him:\n\nIn the Name of Jesus, I prophesy and declare: May all the individuals serving in the state legislature, and their staff, who support, promote and practice sodomy and other perverted, sexually deviant lifestyles, who support the killing of unborn babies, and who hate God's Law and God's Word, receive just retribution from God for their evil actions. . . . May they be consumed, collapse, rot and be blown away as dust from their current positions because of their wicked works, thoughts and deeds.\n\nIn an e-mail, Patrick's office described Hotze as a \"longtime supporter,\" but added, \"The Lieutenant Governor does not agree with everything that any of his supporters say or do.\" Straus told me, \"Steve Hotze exists on the fringes. Mainstream Republicans don't take him seriously.\" Hotze, meanwhile, has been campaigning to have Straus removed as speaker.\n\nOn May 20th, Tom Mechler, the chairman of the state Republican Party, resigned, citing personal reasons. He issued a letter pleading for party unity. \"A party that is fractured by anger and backbiting is a party that will not succeed,\" he said. He also warned that the Republican Party had failed to attract voters outside the white demographic, and was therefore destined for electoral oblivion. \"If we do not continue to make efforts to engage in the diverse communities across Texas, our state will turn blue,\" he warned. He urged the next chairman to reshape the Party in the image of modern Texas.\n\nSoon after Mechler's resignation, Rob Morrow-the former Travis County Republican Party chairman with the motley-fool hat-announced his candidacy for the statewide position. His priorities had not changed since he had been drummed out of office. In a statement for the press, he declared, \"I like big titties. I am a proponent of boobyliciousness. In the past several years I have shared on social media the pics of over 500 extremely hot, busty women.\" He concluded by saying, \"I am for having bikini contests at the Alamo every 4th of July. Case closed.\"\n\nThe twelve members of the Texas Freedom Caucus were furious at Straus and his allies for impeding their legislation, which included yet more bills targeting abortion, and measures that would further loosen gun laws and roll back property taxes. They decided to get revenge, with what became known as the Mother's Day Massacre.\n\nBills that are not considered controversial are often placed before the House for a pro-forma vote. In May, a hundred and twenty-one such proposals, known as consent bills, were awaiting approval. However, if five or more members object to a consent bill, it must go through the normal legislative process, and be scheduled for discussion on the House floor. This year, the clock for such discussions ran out at midnight on May 11th-the Thursday before Mother's Day weekend. Hours before midnight, the Freedom Caucus objected to the entire slate of consent bills, making it impossible for them to be heard this session. The doomed consent bills included two that addressed the sharp rise in maternal mortality in Texas. Shawn Thierry, a Democrat from Houston, begged Freedom Caucus members to spare her bill, which would have commissioned a study that focussed on low-income black mothers. She argued that the bill was pro-life, because mothers who died in childbirth had carried their babies to term. Although the Freedom Caucus members agreed with her on this point, they refused her request, adding that it wasn't personal. \"It was like a drive-by shooting,\" Thierry later said.\n\nNext the Freedom Caucus chewed up time in leisurely debate, proposing amendments and making objections to bills already under consideration. The House was brought to a standstill. An hour passed as they debated inconsequential amendments to a bill on industrial-workforce training. (The minority Democrats had perfected such tactics in the past.)\n\nTime was running out to consider any of the other scheduled legislation. Drew Springer, the representative from North Texas who killed Stickland's anti-hog-abatement amendment, pleaded for H.B. 810, which would fund experimental stem-cell treatments. He spoke on behalf of his wife, who is in a wheelchair. Such treatments \"might give somebody like my wife a chance to walk,\" he said, between sobs. \"I'd trade every one of my bills I've passed, every single one, to get the chance to hear H.B. 810.\" The Freedom Caucus gave in on this one, and it passed.\n\nAlso among the slain consent bills was H.B. 3302, a sunset safety-net bill. It had been crafted to preserve important state agencies that would otherwise be phased out under an automatic review policy, which takes place every twelve years. One of the agencies up for review was the state medical board. If the medical board expired, there would be no agency to license doctors in Texas. It wasn't clear if Freedom Caucus members had realized the far-reaching consequences of killing H.B. 3302.\n\nDan Patrick, however, recognized that an important lever had been handed to him. The only way to avoid the consequences of H.B. 3302's failing to pass was for a similar bill to be passed in the Senate-which had a later deadline-and then sent back to the House. On the Monday after Mother's Day, Speaker Straus wrote a letter to Patrick, urging the Senate to pass such a bill-along with the budget-so that the legislature could avoid a special session. In response, Patrick privately sent him specific terms for a deal. The House had to pass the bathroom bill and another item on Patrick's agenda-a bill that capped local property taxes. In return, the Senate would agree to pass its own version of the sunset safety-net bill, as well as the budget and several other items, including one championed by Straus, which dealt with school-finance reform. Public schools in Texas are financed through property taxes, along with federal and state funds. Over the years, the state's contribution per student has diminished, with property taxes making up the difference. To restore the balance, Straus wanted to allocate one and a half billion state dollars to the public schools.\n\nThe Senate had added an amendment to the school-finance-reform bill, however, which amounted to what Straus called a \"poison pill\": a provision for vouchers for private schools. The House had already rejected this idea, but Patrick felt that Texas schools had enough money. In an op-ed published in early June, he noted that total education spending, including universities, was already the largest item in the budget-\"about fifty-two per cent of all state dollars.\" He added, \"It is disingenuous to suggest that we are, somehow, holding back funding that we could spend on schools.\" (Education spending, as a percentage of the Texas budget, is lower than it has been in at least twenty years.)\n\nBy now, the ill will between the two men had spilled over into the chambers they led. Lyle Larson, the San Antonio Republican, who is close to Straus, accused the Senate of \"taking hostages\" when it promised to pass certain House bills only if the House voted for Patrick's priorities. \"I've got six,\" Larson cried. \"How many other bills were held hostage by the Texas Senate?\"\n\nA roar went up in the House, which only grew when Harold Dutton, a Houston Democrat, took to the front microphone. \"When the Senate won't respect us, they need to expect us,\" he said. \"I don't know if they can see us. But would you have them open the door so they can hear us?\" The House doors were flung open, as the frustrated representatives bayed like wolves at the Senate chamber, across the capitol.\n\nGovernor Abbott had warned Speaker Straus that he would demand action on the bathroom bill-even if he had to call a special session. With Straus's blessing, a compromise was crafted by Chris Paddie, a Republican representative from Marshall, in northeast Texas. It was styled as an amendment to a bill on school safety, and would affect grade schools and high schools but not universities or government buildings. It affirmed the right of all students to use the bathroom with \"privacy, dignity, and safety\"-language that strongly echoed Patrick's scaremongering about potential transgender predators. But it did not explicitly bar students from using particular bathrooms.\n\nAcross Texas, school districts and chambers of commerce seemed resigned to accept the amendment. In Straus's opinion, it codified a reasonable practice that many schools had already adopted. Still, there was fierce opposition in the House from Democrats who saw it as appeasement. Representative Rafael Anchia, of Dallas, reminded the other members that, since they had begun debating the bathroom issue, in January, ten transgender people had been violently killed in the U.S. He read their names aloud.\n\nThe amendment passed the House, but Patrick wasn't satisfied. He said that it didn't \"appear to do much.\" Time was running out. Straus declared that Patrick could take Paddie's amendment or leave it. \"For many of us-and especially for me-this was a compromise,\" Straus told reporters. \"As far as I'm concerned, it was enough. We will go no further. This is the right thing to do in order to protect our economy from billions of dollars in losses and more importantly to protect the safety of some very vulnerable young Texans.\" It was \"absurd,\" he said, that passing a bathroom bill had taken on more urgency than fixing the school-finance system.\n\nPatrick did not relent. He said of Straus, \"Instead of siding with the people of Texas-and, as a Republican, siding with Republicans of Texas-he has decided to support the policies of Barack Obama, who said, 'I want boys and girls in every shower in every school in the country.' \" (Obama never said this.) Patrick then added a remark aimed directly at Abbott: \"Tonight, I'm making it very clear, Governor. I want you to call us back on your own time.\" The two chambers succeeded in passing a budget, but a special session seemed inevitable.\n\nAbbott clearly hated the position he had been thrust into. A special session devoted almost entirely to the bathroom bill, he knew, would focus even more unwanted national attention on Texas. Only the governor can call a special session, and though he can nominally set the agenda, special sessions can get out of hand. There was no guarantee that Abbott would get the outcome he hoped for.\n\nLink copied\n\nOn May 27th, the C.E.O.s of fourteen companies with a significant presence in Texas, including Apple, Amazon, Cisco, Google, and I.B.M., sent Abbott a letter. \"We are gravely concerned that any such legislation would deeply tarnish Texas' reputation as open and friendly to businesses and families,\" it said. The bill would harm the companies' ability to recruit talent to the state, they asserted, adding, \"Discrimination is wrong and it has no place in Texas.\"\n\nAround this time, reporters caught up with Abbott at a gun range, where he signed a law lowering the cost of gun licenses. He then shot a few rounds at a target sheet, which he proudly displayed to the reporters. (The Texas press has generally been very kind to him.) This was the day after Montana elected a U.S. representative, in a special election, who had body-slammed a reporter, sending him to the hospital. This was the same season in which Trump had declared the press the enemy. Abbott held up his bullet-riddled target and said, \"I'm gonna carry this around in case I see any reporters.\"\n\nOn the Friday before the end of the session, Straus told me, Patrick sent two emissaries from the Senate to visit him at his office. (Patrick's spokeswoman says that this is \"not accurate.\") One of the senators carried an envelope that apparently contained the language of a bathroom bill that Patrick would accept. The senator, whose name Straus would not disclose, was a lawyer, and told Straus that the language had been carefully crafted to insure that the bill would override any local antidiscrimination ordinances. The senator started to open the envelope, but Straus said not to bother. \"I'm not a lawyer, but I am a Texan,\" he said. \"I'm disgusted by all this. Tell the lieutenant governor I don't want the suicide of a single Texan on my hands.\"\n\nDuring the regular legislative session, more than sixty-six hundred bills were filed, and more than twelve hundred were passed into law. The session was widely seen as being dictated by Dan Patrick, but many of the signature items that he had supported-school vouchers, property-tax rollbacks, and the bathroom bill-failed to pass.\n\nThe major cities in Texas recently joined in a lawsuit against S.B. 4-the sanctuary-cities bill-saying that it will lead to racial profiling, and that regulating immigration is a power reserved for the federal government. The U.S. Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, announced that the Justice Department would help defend S.B. 4. \"President Trump has made a commitment to keep America safe,\" he said. \"Texas has admirably followed his lead by mandating statewide coöperation with federal immigration laws that require the removal of illegal aliens who have committed crimes.\"\n\nOne of the bills that Governor Abbott signed into law allows faith-based adoption groups to reject applicants whose sexual orientation is counter to their beliefs. In response to the law, California's attorney general, Xavier Becerra, banned state employees from travelling to Texas at taxpayers' expense. Dan Patrick jumped at the chance to taunt California. \"Of course, California does have a reason to be angry at Texas,\" he said. \"Thousands of folks fled California's high taxes and liberal attitudes to come to Texas in 2015.\"\n\nThe session concluded this year on Memorial Day, and so fallen soldiers were honored. Legislators said goodbye to colleagues with whom they had endured a hundred and forty of the most intense days of their lives.\n\nMeanwhile, buses began arriving at the capitol. Hundreds of protesters, some from distant states, burst through the doors, filling all four levels of the rotunda and spilling into the House gallery. They unfurled banners (\" SEE YOU IN COURT !\") and chanted, \"S.B. 4 has got to go!\" One of the protest organizers, Stephanie Gharakhanian, explained to reporters, \"We wanted to make sure we gave them the sendoff they deserve.\"\n\nA few of the Democrats in the chamber looked up at the chanting protesters and began to applaud. State troopers cleared the gallery and broke up the protest, but by that time some of the Republicans on the floor had taken offense. Matt Rinaldi, a member of the Freedom Caucus from Dallas County, who is sometimes rated the most conservative member of the House, later told Fox Business Network that he noticed several banners bearing the message \" I AM UNDOCUMENTED AND HERE TO STAY .\" He called ICE , and then bragged to his Hispanic colleagues about it.\n\nA shoving match broke out on the House floor. Curses flew. Afterward, Rinaldi posted on Facebook that Poncho Nevárez, a Democrat from the border town of Eagle Pass, had threatened his life. \"Poncho told me he would 'get me on the way to my car,' \" Rinaldi wrote, adding that he made it clear that \"I would shoot him in self-defense.\"\n\nThe next day, the capitol was subdued. In the House chamber, docents were again leading school tours. In the rotunda, a high-school orchestra was playing a piece for woodwinds. I went up to the second floor, where the acoustics were better. The orchestra was from Kountze, a little East Texas town that had the distinction, in 1991, of electing America's first Muslim mayor. The musicians were arrayed in the center of the rotunda, atop the seals of the republic and the five nations of which Texas had once been part: Spain, France, Mexico, the United States, and the Confederacy. I was moved by the thought that the long and bloody history of Texas had arrived at this moment, with small-town kids bringing the many voices of the state into harmony.\n\nSpeaker Straus was waiting in his chambers, seated on the couch in his shirtsleeves, under a painting of Hereford cattle. He looked far more relaxed than I thought was warranted, given that Governor Abbott was poised to call a special session that would likely focus on Patrick's must-pass bills. But Straus seemed satisfied. He boasted that the priorities of the House- his priorities-had mostly been accomplished. \"We did the Child Protective Services reforms, adding fourteen hundred new caseworkers,\" he said. \"We made tremendous progress on mental-health reforms and funding.\" Texas's decrepit hospitals were going to be upgraded. A health-care plan for retired teachers had been saved. Enormous cuts to higher education had been averted. \"These were issues a little bit under the radar, because they're not sensational, but they're issues that are going to make a big difference in Texas lives,\" Straus said. \"What we didn't achieve was to begin fixing the school-finance system, which everybody knows is a disaster.\"\n\nStraus said that some schools in districts that had been strongly affected by the downturn in the oil and gas economy might have to be closed. \"We had a plan to bridge that,\" he noted. \"Unfortunately, the Senate had other priorities.\" He attributed the failure to Patrick's \"fixation on vouchers.\"\n\nI asked Straus about the clash between business and cultural conservatives. He quoted William H. Seward, Lincoln's Secretary of State, who described the forthcoming Civil War as \"an irrepressible conflict.\" The prejudices unleashed by the election of Donald Trump had poured kerosene on the already volatile world of Texas politics. Straus, referring to the bathroom bill, said, \"We came very close this session to passing a sweepingly discriminatory policy. It would have sent a very negative message around the country.\"\n\n\"That's still possible, right?\" I asked. Couldn't Abbott put forward his own bill in the special session and threaten to veto any amendments?\n\nStraus agreed, but noted, \"The legislature is not obligated to act upon his agenda items within the thirty-day period. And the Governor would have the option to call as many thirty-day sessions as he would like.\"\n\n\"So the bill could stay in committee and not get voted out?\"\n\nStraus smiled.\n\nThe session was the most fractious in memory, and the bad feelings stirred up in the capitol will linger long after the lawmakers return home. Immigrant communities are fearful, lawmakers are vengeful, and hatemongers feel entitled to spread their message. And the bitter battle among Texas Republicans isn't over. Governor Abbott called a special session, to reconvene on July 18th, and set forth a list of twenty items that he said required action. Most of them could have been passed in the regular session; none of them were a priority for him before the session began. In addition to the bathroom bill, his list of demands included education vouchers, caps on state and local spending, and new abortion restrictions. He also asked for a thousand-dollar raise for public-school teachers, which the local school boards-not the state-would likely have to pay for. \"I expect legislators to return with a calm demeanor, and with a firm commitment to make Texas even better,\" he said. Straus was not intimidated. He told me, \"We're under no obligation to pass anything.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Texas have put political ambition above public good amid statewide crises.\n\nby Nicole Narea\n\nRepublicans in Texas are on a warpath.\n\nThey're fighting to fortify their trifecta control of state government despite a rapidly diversifying electorate , and to establish themselves as the bastion of arch-conservatism in the United States. Victory seems imminent, at least in the upcoming election cycle, if not in the years thereafter. But the people of Texas - Republican, independent, and Democrat - have become collateral damage. Because in having dedicated themselves to battle, Texas Republicans have forgotten how to govern.\n\nThis is certainly the case for the Texas legislature, whose GOP majority has just led it through its most conservative session in decades. During that session, GOP lawmakers failed to pass much-needed structural reforms to the state's electrical grid after it collapsed during a catastrophic winter storm earlier this year, as well as a federal Medicaid expansion program that would have given health care coverage to 1.4 million uninsured Texans amid a raging pandemic. Instead, the legislature has prioritized bills that allow any adult in the state to carry a handgun without a license or permit and that ban abortions after six weeks.\n\nIt is now on track to enact one of the most restrictive voting laws in the country after an effort that has literally rendered the legislature unable to govern: Democrats fled the state to deprive the legislature of the quorum it needs to operate to protest the bill, leaving Texans without a representative governing body. In response, the Republican House speaker did not offer to negotiate a policy compromise, but has tried to arrest the Democrats who fled.\n\nRepublican Gov. Greg Abbott, meanwhile, has become a prominent national right-wing figure on both immigration and the pandemic.\n\nHe has waded into battles with the Biden administration over the US-Mexico border, setting off on a misleading quest to construct a wall on his own (the taxpayer funds he'll use for the effort are enough for only a few miles of wall, at most) and falsely claiming that migrants are behind Covid-19 surges. And as the delta variant is infecting almost 12,000 Texans a day in reported tests, he has also refused to reinstate mask mandates at the state level, banned local governments from doing so, and sued those that defy him .\n\nIt's all a bid to keep the GOP base happy in the lead-up to next year's midterm elections, as Republicans in the state are more concerned about potential primary challenges from the right than any serious offensive from Democrats. But with their focus on raising their political profiles and defeating potential rivals, they have forgotten to actually govern amid several statewide crises in recent months: the winter storm that left tens of thousands without power and in the cold, the arrival of increasing numbers of migrants at the border, and the recent resurgence of Covid-19 cases due to the delta variant.\n\nVox's German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration's burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday .\n\nAccording to Brendan Steinhauser, a GOP strategist based in Austin who ran Texas Sen. John Cornyn's 2014 reelection campaign, Republicans are just doing their job by responding to what Texas Republican voters want: \"The voters are driving Republican policies,\" Steinhauser said.\n\nBut at some point, elected officials have a responsibility to protect the health and safety of their constituents and the basic human rights of anyone who passes through their state, even if it's not what their base wants. Few Texas Republicans have embraced that sense of duty; state Rep. Lyle Larson, a Republican from San Antonio, has been a lone dissenting voice calling on his colleagues to \" do the right thing with no expectation of getting re-elected\" on issues like Covid-19, Medicaid expansion, and election law.\n\n\"We've come to a point where Republican elected officials in Texas treat their jobs like they're Fox News contributors as opposed to people with responsibilities to their constituents,\" said Zack Malitz, co-founder of the progressive Real Justice PAC and a former adviser on Democrat Beto O'Rourke's 2018 Texas Senate campaign.\n\nMalitz's view reflects the general frustration of Democrats. But there is a limited amount they - or anyone concerned about Texas government - can do. The reality of how districts are drawn, as well as Texas Republicans' push to restrict voting, means many of those GOP lawmakers with little interest in lawmaking are likely to hang on to their seats next year. And that means the problems Texans have faced due to their government's neglect are likely to continue.\n\nFor a while after the 2018 elections, Texas Republicans were focused on bread and butter issues like property taxes and school finance that wouldn't offend many independents and Democrats. Democrats made some major inroads that year, not just retaking the US House, but also picking up 12 seats in the Texas House and two in the Texas Senate. That shook Republicans' confidence a bit, and left them looking to play it safe.\n\nBut after Democrats' predictions that they would turn Texas blue in 2020 failed to come to fruition, Republicans felt that they were given a mandate, marking the return of culture war-type issues that most energize their base in the Texas legislature.\n\n\"In Texas, Republicans still win statewide and have done so in the last couple of election cycles, even though we had some narrower races in 2018,\" Steinhauser said. \"If you're a Republican running statewide, you still have to speak to the Republican Party first, not only to get the nomination, but to turn them out and win in November.\"\n\nThat pressure has manifested in what Steinhauser described as the most conservative session of the state legislature in his memory. The governor has already signed legislation that removed permit requirements to carry a handgun and also established an effective ban on abortion that is currently facing legal challenges .\n\nBut there is also a special session of the state legislature underway where lawmakers are supposed to work on legislation that would prevent schools from teaching critical race theory or mandating masks or Covid-19 vaccines, and to provide funding for border security, among other Republican causes.\n\nAll the while, the failure of the Texas power grid during the winter storm - a statewide crisis that impacted Texans regardless of political party - has been glossed over. Though the governor signed laws to prepare the electrical grid to withstand future extreme weather events, the legislature hasn't passed any bills delivering direct relief for consumers who were slammed with huge electricity bills as a result of the blackouts or making the kind of forward-looking structural changes to Texas's electricity market that many experts have called for.\n\nNor did the legislature, in either their regular or special sessions, find time to address many other pressing concerns in Texas, like Medicaid expansion and police reforms that were proposed in the aftermath of former Houston resident George Floyd's death.\n\n\"These cultural war issues get people to hunker down in the trenches that they're used to being in around elections and refocus voters' attention on how much they hate the other side,\" Malitz said. \"These issues are being deliberately used as a distraction from really widely felt stuff in Texas right now: Covid, economic recovery, the blackouts, baseline bad governance.\"\n\nRepublicans are also trying to strip Texans of the only tool they have to demand good governance with a bill that would make the state's already very restrictive voting laws even more so. It passed the state Senate on Thursday despite a more than 15-hour filibuster from an Austin Democrat, but still needs to pass the House and be signed by the governor.\n\nAs my colleague Ian Millhiser notes , the bill would strengthen constraints on absentee voting; ban drive-through polling sites; introduce new limitations and paperwork requirements on people who help disabled voters and non-English speakers cast a ballot; make it harder to remove partisan poll watchers who harass voters or otherwise disrupt an election; and impose harsh new penalties on people who commit even minor violations of Texas election law.\n\nSteinhauser said that Texas Republicans are more unified behind that agenda than they have been in a long time.\n\n\"If you're a Republican running statewide, you still have to speak to the Republican Party first\"\n\n\"Part of that is probably the party being out of power nationally and having a common political enemy, if you will - to have the White House and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to point to,\" he said. \"Also having Trump be a little less front and center in the party has allowed them to focus their critiques on national Democrats.\"\n\nBut for Texas Democrats, there isn't room for compromise on the Republican agenda. House Democrats had fled the state en masse last month in an effort to prevent votes on the voting bill in particular. But after Republican Speaker Dade Phelan signed civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats on Tuesday night with a green light from the Texas Supreme Court, nearly enough of them have returned to form a quorum, a two-thirds majority of the chamber required to conduct business, giving the Republican majority a chance to move forward with their agenda.\n\nThough Republicans have decried Democrats' actions as breaking relationships in a chamber that has historically sought to give the minority party a seat at the table, Republicans had already drawn battle lines with a legislative agenda designed to exploit partisan divisions.\n\nBeyond the problems with the legislature, Texas is in the middle of another statewide crisis: a third wave of Covid-19, this time brought on by the highly contagious delta variant. It has left hospitals with dwindling numbers of ICU beds and delaying non-emergency medical procedures while the governor calls in out-of-state medical staff to come to the rescue.\n\nNevertheless, Abbott hasn't budged in refusing to use his gubernatorial powers to try to get rising case - and death - numbers under control. He could, for instance, implement statewide mask or vaccine mandates, but will not, saying that curbing the epidemic now comes down to \" personal responsibility .\"\n\nHe has instead actively worked against the interests of public health, issuing an executive order that prohibits any government entity from issuing its own mask mandates, effectively hamstringing local governments that are bearing the brunt of Covid-19 surge in keeping Texans safe. Several counties have gone ahead and implemented mask mandates anyway , but Abbott is going to court in an effort to reverse them.\n\nThough he has praised the vaccine and has gotten the jab himself, Abbott is focused on protecting the rights of the unvaccinated.\n\n\"They have the individual right and responsibility to decide for themselves and their children whether they will wear masks, open their businesses and engage in leisure activities,\" Abbott told the Dallas Morning News . \"Vaccines, which remain in abundant supply, are the most effective defense against the virus, and they will always remain voluntary - never forced - in the State of Texas.\"\n\nSteinhauser said that Abbott is trying to balance the desire of millions of Texans not to return to the shutdowns of last year with the real immediate need to get millions more Texans vaccinated. Democrats, however, see it as an abdication of the governor's responsibility to protect public health.\n\n\"This is beyond inaction - this is the governor tying the hands of health experts who are trying to keep Texans healthy as cases and hospitalizations increase,\" Texas state Rep. Donna Howard, a former critical care nurse, said in a statement .\n\nWhat's more, Abbott has sought to blame the recent delta surge on migrants arriving on the southern border - playing into a false, nativist, and damaging right-wing narrative that might be particularly attractive to Republican voters in the state, who have long identified immigration and border security as top priorities in public opinion polling.\n\nAt a national level, a recent Axios poll found that nearly 37 percent of unvaccinated Americans blame \"foreign travelers in the US\" for the rise in Covid-19 cases. Abbott has played no small part in creating that perception.\n\nThey're \"allowing free pass into the United States of people with a high probability of Covid, and then spreading that Covid in our communities,\" he said in an interview last month on Fox News.\n\nBut available data hasn't shown migrants on the border to be any more likely to test positive for Covid-19. In March, the acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) told Congress that less than 6 percent of migrants at the border had tested positive for Covid-19, a lower percentage than the Texas positivity rate at that time.\n\nScapegoating migrants serves two purposes for Abbott: It obscures his role in failing to prevent the current Covid-19 surge and provides him with an excuse to pursue the kind of restrictive immigration policies that former President Donald Trump both popularized and made a priority.\n\nHe recently issued an executive order allowing public safety officers to stop and reroute vehicles suspected of transporting migrants with Covid-19, though the measure has been blocked in federal court for now.\n\nHe has told Texas child care regulators to revoke the licenses of facilities that house migrant children and state troopers to jail migrants for state crimes, such as trespassing on private property when they cross the border.\n\nAnd he is trying to finish the wall along the Texas border, putting forth a $250 million \"down payment\" drawn from state disaster relief funds - money that could have gone to the aid of those still recovering from last winter's storms, or those struggling under the burden of the pandemic - and crowdfunding almost another $500,000 as of June 23. That's still a drop in the bucket of what he might need to finish the project, which the federal government estimated could cost as much as $46 million per mile in some sectors of the border.\n\nBut it doesn't really matter if Abbott finishes the wall or whether his executive order is ever allowed to go into effect. The policies have generated news cycles that boost his profile nationally, which will be important if he pursues a 2024 presidential bid as rumored.\n\n\"It's a fantastic talking point for his primary electorate, both next year and in 2024,\" Malitz said. \"It's government by theater. The things that they are doing with government in Texas are, by and large, for the purpose of introducing a message into the right wing media machine with obviously catastrophic humanitarian results.\"\n\nAbbott and his fellow Texas Republicans have been very successful at controlling messaging, and have had many wins in energizing state conservatives.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nTexas Republicans are trying to rewrite the Constitution - and this Supreme Court could let them.\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nFor well more than a century, the federal government has enjoyed near exclusive authority over immigration policy , while states have largely been restricted to assisting in carrying out federal policies. The Supreme Court has reinforced this rule many times over many decisions, such as Truax v. Raich (1915), which said that \"the authority to control immigration - to admit or exclude aliens - is vested solely in the Federal Government.\"\n\nTexas, however, now wants the Supreme Court to abandon this longstanding constitutional rule, and it thinks that the political tumblers have finally aligned in a way that would lead the Court to do just that.\n\nTexas seeks to upend the longstanding balance of power between the federal government and the states through a law, known as SB 4, which allows Texas state courts to issue deportation orders that will be carried out by Texas state officials. The law is now before the Supreme Court in two \" shadow docket \" cases, known as United States v. Texas and Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy v. McCraw .\n\nThe Texas law will go into effect on Wednesday at 5 pm unless the Supreme Court acts, so it is likely that the Court will hand down some sort of decision before then (although that decision could just be a brief order extending the deadline to some future date).\n\nThe Supreme Court is as conservative as it's been since the 1930s, with Republicans controlling six seats on the nine-justice Court. And Texas's case attempting to seize control of the Texas/Mexico border arrives at the justices' feet at the same time that an unusually large wave of migrants are arriving at the border .\n\nThe reason why the federal government has historically had exclusive authority over nearly all questions of immigration policy is to prevent a single state's mistreatment of a foreign national from damaging US relations with another nation. Indeed, Hines v. Davidowitz (1941) warned that \"international controversies of the gravest moment, sometimes even leading to war, may arise from real or imagined wrongs\" committed against foreign nationals.\n\nWhich isn't to say that the United States must always treat foreign citizens with caution or deference - just that a decision that could endanger the entire nation's relationship with a foreign state should be made by a government that represents the entire nation.\n\nSB 4 is not allowed under Truax , Hines , and countless other decisions, including an Obama-era case involving a very similar Arizona law, Arizona v. United States (2012).\n\nBut the current Supreme Court has only a weak attachment to following precedent, especially when a precedent is widely disliked by modern-day Republicans . So there is at least some risk that the Court's GOP-appointed majority will allow SB 4 to go into effect.\n\nTo a certain extent, an immigration-related conflict between a red state and the federal government was inevitable the minute a Democrat entered the White House. Under President Obama, Arizona's Republican government enacted a similarly unconstitutional law, known as SB 1070, which imposed registration requirements on immigrants and which gave state police enhanced authority over suspected undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Supreme Court struck down several key provisions of SB 1070 in Arizona , in an opinion which also reaffirmed that the national government, and not the states, must have primacy over immigration. \"[I]t is fundamental that foreign countries concerned about the status, safety, and security of their nationals in the United States must be able to confer and communicate on this subject with one national sovereign ,\" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the Court in Arizona , \"not the 50 separate States.\"\n\nBut Kennedy is no longer on the Court, and he was replaced by the more hardline conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Also gone is Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , who joined the majority opinion in Arizona , and who died in 2020 and was replaced by Trump appointee Justice Amy Coney Barrett .\n\nIf Kavanaugh and Barrett unite with the three most conservative justices, that's five votes to overrule Arizona , and to bless Texas's SB 4.\n\nYet, while Republican-led lawsuits pushing harsher US immigration policies are now a fixture of Democratic administrations, Texas might have a particularly strong political hand right now because of the unusually large number of migrants arriving at the southern US border. For most of the 2010s, US Customs and Border Protection reported about 400,000 to 500,000 \"encounters\" with migrants at this border every year. Now, that number stands around 2 million a year .\n\nThere are several reasons why this uptick in migration is happening now.\n\nOne of the biggest factors is political instability in many parts of Central America and the Caribbean. For many years, the so-called \" Northern Triangle \" countries - Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador - were a major source of migration, as citizens of those nations fled corruption, gang violence, and high levels of poverty. This migration remains ongoing, and is now augmented by migrants fleeing an economic and political crisis in Venezuela , and violence and political instability in Haiti , among other things.\n\nAdditionally, the United States recently relaxed its border policy because it could no longer point to the Covid-19 pandemic to justify extraordinary measures. In 2020, at the height of the pandemic, the Trump administration invoked a statute which allows the government to close the border in order to prevent the spread of a \"communicable disease\" that is present in a foreign country. This tight border policy remained in effect well into the Biden administration , until May of 2023.\n\nThis policy (which was known as \"Title 42\" ) always stood on dubious legal grounds. It certainly wasn't effective in keeping Covid from entering the United States. And the idea that we could prevent the spread of this \"communicable disease\" by locking down the border became less and less defensible as Covid both became ubiquitous in the United States, and ceased to be a global crisis.\n\nBy spring of 2023, even Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Republican appointed by Trump, openly mocked the suggestion that Title 42 could remain in place. \" The current border crisis is not a COVID crisis ,\" wrote Gorsuch.\n\nTexas has since tried to augment a federal border policy that is widely viewed as inadequate with a series of dubiously legal policies . In addition to enacting SB 4, the state has constructed physical barriers - including razor wire fences and floating obstructions in the Rio Grande - intended to keep migrants out of the country (or, in at least one case, to cause them to drown while trying to enter).\n\nIn January, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that Texas could not use razor wire to prevent US Border Patrol agents from entering an area where migrants are present, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Barrett joining the Court's three Democratic appointees.\n\nPresident Biden , for what it is worth, agrees with Republicans that legal changes are necessary to limit border crossings. Indeed, he pressed Senate Democrats to negotiate a bipartisan bill that would make it harder for migrants to claim asylum, increase funding for immigration officials and detention facilities, and allow the government to close down border crossings if they exceed a certain level.\n\nBut, after Democratic and Republican negotiators agreed on a bill, much of the GOP abruptly pulled its support. According to Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), this happened because presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump told Republicans \" he doesn't want us to solve the border problem because he wants to blame Biden for it .\"\n\nAnd so, here we are, with an unpopular spike in southern migration overwhelming the US immigration system, and a Congress that is unable to address the problem because the leader of the GOP prefers chaos to a solution.\n\nTexas Republicans, meanwhile, have their own answer. It just requires the Supreme Court to toss out more than a century of established law, and strip away the United States' ability to speak with one voice on matters of foreign policy.\n\nIf Texas prevails in this lawsuit, the consequences will be unpredictable, and could be catastrophic. It would mean, as the Supreme Court warned in Hines , that states would gain broad leeway to act against foreign nationals - potentially endangering US relations with our allies, or worse.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nTrump's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to reinstate his ban on trans military service, after a lower court blocked it.\n\nMany of the justices seemed eager to impose impossible burdens on schools.\n\nThe two Republican justices appeared open to an attack on Obamacare, but ultimately seemed likely to reject it.\n\n﻿In an unusual overnight order, most of the justices voted to halt several illegal deportations.\n\nHow can you punish Trump officials for violating the law, when federal law enforcement is controlled by Trump?\n\nThe Oklahoma charter school case is one of two April cases seeking to remake schools in the religious right's image.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

      "text": "How Republicans rigged Texas's federal courts against Biden\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIt's easy to secure court orders blocking major policies when you can choose your own judges.\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nOne of the biggest impediments to President Joe Biden's ability to govern is a small crew of Republican-appointed federal trial judges, all of whom sit in Texas.\n\nIn August of 2021, for example, a Trump-appointed judge named Matthew Kacsmaryk ordered the Biden administration to reinstate a Trump-era immigration policy, known as \" Remain in Mexico, \" which forced many migrants to live in awful conditions on the Mexican side of the US/Mexico border. Although the Supreme Court eventually determined that Kacsmaryk egregiously misread federal immigration law, it left his order in place for nearly a year - and the Court's most recent decision concerning Remain in Mexico makes it very easy for Kacsmaryk to seize control of federal border policy once again .\n\nIndeed, the status of this case, known as Texas v. Biden in Kacsmaryk's court, is changing almost by the hour. On Monday, Kacsmaryk lifted his original order requiring the Biden administration to implement Trump's policy - something he had to do given the Supreme Court's decision - and the administration swiftly announced that it would wind down the program .\n\nBut almost as soon as Kacsmaryk lifted his original order, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a new motion asking Kacsmaryk to seize control of federal border policy once again .\n\nThis one Trump judge's ability to override an elected president's policies and assume the powers of a Cabinet secretary is just one aspect of a much larger problem. With the Supreme Court's tacit blessing, Texas officials and other right-wing litigants can handpick the trial judge who will hear their challenges to Biden administration policies. And when those handpicked judges overreach in ways that even this Supreme Court deems unacceptable, decisions by men like Kacsmaryk can remain in place for as much as a year - effectively replacing governance by an elected presidential administration with rule by unelected Republican judges.\n\nIn another, similar case, the Supreme Court allowed a Trump judge named Drew Tipton to temporarily strip Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of much of his authority over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This is the same Drew Tipton who issued a legally dubious order six days after Biden took office, which blocked the Biden administration's call for a 100-day pause on deportations while the new administration was figuring out its immigration policies.\n\nAnd then there's Judge Reed O'Connor, the Fort Worth, Texas, judge known for rubber stamping nearly any legal outcome requested by Republicans. O'Connor is best known for his order in Texas v. United States , holding that Obamacare must be repealed in its entirety . That decision was so poorly reasoned that seven justices - including four Republican appointees - eventually ruled that no federal judge had any business hearing Texas's anti-Obamacare lawsuit in the first place.\n\nBut that experience did nothing to humble the Rubber Stamp of Fort Worth. In January, O'Connor forced the US Navy to deploy personnel that it deemed unfit for deployment because they are not vaccinated for Covid-19. The Supreme Court blocked most of O'Connor's ruling in March, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh writing that the highly partisan judge \"in effect inserted [himself] into the Navy's chain of command , overriding military commanders' professional military judgments.\"\n\nMeanwhile, O'Connor is widely expected to strike down the Affordable Care Act's provisions requiring health insurers to cover a wide range of vaccinations and preventive care in a pending case called Kelley v. Becerra .\n\nThe fact that all these cases - and this is just a sample of the many policy-setting lawsuits being shunted to a handful of the most conservative judges in Texas - are winding up before a few GOP-appointed judges is not a coincidence. It is a deliberate strategy, made possible by procedural rules that effectively allow litigants to select which judge will hear their lawsuits, and by all appearances, intentionally pursued by the Texas attorney general's office.\n\nThese Texas federal judges' orders, moreover, appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, almost certainly the most conservative federal appeals court in the country , which tends to regard those orders with the same level of partisanship that is a feature in Kacsmaryk, Tipton, and O'Connor's courtrooms.\n\nSo the Biden administration's policies are routinely blocked, not because an impartial judge gives those policies a fair hearing and determines them to be illegal, but because Republican litigants can ensure that lawsuits seeking to undermine President Biden are heard by some of the most partisan judges in the country.\n\nChance normally plays a big role in federal litigation. When a plaintiff files a lawsuit, that suit is typically assigned to a district judge at random from among the federal trial judges who sit in the same geographic region. On appeal, the overwhelming majority of cases are heard by three-judge panels selected at random from among an appeals court's judges. Only at the Supreme Court level, where a fixed panel of nine justices hears all cases, are litigants normally sure which judges will hear their case.\n\nIn Texas, however, things work a little differently. Texas is divided into four large geographic regions known as \"districts,\" each overseen by a federal district court. These districts are further subdivided into smaller \"divisions.\" Anti-Obamacare Judge O'Connor, for example, sits in the Fort Worth Division of the Northern District of Texas .\n\nA problem arises, however, because federal law permits each federal district court to determine how cases are divided among the court's judges , and Texas's district courts divide their work in ways that make it easy for plaintiffs challenging a federal policy to choose which judge will hear their case.\n\nWhen a plaintiff files a lawsuit in a division of one of Texas's federal district courts, their case will typically be heard by one of the judges in that division. Some divisions, however, are fairly small and may have a single judge who hears all or nearly all of the cases. In the Amarillo Division of the Northern District of Texas, for example, 95 percent of all civil cases are assigned to Kacsmaryk . In the Victoria Division of Texas's Southern District, Tipton hears virtually all civil cases .\n\nTo be clear, it's unlikely that these geographic case assignment rules arose from an intentional effort to let litigants choose their own judges - they are most likely a response to the fact that Texas is very large, and litigants don't want to travel hundreds of miles to a federal courthouse in a distant part of the state every day for a lawsuit - but they've certainly had that effect. While the Texas case assignment rules would be benign in a world where federal judges can be trusted to be fair and impartial, they take on a much more sinister cast in a world where judges like O'Connor exist. It's the combination of well-known judges who act as rubber stamps for a political party, and local court rules that frequently allow plaintiffs to select which judge will hear their case, that effectively rigs Texas's federal court system for the GOP.\n\nMany normal litigants still file at their closest federal courthouse. But if you are a plaintiff determined to undermine Biden, why would you file a lawsuit in Austin or Dallas when you can drive a few hours to a courthouse presided over by a Kacsmaryk or a Tipton?\n\nThe Texas attorney general's office is particularly ruthless in doing just that, manipulating the rules to ensure that its lawsuits will be heard by the GOP's allies on the bench.\n\nAs Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, documented in a recent amicus brief filed in the Supreme Court , \"the Texas Attorney General appears to have filed 19 cases in the Texas district courts\" against the Biden administration. Of these 19 cases, \"judges appointed during Republican presidencies are presiding in all but one.\"\n\nTexas achieved this feat by being very selective about where it files lawsuits. As Vladeck writes, Texas filed 12 of its 19 lawsuits against the Biden administration \"in divisions where judges appointed during Republican presidencies preside over 100 percent of newly filed civil cases.\" The remaining seven \"were filed in divisions where judges appointed during Republican presidencies preside over 95 percent of new civil cases.\"\n\nNotably, the Texas AG's office has not filed a single case in Austin - the city where that office is actually located - a choice that most likely can be explained by the fact that half of all federal cases filed in Austin are heard by Judge Robert Pitman, an Obama appointee.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court has, at times, disagreed with the judges Texas's Republican leaders selected to hear their lawsuits, it's done nothing to discourage the Texas AG's judge-shopping. Indeed, if anything, it's encouraged it.\n\nRecall, for example, the Supreme Court's decision in Biden v. Texas , which determined that Judge Kacsmaryk mangled federal immigration law when he ordered the Biden administration to reinstate the Remain in Mexico program. While that was a victory, both for Biden and for the rule of law, it was an exceedingly narrow one.\n\nTen months before the justices handed down their decision rebuking Kacsmaryk, the Biden administration asked the Supreme Court to block his order while the case was making its way through the appeals process. But the Court refused to do so , with only its three Democratic appointees registering their dissent. That meant that Kacsmaryk wielded much of DHS Secretary Mayorkas's policymaking authority for nearly an entire year.\n\nThen, even when the Court did rule against Kacsmaryk in its Biden decision, it explicitly left open several legal questions which Kacsmaryk could easily latch onto to seize control of federal border policy once again. Texas has already asked Kacsmaryk to do so .\n\nJust a few weeks after its decision in Biden , moreover, the Court issued a similar order to the one allowing Kacsmaryk to set border policy for 10 months. In this case, Judge Tipton effectively placed himself in charge of ICE's decisions about which immigrants to target for enforcement actions by striking down a memo from Mayorkas that set enforcement priorities for the agency.\n\nTipton's order is egregiously wrong - among other things, a federal statute explicitly gives Mayorkas the power to establish \" national immigration enforcement policies and priorities .\" Nevertheless, the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to leave that order in place, at least until the justices can fully consider the case later this year. Even if the Court does correct Tipton's error in this case, it could feasibly not hand down its decision until June of 2023 - leaving Tipton as the de facto head of ICE for nearly a full year.\n\nNotably, the Court was far quicker to intervene when lower court judges blocked Trump administration policies. In early 2020, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned that her GOP-appointed colleagues were \"putting a thumb on the scale in favor of\" the Trump administration in cases asking the Court to temporarily block lower court decisions while a case was still on appeal.\n\nAround the same time, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch complained about a system where any one of the \"more than 1,000 active and senior district court judges, sitting across 94 judicial districts\" could block one of the Trump administration's policies. Although liberal litigants typically did not engage in judge-shopping to the same degree that Texas now does, litigants suing the Trump administration would often file lawsuits in left-leaning districts such as the Northern District of California .\n\nIn any event, Gorsuch appears to have lost interest in solving the problem of judge-shopping and nationwide injunctions after a Democrat moved into the White House.\n\nEvery year Chief Justice John Roberts releases a \"year-end report on the federal judiciary.\" The document is normally quite brief; his 2021 report was only nine pages long , and three of those pages were charts and statistics describing the workload of the federal courts.\n\nAnd yet, Roberts devoted a considerable amount of that report to what he described as \"an arcane but important matter of judicial administration.\" Patent litigators throughout the country were taking advantage of the same judge-shopping rules that Texas uses to its advantage in order to shunt a high percentage of patent infringement suits to a single federal trial judge in Texas (not one we've discussed here). And Roberts announced that he'd asked one of the federal judiciary's internal governing bodies to look into this problem of judge-shopping in patent litigation.\n\nIn what was likely a response to Roberts's rebuke, the Western District of Texas recently announced that it would randomly assign patent cases to one of 12 judges , thus ending this one judge's monopoly over so many of these cases. But Texas's federal courts have not taken similar action to stop Texas Republicans from shopping around for sympathetic judges. And Roberts has not urged them to do so.\n\nIf the courts want to solve the problem of judge-shopping, it would not be hard for them to do so. One solution is to apply the same rule to Texas's anti-Biden litigation as the Western District of Texas now applies to patent litigation - if a party seeks an order blocking a federal policy, that case will be randomly assigned to any judge within the entire district court where it is filed, not just one in the smaller division.\n\nAlternatively, a court could assign lawsuits seeking a nationwide injunction against a federal policy to a panel of three judges. That's the solution Fifth Circuit Judge Gregg Costa proposed in a 2018 piece published by the Harvard Law Review's blog .\n\nIn any event, the details of such a solution don't matter all that much. The important thing is that litigants who are actively trying to sabotage the United States government should not be allowed to handpick judges who share their agenda. For the moment, however, the courts seem to lack the will to address this problem. Texas Republicans can shop around for the judges they want, and that seems to suit a Supreme Court dominated by Republican appointees just fine.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe presidential primaries are basically over. But there's still plenty to learn from California, Texas, and North Carolina.\n\nby Christian Paz\n\nFifteen states conclude their primary voting on March 5, a \"Super Tuesday\" that ordinarily shapes presidential primaries. This year, however, those presidential primaries are a snoozer: President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are each cruising toward their parties' nominations, and they're each favored to sweep Tuesday's contests.\n\nStill, there are some interesting state contests happening around the country. California and Texas are holding competitive Senate primaries. And in North Carolina, a primary contest will offer the first preview of what will likely be one of the most competitive governor's races of 2024.\n\nIf the polls are right then the Democrat who comes in first after Tuesday's election concludes is all but certain to be the next person to represent California in the US Senate. That's partly because this is a primary contest in California (where a Republican hasn't won statewide since 2006), but it's also because of the number of high-profile Democrats that crowded the field to succeed the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein .\n\nDemocratic voters are choosing among three well-known candidates: Rep. Barbara Lee (a vocal anti-war progressive), Rep. Katie Porter (a wonky anti-trust progressive), and Rep. Adam Schiff (the establishment voice that has been leading just about every poll). That all three have claimed the \"progressive\" mantle has made it hard for Lee and Porter to differentiate themselves to voters - and the California establishment's rush to back Schiff has demonstrated who the favorite to win is.\n\nBecause California has a top-two primary system (where the two candidates who perform the best move onto the general, regardless of party affiliation), it looked as though this already expensive primary would end in an even more costly Democrat-on-Democrat brawl that would last until November.\n\nThen the Dodgers former All-Star first baseman Steve Garvey, a Republican, decided to enter the fray. Garvey has been surging in the polls, frequently coming in second ahead of Porter and Lee and benefiting not just from his Dodgers-era fame but also from extra spending by Schiff's campaign to boost GOP voters' awareness of Garvey.\n\nShould Garvey come in second, Porter and Lee would be eliminated. Garvey, however, has little chance of winning a statewide race, virtually guaranteeing that Schiff, likely to be the top Democratic vote-getter, will be California's next senator. A shortened race would be a boon for vulnerable Democratic Senate incumbents in other states, as donor money would flow to them instead of into California (the three Democrats have raised over $60 million combined, according to FEC filings).\n\nAs Texas Republicans fight over just how conservative the state government should be, Democratic voters are set to decide the kind of Senate candidate they want to challenge Republican incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz. Leading the pack is the more moderate Rep. Colin Allred - who represents part of Dallas and who has been leading in the polls and in fundraising since he started campaigning in May 2023.\n\nChallenging Allred is state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, seen as the more progressive choice, who attracted national attention after the 2022 Uvalde school shooting for his efforts in getting gun restrictions passed by the state legislature - though that push didn't get far in the Republican-controlled body.\n\nThe stakes for this primary are the chance for Democrats to flip a seat and keep control of the Senate next year: Cruz is an unpopular incumbent - he only won his 2018 reelection by about 2 points - and Texas is one of the few opportunities Democrats have to protect and expand their small Senate majority. If Allred wins, he's seen as the Texas Democrat with the most realistic chance of beating Cruz.\n\nStill, this is Texas we're talking about. Democrats have long dreamed of turning Texas blue in federal or statewide elections, but the state's Republican tilt has always scuppered that possibility. During a presidential election year, a down-ballot upset like this one will be tough for Democrats to pull off.\n\nIn North Carolina, a Democratic governor holds power in a Republican-dominated state. That's a rarity, and it's one Democrats are desperate to preserve. But Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper is term-limited, and on Tuesday, three candidates are facing off in the primary to be his successor.\n\nLeading the pack of Democrats hoping to replace him is the state's Democratic attorney general, Josh Stein, a more centrist, mainstream candidate. He has a few rivals, like the former state Supreme Court Justice Mike Morgan, but according to polling , none has posed a serious threat.\n\nRepublicans' top choice appears likely to be the state's right-wing lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson - a \" firebrand \" politician who has sought to make culture war issues like abortion , gun rights, and LGBTQ rights his focus. He has a history of incendiary remarks and social media posts, like a 2018 Facebook post arguing that homosexuality would lead to pedophilia \"which will be closely followed by the END of civilization as we know it.\"\n\nRobinson is running against two comparatively more mainstream Republicans, the state treasurer Dale Folwell and an attorney, Bill Graham. According to state polling, Graham is Robinson's most credible rival - he's been running ads critical of Robinson's history of controversial statements , and Robinson's campaign has responded with attack ads of their own.\n\nIt's a good time to get familiar with the candidates because North Carolina is shaping up to be one of 2024's most competitive, expensive, and closely watched governor's races. It's also a good time to get familiar with the state's politics in general as it's possibly the Biden campaign's best opportunity to go on offense in the 2024 presidential election .\n\nVoters in North Carolina have tended to side with Republicans in presidential elections - Barack Obama is the only Democratic candidate to have won the state in the last 40 years - but have frequently elected Democratic governors in that time. Ticket-splitting is a frequent occurrence, and the rapidly growing urban and suburban centers in the state have led to an increase in wealthier and better-educated voters - a demographic that has grown more alienated from the national Republican brand during the Trump era.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe Fifth Circuit wants to put Texas Republicans in charge of social media platforms.\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nAn especially right-wing panel of the already conservative United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit handed down an astonishing opinion on Friday, effectively holding that the state of Texas may seize control of content moderation at major social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.\n\nThe mere fact that this opinion exists is not surprising. When Texas initially passed the law at hand, which imposes strong restrictions on major social media companies' power to moderate content and ban users deemed to be offensive or worse, the same panel of judges raced to defend it.\n\nTrade organizations representing the major social media companies sued to block the law from taking effect, and a federal trial court agreed with them. In May, the Fifth Circuit handed down a brief, unexplained order in NetChoice v. Paxton , which reinstated the Texas law - until the Supreme Court blocked that decision a few weeks later, effectively suspending the law once again.\n\nNow, the Fifth Circuit is attempting to permanently reinstate the law. Its latest opinion, which explains why the court sided with Texas's law, is exceedingly difficult to square with longstanding First Amendment law. Indeed, it turns that law on its head, holding that the government may force private companies - or, at least, large private social media companies - to publish content that the companies do not wish to host.\n\nThe Texas law is potentially an existential threat to the social media industry . Its supposed anti-censorship provisions are so strict that it would likely prevent the major social media platforms from removing content touting Nazism or white supremacy, or even from blocking social media users who engage in campaigns of harassment against other users. Additionally, the law imposes disclosure and procedural requirements on the major platforms that may literally be impossible to comply with .\n\nGiven the Supreme Court's previous intervention in this case, there is a good chance that the law will be suspended again in fairly short order. But the law - and the back-and-forth over it - raise interesting questions about just how much power social media companies should have over public discourse.\n\nUnder existing First Amendment law, individuals and private businesses have a right to speak their own minds, and also a right not to speak when they do not wish to, or when they disagree with a particular viewpoint. As the Supreme Court explained in Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights (2006), \"this Court's leading First Amendment precedents have established the principle that freedom of speech prohibits the government from telling people what they must say.\"\n\nThis freedom allows companies to choose which viewpoints of its users it publishes, too. (More on this later.)\n\nNevertheless, the Texas law prohibits a social media platform \"that functionally has more than 50 million active users in the United States in a calendar month\" from banning a user - or even from regulating or restricting a user's content, or altering the algorithms that surface content to other users - because of that user's \"viewpoint.\" The Texas law permits individual social media users who believe that a platform has violated the law to sue in order to force compliance. It also permits suits by the state's attorney general.\n\nTechnically, the law's restrictions only apply to Texas residents, businesses that operate in Texas, or to a social media user who \"shares or receives content on a social media platform in this state.\" As a practical matter, however, social media platforms are likely to struggle to identify which users view social media content within Texas, and which businesses have Texas operations. So they could be forced to apply Texas's rules to every user in order to avoid being sued for unwittingly targeting someone who the Texas law applies to.\n\nTexas Republicans have been quite open about the fact that they intend the law to address what Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) described as a \"dangerous movement by social media companies to silence conservative viewpoints and ideas.\" But, while some individual conservatives have been banned from some platforms, including former President Donald Trump, the evidence that social media companies are engaged in any kind of systemic discrimination against conservative viewpoints is quite thin .\n\nAnd, in any event, the law applies broadly to nearly all forms of viewpoint discrimination, regardless of whether the speech at issue is political.\n\nSuppose, for example, that someone, angry that a woman he met online refused his advances, decides to bombard that woman with harassment, much of it calling her \"ugly.\" If Twitter bans this user for calling the woman \"ugly,\" Texas's law most likely would also require Twitter to ban anyone who calls the woman \"beautiful\" - because the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of viewpoint.\n\nSimilarly, if a literal Nazi launched a YouTube account that posts videos calling for the systematic extermination of all Jews, Texas's law would prevent YouTube from banning this user or removing the Nazi videos , unless it also took the same action against users who express the opposite viewpoint - that is, the view that Jewish people should not be exterminated.\n\nAdditionally, the law would require the major social media platforms to publish a \"biannual transparency report\" disclosing every single \"action\" they took against a particular piece of content. It would also require them to set up a process where decisions to remove content can be appealed - and these appeals must be resolved within 14 days .\n\nBut, as Facebook explained in a court filing, it alone \" makes decisions about 'billions of pieces of content ' and '[a]ll such decisions are unique and context-specific ... and involve some measure of judgment.'\" It is far from clear whether Facebook, or any of the other major platforms, have the physical capacity to comply with the law's disclosure and appeals requirements.\n\nThe Texas law, in other words, could potentially turn every major social media site into a cesspool of racial slurs, misogyny, and targeted harassment that the platforms would be powerless to control - and that's assuming that the platforms are even capable of complying with the law.\n\nIn order to understand why this law violates the Constitution, it's helpful to understand three well-established principles of First Amendment law.\n\nThe first principle is that, under what is known as the \" state action doctrine ,\" the First Amendment generally only prohibits the government , and not private actors, from taking actions that restrict speech. This doctrine respects the gross power deferential between the government and literally any other actor.\n\nIf Facebook doesn't like what you have to say, it can kick you off Facebook. But if the government doesn't like what you say (and if there are no constitutional safeguards against government overreach), it can send armed police officers to haul you off to prison forever.\n\nThe second principle is that corporations may assert free speech protections just as surely as individuals can. This proposition became controversial, especially among left-leaning critics of the Supreme Court, after the Court held in Citizens United v. FEC (2010) that corporations have a First Amendment right to spend lavishly to influence elections. But the proposition that corporations have First Amendment rights long predates Citizens United , and is one of the foundations of press freedoms in the United States.\n\nIn New York Times v. Sullivan (1964), for example, the Court ruled that Jim Crow state officials could not use malicious libel suits to punish a media corporation that published an advertisement with a pro-civil rights viewpoint. If corporations could not assert First Amendment claims, then the New York Times Company would have lost this case.\n\nThe third principle of First Amendment law is that the Constitution protects both against government censorship and against government actions that force people to speak when they would rather remain silent. The seminal case is West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943), which held that the government could not require schoolchildren to salute the flag or say the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nSubsequent decisions establish that the prohibition on forced speech prevents the government from telling media companies what they must publish. In Miami Herald v. Tornillo (1974), for example, the Court held that a newspaper's \"choice of material to go into a newspaper\" is subject only to the paper's \"editorial control and judgment,\" and that \"it has yet to be demonstrated how governmental regulation of this crucial process can be exercised consistent with First Amendment guarantees of a free press.\"\n\nThen, in Reno v. ACLU (1997), the Court held that the same First Amendment regime that applies to physical media also applies to the internet. Reno acknowledged that the internet is distinct from other forms of communication because \"the Internet can hardly be considered a 'scarce' expressive commodity\" - that is, unlike a newspaper, there is no physical limit on how much content can be published on a website. But the Court ultimately concluded that \"our cases provide no basis for qualifying the level of First Amendment scrutiny that should be applied to this medium.\"\n\nTo all of this, Judge Andy Oldham, the Trump appointee and former law clerk to Justice Samuel Alito who authored the Fifth Circuit's opinion in NetChoice , argues that the First Amendment doesn't apply to Texas's law because the law \"does not chill speech,\" and instead \"chills censorship\" by preventing social media companies from limiting who is allowed to post on their platforms or what they can say.\n\nBut that decision is hard to square with Miami Herald and similar cases, which establish that media companies may refuse to publish content that they do not wish to publish. Texas could not, for example, force Vox Media to publish a guest column entitled \"Greg Abbott is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life .\" So why can it effectively force YouTube to publish content from Nazis?\n\nOldham's primary response to Miami Herald is that social media platforms are \"nothing like the newspaper in Miami Herald \" because, he claims, \"the Platforms exercise virtually no editorial control or judgment.\" But this is false.\n\nIt is true that social media companies are unlike newspapers in that they typically let users post whatever they want, and then pull down content that violates their rules after the fact. But Oldham's claim that the platforms exercise \"virtually no editorial control\" is not credible. As Judge Robert Pitman, the trial judge who heard NetChoice , explained in his opinion striking down the Texas law :\n\n[I]n three months in 2021, Facebook removed 8.8 million pieces of \"bullying and harassment content,\" 9.8 million pieces of \"organized hate content,\" and 25.2 million pieces of \"hate speech content.\" During the last three months of 2020, YouTube removed just over 2 million channels and over 9 million videos because they violated its policies. While some of those removals are subject to an existing appeals process, many removals are not. For example, in a three-month period in 2021, YouTube removed 1.16 billion comments.\n\nSo, while social media companies permit more individuals to publish on their platforms than a traditional newspaper, they still exercise a fair amount of editorial control. And the First Amendment, as interpreted by decisions like Miami Herald and Reno , permits Facebook to decide that it will not publish bullying or \"organized hate content.\"\n\nIt also permits Facebook, as a private company, to decide not to publish Republicans' content, if that's the company's decision.\n\nHaving explained why Oldham's opinion is at odds with the First Amendment, I want to acknowledge the difficult questions presented by a world where private companies get to decide who gets to participate in such potent forums. Mark Zuckerberg may not have the power to have his critics arrested, but the amount of control that he wields over political conversations throughout the globe is alarming - and it's not like Facebook has always used its power responsibly .\n\nBut the solution suggested by Oldham's opinion is that one set of state legislators in Texas should get to decide the rules around what content must be published on social media platforms. That's infinitely worse than the current regime. Among other things, if Texas's GOP-controlled legislature has the power to decide what content shows up on social media, it has an obvious interest in using that power to benefit Republicans and to hurt Democrats.\n\nThe inherent dilemma inherent in all cases of speech regulation is that, once the government is given the power to regulate speech, that power will ultimately rest with government officials with their own political agendas. If you do not like living in a world where Zuckerberg wields outsized control over public debates, imagine living in one where the ultimate power to decide what content is published online rests with Greg Abbott. Or with Andy Oldham. Or with Samuel Alito .\n\nOldham's opinion, moreover, necessarily permits a single state - the state of Texas - to decide the free speech regime that applies to every major social media company. That's despite that people in the other 49 states, not to mention people in other countries, have no say over who wields power in Texas.\n\nAnd what happens if another state - perhaps a blue state with very different views about what sort of content should be published online - enacts a law that contradicts Texas's statute? What is Twitter or Facebook supposed to do if states enact conflicting laws and it is literally impossible to comply with both of them?\n\nCurrent case law - cases like Barnette , Miami Herald , and Reno - respect these realities. They understand that, whatever the costs of giving media companies an outsized ability to shape political debates and culture, the cost of giving this power to government is so much worse.\n\nIt is likely that even the current Supreme Court, with its Republican-appointed supermajority, will respect existing law. After all, the Court already voted to block the Texas law last May, albeit in a 5-4 decision .\n\nFor now, though, the law is technically in effect, endangering the entire world's ability to openly debate ideas online.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is where law goes to die.\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nTrent Taylor says his cell, in a Texas psychiatric unit operated by the state's prison system, was covered in human excrement . Feces smeared the window and streaked the ceiling. Someone had painted a shit swastika on the wall, alongside a smiley face. According to Taylor's allegations in a federal lawsuit , there was such a thick layer of dried human dung on the floor of the cell that it made a crunching sound as he walked naked across the cell.\n\nTaylor alleged that he was kept in this cell for four days, where he neither ate nor drank due to fears that the excrement, which was even packed inside the cell's water faucet, would contaminate anything he consumed. Then, on the fifth day, he was moved to a bare, frigid cell with no toilet, water fountain, or bed . A clogged drain filled the new cell with choking ammonia films. With nowhere to relieve himself, Taylor held his urine for 24 hours before he could do so no longer. And then he had to sleep alone on the floor while covered in his own waste.\n\nThe Supreme Court eventually ruled 7-1 that Taylor's lawsuit against the corrections officers who forced him to live in these conditions could move forward, and that lawsuit settled last February. But the Supreme Court had to intervene after an even more conservative court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, attempted to shut down these claims against the prison guards.\n\nA unanimous panel of three Fifth Circuit judges held that it was unclear whether the Constitution prevents prisoners from being forced to remain in \" extremely dirty cells for only six days\" - although, in what counts as an act of mercy in the Fifth Circuit, the panel did concede that \"prisoners couldn't be housed in cells teeming with human waste for months on end.\"\n\nThis decision, in Taylor v. Stevens , is hardly aberrant behavior by the Fifth Circuit, which oversees federal litigation arising out of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The Fifth Circuit's Taylor decision stands out for its casual cruelty, but its disregard for law, precedent, logic, and basic human decency is ordinary behavior in this court.\n\nDominated by partisans and ideologues - a dozen of the court's 17 active judgeships are held by Republican appointees, half of whom are Trump judges - the Fifth Circuit is where law goes to die. And, because the Fifth Circuit oversees federal litigation arising out of Texas, whose federal trial courts have become a pipeline for far-right legal decisions , the Fifth Circuit's judges frequently create havoc with national consequences.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit has, in recent months, declared an entire federal agency unconstitutional and stripped another of its authority to enforce federal laws protecting investors from fraud . It permitted Texas Republicans to effectively seize control of content moderation at social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. Less than a year ago, the Fifth Circuit forced the Navy to deploy sailors who defied an order to take the Covid vaccine, despite the Navy's warning that a sick service member could sideline an entire vessel or force the military to conduct a dangerous mission to extract a Navy SEAL with Covid.\n\nAs Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote when the Supreme Court restored the military's command over its own personnel, the Fifth Circuit's approach wrongly inserted the courts \"into the Navy's chain of command , overriding military commanders' professional military judgments.\"\n\nAnd this is just a small sample of the decisions the Fifth Circuit has handed down in 2022. Go back just a little further, and you'll find things like a decision endangering the First Amendment right to protest , or another that seized control over much of the United States' diplomatic relations with the nation of Mexico. In 2019, seven Fifth Circuit judges joined an opinion that, had it been embraced by the Supreme Court, could have triggered a global economic depression unlike any since the 1930s .\n\nIts judges embrace embarrassing legal theories , and flirt with long discredited ideas - such as the since-overruled 1918 Supreme Court decision declaring federal child labor laws unconstitutional . They abuse litigants and even each other. During a 2011 oral argument, the Court's then-chief judge, Edith Jones, told one of her few left-leaning colleagues to \"shut up.\"\n\nAnd while the Fifth Circuit is so extreme that its decisions are often reversed even by the Supreme Court's current, very conservative majority, its devil-may-care approach to the law can throw much of the government into chaos, and even destabilize our relations with foreign nations , before a higher authority steps in. Worse, the Fifth Circuit's antics could very well be a harbinger for what the entire federal judiciary will become if Republicans get to replace more justices.\n\nThe median Fifth Circuit judge is very far to the right - more so than the Court's current median justice, Brett Kavanaugh. But the typical Fifth Circuit judge would also be quite at home alongside a Republican stalwart like Justice Samuel Alito , or a more nihilistic justice like Neil Gorsuch .\n\nTwo generations ago, the Fifth Circuit was widely viewed as a heroic court by proponents of civil rights, handing down aggressive decisions calling for public school integration and protecting voting rights - even in the face of opposition from other, prominent judges.\n\nVery soon after Brown v. Board of Education (1954) determined that racially segregated public schools violate the Constitution, a panel of federal judges in South Carolina handed down an influential opinion, in Briggs v. Elliott (1955), that effectively strangled Brown in its cradle. Brown , the court claimed in Briggs , \"has not decided that the states must mix persons of different races in the schools or must require them to attend schools or must deprive them of the right of choosing the schools they attend.\" To comply with Brown , Briggs suggested, a state must merely offer Black children the choice to attend white schools - and if those children choose to remain in segregated classrooms, that's not a constitutional problem.\n\nAs a practical matter, these \"freedom to choose\" plans led to very little integration, in no small part because African American families knew full well what the Ku Klux Klan might do to them if they volunteered to send their children to a historically white school. Ten years after Briggs , the Fifth Circuit noted in United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education (1967), the South Carolina school system at the heart of the Briggs case was \"still totally segregated.\"\n\nJefferson County was authored by Judge John Minor Wisdom, arguably the greatest of the Fifth Circuit's judges, whose name adorns the court's building in New Orleans today . After watching Briggs 's approach fail Black children for 10 long years, Wisdom wrote a lengthy, statistics-laden opinion savaging Briggs and insisting that \"the only school desegregation plan that meets constitutional standards is one that works.\"\n\n\"The Brown case is misread and misapplied when it is construed simply to confer upon Negro pupils the right to be considered for admission to a white school,\" Wisdom wrote. \"The Constitution is both color blind and color conscious,\" he wrote, anticipating modern-day attacks on affirmative action . It must be read \"to prevent discrimination being perpetuated and to undo the effects of past discrimination.\"\n\nAt the time, the Fifth Circuit's jurisdiction extended over six Southern states, stretching from Texas to Florida (the court was split in half and three of these states were reassigned to a new Eleventh Circuit by a 1980 law ), so the aggressive approach to desegregation laid out in Wisdom's Jefferson County opinion bound many of the states where the need for public school integration was most urgent.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, however, Wisdom's influence within his court began to fade. Republican President Ronald Reagan appointed a total of eight judges to the Fifth Circuit - one of whom was Edith Jones, a thirtysomething former general counsel to the Texas Republican Party. President George H.W. Bush added another four judges. The result was that, by 1991, Wisdom complained that his court's approach to race in education was so harsh that it would even violate the separate-but-equal approach announced in the Supreme Court's infamous Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) decision.\n\nIf any one decision captures the spirit of the post-Reagan, but pre-Trump Fifth Circuit, it's that court's decision in Burdine v. Johnson (2000). In that case, a man was convicted of murder and sentenced to die after his court-appointed lawyer slept through much of his trial. One witness recalled that the lawyer fell asleep as many as 10 times . Another testified that the lawyer \"was asleep for long periods of time during the questioning of witnesses.\"\n\nAnd yet, a panel of Fifth Circuit judges that included Judge Jones initially voted to let this death sentence stand because it was unable to determine whether the lawyer \"slept during the presentation of crucial, inculpatory evidence,\" or merely through portions of the trial that the panel deemed unimportant. Eventually, the full Fifth Circuit reheard Burdine and held that the death row inmate at the heart of the case must be retried - but it did so over the dissents of five Fifth Circuit judges .\n\nAnd the Fifth Circuit has only grown more conservative since these five judges determined that it was no big deal that a capital defendant's lawyer couldn't even remain awake throughout his trial.\n\nWhen former President Donald Trump took office, the Fifth Circuit was already one of the most conservative courts in the country. It also had two vacancies due to a boneheaded decision by former Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Patrick Leahy (D-VT) to give Republican senators a veto power over anyone nominated to a federal judgeship in their home state - thus preventing President Barack Obama from filling these seats during his time in office.\n\nTo the first of these two seats, Trump appointed Don Willett, a libertarian provocateur known for speckling his opinions with the kind of platitudes that one might hear from a member of the John Birch Society, a member of the Tea Party, or a participant in the January 6 putsch. Sample quote: \" Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch. Liberty is a well-armed lamb contesting the vote. \"\n\nAnd then there was James Ho, the former law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas who labeled abortion a \" moral tragedy \" in one of his first opinions as a judge. Ho's very first opinion sought to implement a proposal he first announced in a 1997 op-ed to \"abolish all restrictions on campaign finance .\" The opinion declared that \"big money in politics\" was a \"necessary consequence\" of \"big government in our lives.\" It also claimed that our current government \"would be unrecognizable to our Founders\" because the Affordable Care Act exists.\n\nAnother Trump judge on the Fifth Circuit, Cory Wilson, published a series of columns in Mississippi newspapers that raise serious questions about his ability to apply the law impartially to Democrats and to LGBTQ Americans. Among other things, Wilson claimed that \"intellectually honest Democrat[s]\" are \"very rare indeed.\" He called President Obama a \" fit-throwing teenager \" because he opposed a Republican proposal to slash Medicaid funding and repeal Medicare and replace it with a voucher program. He wrote that \" gay marriage is a pander to liberal interest groups and an attempt to cast Republicans as intolerant, uncaring and even bigoted.\" And he also had a Twitter feed that often resembled Trump's.\n\nAnother Trump judge on the Fifth Circuit, Kyle Duncan, spent much of his career as an anti-LGBTQ lawyer . He may be best known for an opinion he authored as a judge, which refused a transgender litigant's request that Duncan use her proper pronouns.\n\nDuncan also joined an opinion, authored by Trump-appointed Judge Kurt Engelhardt, which blocked a Biden administration rule requiring most workers to either get vaccinated against Covid-19 or take weekly Covid tests. The Supreme Court eventually struck this rule down under a legally dubious, judicially created legal doctrine called \"major questions.\"\n\nBut Engelhardt's opinion makes this Supreme Court look sensible and moderate. Although federal law permits the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to issue emergency rules to protect workers from \"exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful,\" Engelhardt made the extraordinary argument that the novel coronavirus - which has killed over a million Americans - does not qualify as a \"substance or agent\" that is \"physically harmful.\"\n\nNor did Engelhardt stop there. His most aggressive argument implies that the federal government's power to regulate commerce does not extend to the workplace, which is the same argument the Supreme Court used in a discredited 1918 decision striking down federal child labor laws .\n\nTrump, in other words, took a court that was already a reactionary outlier among the federal courts of appeal, and filled it with judges from the fringes of the legal profession. And those judges gleefully sow chaos throughout the law.\n\nOne reason why the Fifth Circuit's decline is so harmful to the nation as a whole is that it oversees federal litigation arising out of Texas.\n\nThat's one part of a perfect storm: Texas's Republican attorney general and other conservative litigants frequently bring challenges to Biden administration policies in Texas's federal trial courts. And because those courts often permit plaintiffs to choose which judge will hear their lawsuits , these challenges frequently go before highly partisan judges who issue nationwide injunctions blocking that policy. And then those decisions, which frequently have glaring legal errors that would be obvious to many first-year law students, go to the Fifth Circuit.\n\nThis practice has been a particular thorn in the side of the Department of Homeland Security, as Texas has repeatedly obtained orders from Trump judges blocking the Biden administration's immigration policies . One even forced the United States to change its diplomatic posture regarding Mexico .\n\nOne of the federal appeals' courts most important roles is to keep a watchful eye over federal trial judges, and make sure they don't issue disruptive, idiosyncratic decisions - or, at least, to make sure that those decisions don't remain in effect for long. But the Fifth Circuit almost always operates like a rubber stamp for the Trumpiest judges, blessing even the most extreme decisions by trial judges who hope to sabotage Biden's policies.\n\nJust as often, the Fifth Circuit hands down decisions that seem to come out of nowhere, embracing legal theories that few lawyers have ever even heard of before, and that threaten to shut down much of the federal government and disrupt the nation's economy. Consider, for example, Community Financial Services v. CFPB (2022), a decision by three Trump judges (Willett, Engelhardt, and Wilson), which declared the entire Consumer Financial Protection Bureau unconstitutional.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit's opinion, by Wilson, claims that the agency is unlawful because of the unusual way that it is funded - rather than receiving an annual appropriation from Congress, the CFPB receives a portion of the funds raised by the Federal Reserve . Wilson claims that this funding structure \"violates the Constitution's structural separation of powers.\"\n\nBut he's just plain wrong about that, and his legal reasoning was explicitly rejected by the Supreme Court more than eight decades ago. Wilson relied on a provision of the Constitution stating that \"no money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law .\" But, as the Supreme Court held in Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States (1937), this provision \"means simply that no money can be paid out of the Treasury unless it has been appropriated by an act of Congress.\"\n\nBecause there is an Act of Congress creating the CFPB and its funding structure, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 , the CFPB is constitutional. Wilson's opinion relies on a fantasy constitution that does not exist.\n\nThree years before its CFPB decision, seven Fifth Circuit judges signed onto another opinion that would have destroyed another entire federal agency - and potentially triggered a worldwide economic depression in the process .\n\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) was created in 2008 to deal with the mortgage crisis that triggered a historic recession, and that very well could have led to a second Great Depression if the FHFA had not acted. Over the course of the next several years, the FHFA presided over tens of billions of dollars worth of transactions intended to prop up the US mortgage system and ensure that the American housing market did not collapse .\n\nAbout a dozen years after the FHFA was created, however, the Supreme Court determined that federal agencies may not be led by a single individual who cannot be fired at will by the president . By law, the FHFA director enjoyed some protections against being fired, and there's no question that this decision required her to be stripped of these protections.\n\nBut in Collins v. Mnuchin (2019), seven Fifth Circuit judges joined an opinion by Judge Willett, which argued that this minor constitutional violation - a violation the Supreme Court didn't even recognize until years after the FHFA was established - renders everything the FHFA has ever done invalid. When a plaintiff who is injured in any way by one of the FHFA's actions files a federal lawsuit challenging that action, Willett claimed, the \" action must be set aside .\"\n\nThe immediate impact of Willett's opinion, had it taken effect, would have been to force the FHFA to unravel more than $124 billion worth of transactions it undertook to rescue the US housing market - more than the gross domestic product of the entire nation of Ecuador . But Willett's opinion would have gone even further than that, because it would have permitted suits invalidating literally anything the FHFA had ever done since its creation in 2008.\n\nIn any event, the Collins case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court, where the justices voted 8 to 1 to reject Willett's approach . Only Justice Neil Gorsuch thought that toying with an economic depression was a good idea.\n\nBut even when the Supreme Court does step in, eventually, to reverse the Fifth Circuit, it often drags its feet. When a notoriously partisan federal trial judge ordered the Biden administration to reinstate much of Trump's border policy , and the Fifth Circuit rubber stamped that decision, the Supreme Court waited 11 months to intervene - leaving the lower court's decisions imposing a defeated president's policies on the nation in place the entire time. A similar drama played out over immigration enforcement.\n\nThe result is that the Fifth Circuit, though it does not have the final say, often decides what US policy should be for months at a time. And that's assuming that the Supreme Court actually reverses the Fifth Circuit - sometimes the Fifth Circuit's most legally dubious decisions are embraced by a Supreme Court dominated by Republican appointees .\n\nOne of the few good things that can be said about the Fifth Circuit is that it does not have the last word about what the law says. When its judges strike down a federal law, or attempt to destroy an entire federal agency, or declare a national policy unconstitutional, the Supreme Court almost always steps up to hear that case. And the justices do frequently reverse the Fifth Circuit's most outlandish decisions - even if they take their sweet time before they do so.\n\nBut the Supreme Court only hears a tiny percentage of the cases decided by federal appeals courts, and it almost never hears cases brought by extraordinarily vulnerable litigants like Trent Taylor. Indeed, it hears these cases so infrequently that, when the Court decided to intervene on Taylor's behalf, Justice Samuel Alito wrote a brief opinion complaining that Taylor's case \"which turns entirely on an interpretation of the record in one particular case, is a quintessential example of the kind that we almost never review.\"\n\nThe Fifth Circuit hears a steady diet of ordinary immigration cases, which will often decide whether an individual immigrant can remain with their family in the United States or whether they must be deported to a nation they may barely know, or where they may fear for their physical safety. These cases are now heard by judges like Andrew Oldham, Trump's sixth appointment to the Fifth Circuit, who spent much of his time both on and off the bench seeking to make federal immigration policies harsher to immigrants.\n\nSimilarly, the court hears a steady diet of employment discrimination cases. These cases are heard by judges like Edith Jones, who dissented in a 1989 case ruling in favor of Susan Waltman, a woman who experienced the kind of sexual harassment that would make any normal person's skin crawl :\n\nDuring the summer of 1984, an IPCO employee told a truck driver that Waltman was a whore and that she would get hurt if she did not keep her mouth shut. Later, in the Fall of 1984, several other incidents occurred. A Brown and Root employee, who was working at the mill, grabbed Waltman's arms while she was carrying a vial of hot liquid; another Brown and Root worker then stuck his tongue in her ear. In a separate incident, an IPCO employee told Waltman he would cut off her breast and shove it down her throat. The same employee later dangled Waltman over a stairwell, more than thirty feet from the floor. In November 1984, one employee pinched Waltman's breasts. In another incident, a co-worker grabbed Waltman's thigh.\n\nJones claimed that Waltman's employer \"did not have actual or constructive notice that Waltman was subjected to a pervasively abusive and hostile work environment,\" but Waltman complained multiple times to her supervisors, met with senior managers about the harassment she faced, and announced her intention to resign after a shift meeting where her coworkers made comments that \" women provoke sexual harassment by wearing tight jeans \" in front of her supervisor.\n\nAnd then, after determining that these conditions do not amount to actionable sexual harassment, Jones spent the next 33 years hearing other cases brought by workers alleging employment discrimination.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit has created a void in the law, where judges ignore horrific violations in between writing opinions claiming that entire federal agencies are unconstitutional. And, barring legislation adding additional seats to the court, things are unlikely to get better anytime soon. Currently, Republican appointees hold 12 of the 17 active judgeships on this benighted court - and nearly all of them are ideologically similar to Jones.\n\nThat said, there are reforms that Congress or the Supreme Court could implement , which would diminish both the Fifth Circuit's power and the power of litigants to channel political lawsuits to highly ideological judges. Congress, for example, may strip the Fifth Circuit of its jurisdiction over certain cases, or require certain suits to be filed in a federal court that is not located in the Fifth Circuit. It could also add seats to the court, which would then be filled by President Biden.\n\nA less radical reform , proposed by former Fifth Circuit Judge Gregg Costa, would prevent litigants like the Texas AG's office from handpicking judges who are likely to rule in their favor - and whose decisions are equally likely to be affirmed by the Fifth Circuit. Costa proposed having all lawsuits seeking a nationwide injunction against a federal law or policy be heard by three-judge panels, rather than a single judge chosen by the plaintiff. These panels' decisions would then appeal directly to the Supreme Court, bypassing the Fifth Circuit (although a single Fifth Circuit judge might sit on some of these panels).\n\nRealistically, however, systemic reforms to the problem of judge-shopping - and to the problem of a lawless court of appeals - are unlikely to happen anytime soon. The House of Representatives will soon be controlled by Republicans, who are unlikely to support legislation that reduces the power of their partisan allies on the bench. And the Supreme Court has six justices appointed by Republican presidents.\n\nAnd so the Fifth Circuit will continue to hand down its decrees, confident that no one with the power to stop them is likely to do so.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Unfortunately, Washington's failure to uphold this responsibility has forced states like Texas to shoulder the burden of securing our southern border.\"\n\nIn an interview with CBS News Texas, U.S. Representative Keith Self agreed the measure should pass.\n\n\"Absolutely, absolutely,\" Self said. \"The federal government has been derelict in its duty because immigration people say it's a federal issue. They're exactly right. But in the absence of the federal government, in the dereliction of its duty by the federal government, the state of Texas has done what it could.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the Governor sent letters to the entire Texas Congressional delegation and to Congressional leaders.\n\nHe wants Congress to reimburse the state $11.1 billion, which the state has spent between 2022 and this budget year.\n\nAbbott said most of that went to building a border wall, and for deploying National Guard soldiers and state troopers to the border. The Governor blames what he calls the Biden administration's failures to prevent illegal immigration.\n\nU.S. Representative Julie Johnson, D-Farmers Branch told CBS News Texas she isn't sure how she would vote on the bill.\n\n\"I'd have to see the language of the bill to see what it encompasses,\" said Johnson. \"But Greg Abbott, our Governor, did a lot of performative spending down there just for re-election purposes that really didn't make a meaningful contribution to our border security. If it had, we wouldn't be in the situation that we're in now. And so, I'm not for wasting governmental resources for one politician's performance gain.\" T\n\nTexas lawmakers have proposed spending $6.5 billion on border security during the 2026-27 biennium.\n\nWatch Eye On Politics on CBS News Texas at 7:30 Sunday morning .\n\nJack Fink covers politics for KTVT-TV CBS 11 and has been with the station since September 2003.\n\n© 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Senator Ted Cruz, who won re-election for a third term, discusses the main priorities lawmakers will tackle first. Congressman-elect Brandon Gill, who will represent the 26th Congressional District in North Texas, talks about how he will help pass President-elect Donald Trump's agenda. Plus, for the first time since some controversial charter amendments passed in the City of Dallas, Mayor Eric Johnson is speaking out about the results. He also answers the question about whether he's had conversations about serving in the Trump administration. Jack Fink covers these stories in the latest episode of Eye On Politics. (Original air date: December 8, 2024.)\n\nOn Tuesday, Senator Ted Cruz spoke with political reporter Jack Fink about the most urgent priorities voters expect Republicans to work on in the new session of Congress starting next month. They include border security, deporting violent criminals in the U.S. illegally, reducing prices and boosting the economy.\n\n\"We have a real obligation to deliver on our campaign promises,\" said Cruz. \"And if you lok at the election, there are a number of things that came out of the election that, I think are a real mandate and a mandate for change.\"\n\nWatch Jack's full interview with Senator Ted Cruz:\n\nAt the age of 30, the youngest Republican to serve in the next Congress will be Brandon Gill. He will represent the 26th Congressional District in North Texas. He was also elected Freshman Class President.\n\nGill said he and his fellow Republican freshmen ran on the Trump agenda: securing the border, unleashing American energy and cutting wasteful federal spending to bring inflation down. He told Jack what he hopes to accomplish as the president of the incoming class in the House.\n\n\"I said I want to do everything I possibly can to make sure we are all in the best position to execute on the Trump agenda,\" said Gill.\n\nWatch Jack's full interview with Congressman-elect Brandon Gill:\n\nJack also spoke with Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson in an exclusive interview Tuesday.\n\nHe discussed the controversial charter election and his recommendation to residents to vote down all the propositions. He called two measures that were part of the Dallas HERO Initiative that passed \"workable.\"\n\n\"The reality is, I'm not very worried about it,\" said Johnson.\n\nHe played down concerns by opponents, including former Mayors, that prop U will negatively impact the city finances and services by requiring the city to hire and maintain 4,000 police officers. It's a move that city leaders and advocates for the measure estimate will cost between $175 and $185 million dollars.\n\n\"It's not going to destroy the city of Dallas,\" said Johnson. \"It's not going to bring us to our knees financially. It does force us to put our money where our mouth is on public safety and I don't think that's a bad thing.\"\n\nHe said Prop S, which allows residents to file suit against the city if it doesn't comply with the charter, city ordinances, and state law. He did express concern about what he called \"enforcement through litigation.\"\n\n\"We don't want to be tied up in court constantly of paying lawyers' legal fees to bring lawsuits against us to do what we're trying to do anyway. So that's my concern about prop s - it's a litigation bonanza potentially.\"\n\nThe Mayor said his recommendation to Dallas residents was to vote down all of the charter amendments, not just certain propositions. \"If none of them passed, I had a legal opinion from our city attorney that said we've got to have an immediate do-over, an immediate do-over. That's what I wanted. I wanted to be able to come right back and come up with some well-thought out charter amendments that actually would have accomplished what props S, T, U wanted to do but more effectively.\"\n\nOne of the Mayor's friends from serving in the Texas Legislature, former Republican Representative Scott Turner, has been nominated by President-elect Donald Trump to serve as HUD Secretary. Jack asked the Mayor if he's had any conversations about joining the Trump administration.\n\n\"I love my city, I've had no greater honor in my life being elected Mayor of this city,\" said Johnson. \"Whether or not I'd be willing to serve our country, I think that would depend on a lot, but my focus is on being Mayor of Dallas.\"\n\nThe Dallas Mayor said that he told Turner that he would like Dallas to be at the front of the line for anything HUD will be doing to help cities. Johnson delivered his State of the City address Thursday. He said he wants the city's progress reducing violent crime and reducing property taxes to continue.\n\nWatch Jack's full interview with Dallas Mayor Eric Johson:\n\nJack Fink covers politics for KTVT-TV CBS 11 and has been with the station since September 2003.\n\n© 2024 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Kay Granger's service, differ over how she disclosed health challenges\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  December 24, 2024 / 10:14 AM CST / CBS Texas\n\nNORTH TEXAS - Former Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price said Monday she had heard Congresswoman Kay Granger had some health issues but didn't realize they were more serious.\n\n\"I'm very proud of her for standing up and acknowledging it,\" Price said.\n\nOn Sunday, the 81-year-old Congresswoman issued a statement that read in part, \"As many of my family, friends, and colleagues have known, I have been navigating some unforeseen health challenges over the past year. However, since early September, my health challenges have progressed making frequent travel to Washington both difficult and unpredictable. During this time, my incredible staff has remained steadfast, continuing to deliver exceptional constituent services, as they have for the past 27 years.\"\n\nHer announcement followed a report by the conservative publication Dallas Express that said Granger had missed votes since late July. The publication's CEO is Chris Putnam, who challenged Granger in the Republican primary in 2020.\n\nGranger's son told the Dallas Morning News that she was \"having some dementia issues late in the year\" and that she is a resident of an independent living facility called Clearfork Tradition in Fort Worth. He declined to elaborate when we reached out to him.\n\nGranger was first elected in 1996 and announced in November of last year that she would not run for re-election and would retire at the end of her term at the end of this month.\n\nSources familiar with the situation told CBS News Texas that Granger intended to complete her term without any issues but didn't realize her health issues would progress. The sources also said that Granger informed House leadership about her challenges and told them she would be there if she was needed for a crucial vote in Washington. Records from the official Congressional website show her last vote on Capitol Hill was July 24.\n\nThe website GovTrack.US , which tracks Congressional votes, shows between April and June of this year, Granger missed 107 of 231 eligible votes, or about 46 percent. Between July and September of this year, the site shows Granger missed 92 of 120 eligible votes, or more than 76 percent, and she didn't vote on any of the 62 eligible votes last month and this month.\n\nPrice said Granger's decision to come forward and stay in office was personal.\n\n\"I think that was her choice on timing,\" Price said. \"We shouldn't do could-of, should-of, would-of and take a look at that. We have to celebrate what Kay's done in the service she's given this country.\"\n\nAbraham George, chairman of the Texas Republican Party, said Monday he would have liked to have seen more transparency from the Congresswoman.\n\n\"Honestly, I think if she was not available, she should have stepped down,\" George said. \"I get it. She was retiring. She said she is not running again. Something as serious as this, she should have stepped down and let a special election happen. It also comes down to does she have the mental capacity to read a bill to understand what she is casting a ballot for or is it some staffers going to tell her this is how we are supposed to do this, and this is what we want you to do. An elected official is the only person who is responsible to the district, and I know I'm being very critical about this, but I think the people will agree with me on this.\"\n\nGranger stepped down in March as the chairwoman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, and last month, she or her office posted a variety of photos of her receiving her official portrait honoring her service as a committee chair.\n\nIn her statement, Granger said, \"In November, I was able to return to DC to hold meetings on behalf of my constituents, express my gratitude to my staff, and oversee the closure of my Washington office. It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve the city of Fort Worth - as a city council member, as mayor, and as a Member of Congress.\"\n\nGranger was the first Republican woman to serve as chair of that committee and the first Republican woman to serve as a member of Congress from Texas. She was also elected as the first woman to be mayor of Fort Worth, a job she held for five years.\n\n\"She's been a trailblazer for women,\" Price said. \"She's been a champion for this region, no stronger supporter for the city of Fort Worth and our region and whether as a mayor, council member, or in Washington, Kay's done a beautiful job.\"\n\nGeorge agreed.\n\n\"She's got an amazing legacy,\" George said. \"She's been a very good champion for Republican causes and conservative values. She brought in a lot of work to her district and for Texas. She's done a great job for Texas. There's nobody who's going to question her on her work ethic and what she's done for her district and for the State of Texas.\"\n\nCongressman-elect Craig Goldman, a former Republican state representative from Fort Worth, will succeed Granger in representing the 12th Congressional District.

A look at the historic margin of victory for Trump in Texas. Jack Fink speaks with two of the three new members of Congress who will represent North Texas. These stories in the latest episode of Eye On Politics with Jack Fink. (original air date: November 10, 2024.)\n\nFor the first time since the late 1800s, a former President has been re-elected four years after he left office. After his big win on Election Night, Donald Trump is joining the ranks of Grover Cleveland and heading back to the White House. Vice-President Kamala Harris conceded the race Wednesday. Her campaign was just 107 days long because President Biden made history of his own by changing his mind about running for a second term, 56 years after the last President who made the same decision: Lyndon Baines Johnson.\n\nIn the Texas Senate race, Republican Ted Cruz won his third term after defeating Democratic Congressman Colin Allred of Dallas in a very expensive and combative race. Cruz celebrated with his supporters at a Houston watch party.\n\n\"I want to say to all of those who didn't support me, you have my word that I will fight for you, for your jobs, and for your safety, and for your constitutional rights,\" said Cruz. \"But tonight, the people of Texas have spoken and their message rings clear as a bell across our great state. Texas will remain Texas.\"\n\nAllred delivered a concession speech in Dallas before supporters. \"It took courage for each and every one of you and everyone who got involved in this campaign to even though we haven't won in Texas in some time, to believe in this election and put everything you had into it, it's going to take courage for whatever comes tomorrow or after,\" said Allred. \"This state is worth fighting for. This country is worth fighting for. Understand that. This state is worth fighting for.\"\n\nCruz's victory was double the margin predicted by the polls. He defeated Allred by more than 970,000 votes statewide, 53% to 44%, a nine percentage point margin. Going into election day, Cruz led the Real Clear Politics average of polls by just 4.4 percentage points. While Cruz won statewide, he lost in Tarrant County, the state's largest Republican-led county in the country, by just 1251 votes. The margin was razor thin. Allred: 48.87% Cruz: 48.72%.\n\nCruz finished a lot stronger this year than in 2018, which was a good year for Democrats. He lost Tarrant County to Beto O'Rourke that year by more than 4,300 votes and won statewide by nearly 215,000 votes. Allred won Dallas County, while Cruz won Collin and Denton counties.\n\nIn the presidential race in Texas, Trump beat the current Vice President, 56% to 42%. It was the biggest margin in a presidential race in the Lone Star State in 20 years. He beat Vice President Harris by more than 1.5 million votes.\n\nTo find a bigger margin of victory, you would have to go back to the year 2004, when then-President George W. Bush beat Democratic Senator John Kerry by nearly 1.7 million votes statewide. Trump did have a higher margin of victory in Texas than Bush had in 2000.\n\nIn Tarrant County this year, Trump won by more than 42,000 votes. Four years ago, in 2020, he lost to Joe Biden by more than 1,800 votes. Trump also won in Collin and Denton counties, but lost in Dallas County in both elections.\n\nTrump expanded his support among Hispanic voters, and the impact of this was seen in South Texas. Trump won the counties surrounding McAllen, Brownsville and Laredo along the border this year after losing these areas by wide margins four years ago.\n\nAs  expected, Texas GOP Chair Abraham George celebrated the wins by Trump and Cruz. He also discussed the race for Texas House Speaker which is shaping up in Austin between the incumbent Dade Phelan and his Republican Representative David Cook of Mansfield.\n\nWatch Jack's full interview with Texas GOP Chair Abraham George:\n\nFor months leading up to the election, the polls showed a very tight race - particularly in the seven battleground states where Trump won.  Here's a look at how the political dust settled.\n\nIn Arizona, Trump is leading Harris by 5.9%, a bigger margin than the final Real Clear Politics average of polls. Trump was also leading in Nevada by 3.4%, also higher than the Real Clear Politics average of polls. In Georgia, Trump won by 2.3 percentage points, also higher than the polling average.\n\nIn the Midwest, Trump won two states the Vice President was ahead in before Election Day: Wisconsin where Trump won by point 0.8 percentage points and Michigan where he won by 1.5 percentage points.\n\nIn the biggest battleground, Pennsylvania, Trump won by 2.0 percentage points and in North Carolina, the former President won by 3.4 percentage points.\n\nWatch how battleground states performed on Election Day:\n\nLooking ahead, this week Republicans in the U.S. Senate, who now regained the majority, will be selecting their new Majority Leader. Senator John Cornyn is vying for that position against two others: John Thune of South Dakota and Rick Scott of Florida.\n\nThe other question is whether any Texas Republicans will serve in the second Trump administration. One name mentioned to serve as Attorney General is John Ratcliffe, who served as the Director of National Intelligence during part of the first administration. He's also a former North Texas Congressman and United States Attorney. Another Texan mentioned is Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, who is reportedly being considered for the Agriculture Secretary. We also know Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is also close to Trump.\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott celebrated the wins by Trump and Cruz. He suggested that with Trump's tougher border security policies, the state will likely no longer need to spend billions of dollars to combat illegal immigration. The Governor also said because of Republican gains this election, he has 79 votes, three more than necessary to pass school choice in the new legislative session in January.\n\nAbbott also said there's enough money to also boost public schools. Republicans picked up two state house seats in Austin and now lead Democrats by an 88 to 62 lead. One seat the GOP hoped to flip was the 70th House district in Plano. But Democratic incumbent Mihaela Plesa held onto her seat, beating Republican Steve Kinard .\n\nThere will be three new members of Congress from North Texas sworn-in this January.\n\nRepublican Craig Goldman won in the 12th Congressional District, which includes Tarrant and Parker counties. Goldman succeeds longtime Congresswoman and former Fort Worth Mayor Kay Granger.\n\nRepublican Brandon Gill succeeds Michael Burgess in the 26th Congressional District in Denton and northern counties.\n\nDemocrat Julie Johnson in the 32nd Congressional District, succeeds Colin Allred in Dallas, and small portions of Collin and Denton counties.\n\nWatch Jack's full interview with Congresswoman-elect Julie Johnson:\n\nWatch Jack's full interview with Congressman-elect Craig Goldman:\n\nJack Fink covers politics for KTVT-TV CBS 11 and has been with the station since September 2003.\n\n© 2024 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Justin Holland lost his suburban Dallas seat to Trump 2016 spokeswoman Katrina Pierson in two of the highest-profile races in the increasingly bloody internal war among Texas Republicans.\n\nDespite the Republicans' 84-66 majority in the state House of Representatives and successful conservative agenda from the 2023 legislative session, 15 House Republicans lost to challengers either in primaries in March or in the runoffs on Tuesday night. The Republicans were victims of the intra-party war, with Attorney General Ken Paxton taking aim at Republicans who voted to impeach him last year and separately, Gov. Greg Abbott backed challengers to the Republicans who voted against his school voucher bill.\n\nSix of the eight incumbents on Tuesday night lost to challengers, with Abbott declaring Tuesday night that he had enough votes to pass his voucher bill. Last fall, 21 state House Republicans - mainly from rural districts - joined with all the Democrats to defeat his voucher bill . Abbott backed several challengers to Republicans who voted against his bill.\n\nPhelan, who has represented the Beaumont area since 2015 and has been speaker for two terms, did not pressure his members to back Abbott's bill in a special November legislative session, according to the Texas Tribune .\n\nAlthough Abbott stayed out of Phelan's race, Paxton had vowed to defeat him and challenger David Covey even managed to get the endorsement of former President Donald Trump and powerful Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick.\n\nOn Tuesday, Phelan managed to stave off Covey by fewer than 500 votes, according to The Associated Press.\n\n\"I am immensely grateful to the voters of Southeast Texas, who have spoken loud and clear: in Southeast Texas, we set our own course-our community is not for sale, and our values are not up for auction,\" Phelan said in a statement. \"I owe a profound debt of gratitude to every voter and volunteer whose relentless dedication turned that vision into tonight's resounding victory.\"\n\nAfter the result, Paxton posted on social media \"Texas AG Ken Paxton's Statement on Dade Phelan Stealing Election\" and called for the primaries to be closed only to Republicans.\n\n\"My message to Austin is clear: to those considering supporting Dade Phelan as Speaker in 2025, ask your 15 colleagues who lost re-election how they feel about their decision now,\" Paxton said. \"You will not return if you vote for Dade Phelan again!\"\n\nPhelan was targeted by Paxton for leading the impeachment case in the Texas House last year against Paxton, one of Trump's closest allies. Phelan had launched the investigation into Paxton early in the 2023 legislative session and moved forward with impeaching Paxton related to allegations of misconduct, including bribery and abuse of office.\n\nAhead of the impeachment vote, Paxton accused Phelan of being drunk on the House floor.\n\nSixty House Republicans - more than two-thirds of the 84 total Republicans in the House - joined all 66 Democrats in voting to impeach Paxton on 20 articles. Paxton was ultimately acquitted in the GOP-controlled state Senate.\n\nThe victorious Paxton then endorsed challengers to those who voted to impeach him and embarked on a \"statewide Fall tour\" to campaign for them. Facing the Paxton-backed challenger, impeachment manager Republican Rep. Andrew Murr, the grandson of Coke Stevenson, who famously lost the 1948 contested Senate election to Lyndon Johnson, opted not to run for reelection .\n\nPhelan came in second in the March primary, but Covey did not secure the 50% vote necessary to stave off a runoff.\n\nThe five state House representatives representing Paxton's home county, Collin County, were among the 60 who voted to impeach him. In a joint statement, they said the vote was an \"incredibly difficult vote as, for most of us, Ken has been a long time friend.\"\n\nOne of those five, Paxton's hometown legislator, Rep. Frederick Frazier, was defeated Tuesday night by challenger Keresa Richardson. In addition to being targeted by Paxton, Frazier had pleaded guilty to criminal mischief and no contest on two misdemeanor charges for allegedly impersonating a public official.\n\nAnother of Paxton's targets was Holland, who also represents Paxton's home district of Collin County. Abbott backed Pierson in the primary given Holland's vote against school vouchers. Holland had also angered the right wing of the party after voting out of committee a bill that had zero chance of passing the House floor that would have raised the age for gun background checks after a shooting in his district.\n\nCaroline Linton is an associate managing editor on the political team for CBSNews.com.

JD Vance as his vice-presidential nominee and running mate.\n\n\"He has a wonderful history,\" said Karen Watson, a Republican. \"It's a wonderful American story. He's young, he's energetic.\"\n\n\"You see that he's just a hard-working, normal guy who has used his intelligence and his talent to get where he is,\" said Republican Orlando Salazar.\n\nRepublicans CBS News Texas spoke to said Vance, who turns 40 next month, represents the next generation of Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement.\n\n\"Really represents the ideological vanguard of where the Republican Party and more broadly the conservative movement is moving in favor of really focusing on the working class and the middle class whose wages have stagnated over the last four years, particularly in the Midwest,\" said Sanjay Narayan, another Republican.\n\nDuring primetime Monday night, Trump walked into the Republican National Convention to a rousing standing ovation from delegates two days after he survived an assassination attempt at his rally in Pennsylvania. He wore a bandage on his right ear .\n\nTrump also appeared for the first time with Vance since selecting him as his new running mate.\n\nThe convention began earlier Monday.\n\nJonathan Saenz, president of the conservative group Texas Values Action and a Delegate At Large, spoke with CBS News Texas as he and others were ready to enter the complex.\n\n\"This is the Texas delegation. So, you know we're a proud bunch,\" said Saenz. \"We're all wearing our cowboy hat, so everybody knows we're from Texas.\"\n\nSaenz said he and other proud Texans are pumped up for the convention after the former president walked away from the shooting and pumped his fist in defiance.\n\n\"When your presidential nominee takes a bullet and keeps going and encourages you to do the same, that is inspired from people from the State of Texas that are delegates here to stand with President Trump to be more resolute, to be more optimistic, and to unite for victory,\" said Saenz.\n\nSouth Texas Congresswoman Monica De La Cruz, R-15th Congressional District, will speak at the convention in prime time Wednesday night.\n\nShe said she'll talk about the top concerns for Americans, including inflation.\n\n\"Families all across this nation are struggling to put food on the table,\" De La Cruz said. \"I'm also going to talk about the men and women who've been forgotten by the Biden administration due to Biden's lack of securing our border.\"\n\nAside from De La Cruz, Gov.

      "text": "Rep. Dustin Burrows of Lubbock elected as Texas House Speaker\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  January 16, 2025 / 7:50 PM CST / CBS Texas\n\nAUSTIN - The 89th legislative session began Tuesday with members of the Texas House electing Rep. Dustin Burrows as their new speaker after a month-long divisive battle among Republicans.\n\nBurrows won the speaker's race by a vote of 85-55.\n\n\"The duty bestowed upon me today as Speaker of the Texas House is one of immense responsibility and honor, and I thank each of my colleagues for their trust and vote of confidence,\" Burrows said in statement posted to X. \"As Speaker, I stand ready to support every member as we collectively navigate the most pressing issues facing Texans today-issues ranging from improving education to providing additional property tax relief, bolstering water resources, fighting for safer communities, and everything in between. While the majority will guide our course, the House's strength lies in its diversity, and my leadership will be dedicated to ensuring every voice is heard and every district represented this session.\"\n\nAfter former House Speaker Dade Phelan dropped his bid to keep the gavel in early December, Rep. Burrows of Lubbock entered the race pitting himself against Rep. David Cook of Mansfield. Even though Cook won the House GOP Caucus nomination, Burrows decided to run anyway despite caucus rules saying Republicans need to back their nominee.\n\nRep. Jeff Leach backed Burrows.\n\n\"I've known Dustin Burrows for a long time,\" Leach said. \"I've been desk mates with Dustin the past three sessions and Representative Burrows is a rock-solid conservative. He's actually the conservative choice in this race.\"\n\nIncoming freshman Rep. Shelley Luther said she supported Cook.\n\n\"When David Cook came out and said that he was for reform, and he wanted to transform the House into something that is a working House then we all got behind him,\" Luther said.\n\nThere was Democrat in the Speaker race, Rep. Ana Maria Rodriguez Ramos of Dallas. She had no chance at winning because Democrats are in the minority.\n\nRepublicans have 88 seats, and because they are split between the candidates, the winner needed votes from Democrats. All 150 House members voted and the winner needed a simple majority of 76.\n\nAfter the election, Cook congratulated Burrows and thanked his supporters.\n\n\"Together, we sparked an important and long-overdue conversation about the need for reform within this body, and for that, I am truly appreciative,\" Cook said in a statement. \"While the outcome may not have been what I hoped for, I remain humbled to still have the privilege to work alongside my House colleagues to advance meaningful policy changes for the betterment of all Texans.\"\n\nThe speaker assigns committee chairmanships and can push for a bill's passage or kill it. Burrows is now the third most powerful person at the Capitol behind Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick.\n\nEven though House members, not the public, vote for speaker, the fight had turned into a statewide campaign as Attorney General Ken Paxton toured the state , promising that any House Republican who voted for Burrows instead of Cook would face a primary challenge next year.\n\nIn an interview with CBS News Texas, Leach was unfazed and criticized Paxton.\n\n\"I wish the attorney general would focus on his actual job of running the attorney general's office [rather] than get involved in these House political squabbles,\" Leach said. \"I've heard what the attorney general has said on his tour of terror, if you will, across the state and he's talking a lot about himself.\"\n\nAbbott and Patrick also weighed in to support Cook. Luther told CBS News Texas that she didn't mind hearing from high-profile Republicans outside the House.\n\nTexas GOP Chair Abraham George and Paxton pressured House Republicans to back Cook after he won the nomination by the House GOP caucus.\n\nRep. Carl Tepper , R-Lubbock, a friend and supporter of Burrows for Speaker, said Tuesday morning the pressure campaign isn't working.\n\n\"I know that they're outside of the House, but it is their party and it's an embarrassment honestly that Republicans can't come together and make a decision,\" said Luther.\n\nAfter Burrows' election, Paxton said in a statement that removing Phelan as Speaker was a positive step for Texas, but maintained his criticism of Burrows.\n\n\"[Phelan's] close ally, Dustin Burrows, was elected with the support of most Democrats after he refused to honor the rules of the Republican Caucus,\" Paxton's statement reads. \"It is now important that Speaker Burrows and his leadership team pass every conservative legislative priority in a timely manner to make our state more secure and more prosperous. That is what Texas Republicans expect.\"\n\nWhile the battle for speaker was bitter, the legislature did get some good news as the session was set to begin: There's another big budget surplus.\n\nThe Texas comptroller announced the surplus amounts to nearly $24 billion, which isn't as high as the record $32.7 billion from two years ago.\n\nThe separate rainy-day fund will have more than $28 billion by the end of August 2027.\n\nDuring the next five months, lawmakers will now debate how much of the extra cash to spend on schools, healthcare, and border security and whether to give homeowners and businesses an additional break on their property taxes.\n\nJack Fink covers politics for KTVT-TV CBS 11 and has been with the station since September 2003.\n\n© 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

      "text": "Colin Allred is in a tight race with Ted Cruz. Here's how he's planning to become Texas' first Democratic senator in decades.\n\nFor decades, Democrats have sought to reclaim their former glory in Texas, but they've repeatedly come up short.\n\nThe party hasn't won a statewide race in the Lone Star State since 1994, which has largely deprived it of the sort of bench that Republicans have cultivated for years through their dominance of state government.\n\nSo when Rep. Colin Allred - a three-term lawmaker who represents the Dallas-area 32nd Congressional District - entered this year's Senate contest against two-term Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, many Democrats felt that his bipartisan credentials would bolster his run.\n\nAllred, 41, believes that he can be a change agent for Texas. And with less than a week to go before the election, he remains locked in a competitive contest with the 53-year-old Cruz.\n\nA late October New York Times/Siena College survey showed Cruz with a four-point edge over Allred (50% to 46%) among likely voters, but in the same poll, former President Donald Trump led Vice President Kamala Harris by ten points (52% to 42%). And other polls of the race, including ones from Marist College, Morning Consult, and the University of Houston Hobby School of Public Affairs, all showed Cruz with single-digit leads.\n\nThe competitiveness of the race led the Senate Majority PAC - the Democratic political action committee tied to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York - to pour $5 million into the contest in recent days, as the Texas race is now widely viewed as the party's best opportunity to flip a red seat this year. In total, Allred has raised more than $80 million for the Senate race, according to his campaign.\n\nBut one key fact remains: Allred will have to overcome the state's Republican lean in order to oust Cruz.\n\nI sat down with Allred before a recent block walk kickoff event in Houston, where the former NFL player and civil rights attorney laid out his case against Cruz's reelection bid.\n\nBut something significant stuck out during our conversation.\n\nIn the past, red-state Democrats often shied away from speaking out too forcefully regarding reproductive rights. However, after Roe v. Wade was overturned by the US Supreme Court, along with the passage of Texas' strict abortion ban , Allred lambasted \"extremism\" that he argued would seriously affect the economy.\n\nIn the Times/Siena poll, likely voters in Texas ranked the economy as their top issue, with 27% of respondents expressing this opinion. (The second-and- third ranked issues were immigration and abortion, with 15% support for each issue.)\n\n\"The individual stories of people denied miscarriage care or denied care when pregnancies weren't viable and having to leave the state are horrific,\" Allred told me after he spoke at a reproductive rights-focused rally headlined by Harris, which also featured an appearance by Beyoncé . \"I know many of these women that have come forward. It's personal. It's also impacting every other aspect of Texas life, from our medical schools to our universities to our business climate.\"\n\nIn 2018, then-Rep. Beto O'Rourke traversed Texas during his Senate campaign and in the process visited all of the state's 254 counties.\n\nWhile Cruz eventually won, he bested O'Rourke by only 2.6 percentage points , or by roughly 215,000 votes out of more than 8.3 million ballots cast.\n\nO'Rourke's campaign that year worked to energize Democratic voters - with a focus on young and progressive voters - and his town hall events became a signature part of his campaign.\n\nAllred's campaign approach is a bit different than the one pursued by O'Rourke, who represented the El Paso area in Congress from 2013 until 2019. He's seeking to maximize Democratic turnout as well, but he's conducted serious outreach to independents and Republicans to be a part of his moderate-minded campaign.\n\n\"I have a record of being the most bipartisan Texan in Congress,\" he told me during our conversation.\n\nIt's the sort of ethos that Allred takes with him on the campaign trail across Texas, a behemoth of a state that contains huge cities and scores of medium-sized and smaller cities and towns in between. It can take around thirteen hours to drive across Texas from the east to the west.\n\n\"This is a massive state, and what happens in one part of the state is not always known in the other part of the state,\" Allred told me, adding of his experience: \"I don't come across any Texans who are looking for a handout, but I come across Texans who are looking for somebody who's going to be on their side.\"\n\nDemocrats in Texas already perform strongly in cities like Austin, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. But in the Trump era, Democrats have also increasingly won over more suburban voters , a phenomenon that has helped the party immensely in other Sun Belt states like Arizona and Georgia. And if Allred is to defeat Cruz, he'll have to put up extremely strong numbers with suburban voters across the board.\n\nMark P. Jones, a political science professor at Rice University, told me in a interview that Cruz is in a tougher spot compared to other Texas Republicans because he lacks substantial \"crossover\" support. Republicans for decades have flexed their political muscle in the state based on their strong support from the party faithful and conservative-leaning independents.\n\nBut Cruz, a onetime GOP presidential candidate, has cut a polarizing profile both in Texas and on the national stage.\n\n\"He doesn't have much appeal to the sort of soft Republicans, independents, and moderate-to-conservative Democrats in the same way that Gov. Greg Abbott or Sen. John Cornyn do,\" Jones said. \"And it's not a large amount, but he starts off at a disadvantage in that he needs to pretty much win all of the Republican vote and make sure that Republicans turn out.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Allred has targeted Cruz's infamous 2021 trip to Cancún, Mexico, which occurred while many Texans were without power due to a severe winter storm.\n\nDuring our conversation, Allred depicted Cruz as someone who doesn't have a broader vision for one of the fastest-growing states in the country, which now boasts over 30 million residents.\n\nBusiness Insider has reached out to the Cruz campaign for comment.\n\n\"Texas is incredibly diverse and dynamic, but we have been governed by extremists who I think have put at risk all of the positives about our state,\" Allred told me. \"Ted Cruz, in particular, is someone who I think is just too small for Texas. His vision is too small for us. And to me, it's kind of the opposite of the Texas that I know.\"\n\nAllred, who would be the first Black senator from Texas should he defeat Cruz, also spoke about the difficulties of change in a state where Republicans have long held a firm grip on power.\n\n\"When you have a one-party rule state for so long, you can get an impression that there's no changing it,\" Allred told me. \"There's always a sense that we should have change. But can we break through?\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Here's why the once solidly Republican state of Texas could become a ticking time bomb for Trump's GOP\n\nThe 2020 presidential election is projected to have record voter turnout, and the long-time Republican stronghold of Texas is shaping up to be a battleground state.\n\nRepublicans' margins of victory in the state have been narrowing over the course of the last few election cycles, especially in Texas' suburban areas.\n\nAnd over the course of just a few weeks in July, four incumbent Republican congressmen all decided to call it quits and not run for re-election in 2020 in what some commentators have termed a \"Texodus.\"\n\nThree of the retiring congressmen, Rep. Pete Olson of Texas' 22nd district in the Houston suburbs, Rep. Will Hurd of the 23rd district along the border, and Rep. Kenny Marchant of the 24th district in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area all represent majority-nonwhite, suburban districts that have been trending towards Democrats in recent election cycles.\n\nNot only do retirements automatically make many seats more competitive, but Texas is currently experiencing two trends that are favorable to Democrats: increasing urbanization, and big demographic shifts.\n\nThe Texas Tribune recently reported that Hispanics are expected to become the largest demographic group in the state by 2022, with Texas gaining nearly nine times as many Hispanic residents as white residents.\n\nAs the Tribune noted, almost half of Texas' Hispanic population is concentrated in the state's five largest counties, and Hispanic voters in Texas \" are registering and voting at significantly higher rates than their population is growing,\" according to a Houston Chronicle analysis.\n\nThe current rate of population growth among non-white Texas residents is a positive development for Democrats, but they can't take voters of color for granted.\n\nDespite Latino turnout doubling in Texas between the 2014 and 2018 midterms, according to one analysis , Democrats do not hold a monopoly on Hispanic and Latino voters.\n\nAs the Pew Research Center noted , 65% of Hispanics voted for Rep. Beto O'Rourke while 35% backed Sen. Ted Cruz in their high-profile Senate race in 2018. And a slim majority of Hispanic voters - 53% - backed Democrat Lupe Valdez over incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott, who received 42% of the Latino vote.\n\nWashington Post data columnist David Byler argued that while a blue Texas is a \"Democratic dream\" for now, the GOP could be putting itself at a disadvantage by embracing the Trump's administration's harsh and controversial immigration policies, leaving lots of Latino and Hispanic voters on the table instead of courting them.\n\nFord O'Connell, a veteran GOP campaign strategist and adjunct professor at George Washington University 's Graduate School of Political Management, told INSIDER that while the increase in the state's Latino population is an important demographic change, Texas' current leftward shift can be attributed more to white suburbanites breaking with President Donald Trump 's Republican party.\n\n\"The narrative that Hispanics will turn Texas blue may eventually happen, but that's not moving as fast as the fact that college-educated whites are telling us they don't like Donald Trump,\" O'Connell said.\n\nThe Obama-Trump voters who helped Republicans carry competitive states in the Upper Midwest have been the subject of a significant amount of media scrutiny since the 2016 election.\n\nBut suburban voters who flipped from Mitt Romney in 2012 to Hillary Clinton in 2016 in states like Texas have received far less attention, despite the critical role they could play in turning Texas, a GOP stronghold for four decades, into a swing state.\n\nThe prospects of past Republican presidential nominees, including Mitt Romney and John McCain, and the GOP more broadly have hinged on the support of suburban, college-educated voters in the state who are concentrated around urban centers like Houston and the Dallas-Fort Worth area and in many cases, are fleeing the GOP altogether.\n\n\"Texas' cities are getting bigger in areas like Houston, Dallas, and Austin, it's the white folks in Texas whose votes are changing,\" O'Connell said. \"You have more college-educated voters in those cities because they also have booming economies, and it's these college-educated whites who don't like Donald Trump.\"\n\nTrump won Texas in 2016 with 52% of the vote compared to Romney's 57% in 2012. And in many of the suburban congressional districts that Romney easily carried in 2012, Trump either lost to Clinton or barely cleared over 50% of the vote. Since taking office, Trump's approval rating in the state has dropped by 14%, according to Morning Consult.\n\nRomney carried Texas' 7th and 32nd congressional district in the Houston and Dallas suburbs, respectively, by comfortable double-digit margins in 2012, but Clinton narrowly won both in 2016, according to data compiled by the Daily Kos . Democrats ended up flipping both seats in the 2018 midterms.\n\nRomney similarly carried the soon-to-be-open seats in Texas 22nd and 24th districts by huge margins of 26% and 22% respectively, and narrowly held the 23rd by a little over two percentage points.\n\nBut in 2016, Clinton carried the 23rd by over three percentage points with Trump holding the 22nd and 24th districts by single-digit margins, a far departure from Romney and McCain's previous blowout victories in those areas. And in 2018, Hurd won his re-election bid by fewer than 1,000 votes.\n\nNot only did Democrats flip two suburban House seats in 2018, but former Rep. Beto O'Rourke came within just three percentage points of ousting Sen. Ted Cruz, the best statewide performance for a Texas Democrat in decades.\n\n\"Texans are not particularly big fans of Donald Trump in the way that they are of other Republicans,\" O'Connell said, noting that many Texas voters were sending Cruz \"a message\" about their disapproval to Trump by giving Cruz - who they view to be aligned with Trump - a slim victory over O'Rourke while re-electing Abbott by a much more comfortable margin.\n\n\"The problem there comes down to a very simple thing and that is, is that the entire ticket is tied to Trump,\" O'Connell said of Texas Republicans. \"So you either have to carve out your own brand or you have to rub a rabbit's foot and hope for the best.\"\n\nBenjamin Ray, a Democratic strategist and communications specialist at the pro-choice political action committee EMILY's List, told INSIDER that long-time Republican members of Congress retiring in formerly safe districts presents a \"great opportunity\" for Democrats and a glaring warning sign for the GOP.\n\nRay further pointed out that many of the districts in the Houston, Dallas, and Austin suburbs were specifically gerrymandered to optimize the chances of a Republican victory, making it all the more concerning that Republicans' margins of victory in those areas are getting slimmer over time.\n\n\"They drew these maps for one particular version of the Republican party to do well in, and the voters that they're counting on don't think that their Republican representatives are speaking for them anymore,\" Ray added.\n\nHe said of the retiring congressmen, \"these folks have been in politics for a while, they can tell which way the wind is blowing, and they're heading for the exits. That doesn't just happen by accident.\"\n\nAs many Democratic campaign strategists and political scientists frequently say, Texas is a less of a Republican state than it is a non-voting state.\n\nIn 2018, Texas improved on their 2014 midterm turnout rate by 18%, with 46.3% of registered voters coming out to vote, but still ranked among the lowest states in voter turnout in the 2018 elections, according to the Dallas Morning News.\n\nAnd in 2020, Democrats will be aiming not just to flip several House seats, but to defeat GOP Sen. John Cornyn - all of which will be reliant on high turnout at the top of the ticket.\n\nRay told INSIDER that the Democratic strategy to win back House seats will necessarily involve both flipping Trump-skeptical suburban voters and increasing turnout among nonvoters - the latter of which was a major component of O'Rourke's 2018 campaign strategy.\n\n\"There's nothing like the presidential election to get voters to show up, and I think that all signs point towards a very high turnout in 2020,\" Ray said. \"In a state like Texas, I have to think that Democratic campaigns regard that as good news.\"\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that 53% of Hispanic voters backed Gov. Greg Abbott and 42% voted for his Democratic challenger Lupe Valdez. This article has been updated with the correct data to reflect that 53% of Hispanics backed Valdez and 42% voted for Abbott.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump's early organizing across the South is paying off as he faces off against Nikki Haley\n\nLast January, former President Donald Trump headlined a campaign event at the South Carolina State House, with the former president already eyeing the state's critical primary even before any major competitor had entered the GOP presidential race.\n\nFlanked by Gov. Henry McMaster and Sen. Lindsey Graham, Trump basically put his would-be competitors on notice that he had already locked up support from the state's GOP establishment and that anyone who dared to enter the race would start miles behind him.\n\nFast forward a year and Trump has been largely correct in his assessment of the race. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott exited the primary months ago. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis left the race in January after a disappointing finish in Iowa. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley remains in the race but lacks substantial institutional backing in her home state ahead of the February 24 primary.\n\nThrough early endorsements and organizational moves on the ground, Trump finds himself in an enviable position ahead of the string of primary contests across the South in the coming weeks. How did this come about?\n\nMcMaster and Graham were both early high-profile endorsees of Trump's reelection bid. And the former president replicated that show of support across the South, notably in Texas.\n\nTexas Republicans will head to the polls on March 5, or Super Tuesday, in what could be the day that Trump effectively runs up the score in the delegate math against Haley. In the upcoming Republican primary, Texas will have 161 delegates up for grabs, which is second only to California in the number of delegates that a GOP candidate can win.\n\nIt's a prize that Trump has long eyed, and during a high-profile rally last April, the former president touted his support among many of the state's top Republicans. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and state Attorney General Ken Paxton threw their support behind Trump, and Rep. Wesley Hunt and state Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller were at the rally to pump up the former president. Since then, Gov. Greg Abbott, who has repeatedly tussled with President Joe Biden's administration over border security and immigration, has also endorsed Trump's reelection bid.\n\nBy courting Republicans early, Trump essentially created a sense of inevitably around his campaign among many GOP voters, a significant impediment for Haley.\n\nIn addition to South Carolina, where Trump remains popular with key voting blocs like evangelical Christians and traditional conservatives, the upcoming primaries on Super Tuesday feature several Southern states where the former president remains wildly popular with the GOP base: Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee.\n\nThe March 12 primaries in Georgia and Mississippi are also poised to solidify the former president's dominance in the race. DeSantis was once seen as a major threat to Trump's hold over the South, but the Florida governor didn't even make it to the South Carolina primary.\n\nLast August, Trump made an appeal to Alabama Republicans at a high-profile party dinner, using his 91 criminal charges to make the case that he was being targeted politically because he represented the party's best chance to win back the White House.\n\nAlabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville at the time echoed much of that message.\n\n\"He's had a tough week. We need to stand behind him,\" the conservative senator said after Trump pleaded not guilty to federal charges connected to his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. \"He needs encouragement. They're after him.\"\n\nBy lashing out against his pending court cases early, Trump got ahead of what could have been an issue for him in the early contests, helping him retain his support in GOP strongholds.\n\nThe evidence? Trump now leads Haley among potential GOP primary voters 81%-18%, according to the latest Morning Consult tracking poll .\n\nJump to"

      "text": "A growing number of Texas Republicans are calling on the governor to halt the execution of a death row inmate who says he's innocent\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) - In his five years as Texas' governor, Republican Greg Abbott has overseen the execution of nearly 50 prisoners while only once sparing a condemned man's life, after a victims' family asked him to do so.\n\nBut Abbott - who has proudly referred to the death penalty as \"Texas justice\" - has never confronted such intense pressure to halt a lethal injection like he is facing in the case of Rodney Reed, who is set to die this month for a 1996 killing despite new evidence that even a growing number of Republican legislators say raises serious questions about his guilt.\n\nOn Saturday, supporters of Reed held their biggest protest yet outside the governor's mansion, escalating a public campaign that now counts Beyoncé, Kim Kardashian and Oprah Winfrey among the celebrities who have urged Abbott to call off the Nov. 20 execution. So, too, has the European Union's ambassador to the US.\n\n\"Only thing I would tell him is, honestly, just look at the evidence,\" said Rodrick Reed, Rodney's brother.\n\nIt's unclear if the public pressure is making any impression on Abbott, who was a law and order state attorney general before he was elected governor. Abbott hasn't spoken publicly about Reed's case. Even Republican lawmakers who are close to the governor and have lobbied his office in recent days and weeks for a reprieve say they're in the dark about his thinking.\n\n\"They said the governor has heard about it and is taking a very deliberative and thoughtful analysis,\" Republican state Rep. Matt Krause said. \"But they didn't give me an indication one way or the other on which way he'd be.\"\n\nReed, now 51, was convicted of raping and strangling 19-year-old Stacy Stites while she made her way to work at a supermarket in Bastrop, a rural community about 30 miles southeast of Austin.\n\nReed has long maintained that Stites was killed by her fiance, former police officer Jimmy Fennell. Reed says Fennell was angry because Stites, who was white, was having an affair with Reed, who is black. In recent weeks, Reed's attorneys have presented affidavits that support his claims, including one by a former prison inmate who claims Fennell bragged about killing Stites and referred to Reed by a racial slur.\n\nReed's lawyers say other recent affidavits also corroborate the relationship between Stites and Reed. Fennell's attorney has said his client didn't kill Stites, and prosecutors maintain that they believe Reed is guilty.\n\nTexas remains the death penalty capital of the US even as executions nationwide hover at historic lows. Last year, about half of the 25 executions nationwide took place in Texas, which has put to death eight people so far this year.\n\nSupport for the death penalty has been declining in recent years, but in Texas, Abbott hasn't relaxed his position. A practicing Roman Catholic, Abbott breaks with the church on the Vatican's view that capital punishment can never be sanctioned, and efforts to scale back the types of crimes that carry the death penalty in Texas have stalled under his watch.\n\nOnly once has Abbott spared the life of a convicted killer shortly before the scheduled execution: Last year, he accepted a rare recommendation of clemency from Texas' parole board and commuted the sentence of Thomas \"Bart\" Whitaker, who fatally shot his mother and brother. Abbott did so after Whitaker's father, who was also shot, asked for mercy.\n\nIt's not the first time Abbott's decision-making has been in the spotlight over a high-profile death penalty case. While serving as Texas attorney general in 2011, Abbott ruled that a state forensic panel could not consider old evidence in the case against Cameron Todd Willingham, who was executed for a fire that killed his children but whose guilt remained in question after his death because the arson science used to convict him had since been debunked.\n\nIn a letter to Abbott this week, more than a dozen Republicans said that getting it wrong with Reed could \"erode public trust - not only in capital punishment, but in Texas justice itself.\"\n\n\"We have a lot of executions, right? We're Texas,\" said Republican state Rep. James White, who has served in the Legislature for nearly a decade. \"This probably is the first one I've directly reached out to the attorney general's office and the governor's office on. Not on the prospect that I believe that Mr. Reed is innocent. But I do believe there is a lot of information and evidence that does deserve to be vetted.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Both sides ignoring swing voters in hot Texas Senate race\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) - With Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr. already visiting the state and the president himself coming Monday, Ted Cruz is convening a veritable parade of Republican powerbrokers in the final weeks of the Texas Senate campaign to ensure Democrat Beto O'Rourke doesn't upset him.\n\nO'Rourke is countering with the opposite. He's blowing off the Democratic Party's political luminaries and instead cranking up the cool - rocking with Willie Nelson, securing shout-outs from star rappers and road-tripping with a 38-year-old Kennedy whose family name still has its mystique.\n\nWhile their approaches seem divergent, both candidates are opting to sacrifice one goal to accomplish another. They're trying to fire up the loyalists they see as key to victory, even if it means slighting moderates and undecided voters - energizing the right and the left while ignoring the middle.\n\n\"There's a common misconception that elections are mostly decided by so-called 'swing voters,'\" O'Rourke's campaign wrote in its \"Plan to Win.\" Cruz has for months noted that there are more Texas Republicans than Democrats, so if he guards against conservative complacency, he wins.\n\nBoth may be onto something. A recent Quinnipiac University poll that showed Cruz leading the race by 9 points also found that, among likely Texas voters who could name a Senate candidate, 96 percent had made up their minds.\n\n\"There are many of us who argue there is no middle and there are no swing voters left,\" said Texas Democratic consultant Colin Strother.\n\nO'Rourke hasn't completely written off non-Democratic voters, trumpeting bipartisanship at rallies. But he hasn't softened a platform of universal health care, gun control, decriminalizing marijuana and offering a $10,000-per-child federal grant for pre-kindergarten.\n\n\"Beto is saying, 'Hey look, you're all welcome here, but this is what I believe,'\" Strother said.\n\nAfter spending months hitting rural corners of the state that other Democrats gave up on decades ago, O'Rourke is now largely sticking to reliably blue venues such as college campuses, a Willie Nelson concert in Austin, a Houston show featuring rapper Bun B, Texas-Mexico border concerts and rallies and a Dallas sunrise jog.\n\nThe recent Austin City Limits festival was so choked with \"Beto for Texas\" T-shirts that it sometimes seemed the lanky Senate hopeful was headlining along with Metallica. And as R&B star Khalid won an American Music Award this month, he declared from the stage, \"Shout-out to Beto.\"\n\n\"He's representing everyone and not just a certain group of people,\" said 18-year-old Anoosha Adtani, who joined a line of students snaking out the door when O'Rourke appeared at the University of Texas at San Antonio.\n\nNot on the schedule are ex-Vice President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State John Kerry, though they've pitched in on Democratic campaigns elsewhere. Liberal powerhouses like Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also haven't stumped for O'Rourke.\n\nInstead, he's brought in Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III, who is enough of a greenhorn nationally that Cruz has made fun of him, laughing about how Kennedy drove O'Rourke between events and saying, \"It may be the first time in history anyone's ever asked a Kennedy to drive.\" That raised in peoples' minds the deadly, 1969 car crash on Chappaquiddick Island involving Sen. Ted Kennedy, Joe's great-uncle.\n\nWith his party controlling the White House and Congress, Cruz now touts a Republican status quo he attempted to torch as a tea party firebrand. In addition to the Trump administration's top brass, fellow Texan John Cornyn, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, hosted a Washington fundraiser for Cruz despite their past policy clashes. Fox News host Sean Hannity and ex-Texas Gov. Rick Perry, now Trump's secretary of energy, also campaigned for him this weekend.\n\nStill, George W. Bush lives in Dallas but isn't hitting the trail on Cruz's behalf, underscoring how he'd rather have Trump supporters than traditional, country-club Republicans.\n\nA three-term El Paso congressman, O'Rourke has stayed within striking distance despite his party not winning any of Texas' nearly 30 statewide offices for almost 25 years. His crunch-time strategy is to mobilize 5.5 million people who \"are very likely to vote for Beto if they vote, but who might not vote unless we contact them.\" That means prioritizing those who moved to Texas from other states and often settled in urban areas, and millennials who are \"the most diverse, most progressive generation in American history,\" according to his playbook.\n\nChairman James Dickey said the Republican Party of Texas has been similarly contacting new and past sympathetic voters for months, not just in the race's final weeks.\n\n\"We have a very clear process that has worked very well,\" Dickey said.\n\nTexas added 1.6-plus million registered voters since 2014's midterm elections, with young voters helping to power that surge. But Austin Republican analyst Derek Ryan noted that four years ago, only about 14 percent of the newly registered voters under 20 wound up casting ballots.\n\nO'Rourke, though, insists that courting youth is no fool's errand.\n\n\"Young people have been coming out to our events in record numbers,\" he said after the San Antonio event. \"I'm going where the leaders are.\"\n\n___\n\nSign up for \"Politics in Focus,\" a weekly newsletter showcasing the AP's best political reporting from around the country leading up to the midterm elections: https://bit.ly/2ICEr3D\n\nJump to"

      "text": "David Hogg and other activists are trying to drive a wedge between Trump and Ted Cruz in one of the tightest Senate races\n\nSen. Ted Cruz and President Donald Trump have had a tumultuous relationship, to say the least.\n\nBut that is a history both men would like to forget. They need each other now, as Cruz faces an unexpectedly competitive challenge to his Texas seat in a race that could determine party control over the US Senate.\n\nSo Democratic activists are doing their best to remind Texas Republicans that it wasn't long ago that the president declared Cruz a \"maniac,\" questioned his American citizenship and religious beliefs, promoted conspiracies about his father, threatened to \"spill the beans\" on his wife, Heidi (and attacked her physical appearance), and nicknamed him \"Lyin' Ted\" - not to mention asserting that Cruz had done \"absolutely nothing\" for his state.\n\nAntonio Arellano, a Texan activist and Latino community organizer, recently teamed up with David Hogg, a survivor of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and a few other activists to raise money for an idea Arellano hatched: billboard trucks featuring Trump's tweets attacking Cruz.\n\nAfter the group raised $9,760 through a GoFundMe page, they stopped accepting donations and prepared for the rollout, The Washington Post reported . The trucks carrying the billboards will hit the road in the red state on Thursday, Arellano tweeted last week.\n\nDemocrats are also spreading footage of Cruz's attacks on Trump from when he was a presidential candidate, which included calling Trump a \"pathological liar,\" \"utterly amoral,\" a \"narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,\" and a \"serial philanderer\" during the 2016 campaign.\n\nOn Tuesday, Neera Tanden, president of the progressive think tank Center for American Progress, shared a video of the ultra-conservative senator calling the president a \"sniveling coward\" in March 2016, while insisting that Trump wouldn't be the party's presidential nominee.\n\n\"Everyone in Texas needs to see this,\" she wrote.\n\nSince the election, relations between the two men have made a remarkable recovery. Trump announced via tweet last month that he'll hold a rally for Cruz in \" the biggest stadium in Texas we can find\" and called the senator's Democratic opponent, Rep. Beto O'Rourke, \"a disaster for Texas.\"\n\nCruz, who was outraised two-to-one by O'Rourke last quarter, is also aggressively courting wealthy donors and conservative groups to send financial support to his campaign.\n\nLast year, Trump described his evolution with Cruz as \" like, dislike like .\"\n\nThe relationship between the two has indeed gone from friendly, to nasty, to apparently amicable again. While the men avoided taking shots at each other in the first months of their respective campaigns for the presidency, their relationship soured as the GOP primary narrowed.\n\n\"This man is a pathological liar. He doesn't know the difference between truth and lies,\" Cruz said after Trump alleged that Cruz's father was involved in President John F. Kennedy's assassination. \"In a pattern that is straight out of a psychology text book, he accuses everyone of lying.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "TikTokers tried to prove that snow in Texas was 'fake' as weather conspiracy theories ran wild online\n\nWhile Texans sought warmth and electricity last week, some baselessly questioned whether the snowfall in their state was real.\n\n\"Look at this government snow right here,\" one man says in a TikTok video while crumbling up the snow in his hand. In another video , a woman uses a blowdryer on a snowball. \"No drip,\" she says, appearing to claim that because the snow didn't melt to liquid when hit with heat, it was fake.\n\nSeveral people have died during Winter Storm Uri , which brought snowfall and record-low temperatures to Texas. Because the state is accustomed to its warm climate, the state's energy infrastructure was not prepared for the storm. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) rolled out blackouts to protect the state's power grid, cutting off electricity for millions of people for days.\n\nConspiracy theories of outlandish proportions spread online - especially in far-right online spaces, including Telegram channels run by promoters of QAnon, the baseless far-right conspiracy theory alleging the existence of a \"deep state\" cabal of human traffickers made up of Democrats and celebrities.\n\nThe claims included the false allegations that the snow in Texas was fake and somehow engineered by President Joe Biden and that Bill Gates \"blocking the sun\" caused the bizarre weather. Many of these ideas made their way to TikTok , where people held flames to snowballs to \"prove\" that the snow was \"fake.\" In actuality, due to a process called sublimation, some snow will turn to a gas rather than a liquid when heated in certain temperatures, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .\n\nGoogle search trends throughout the week demonstrate the scope of this misinformation. On February 17, the peak of the crisis, \"fake snow\" was a top related-search-query for \"Texas snow.\" The next day, \"bill gates sun\" was a breakout related-query, meaning that the searches grew by more than 5000%.\n\nIn addition to conspiracy theorists on social media, traditional right-wing media outlets are promoting misinformation about the cause of the storm, blaming green energy.\n\nYotam Ophir, an assistant professor at the University of Buffalo who researches media persuasion, said people will \"abuse the uncertainty\" of an emergency situation \"in order to promote their agendas.\"\n\nThe fringe far-right conspiracy theory claiming that Bill Gates is trying to \"block the sun\" has been reimagined by climate-change deniers in light of the Texas catastrophe. Gates donated money to a Harvard climate experiment called SCoPEx , which is seeking ways to temper the sun in an effort to slow climate change. Gates' donation to the experiment, as well as other climate-change efforts, has made him a frequent scapegoat in the world of climate-science denialism.\n\nOne Telegram channel falsely purporting to be Thomas McInerney, a conspiracy theorist and retired United States Air Force general, referenced the bogus claim in a February 18 message to 164,460 subscribers. The post, which was forwarded to other channels and viewed more than 150,000 times, falsely claimed that the situation in Texas \"was a planned attack.\" McInerney, a Trump supporter, has previously pushed the claim that COVID-19 was a \"biological attack,\" but Defense News has reported that the account does not belong to the retired general.\n\nOn a Telegram channel popular among QAnon supporters, the idea that the Texas blackouts were \"not a coincidence\" also reached hundreds of thousands of viewers.\n\nAnother conspiracy theory spreading mostly on Facebook alleged that Biden had somehow manipulated the weather to cause the storm in Texas.\n\nThe theory appeared to originate from a post by conspiracy theorist Scott L. Biddle, as reported by PolitiFact , the fact-checking website run by the Poynter Institute. Facebook, which has announced increased efforts in cracking down on misinformation, labelled the post as false. Another post by Biddle questions whether the snow in Texas is \"real.\" The February 16 post does not have a false information label and was shared 441 times as of Friday. Facebook declined to comment.\n\nBrian Southwell, senior director of the Science in the Public Sphere Program in the Center for Communication Science at RTI International, a nonprofit research institute, told Insider that misinformation can thrive when \"people are worried or concerned for their own well-being,\" leading them to seek answers, and find information that is sometimes inaccurate.\n\nOne's social-media feed is often the first destination in those moments. Social-media feeds are curated not only by interest and social circle, but also by platform algorithms knowing what kind of content you're likely to share. \"A vacuum can be a good recipe for a rumor to flourish,\" said Southwell, who is also an editor of the book \"Misinformation and Mass Audiences.\"\n\nWith climate-related disasters, misinformation is often weaponized politically, Ophir, the University of Buffalo professor, told Insider.\n\nJust as the COVID-19 pandemic was downplayed by those with an incentive to do so , the Texas crisis - which is largely due to climate change, an already intensely politicized issue - has inspired a new wave of science denial.\n\nBeyond the ludicrous ideas spreading on social media, one massive piece of misinformation is being promoted by right-wing politicians and media outlets. Prominent Republicans, Fox News hosts, and conservative websites have pushed the idea that wind and solar energy are to blame for Texas' disaster.\n\nOn his Fox News show, Tucker Carlson promoted the idea that green energy caused the failures of the state's power grid. Many Texas Republicans also blamed the electricity blackouts on frozen wind turbines .\n\nBut the majority of Texas energy providers that went offline used fossil fuels , not green energy. The right-wing narrative has also blamed the Green New Deal for the disaster, though no legislation from that leftist congressional climate-change proposal has passed.\n\nClimate-change denial has even played a role in conspiracy theories spread by Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , who is known for her support of QAnon . Greene falsely claimed on Facebook in 2018 that the Camp Fires, the deadliest series of wildfires in California's history , were caused by lasers in space that were paid for by wealthy Jews. Scientists have said that the series of wildfires were partly fueled by climate change .\n\nOphir said that dramatic events like natural disasters or the pandemic lead many to place blame on others. \"Scapegoating is a big part of dealing with uncertainty and trying to make sense of confusing or negative events,\" Ophir said.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "How the Texas GOP has grown more and more conservative\n\nBy\n\nSergio Martínez-Beltrán | The Texas Newsroom\n\nThe Texas Republican Party has gotten more conservative over the years. Immigration policies once pushed by top GOP officials now seem moderate. Party leaders crack down on dissension in their ranks.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The Republican Party of Texas has changed. The party that embraced the Bush family has now become a place where the Bushes are considered too moderate. Texas Republicans have taken a harder stance on immigration, and the party punishes dissension in its own ranks. With the 2024 presidential election looming, the Texas Newsroom's Sergio Martinez-Beltran reports on the party's evolution. SERGIO MARTINEZ-BELTRAN, BYLINE: Let's start back in 2012, when former Texas Governor Rick Perry was running to be the Republican nominee for president. During a Fox News debate, Perry touted his actions on the border and defended a bill he'd signed allowing undocumented Texas students to pay in-state tuition at public universities and colleges. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK PERRY: But if you say that we should not educate children who have come into our state for no other reason than they've been brought there by no fault of their own, I don't think you have a heart. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Just over a decade later, it's hard to imagine the Republican Party of Texas supporting a policy like that. Just ask Matt Rinaldi, the party's chairman since 2021. MATT RINALDI: No, that was a very bad idea. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Rinaldi is part of the Republican Party's move to the far right, which started around 2010 in Texas with the rise of the Tea Party movement. RINALDI: The party 10 years ago was effectively a cheerleading society for Republican elected officials. It didn't take positions on tough issues for fear that they might offend some of those elected officials. And my question always was, why? MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Part of Texas' rightward shift has been caused by top Republicans like Rinaldi going after old-school Republicans who disagree with them. One example, Rinaldi criticized and campaigned against the Texas House speaker for allowing the impeachment of fellow Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton to move forward. Rinaldi also targeted Republicans who don't support school vouchers, one of Governor Greg Abbott's top priorities. RINALDI: You have the brand that those elected officials depend on in order to get elected. You should exert some of the leverage you have to make sure that the government operates under the principles and values that your members share. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: But the shift has also had implications nationwide, says Mark Jones, a professor of political science at Rice University. MARK JONES: Texas has an outsized impact on national policy, first and foremost, because of its size. It's much larger than other red states. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Jones says Texas has a big influence on the legal system. Embattled Attorney General Ken Paxton has gone after the Obama and Biden administrations over healthcare, reproductive rights and immigration. JONES: During the Obama administration, Texas always was in the lead because it had the advantage of being a large red state where the governor, the attorney general had little fear of Democrats actually taking control. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Texas has sued the federal government over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, best known as DACA, and it challenged President Biden's decision to end the Remain in Mexico policy, which required non-Mexican citizens seeking asylum to go back to Mexico while their cases are processed. But the evolution of the party has rattled many of its members who say it's become less inclusive and more exclusive. ARTEMIO MUNIZ: You would think that these guys that have been to every meeting and every seminar possible on growing the party would understand that they should be focused on growing the party in the Hispanic community. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Artemio Muniz is the president of the Texas Federation of Hispanic Republicans. His group left the Texas GOP nearly a decade ago over the party's anti-immigration position, including its support for policies Muniz says would create de facto mass deportations. MUNIZ: They inherited a party that can win without the Hispanic vote, and so they're resting on that. They know that the strategy to just kind of hold the status quo, it can win, and it can win for the next few years. But pretty soon you're going to have to do something about getting new voters in. And right now, it sucks. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Muniz says the party used to be better at courting Hispanic voters, particularly during the Governor Rick Perry years. But party chair Rinaldi says the critics are upset at the fact that the Texas GOP has become more influential than ever. This means that if an incumbent crosses the party, chances are that politician would face a primary opponent and lose. That's exactly what happened on Super Tuesday. Nine Republican incumbents in the legislature targeted by Abbott or Paxton lost their seats. Eight more were pushed into runoffs. For NPR News, I'm Sergio Martinez-Beltran in Austin.

But party chair Rinaldi says the critics are upset at the fact that the Texas GOP has become more influential than ever. This means that if an incumbent crosses the party, chances are that politician would face a primary opponent and lose. That's exactly what happened on Super Tuesday. Nine Republican incumbents in the legislature targeted by Abbott or Paxton lost their seats. Eight more were pushed into runoffs. For NPR News, I'm Sergio Martinez-Beltran in Austin.

The party that embraced the Bush family has now become a place where the Bushes are considered too moderate. Texas Republicans have taken a harder stance on immigration, and the party punishes dissension in its own ranks. With the 2024 presidential election looming, the Texas Newsroom's Sergio Martinez-Beltran reports on the party's evolution. SERGIO MARTINEZ-BELTRAN, BYLINE: Let's start back in 2012, when former Texas Governor Rick Perry was running to be the Republican nominee for president. During a Fox News debate, Perry touted his actions on the border and defended a bill he'd signed allowing undocumented Texas students to pay in-state tuition at public universities and colleges. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK PERRY: But if you say that we should not educate children who have come into our state for no other reason than they've been brought there by no fault of their own, I don't think you have a heart. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Just over a decade later, it's hard to imagine the Republican Party of Texas supporting a policy like that. Just ask Matt Rinaldi, the party's chairman since 2021. MATT RINALDI: No, that was a very bad idea. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Rinaldi is part of the Republican Party's move to the far right, which started around 2010 in Texas with the rise of the Tea Party movement. RINALDI: The party 10 years ago was effectively a cheerleading society for Republican elected officials. It didn't take positions on tough issues for fear that they might offend some of those elected officials. And my question always was, why? MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Part of Texas' rightward shift has been caused by top Republicans like Rinaldi going after old-school Republicans who disagree with them. One example, Rinaldi criticized and campaigned against the Texas House speaker for allowing the impeachment of fellow Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton to move forward. Rinaldi also targeted Republicans who don't support school vouchers, one of Governor Greg Abbott's top priorities. RINALDI: You have the brand that those elected officials depend on in order to get elected. You should exert some of the leverage you have to make sure that the government operates under the principles and values that your members share. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: But the shift has also had implications nationwide, says Mark Jones, a professor of political science at Rice University. MARK JONES: Texas has an outsized impact on national policy, first and foremost, because of its size. It's much larger than other red states. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Jones says Texas has a big influence on the legal system. Embattled Attorney General Ken Paxton has gone after the Obama and Biden administrations over healthcare, reproductive rights and immigration. JONES: During the Obama administration, Texas always was in the lead because it had the advantage of being a large red state where the governor, the attorney general had little fear of Democrats actually taking control. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Texas has sued the federal government over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, best known as DACA, and it challenged President Biden's decision to end the Remain in Mexico policy, which required non-Mexican citizens seeking asylum to go back to Mexico while their cases are processed. But the evolution of the party has rattled many of its members who say it's become less inclusive and more exclusive. ARTEMIO MUNIZ: You would think that these guys that have been to every meeting and every seminar possible on growing the party would understand that they should be focused on growing the party in the Hispanic community. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Artemio Muniz is the president of the Texas Federation of Hispanic Republicans. His group left the Texas GOP nearly a decade ago over the party's anti-immigration position, including its support for policies Muniz says would create de facto mass deportations. MUNIZ: They inherited a party that can win without the Hispanic vote, and so they're resting on that. They know that the strategy to just kind of hold the status quo, it can win, and it can win for the next few years. But pretty soon you're going to have to do something about getting new voters in. And right now, it sucks. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Muniz says the party used to be better at courting Hispanic voters, particularly during the Governor Rick Perry years.

MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Texas has sued the federal government over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, best known as DACA, and it challenged President Biden's decision to end the Remain in Mexico policy, which required non-Mexican citizens seeking asylum to go back to Mexico while their cases are processed. But the evolution of the party has rattled many of its members who say it's become less inclusive and more exclusive. ARTEMIO MUNIZ: You would think that these guys that have been to every meeting and every seminar possible on growing the party would understand that they should be focused on growing the party in the Hispanic community. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Artemio Muniz is the president of the Texas Federation of Hispanic Republicans. His group left the Texas GOP nearly a decade ago over the party's anti-immigration position, including its support for policies Muniz says would create de facto mass deportations. MUNIZ: They inherited a party that can win without the Hispanic vote, and so they're resting on that. They know that the strategy to just kind of hold the status quo, it can win, and it can win for the next few years. But pretty soon you're going to have to do something about getting new voters in. And right now, it sucks. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Muniz says the party used to be better at courting Hispanic voters, particularly during the Governor Rick Perry years. But party chair Rinaldi says the critics are upset at the fact that the Texas GOP has become more influential than ever. This means that if an incumbent crosses the party, chances are that politician would face a primary opponent and lose. That's exactly what happened on Super Tuesday. Nine Republican incumbents in the legislature targeted by Abbott or Paxton lost their seats. Eight more were pushed into runoffs. For NPR News, I'm Sergio Martinez-Beltran in Austin.

Just ask Matt Rinaldi, the party's chairman since 2021. MATT RINALDI: No, that was a very bad idea. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Rinaldi is part of the Republican Party's move to the far right, which started around 2010 in Texas with the rise of the Tea Party movement. RINALDI: The party 10 years ago was effectively a cheerleading society for Republican elected officials. It didn't take positions on tough issues for fear that they might offend some of those elected officials. And my question always was, why? MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Part of Texas' rightward shift has been caused by top Republicans like Rinaldi going after old-school Republicans who disagree with them. One example, Rinaldi criticized and campaigned against the Texas House speaker for allowing the impeachment of fellow Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton to move forward. Rinaldi also targeted Republicans who don't support school vouchers, one of Governor Greg Abbott's top priorities. RINALDI: You have the brand that those elected officials depend on in order to get elected. You should exert some of the leverage you have to make sure that the government operates under the principles and values that your members share. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: But the shift has also had implications nationwide, says Mark Jones, a professor of political science at Rice University. MARK JONES: Texas has an outsized impact on national policy, first and foremost, because of its size. It's much larger than other red states.

They know that the strategy to just kind of hold the status quo, it can win, and it can win for the next few years. But pretty soon you're going to have to do something about getting new voters in. And right now, it sucks. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Muniz says the party used to be better at courting Hispanic voters, particularly during the Governor Rick Perry years. But party chair Rinaldi says the critics are upset at the fact that the Texas GOP has become more influential than ever. This means that if an incumbent crosses the party, chances are that politician would face a primary opponent and lose. That's exactly what happened on Super Tuesday. Nine Republican incumbents in the legislature targeted by Abbott or Paxton lost their seats. Eight more were pushed into runoffs. For NPR News, I'm Sergio Martinez-Beltran in Austin.

You should exert some of the leverage you have to make sure that the government operates under the principles and values that your members share. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: But the shift has also had implications nationwide, says Mark Jones, a professor of political science at Rice University. MARK JONES: Texas has an outsized impact on national policy, first and foremost, because of its size. It's much larger than other red states. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Jones says Texas has a big influence on the legal system. Embattled Attorney General Ken Paxton has gone after the Obama and Biden administrations over healthcare, reproductive rights and immigration. JONES: During the Obama administration, Texas always was in the lead because it had the advantage of being a large red state where the governor, the attorney general had little fear of Democrats actually taking control. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Texas has sued the federal government over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, best known as DACA, and it challenged President Biden's decision to end the Remain in Mexico policy, which required non-Mexican citizens seeking asylum to go back to Mexico while their cases are processed. But the evolution of the party has rattled many of its members who say it's become less inclusive and more exclusive. ARTEMIO MUNIZ: You would think that these guys that have been to every meeting and every seminar possible on growing the party would understand that they should be focused on growing the party in the Hispanic community.

And right now, it sucks. MARTINEZ-BELTRAN: Muniz says the party used to be better at courting Hispanic voters, particularly during the Governor Rick Perry years. But party chair Rinaldi says the critics are upset at the fact that the Texas GOP has become more influential than ever. This means that if an incumbent crosses the party, chances are that politician would face a primary opponent and lose. That's exactly what happened on Super Tuesday. Nine Republican incumbents in the legislature targeted by Abbott or Paxton lost their seats. Eight more were pushed into runoffs. For NPR News, I'm Sergio Martinez-Beltran in Austin.

Democrats haven't won a statewide election in Texas for decades, despite many attempts to \"turn Texas blue.\"\n\nA MARTINEZ, HOST: In Texas, early voting is well underway ahead of Tuesday's primary election. Democrats from around the country, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have been campaigning there. And the New York congresswoman recently repeated a long-held political prediction. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: Texas turning blue is inevitable... (CHEERING) OCASIO-CORTEZ: ...Inevitable. The only question is when, Texas. (CHEERING) OCASIO-CORTEZ: The only question is when. MARTINEZ: But NPR's Wade Goodwyn asks, is that the only question? WADE GOODWYN, BYLINE: How long has it been since a Democrat was elected statewide in Texas? I'll give you a hint. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANN RICHARDS: Poor George. He can't help it. (LAUGHTER) RICHARDS: He was born with a silver foot in his mouth. (LAUGHTER) GOODWYN: That was Ann Richards at the Democratic National Convention in 1988, joking about the first President Bush, George H.W. Three years later, she was elected Texas governor. But after she was beaten for reelection by the joke victim's son, George W. Bush, in 1994, not another Democrat has been elected statewide. No other state has gone longer. MATT RINALDI: We've been hearing since 2002, with the dream team of Ron Kirk and Tony Sanchez, that Democrats were going to take the state, and they didn't do it then. GOODWYN: Matt Rinaldi is the chairman of the Texas Republican Party. RINALDI: And then we heard again with Wendy Davis that Democrats were going to take the state, and they didn't do it then. And then we heard with Beto O'Rourke, and they didn't that time, either. So we've been hearing this over a period of about 20 years, and it's never played out. GOODWYN: It's not that there hasn't been progress for Texas Democrats. In the 2014 governor's race that Rinaldi mentioned, Democrat Wendy Davis was routed by Republican Greg Abbott by more than 20 points. Four years ago in the U.S. Senate race, Beto O'Rourke only lost to Ted Cruz by just over 2 1/2 points - quite promising, if nonetheless disappointing for Democrats. But last year, Joe Biden lost Texas to President Trump by nearly six points. That's closer than the margin Trump beat Hillary Clinton by in 2016. But in politics, it's still getting stomped. Here's GOP chairman Rinaldi again. RINALDI: Political relocations are greater than ever. We're actually importing Republican voters from other states - California and New York - coming here. And we saw that reflected in the Ted Cruz race. Ted Cruz won a majority of transplants, while Beto won a majority of native Texans. GOODWYN: Republicans have made progress with Hispanic voters on the Texas border. In the last election in both McAllen and Laredo, President Trump improved his share of Hispanic voters by more than 23 points, though he still lost those towns. While Democratic activists were calling Hispanic voters on the phone during the last election because of the coronavirus, Republicans were going door to door, connecting to conservative Hispanic Catholics and evangelicals - generations who may have well grown up hunting birds with friends and family along the largely rural border. Joanne Green is a political science professor at TCU. JOANNE GREEN: Issues like abortion, definitely Second Amendment issues, economic issues, oil and gas industry - many of them, when asked by academics, identify as white - so very much part of the Texas culture. COLIN ALLRED: Well, listen, I understand some of the skepticism around Texas turning blue. GOODWYN: Colin Allred is a Democratic congressman in Dallas. Allred says that although Texas hasn't turned blue as fast as was predicted, he still believes it's inevitable that there are a lot more liberal Hispanics in the cities than conservative Hispanics along the border. ALLRED: Then we have to remember that these are gerrymandered districts that were drawn so that they could not be flipped. And it is true in the most recent round of redistricting, both at the congressional level and the State House level, that we're not going to have as many competitive elections early on in the decade. But that happened last decade as well, and later in the decade we saw all of these districts flipping. GOODWYN: Early voting in the Texas primaries have started. The latest fundraising statistics from Transparency USA show Texas Republicans outraising Texas Democrats by 3 to 1. Beto O'Rourke, who's running for governor against incumbent Greg Abbott, is currently down by seven to 10 percentage points, according to the latest polls. But there's still a long way to go. The November elections this year and then again in 2024, will tell us a lot. Wade Goodwyn, NPR News, Dallas. (SOUNDBITE OF ERNESTO JIMENEZ'S \"MAR EN CALMA\") Copyright © 2022 NPR.

COLIN ALLRED: Well, listen, I understand some of the skepticism around Texas turning blue. GOODWYN: Colin Allred is a Democratic congressman in Dallas. Allred says that although Texas hasn't turned blue as fast as was predicted, he still believes it's inevitable that there are a lot more liberal Hispanics in the cities than conservative Hispanics along the border. ALLRED: Then we have to remember that these are gerrymandered districts that were drawn so that they could not be flipped. And it is true in the most recent round of redistricting, both at the congressional level and the State House level, that we're not going to have as many competitive elections early on in the decade. But that happened last decade as well, and later in the decade we saw all of these districts flipping. GOODWYN: Early voting in the Texas primaries have started. The latest fundraising statistics from Transparency USA show Texas Republicans outraising Texas Democrats by 3 to 1. Beto O'Rourke, who's running for governor against incumbent Greg Abbott, is currently down by seven to 10 percentage points, according to the latest polls. But there's still a long way to go. The November elections this year and then again in 2024, will tell us a lot. Wade Goodwyn, NPR News, Dallas. (SOUNDBITE OF ERNESTO JIMENEZ'S \"MAR EN CALMA\") Copyright © 2022 NPR.

(CHEERING) OCASIO-CORTEZ: ...Inevitable. The only question is when, Texas. (CHEERING) OCASIO-CORTEZ: The only question is when. MARTINEZ: But NPR's Wade Goodwyn asks, is that the only question? WADE GOODWYN, BYLINE: How long has it been since a Democrat was elected statewide in Texas? I'll give you a hint. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANN RICHARDS: Poor George. He can't help it. (LAUGHTER) RICHARDS: He was born with a silver foot in his mouth. (LAUGHTER) GOODWYN: That was Ann Richards at the Democratic National Convention in 1988, joking about the first President Bush, George H.W. Three years later, she was elected Texas governor. But after she was beaten for reelection by the joke victim's son, George W. Bush, in 1994, not another Democrat has been elected statewide. No other state has gone longer. MATT RINALDI: We've been hearing since 2002, with the dream team of Ron Kirk and Tony Sanchez, that Democrats were going to take the state, and they didn't do it then. GOODWYN: Matt Rinaldi is the chairman of the Texas Republican Party. RINALDI: And then we heard again with Wendy Davis that Democrats were going to take the state, and they didn't do it then. And then we heard with Beto O'Rourke, and they didn't that time, either. So we've been hearing this over a period of about 20 years, and it's never played out. GOODWYN: It's not that there hasn't been progress for Texas Democrats. In the 2014 governor's race that Rinaldi mentioned, Democrat Wendy Davis was routed by Republican Greg Abbott by more than 20 points. Four years ago in the U.S. Senate race, Beto O'Rourke only lost to Ted Cruz by just over 2 1/2 points - quite promising, if nonetheless disappointing for Democrats. But last year, Joe Biden lost Texas to President Trump by nearly six points. That's closer than the margin Trump beat Hillary Clinton by in 2016. But in politics, it's still getting stomped. Here's GOP chairman Rinaldi again. RINALDI: Political relocations are greater than ever. We're actually importing Republican voters from other states - California and New York - coming here. And we saw that reflected in the Ted Cruz race. Ted Cruz won a majority of transplants, while Beto won a majority of native Texans. GOODWYN: Republicans have made progress with Hispanic voters on the Texas border. In the last election in both McAllen and Laredo, President Trump improved his share of Hispanic voters by more than 23 points, though he still lost those towns. While Democratic activists were calling Hispanic voters on the phone during the last election because of the coronavirus, Republicans were going door to door, connecting to conservative Hispanic Catholics and evangelicals - generations who may have well grown up hunting birds with friends and family along the largely rural border.

While Democratic activists were calling Hispanic voters on the phone during the last election because of the coronavirus, Republicans were going door to door, connecting to conservative Hispanic Catholics and evangelicals - generations who may have well grown up hunting birds with friends and family along the largely rural border. Joanne Green is a political science professor at TCU. JOANNE GREEN: Issues like abortion, definitely Second Amendment issues, economic issues, oil and gas industry - many of them, when asked by academics, identify as white - so very much part of the Texas culture. COLIN ALLRED: Well, listen, I understand some of the skepticism around Texas turning blue. GOODWYN: Colin Allred is a Democratic congressman in Dallas. Allred says that although Texas hasn't turned blue as fast as was predicted, he still believes it's inevitable that there are a lot more liberal Hispanics in the cities than conservative Hispanics along the border. ALLRED: Then we have to remember that these are gerrymandered districts that were drawn so that they could not be flipped. And it is true in the most recent round of redistricting, both at the congressional level and the State House level, that we're not going to have as many competitive elections early on in the decade. But that happened last decade as well, and later in the decade we saw all of these districts flipping. GOODWYN: Early voting in the Texas primaries have started. The latest fundraising statistics from Transparency USA show Texas Republicans outraising Texas Democrats by 3 to 1. Beto O'Rourke, who's running for governor against incumbent Greg Abbott, is currently down by seven to 10 percentage points, according to the latest polls. But there's still a long way to go. The November elections this year and then again in 2024, will tell us a lot. Wade Goodwyn, NPR News, Dallas. (SOUNDBITE OF ERNESTO JIMENEZ'S \"MAR EN CALMA\") Copyright © 2022 NPR.

WADE GOODWYN, BYLINE: How long has it been since a Democrat was elected statewide in Texas? I'll give you a hint. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANN RICHARDS: Poor George. He can't help it. (LAUGHTER) RICHARDS: He was born with a silver foot in his mouth. (LAUGHTER) GOODWYN: That was Ann Richards at the Democratic National Convention in 1988, joking about the first President Bush, George H.W. Three years later, she was elected Texas governor. But after she was beaten for reelection by the joke victim's son, George W. Bush, in 1994, not another Democrat has been elected statewide. No other state has gone longer. MATT RINALDI: We've been hearing since 2002, with the dream team of Ron Kirk and Tony Sanchez, that Democrats were going to take the state, and they didn't do it then. GOODWYN: Matt Rinaldi is the chairman of the Texas Republican Party. RINALDI: And then we heard again with Wendy Davis that Democrats were going to take the state, and they didn't do it then. And then we heard with Beto O'Rourke, and they didn't that time, either. So we've been hearing this over a period of about 20 years, and it's never played out. GOODWYN: It's not that there hasn't been progress for Texas Democrats. In the 2014 governor's race that Rinaldi mentioned, Democrat Wendy Davis was routed by Republican Greg Abbott by more than 20 points. Four years ago in the U.S. Senate race, Beto O'Rourke only lost to Ted Cruz by just over 2 1/2 points - quite promising, if nonetheless disappointing for Democrats. But last year, Joe Biden lost Texas to President Trump by nearly six points. That's closer than the margin Trump beat Hillary Clinton by in 2016. But in politics, it's still getting stomped. Here's GOP chairman Rinaldi again. RINALDI: Political relocations are greater than ever. We're actually importing Republican voters from other states - California and New York - coming here. And we saw that reflected in the Ted Cruz race. Ted Cruz won a majority of transplants, while Beto won a majority of native Texans. GOODWYN: Republicans have made progress with Hispanic voters on the Texas border.

And it is true in the most recent round of redistricting, both at the congressional level and the State House level, that we're not going to have as many competitive elections early on in the decade. But that happened last decade as well, and later in the decade we saw all of these districts flipping. GOODWYN: Early voting in the Texas primaries have started. The latest fundraising statistics from Transparency USA show Texas Republicans outraising Texas Democrats by 3 to 1. Beto O'Rourke, who's running for governor against incumbent Greg Abbott, is currently down by seven to 10 percentage points, according to the latest polls. But there's still a long way to go. The November elections this year and then again in 2024, will tell us a lot. Wade Goodwyn, NPR News, Dallas. (SOUNDBITE OF ERNESTO JIMENEZ'S \"MAR EN CALMA\") Copyright © 2022 NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANN RICHARDS: Poor George. He can't help it. (LAUGHTER) RICHARDS: He was born with a silver foot in his mouth. (LAUGHTER) GOODWYN: That was Ann Richards at the Democratic National Convention in 1988, joking about the first President Bush, George H.W. Three years later, she was elected Texas governor. But after she was beaten for reelection by the joke victim's son, George W. Bush, in 1994, not another Democrat has been elected statewide. No other state has gone longer. MATT RINALDI: We've been hearing since 2002, with the dream team of Ron Kirk and Tony Sanchez, that Democrats were going to take the state, and they didn't do it then. GOODWYN: Matt Rinaldi is the chairman of the Texas Republican Party. RINALDI: And then we heard again with Wendy Davis that Democrats were going to take the state, and they didn't do it then. And then we heard with Beto O'Rourke, and they didn't that time, either. So we've been hearing this over a period of about 20 years, and it's never played out. GOODWYN: It's not that there hasn't been progress for Texas Democrats. In the 2014 governor's race that Rinaldi mentioned, Democrat Wendy Davis was routed by Republican Greg Abbott by more than 20 points. Four years ago in the U.S. Senate race, Beto O'Rourke only lost to Ted Cruz by just over 2 1/2 points - quite promising, if nonetheless disappointing for Democrats. But last year, Joe Biden lost Texas to President Trump by nearly six points. That's closer than the margin Trump beat Hillary Clinton by in 2016. But in politics, it's still getting stomped. Here's GOP chairman Rinaldi again. RINALDI: Political relocations are greater than ever. We're actually importing Republican voters from other states - California and New York - coming here. And we saw that reflected in the Ted Cruz race. Ted Cruz won a majority of transplants, while Beto won a majority of native Texans. GOODWYN: Republicans have made progress with Hispanic voters on the Texas border. In the last election in both McAllen and Laredo, President Trump improved his share of Hispanic voters by more than 23 points, though he still lost those towns. While Democratic activists were calling Hispanic voters on the phone during the last election because of the coronavirus, Republicans were going door to door, connecting to conservative Hispanic Catholics and evangelicals - generations who may have well grown up hunting birds with friends and family along the largely rural border. Joanne Green is a political science professor at TCU. JOANNE GREEN: Issues like abortion, definitely Second Amendment issues, economic issues, oil and gas industry - many of them, when asked by academics, identify as white - so very much part of the Texas culture. COLIN ALLRED: Well, listen, I understand some of the skepticism around Texas turning blue. GOODWYN: Colin Allred is a Democratic congressman in Dallas. Allred says that although Texas hasn't turned blue as fast as was predicted, he still believes it's inevitable that there are a lot more liberal Hispanics in the cities than conservative Hispanics along the border.

But last year, Joe Biden lost Texas to President Trump by nearly six points. That's closer than the margin Trump beat Hillary Clinton by in 2016. But in politics, it's still getting stomped. Here's GOP chairman Rinaldi again. RINALDI: Political relocations are greater than ever. We're actually importing Republican voters from other states - California and New York - coming here. And we saw that reflected in the Ted Cruz race. Ted Cruz won a majority of transplants, while Beto won a majority of native Texans. GOODWYN: Republicans have made progress with Hispanic voters on the Texas border. In the last election in both McAllen and Laredo, President Trump improved his share of Hispanic voters by more than 23 points, though he still lost those towns. While Democratic activists were calling Hispanic voters on the phone during the last election because of the coronavirus, Republicans were going door to door, connecting to conservative Hispanic Catholics and evangelicals - generations who may have well grown up hunting birds with friends and family along the largely rural border. Joanne Green is a political science professor at TCU. JOANNE GREEN: Issues like abortion, definitely Second Amendment issues, economic issues, oil and gas industry - many of them, when asked by academics, identify as white - so very much part of the Texas culture. COLIN ALLRED: Well, listen, I understand some of the skepticism around Texas turning blue. GOODWYN: Colin Allred is a Democratic congressman in Dallas. Allred says that although Texas hasn't turned blue as fast as was predicted, he still believes it's inevitable that there are a lot more liberal Hispanics in the cities than conservative Hispanics along the border. ALLRED: Then we have to remember that these are gerrymandered districts that were drawn so that they could not be flipped. And it is true in the most recent round of redistricting, both at the congressional level and the State House level, that we're not going to have as many competitive elections early on in the decade. But that happened last decade as well, and later in the decade we saw all of these districts flipping. GOODWYN: Early voting in the Texas primaries have started. The latest fundraising statistics from Transparency USA show Texas Republicans outraising Texas Democrats by 3 to 1. Beto O'Rourke, who's running for governor against incumbent Greg Abbott, is currently down by seven to 10 percentage points, according to the latest polls. But there's still a long way to go. The November elections this year and then again in 2024, will tell us a lot. Wade Goodwyn, NPR News, Dallas. (SOUNDBITE OF ERNESTO JIMENEZ'S \"MAR EN CALMA\") Copyright © 2022 NPR.

While Democratic activists were calling Hispanic voters on the phone during the last election because of the coronavirus, Republicans were going door to door, connecting to conservative Hispanic Catholics and evangelicals - generations who may have well grown up hunting birds with friends and family along the largely rural border. Joanne Green is a political science professor at TCU. JOANNE GREEN: Issues like abortion, definitely Second Amendment issues, economic issues, oil and gas industry - many of them, when asked by academics, identify as white - so very much part of the Texas culture. COLIN ALLRED: Well, listen, I understand some of the skepticism around Texas turning blue. GOODWYN: Colin Allred is a Democratic congressman in Dallas. Allred says that although Texas hasn't turned blue as fast as was predicted, he still believes it's inevitable that there are a lot more liberal Hispanics in the cities than conservative Hispanics along the border. ALLRED: Then we have to remember that these are gerrymandered districts that were drawn so that they could not be flipped. And it is true in the most recent round of redistricting, both at the congressional level and the State House level, that we're not going to have as many competitive elections early on in the decade. But that happened last decade as well, and later in the decade we saw all of these districts flipping. GOODWYN: Early voting in the Texas primaries have started. The latest fundraising statistics from Transparency USA show Texas Republicans outraising Texas Democrats by 3 to 1. Beto O'Rourke, who's running for governor against incumbent Greg Abbott, is currently down by seven to 10 percentage points, according to the latest polls. But there's still a long way to go. The November elections this year and then again in 2024, will tell us a lot. Wade Goodwyn, NPR News, Dallas. (SOUNDBITE OF ERNESTO JIMENEZ'S \"MAR EN CALMA\") Copyright © 2022 NPR.

RINALDI: And then we heard again with Wendy Davis that Democrats were going to take the state, and they didn't do it then. And then we heard with Beto O'Rourke, and they didn't that time, either. So we've been hearing this over a period of about 20 years, and it's never played out. GOODWYN: It's not that there hasn't been progress for Texas Democrats. In the 2014 governor's race that Rinaldi mentioned, Democrat Wendy Davis was routed by Republican Greg Abbott by more than 20 points. Four years ago in the U.S. Senate race, Beto O'Rourke only lost to Ted Cruz by just over 2 1/2 points - quite promising, if nonetheless disappointing for Democrats. But last year, Joe Biden lost Texas to President Trump by nearly six points. That's closer than the margin Trump beat Hillary Clinton by in 2016. But in politics, it's still getting stomped. Here's GOP chairman Rinaldi again. RINALDI: Political relocations are greater than ever. We're actually importing Republican voters from other states - California and New York - coming here. And we saw that reflected in the Ted Cruz race. Ted Cruz won a majority of transplants, while Beto won a majority of native Texans.

      "text": "Here's What's In Texas Republicans' New Voting Law\n\nFrom\n\nAshley Lopez\n\nTexas, which already had some of the country's strictest voting rules, has a new restrictive voting law backed by Republicans. Tamir Kalifa/Getty Images hide caption\n\nTexas, which already had some of the country's strictest voting rules, has a new restrictive voting law backed by Republicans.\n\nSweeping new voting restrictions are now law in Texas - a state that already had some of the most restrictive election rules in the country.\n\nRepublican Gov. Greg Abbott signed the measure into law on Tuesday. In a statement last week, Abbott said, \"Senate Bill 1 will solidify trust and confidence in the outcome of our elections by making it easier to vote and harder to cheat.\"\n\nThe GOP effort to pass its omnibus voting legislation has taken months. Texas House Democrats staged a last-minute walkout in late May to block a vote on the bill and then skipped town in July during a special session, denying Republicans a quorum to conduct legislative business. More than a month later, enough Democrats returned to the chamber so that GOP lawmakers could pass the bill along near-party lines.\n\nThe new law is part of a nationwide push by state-level Republicans to enact more restrictive voting laws following former President Donald Trump's loss in the 2020 election. Trump and his allies have falsely claimed the election was stolen.\n\nHere's what's in the Texas law:\n\nThe measure includes new identification requirements for people voting by mail and prohibits local election officials from sending a vote-by-mail application to someone who hasn't requested one. Voters are also given new opportunities to correct mistakes with their mail ballots.\n\nThe law creates a slew of new criminal penalties and requirements for folks who assist voters at the polls, or people who assist others planning to vote by mail.\n\nIt also bans drive-through voting and extended voting hours. Republicans in the state argue that these innovations - which officials in Harris County , home to Houston, mostly used during the pandemic - opened the door to voter fraud.\n\nJames Slattery, a senior staff attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project, said voters of color and shift workers benefited the most from these methods of voting last year.\n\n\"And so you can consider the bans on those forms of voting to be a direct attack on voters of color in particular,\"  Slattery said in an interview over the summer.\n\nIn addition, the law expands what partisan poll watchers can observe during elections and grants them new protections.\n\nTexas Democrats ultimately lost the fight over the voting law, but Slattery said the walkouts and quorum breaks did indeed make the measure less restrictive .\n\n\"If one were to ask me, 'Were the quorum breaks worth it?' I think absolutely,\" he said, \"and the situation for voters in Texas would be much worse if it hadn't happened.\"\n\nFor example, provisions that would have limited voting on Sundays - when Black church members often go to the polls - and sections that would have made it easier to overturn elections are not part of the final law.\n\nThose two provisions would have passed if Democrats didn't walk out the first time back in May. And the sections were so controversial that even Republicans distanced themselves , even though they were ready to vote for them.\n\nDemocrats did lose out late on one key item, though, regarding illegal voting.\n\nThere are two high-profile cases of illegal voting in Texas, including that of Crystal Mason, who was released from federal prison but couldn't vote because she was still on supervised release. She said she didn't know and voted.\n\nThe provision - which had bipartisan backing - would try to prevent more people from unknowingly getting in that situation, but it was stripped out in conference committee because the bill's sponsor, Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes, said it was too broad.\n\nTexas Republicans are cheering the new law. Hughes said it's an effort to make elections more secure.\n\n\"How much fraud is OK? None. How much suppression is OK? None. That's why Senate Bill 1 makes it easy to vote and makes it harder to cheat,\" he said.\n\nGOP lawmakers said the new law addresses concerns among voters about fraud - even though proven cases of voter or election fraud are exceedingly rare in Texas or elsewhere.\n\nThe Texas Civil Rights Project's Slattery has said the Republican-led measures do nothing to make elections more secure in Texas and would instead further the false claims Trump and his allies have made that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\n\"There isn't any election security benefit to nearly any of these provisions,\" he said. \"It's all in service of the big lie and enshrining the big lie even further into the laws of this most restrictive state in the country.\"\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, continue to look toward Congress for help to craft an overarching federal solution with nationwide voting standards.\n\nThat effort is stalled on Capitol Hill.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

And some of their positions are striking. The platform declares homosexuality, quote, \"an abnormal lifestyle choice.\" It endorses abolishing the 1965 Voting Rights Act. And the Texas GOP officially holds the false view that President Biden, quote, \"was not legitimately elected.\" Texas Tribune Editor-in-Chief Sewell Chan was reporting at the convention. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. SEWELL CHAN: Thank you, Ari. SHAPIRO: There are 275 planks in this platform, and many are noteworthy. Besides the ones I mentioned, there's one that would require Texas students to, quote, \"learn about the humanity of the preborn child.\" Another would remove the legislature's power to regulate guns. These were not part of the state party platform in 2018 or 2020, so why has the party moved so far to the right on so many of these issues? CHAN: Well, one thing that we've noticed is that the party has actually been emboldened since the 2020 election, although President Trump lost that election. Obviously, you know, his narrative of a stolen election has continued to be very, very powerful. There was a sense in 2018 and even in 2020, when the party last formed its platform, that they had to moderate a little bit to meet the center given that Texas Democrats had made some surprising gains in the 2018 midterm elections. But with Biden seen as very unpopular and with the Republicans seen as being in a strong position for this year's midterms, the party has felt really emboldened to appease the far right. SHAPIRO: The party controls the House, Senate, governor's mansion and every statewide office in Texas. So how much of a real-world impact could these extreme declarations have? CHAN: Well, that's it. We have to remember that a platform is not the same as the legislative priorities. You know, Texas Republicans have actually made - have had so many victories on voting, abortion rights, redistricting that, you know, some observers are like, you know, what more could they hope for? And so we have to keep in mind that some of the platform is, you know, again, throwing kind of red meat and not so much specific legislative language. You know, that said, if you zoom out, you know, the platform would take us back to an America that's very different from the one today. It would include repealing the federal income tax; you know, not having U.S. senators directly elected, but rather, you know, elected by state legislatures; and even not having directly elected state officials, but having a kind of state electoral college that would choose the governor and other officers. SHAPIRO: People at the convention also booed one of their state's most powerful Republicans, Senator John Cornyn. What happened? CHAN: Well, it's very striking. And Senator Cornyn, of course, is a George W. Bush-era Republican - in the news a lot for being part of this group of 10 Republican senators, you know, open to a bipartisan framework on gun safety. He was booed on Friday quite loudly. He tried, over many heckles, to kind of actually explain what's in the bipartisan framework and talk about what he would not agree to, which includes restricting the rights of current gun owners. But people weren't having it. SHAPIRO: Just in our last 30 seconds or so, was there much pushback to some of the more extreme positions like the big lie that the 2020 election was stolen? CHAN: Well, there was some. There was pushback against the homosexuality provision. I think, you know, delegates I talked to - frankly, there was a bit of an eyeroll like, you know, as if, you know, we're going to say the election was illegitimate. But that's not really an actionable item. So that's important to keep in mind too, although, of course, the position itself is fairly extreme. SHAPIRO: That's Sewell Chan, editor-in-chief of The Texas Tribune. Thank you so much for talking with us today. CHAN: Thank you, Ari. Copyright © 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But with Biden seen as very unpopular and with the Republicans seen as being in a strong position for this year's midterms, the party has felt really emboldened to appease the far right. SHAPIRO: The party controls the House, Senate, governor's mansion and every statewide office in Texas. So how much of a real-world impact could these extreme declarations have? CHAN: Well, that's it. We have to remember that a platform is not the same as the legislative priorities. You know, Texas Republicans have actually made - have had so many victories on voting, abortion rights, redistricting that, you know, some observers are like, you know, what more could they hope for? And so we have to keep in mind that some of the platform is, you know, again, throwing kind of red meat and not so much specific legislative language. You know, that said, if you zoom out, you know, the platform would take us back to an America that's very different from the one today. It would include repealing the federal income tax; you know, not having U.S. senators directly elected, but rather, you know, elected by state legislatures; and even not having directly elected state officials, but having a kind of state electoral college that would choose the governor and other officers. SHAPIRO: People at the convention also booed one of their state's most powerful Republicans, Senator John Cornyn. What happened? CHAN: Well, it's very striking. And Senator Cornyn, of course, is a George W. Bush-era Republican - in the news a lot for being part of this group of 10 Republican senators, you know, open to a bipartisan framework on gun safety. He was booed on Friday quite loudly. He tried, over many heckles, to kind of actually explain what's in the bipartisan framework and talk about what he would not agree to, which includes restricting the rights of current gun owners. But people weren't having it. SHAPIRO: Just in our last 30 seconds or so, was there much pushback to some of the more extreme positions like the big lie that the 2020 election was stolen? CHAN: Well, there was some. There was pushback against the homosexuality provision. I think, you know, delegates I talked to - frankly, there was a bit of an eyeroll like, you know, as if, you know, we're going to say the election was illegitimate. But that's not really an actionable item. So that's important to keep in mind too, although, of course, the position itself is fairly extreme. SHAPIRO: That's Sewell Chan, editor-in-chief of The Texas Tribune. Thank you so much for talking with us today. CHAN: Thank you, Ari. Copyright © 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And some of their positions are striking. The platform declares homosexuality, quote, \"an abnormal lifestyle choice.\" It endorses abolishing the 1965 Voting Rights Act. And the Texas GOP officially holds the false view that President Biden, quote, \"was not legitimately elected.\" Texas Tribune Editor-in-Chief Sewell Chan was reporting at the convention. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. SEWELL CHAN: Thank you, Ari. SHAPIRO: There are 275 planks in this platform, and many are noteworthy. Besides the ones I mentioned, there's one that would require Texas students to, quote, \"learn about the humanity of the preborn child.\" Another would remove the legislature's power to regulate guns. These were not part of the state party platform in 2018 or 2020, so why has the party moved so far to the right on so many of these issues? CHAN: Well, one thing that we've noticed is that the party has actually been emboldened since the 2020 election, although President Trump lost that election. Obviously, you know, his narrative of a stolen election has continued to be very, very powerful. There was a sense in 2018 and even in 2020, when the party last formed its platform, that they had to moderate a little bit to meet the center given that Texas Democrats had made some surprising gains in the 2018 midterm elections.

It would include repealing the federal income tax; you know, not having U.S. senators directly elected, but rather, you know, elected by state legislatures; and even not having directly elected state officials, but having a kind of state electoral college that would choose the governor and other officers. SHAPIRO: People at the convention also booed one of their state's most powerful Republicans, Senator John Cornyn. What happened? CHAN: Well, it's very striking. And Senator Cornyn, of course, is a George W. Bush-era Republican - in the news a lot for being part of this group of 10 Republican senators, you know, open to a bipartisan framework on gun safety. He was booed on Friday quite loudly. He tried, over many heckles, to kind of actually explain what's in the bipartisan framework and talk about what he would not agree to, which includes restricting the rights of current gun owners. But people weren't having it. SHAPIRO: Just in our last 30 seconds or so, was there much pushback to some of the more extreme positions like the big lie that the 2020 election was stolen? CHAN: Well, there was some. There was pushback against the homosexuality provision. I think, you know, delegates I talked to - frankly, there was a bit of an eyeroll like, you know, as if, you know, we're going to say the election was illegitimate. But that's not really an actionable item. So that's important to keep in mind too, although, of course, the position itself is fairly extreme.

      "text": "Texas Republicans target how elections are run in Democratic-leaning Houston area\n\nFrom\n\nBy\n\nAndrew Schneider\n\nA voter and her daughter cast a ballot in Houston during the 2020 general election. New bills passed by Texas lawmakers target how elections are run in Harris County, which is home to Houston. David J. Phillip/AP hide caption\n\nA voter and her daughter cast a ballot in Houston during the 2020 general election. New bills passed by Texas lawmakers target how elections are run in Harris County, which is home to Houston.\n\nHOUSTON - Harris County in Texas is a big and diverse county that has trended Democratic over the past decade.\n\nAnd in the recently completed session of the Texas Legislature, Republican state lawmakers passed measures that specifically target how elections are run in Harris County.\n\nTwo bills sent to Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday would remove the county's elections administrator position and allow for the secretary of state - an appointee of the governor - to oversee elections in Harris County, under certain circumstances.\n\nHarris County has struggled to conduct elections in recent years. The then-elections administrator resigned last year after issues with the state primary.\n\nAnd the November general election was more of the same. Some polls in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods opened hours late. Others experienced malfunctioning machines. And then there were more than two dozen polling sites in Republican-leaning neighborhoods that were forced to temporarily shut down because they ran out of paper ballots.\n\n\"I believe, absolutely believe, it was on purpose,\" said Terry Wheeler, who served as a Republican election judge in Cypress, northwest of Houston. \"I've never seen anything like this, the way that they blew us off over the phone and refused to get us paper ballots.\"\n\nDemocrats largely swept the 2022 elections in Harris County. Houston Public Media conducted a five-month investigation of the county's management of those elections, which revealed numerous problems but no evidence that the county had deliberately undersupplied polling sites in Republican-leaning areas. Nor did it determine that the number of people turned away at those sites would have significantly affected the outcome of most contests.\n\nNevertheless, Republicans at the state and county level decided Harris County's election system was broken and needed state intervention to fix it.\n\nGOP state Sen. Paul Bettencourt of Houston was the author of those two bills related to his home county that are now on the governor's desk.\n\n\" Senate Bill 1750 basically returns elections in Harris County back to the elected officials - the county clerk and the tax assessor - like it was before the establishment of the now-defunct elections administrator office,\" Bettencourt said.\n\nLike many Republicans, Bettencourt holds the county's appointed elections administrator, Clifford Tatum, responsible for the problems of Election Day 2022. He says the elected officials would be more responsive to voters.\n\nBut then there's SB 1933 .\n\n\"[SB 1933] basically grants the secretary of state oversight under specific circumstances for Harris County elections, if necessary, through a complaint process established in the bill,\" Bettencourt said. In other words, it would allow the state to override, even remove, those same elected officials.\n\nBoth bills were amended after being filed to target counties with at least 3.5 million and 4 million people, respectively. That's Harris County alone.\n\nThe county's Democratic chief executive, Judge Lina Hidalgo, condemned the two measures.\n\n\"Harris County today finds itself grappling with the audacity of Republican state lawmakers, hell-bent on recklessly enhancing the election chances of one party by targeting the largest county in the state,\" Hidalgo said. \"This sets a dangerous precedent and subverts elections in one of the most diverse counties in the nation - another step toward disenfranchisement in the name of 'election reform.' \"\n\nCounty Attorney Christian Menefee, also a Democrat, said, \"We have a lot of elected officials, a lot of people who are voted into office to serve their community. Yet these bills target three Black elected officials in Harris County: the elections administrator, the county clerk and the tax assessor collector.\"\n\nMenefee said the bills won't go unchallenged. \"We're suing the state of Texas to protect Harris County, to protect Harris County residents, to protect our public officials, and to stop the state from targeting us,\" he said.\n\nThe current elections administrator has taken steps to alleviate the problems that have plagued voting in the county.\n\nBut his job is going away, forcing the county clerk to scramble to oversee November's general election, when Houstonians will choose a new mayor.\n\nTexas lawmakers passed other election-related bills with statewide ramifications.\n\n- House Bill 1243 would increase the penalty for voting illegally from a misdemeanor to a second-degree felony, on par with manslaughter and attempted murder. That would reverse a change made by legislators a couple of years ago.\n\nKatya Ehresman of Common Cause Texas has grave concerns about HB 1243, but she said the measure wasn't as bad as another bill the Senate tried to pass, which would have punished a person for voting illegally even if they didn't realize they were committing a crime by casting a ballot. Both measures came after several high-profile cases of individuals being arrested for voting while still on parole and not having had their voting rights restored yet.\n\n\"This version that did pass [HB 1243], while horrible - insofar as it increases the criminalization of voting, and it ultimately will intimidate people from the process because of the threat of felony penalties - it at minimum doesn't include that opened door of prosecutions of mistakes and confusion,\" Ehresman said.\n\n- Senate Bill 1070 would seek to end the state's participation in the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, a voter data consortium that's been targeted in certain corners by right-wing misinformation.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

This happened at their annual convention last week in the middle of Pride Month. Party leaders also excluded members of the nation's oldest conservative LGBTQ group from parts of the convention. NPR's Ashley Lopez was there and joins us now. Good morning, Ashley. ASHLEY LOPEZ, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: So, Ashley, let's start with this bigoted language that made it into the platform. What exactly was added? A LOPEZ: So there were only a couple of planks that covered these issues. In total, there are about 270 planks in the platform, by the way. And LGBT issues came up in about five or six planks depending how you count them. But what Texas Republicans had to say about gay rights and homosexuality and transgender people really stands out. First and foremost, the party wrote that homosexuality is an abnormal lifestyle choice. They also included language that says there shouldn't be any special legal protections for gay, lesbian and bisexual people, and they oppose any criminal or civil penalties against people who oppose homosexuality. And last, the party says they oppose all efforts to validate transgender identity. And that for anyone under 21, no medical provider should be allowed to provide services to that person affirming their gender identity. FADEL: Wow. In 2022, to write this into the state party platform, and there are LGBTQ Republicans. What was it like for them to see this? A LOPEZ: Well, you know, this was a tough event for gay Republicans. Party leaders actually barred a group of Log Cabin Republicans from Fort Worth from having a booth at the event. The Log Cabin Republicans are the oldest and largest group of conservative LGBTQ people in the country. I spoke to one of their members, Michael Cargill, who is part of the state chapter. He says that in general, he agrees with Texas Republicans on so many issues, particularly gun rights. He sounded a little frustrated that, like, gay rights and inclusion is even something the party is still debating. MICHAEL CARGILL: You have a small minority of people that call themselves Christian conservatives that have forgotten what the Bible actually says. God is the only judge. And as a conservative Christian, we should spend more time loving each other instead of judging each other. A LOPEZ: I will say Cargill also told me that he has no intention of leaving the party over this. In fact, he says, he plans on going to the next convention where he can work on making the platform more inclusive. FADEL: OK. So he says these voices fighting LGBTQ rights are a minority in the party, but these words got into the party platform. You describe party leaders stopping the Log Cabin Republicans from having a booth. So even if a minority, it sounds like these voices are influential. A LOPEZ: They really are. And you can see the influence beyond just the planks in a party platform. Carisa Lopez with the Texas Freedom Network says Republicans in Texas have been codifying what she sees as discrimination into state law for the past few years. CARISA LOPEZ: They have passed laws that open the door to discrimination for LGBTQ couples who want to adopt. They are still trying to undermine marriage. They've tried to regulate which bathrooms people can use. And now, currently, we're in a battle where they're going after families who affirm their trans children. A LOPEZ: By and large, though, voters in Texas, including Republicans and independents, are more accepting of the LGBT community than people attending the party convention, you know, who hold more extreme opinions than Republican voters as a whole. But at the same time, you know, this is the base of the party, and they have a lot of influence. FADEL: NPR's Ashley Lopez in Austin, thank you so much. A LOPEZ: Yeah, thank you.

And as a conservative Christian, we should spend more time loving each other instead of judging each other. A LOPEZ: I will say Cargill also told me that he has no intention of leaving the party over this. In fact, he says, he plans on going to the next convention where he can work on making the platform more inclusive. FADEL: OK. So he says these voices fighting LGBTQ rights are a minority in the party, but these words got into the party platform. You describe party leaders stopping the Log Cabin Republicans from having a booth. So even if a minority, it sounds like these voices are influential. A LOPEZ: They really are. And you can see the influence beyond just the planks in a party platform. Carisa Lopez with the Texas Freedom Network says Republicans in Texas have been codifying what she sees as discrimination into state law for the past few years. CARISA LOPEZ: They have passed laws that open the door to discrimination for LGBTQ couples who want to adopt. They are still trying to undermine marriage. They've tried to regulate which bathrooms people can use. And now, currently, we're in a battle where they're going after families who affirm their trans children. A LOPEZ: By and large, though, voters in Texas, including Republicans and independents, are more accepting of the LGBT community than people attending the party convention, you know, who hold more extreme opinions than Republican voters as a whole. But at the same time, you know, this is the base of the party, and they have a lot of influence. FADEL: NPR's Ashley Lopez in Austin, thank you so much. A LOPEZ: Yeah, thank you.

This happened at their annual convention last week in the middle of Pride Month. Party leaders also excluded members of the nation's oldest conservative LGBTQ group from parts of the convention. NPR's Ashley Lopez was there and joins us now. Good morning, Ashley. ASHLEY LOPEZ, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: So, Ashley, let's start with this bigoted language that made it into the platform. What exactly was added? A LOPEZ: So there were only a couple of planks that covered these issues. In total, there are about 270 planks in the platform, by the way. And LGBT issues came up in about five or six planks depending how you count them. But what Texas Republicans had to say about gay rights and homosexuality and transgender people really stands out. First and foremost, the party wrote that homosexuality is an abnormal lifestyle choice. They also included language that says there shouldn't be any special legal protections for gay, lesbian and bisexual people, and they oppose any criminal or civil penalties against people who oppose homosexuality. And last, the party says they oppose all efforts to validate transgender identity. And that for anyone under 21, no medical provider should be allowed to provide services to that person affirming their gender identity. FADEL: Wow. In 2022, to write this into the state party platform, and there are LGBTQ Republicans. What was it like for them to see this? A LOPEZ: Well, you know, this was a tough event for gay Republicans. Party leaders actually barred a group of Log Cabin Republicans from Fort Worth from having a booth at the event. The Log Cabin Republicans are the oldest and largest group of conservative LGBTQ people in the country. I spoke to one of their members, Michael Cargill, who is part of the state chapter. He says that in general, he agrees with Texas Republicans on so many issues, particularly gun rights. He sounded a little frustrated that, like, gay rights and inclusion is even something the party is still debating.

But at the same time, you know, this is the base of the party, and they have a lot of influence. FADEL: NPR's Ashley Lopez in Austin, thank you so much. A LOPEZ: Yeah, thank you.

What was it like for them to see this? A LOPEZ: Well, you know, this was a tough event for gay Republicans. Party leaders actually barred a group of Log Cabin Republicans from Fort Worth from having a booth at the event. The Log Cabin Republicans are the oldest and largest group of conservative LGBTQ people in the country. I spoke to one of their members, Michael Cargill, who is part of the state chapter. He says that in general, he agrees with Texas Republicans on so many issues, particularly gun rights. He sounded a little frustrated that, like, gay rights and inclusion is even something the party is still debating. MICHAEL CARGILL: You have a small minority of people that call themselves Christian conservatives that have forgotten what the Bible actually says. God is the only judge. And as a conservative Christian, we should spend more time loving each other instead of judging each other. A LOPEZ: I will say Cargill also told me that he has no intention of leaving the party over this. In fact, he says, he plans on going to the next convention where he can work on making the platform more inclusive. FADEL: OK. So he says these voices fighting LGBTQ rights are a minority in the party, but these words got into the party platform. You describe party leaders stopping the Log Cabin Republicans from having a booth. So even if a minority, it sounds like these voices are influential. A LOPEZ: They really are. And you can see the influence beyond just the planks in a party platform. Carisa Lopez with the Texas Freedom Network says Republicans in Texas have been codifying what she sees as discrimination into state law for the past few years. CARISA LOPEZ: They have passed laws that open the door to discrimination for LGBTQ couples who want to adopt. They are still trying to undermine marriage. They've tried to regulate which bathrooms people can use. And now, currently, we're in a battle where they're going after families who affirm their trans children.

It also calls for secession\n\nBy\n\nBill Chappell\n\nThe Republican Party of Texas refuses to recognize the legitimacy of President Biden's election win. Just before Biden's inauguration in 2021, armed groups held a rally in front of the Texas State Capitol in Austin. Matthew Busch/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nThe Republican Party of Texas refuses to recognize the legitimacy of President Biden's election win. Just before Biden's inauguration in 2021, armed groups held a rally in front of the Texas State Capitol in Austin.\n\nPresident Biden is the \"acting\" president because he didn't win legally; Texans should vote on seceding; the Voting Rights Act of 1965 should be repealed; any gun control is a rights violation: this is the world as seen by the Republican Party of Texas, according to its newly adopted party platform.\n\n\"We can't compromise with Democrats who have a different and incompatible vision for our future,\" Matt Rinaldi, the state GOP chairman, said, according to The Texas Newsroom . \"We need to be a bold and unapologetic conservative party, ready to go on offense and win the fight for our country.\"\n\nThe Republicans' 2022 platform is outlined in a 40-page document that addresses state issues but also much broader priorities - such as calling for the U.S. to leave the United Nations. Delegates approved it over the weekend, at the party's convention in Houston.\n\nBy insisting that Biden didn't actually defeat former President Trump in 2020, Texas Republicans are prolonging the lies and baseless claims about election fraud that fueled the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"We believe that the 2020 election violated Article 1 and 2 of the US Constitution,\" the Texas Republicans said in their new platform. They accuse several secretaries of state of illegal actions, alleging that \"substantial election fraud in key metropolitan areas\" distorted the results in Biden's favor.\n\n\"We reject the certified results of the 2020 presidential election, and we hold that acting President Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was not legitimately elected by the people of the United States,\" the GOP platform stated.\n\nThe pro-Trump stance sets the tone for November's midterm election date. It also suggests the Texas GOP will use Trump's claims to stoke voter turnout: The section on election fraud concludes by urging every Republican to vote in order to \"overwhelm any possible fraud.\"\n\nOrganizers screened the film 2,000 Mules at least three times, according to the convention's program .\n\nThe film was recently discussed during a Jan. 6 committee hearing, when former Attorney General Bill Barr said the film's central premise, that electronic location data proved people were used as \"mules\" to stuff ballot boxes, was \"just indefensible.\"\n\n2,000 Mules was directed by Dinesh D'Souza, who, in 2014, admitted to making illegal campaign contributions in other people's names - a form of election law fraud , in other words. The controversial activist was pardoned by Trump in 2018. The former president hosted a showing of the film in Florida last month.\n\nSaying the U.S. government has impaired Texas' right of self-government, the platform calls for rejecting any legislation that conflicts with the state's rights - and it suggests leaving the union might be the answer.\n\n\"Texas retains the right to secede from the United States, and the Texas Legislature should be called upon to pass a referendum consistent thereto,\" the platform stated.\n\nDeeper in the document, the GOP delegates urge state lawmakers to put a referendum on the agenda for the 2023 election, \"for the people of Texas to determine whether or not the State of Texas should reassert its status as an independent nation.\"\n\nIn Texas, secession is a perennial idea that tends to bloom when a Democrat holds the Oval Office. After former President Obama won his first term, for instance, the state's Gov. Rick Perry hinted that Texans might consider exiting the union.\n\nIt remains an open question as to how closely the priorities outlined in the 2022 platform reflect the views of regular Republicans in Texas.\n\nOne sign of a potential divide is in the reception given to the state's politicians in Congress.\n\nThe crowd loudly booed Sen. John Cornyn , who's leading the Republican side in the hunt for areas of bipartisan agreement on guns. Another Texas Republican, Rep. Dan Crenshaw, was confronted by far-right activists who mocked him by calling him \"eye-patch McCain\" and a \"traitor,\" according to Mediate .\n\nAs Matthew Watkins, the managing editor for news and politics at the Texas Tribune, said via Twitter , feelings in the convention hall don't necessarily equate to voter sentiments.\n\n\"John Cornyn, booed in the hall, received 76% of the vote in his last primary race,\" Watkins said. \"Greg Abbott, who didn't give a speech, received 67%. Ken Paxton, who got a standing ovation, received 43% in March.\"\n\nNot every plank in the platform came with a long explanation. For instance, the section on the Voting Rights Act of 1965 - which the Justice Department calls \"the most successful piece of civil rights legislation ever adopted\" by Congress -  merely states that the Texas GOP supports \"equal suffrage for all United States citizens of voting age.\"\n\nThe platform then calls for the 1965 law and its updated forms to \"be repealed and not reauthorized.\" The Voting Rights Act has returned as a key point of contention in the past decade, as parties argue over election fairness - particularly in areas with histories of discriminating against or suppressing voters of color.\n\nThe GOP was more effusive about guns, stating, \"all gun control is a violation of the Second Amendment and our God given rights.\"\n\nAnother section declared there shall be no gun-free zones in Texas, a state that recently absorbed one of the worst mass school shootings in U.S. history. The party platform also spoke out against \"red flag\" laws and any effort to bar people younger than 21 from buying a gun.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "The GOP's Secret to Protecting Gerrymandered Electoral Maps? Claim Privilege.\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nLeer en español.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nEva Bonilla grows furious when she thinks about how Latino voters are treated by the Republican power structure in Texas. At 74, the small business owner watched the GOP Legislature pass a series of measures like a voter ID law that she felt would make it harder for Latinos to cast ballots or run for public office.\n\nTwo years ago, serving as the leader of a Hispanic women's group in Fort Worth, she decided to strike back. The Republican Legislature had just pushed through new election maps that carved up Latino communities and made it even harder for them to elect candidates of their choice. So Bonilla joined other minority voters as plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit alleging intentional discrimination in the 2021 redistricting plan.\n\n\"I wanted to see the right thing done, and this is just not right,\" she said.\n\nThen Bonilla waited.\n\nIn 2022, an election came and went with districts based on the challenged maps. It has now achieved a dubious distinction: Of the 87 lawsuits filed over the 2021 congressional and legislative redistricting plans nationwide, it has dragged on the longest without having held a trial. As another election looms, a trial date has not even been set.\n\nThe reason? Republican leaders asserted their rights to block the most routine give-and-take of lawsuits, resisting handing over documents, providing discovery or submitting to depositions - in effect squashing Bonilla's efforts to uncover how the 2021 maps were drawn. The lawmakers have done so by the rigorous use of two forms of privilege: the better known attorney-client privilege and what is known as legislative privilege, which allows elected members of state legislatures to deliberate in private.\n\nAs the Texas case drags on, legislatures across the country are making new and expansive claims of privilege to keep electoral maps in place and prevent the public from finding out how they made their decisions and why.\n\nTexas lawmakers did not stumble upon these tactics on their own. A national GOP redistricting group helped train Republican lawmakers in Texas on how to approach lawsuits and raised money to pay legal costs. The lawmakers also passed a new law to further protect their deliberations. In addition, they put an outside political operative on the state's payroll so that the legislative privilege could shield his activities. Finally, they relied on GOP map-drawers who worked for law firms, which allowed lawmakers to assert that the maps were \"legal advice.\"\n\nThroughout, the Texas lawmakers have contended they did not discriminate against Latino voters.\n\nIn Louisiana, North Dakota and elsewhere, Republicans have resisted challenges to their maps by asserting privilege. In Washington, Democrats have done the same. Legal experts say the expanding use of privilege robs plaintiffs of key insights. To succeed in court, plaintiffs in many cases have to show legislators intended to discriminate. Without access, explained Harvard Law School professor Nicholas Stephanopoulos, it becomes \"very difficult to prove intent even where it was actually present.\"\n\nThe concept of legislative privilege is protected under the U.S. Constitution's speech and debate clause , and 43 states have embedded it in their constitutions. Originally intended to protect legislators from criminal or civil claims for things they said on the floor, it has come to encompass lawmakers' work-related communications. In theory, affording such protection allowed for frank conversations.\n\nBut in the past, people who wanted to scrutinize a legislature's activities had another, if narrower, way to find out what was going on: They could file open records requests to get access to interactions lawmakers had with outside third parties, such as consultants or political operatives. In Texas and elsewhere, Republicans have succeeded in shielding even these once-public interactions.\n\nConservative judges in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers several states including Texas, and the 8th Circuit, which covers the Dakotas, have recently sided with state legislatures that have used expanded privilege claims to prevent public review. Recently, Arizona Republicans appealed to the 9th Circuit to shield their deliberations .\n\nPartisan battles have long been a staple of redistricting, which happens every 10 years. But as more states craft their new maps out of public sight, the fights are ending up in drawn-out court cases, with enormous consequences for voters. The lawsuits are taking so long to resolve that six states conducted their 2022 elections under maps that had been ruled illegal by lower courts, according to a recent analysis by Democracy Docket, a progressive website that tracks redistricting cases. They await resolution. Lawsuits challenging maps in seven other states were still awaiting court action when the elections took place.\n\nThe Texas GOP undertook its mapmaking effort as the state was undergoing a significant demographic shift. Latinos now slightly outnumber non-Hispanic white people in the state, and they and other minorities account for almost all population growth in the last decade, according to census data. Many of these new residents will likely vote for the Democratic Party. Through aggressive redistricting, however, Republicans have been able to maintain control of the Legislature, all major statewide offices and the state's congressional delegation. And they grabbed one of the two new seats in Congress gained through the population increases.\n\n\"Elections can't really be unwound. You can't go back and change the composition of the Texas Legislature from 2022,\" said Yurij Rudensky, senior counsel with the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan legal institute. The center represents a separate group of minority plaintiffs who are challenging the state's maps. The Justice Department has joined the plaintiffs. \"So using discriminatory districts cuts to the heart of our democracy.\"\n\nTo reconstruct how Texas Republicans stalled the legal fight over their redrawn districts, ProPublica used federal court records in six states as well as interviews with experts, voters and former state officials. Combined they provide the fullest account yet of how state lawmakers hobbled the opposition and hidden their activities.\n\nKeith Gaddie, a former bipartisan litigation consultant, said that in his experience, lawmakers keep their methods secret when they are aggressively gaming the process for political gain. \"The more egregious the gerrymander, the less information can be made available about the process,\" he said. \"It's a nasty, nasty business.\"\n\nRedistricting in Texas was two years away when leaders of the Virginia-based National Republican Redistricting Trust flew into Houston for a poolside briefing for GOP supporters.\n\nEstablished in 2017 to counter a similar Democratic Party redistricting operation, the NRRT and its nonprofit affiliate, Fair Lines America, had many Texas ties. Senior leadership included powerful Texan Karl Rove, a former White House official and longtime consultant to Texas governors.\n\nAt the closed event in 2019 in a Houston suburb, Texas GOP Chairman James Dickey mingled with party loyalists to discuss the two or three new seats they should get in Congress as the state's population boomed, according to social media accounts and interviews. A young supporter took selfies with Washington influencers like James \"Trey\" Trainor , a Texas lawyer whose nomination by President Donald Trump to the Federal Election Commission was being blocked by Democrats because of his criticisms of campaign finance laws. On Instagram, the supporter described it as a helpful session on the \"threats and opportunities redistricting presents.\"\n\nThe NRRT's executive director is Adam Kincaid, a former Republican National Committee strategist. Kincaid had become the go-to conservative voice on redistricting within the party. Soon, he would take a hands-on role in drawing Texas' congressional map. Kincaid declined to comment on his work in Texas \"due to ongoing litigation.\"\n\nOn a party podcast , Kincaid had pushed Republicans to counter what he described as the Democrat's plan to \"sue till it's blue.\" The NRRT distributed talking points asserting that \"Democrats are sitting back counting the cash they plan to use on their trial lawyers to fund their strategy of endless litigation,\" according to a document secured by the watchdog American Oversight .\n\nIn the podcast, Kincaid said the NRRT, which does not have to disclose its donors, would send resources to states facing challenges. Separately, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas promoted a super PAC that raised money to hire redistricting experts and legal counsel and brought in $500,000 in a single day.\n\nTexas had been mired in voting rights litigation for almost a decade. Groups representing Latino and Black voters had sued after the 2010 census too, making similar allegations to today. Then, a district court judicial panel rejected the state's map, ruling that large portions of it were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders and ordering maps to be redrawn. Republicans tried to assert legislative privilege over internal emails, but judges rejected the arguments and ordered the documents released.\n\nEmails exposed GOP staffers plotting about how to draw maps to maximize Republican influence in Latino areas, or as one staffer put it: creating \"Optimal Hispanic Republican Voting Strength.\"\n\nA state lawyer dismissed their plan in Spanish, \"No Bueno,\" slang for \"No Good.\" He warned them not to create a paper trail. The court found discriminatory intent.\n\nThe state appealed. Ultimately, the Supreme Court in 2018 reversed the lower court and sided with the Republicans in a 5-4 ruling.\n\nHaving been embarrassed after 2010, GOP leaders promised transparency this time around. Instead, they took the opposite tack, said Glenn Smith, an author and longtime Houston reporter and Democratic consultant: \"Hide as much as possible.\"\n\nA leader in the buildup to the 2021 redistricting was Republican state Rep. Phil King, a lawyer who has championed religious liberty and Second Amendment issues. King chaired the House Redistricting Committee and set up a tutorial for members in 2019 featuring Ryan Bangert, a hardliner who was appointed by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton. It was obvious, said one attendee, that King was \"preemptively trying to make sure members covered their tracks.\" King's office did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nIn his presentation, Bangert raised what he called \"caution flags,\" according to a tape of the meeting. While judges had differing interpretations of privilege, it was generally waived if information was shared with outside third parties like lobbyists. \"Be very careful,\" he said, of tweets or barroom conversations. Bangert now advises a conservative legal group. His spokesperson said that he had no further redistricting involvement.\n\nKing was the ideal person to lead the fight. He had star billing in 2019 at two sessions of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative group of state lawmakers, lobbyists and executives that works to draft and spread conservative legislation. King, a national board member of the council, spoke on a panel that delivered a primer on redistricting challenges. Drawing maps favorable to the GOP while preserving minority rights was tricky, party leaders said at the sessions.\n\nGOP strategist Cleta Mitchell, who later took a lead role in Trump's 2020 election denial effort, worked with the council's redistricting committee. She moderated King's panel at the annual convention, telling the audience sarcastically that it would teach them \"how to gerrymander.\" Slate, which posted leaked audio , said the speakers encouraged \"trashing potential evidence.\"\n\nThe legislators did not want to rely solely on their own discretion, however. In May 2019, a Republican House member from Fort Worth used a routine housekeeping bill to mount a sweeping assault on open records. He slipped a provision into the bill that closed off public access to internal redistricting records. It passed before transparency advocates noticed.\n\nThe bill shielded lawmakers' communications with staff, even interns, as well as outside contractors who might normally be considered third parties. Other legislatures have adopted similar measures. Florida has exempted redistricting documents from its Sunshine Law since 1993, and North Carolina's Republican-led Legislature recently buried a similar exemption in its 625-page budget bill. The Democratic-led Legislature in Washington is under a court challenge for using a loophole in the state constitution to exclude lawmakers from open records requests related to redistricting.\n\nIn addition to passing the law, Texas Republicans assembled legal heavy hitters who, in turn, hired subcontractors who could work behind attorney-client privilege. The House paid more than $1 million to Butler Snow LLP, which hired a Virginia-based demographer to draw maps for the state House of Representatives. (The legal contracts were obtained by American Oversight through an open records request sent before the law was passed.)\n\nThen, for the national congressional seats, 22 GOP members of the Texas Legislature hired Chris Gober, former general counsel for the state Republican Party. It's not unusual for states or members to retain outside counsel. But what Gober then did was hire the NRRT, an outside party, paying the group a mere $5,000. That secured Kincaid's map-drawing services, according to Gober's deposition. He said Kincaid \"had the mouse\" on the computer drawing congressional maps.\n\nGober said he is not proficient with redistricting software and hires subcontractors to work under his direction. \"That arrangement - and our assertion of attorney-client privilege - is not any different than the other circumstances where our firm hires subcontractors,\" he said.\n\nIn the Texas case, NRRT legal counsel Jason Torchinsky argued that Kincaid should not have to give a deposition because it would \"deter full and honest discussions\" between NRRT and partners. After a year of wrangling, a judge ordered Kincaid to answer questions and a deposition is scheduled for early November.\n\nTorchinsky himself has become a key figure in helping Republicans with redistricting. In 2022, he helped devise a new congressional map for the office of Gov. Ron DeSantis . The governor's plan, which faces a federal lawsuit, reduced the voting power of Black residents. A state judge has since ordered the map redrawn. Torchinsky did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nWhile Kincaid focused on drawing a map for the state's congressional seats, GOP map-drawer Adam Foltz arrived from Wisconsin in 2021 to assist the local effort. By then, Republican state Rep. Todd Hunter had succeeded King as House redistricting chairman. Hunter had a checkered history in redistricting; judges in 2011 had criticized him for drawing maps that undermined Latinos , according to The Texas Tribune. Hunter gave Foltz a $120,000-a-year state job, the Tribune reported, and he enjoyed such high-level access that Democrats noticed his car parked in a special driveway for members. Foltz, whose work also fell under the umbrella of privilege, drew a state salary even after map drawing concluded, and he recently got a $6,000 cost-of-living increase.\n\nFoltz had a similar arrangement in Wisconsin, a state lawyers often cite as a poster child for improper government secrecy and prolonged litigation in its 2010 redistricting cycle. Working from a private law firm, Foltz drew maps that later were thrown out, according to local press reports. Foltz remained in a $50,000-a-year state job during litigation. He later gave testimony that a judicial panel called \"almost laughable.\" Foltz declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation. Hunter's office did not respond.\n\nFoltz's deposition in the Texas case remains sealed by order of the court. He is still asserting legislative privilege to try to prevent giving access to his mapping work to the Justice Department, which joined the plaintiffs who are challenging the maps.\n\nThe fight carried over to the Texas Senate as well. Republican-led redistricting helped end the Senate tenure of Beverly Powell, a Democrat. She said she knew she had a target on her back from the time she was elected, unseating a Tea Party Republican in 2018.\n\nPowell's Senate District 10 in Tarrant County, an unpredictable swing district in recent years, was one of several seats Republicans wanted to reclaim to consolidate their power.\n\nShe expected a bad result when the Republican chair of the Senate Redistricting Committee, Joan Huffman, secluded herself to draw a new Senate map. When Powell was finally called in to view it, what she saw outraged her. Her district's minority communities had been split up, diluting their voting strength, while largely white rural counties had been added.\n\n\"I know exactly what you are trying to do,\" Powell said she told Huffman. She dashed off a warning to other senators that Huffman's plan was discriminatory.\n\nSenate District 10 Was Transformed Dramatically After Redistricting in 2021\n\nThe district previously represented racially diverse communities near Fort Worth, but it now encompasses portions of sprawling rural counties with mostly white constituents.\n\nHuffman insisted her map was \"race-blind.\" Her plan sailed through, with a notable dissent from former redistricting chair Sen. Kel Seliger, a Republican then feuding with some fellow Republicans. The Amarillo senator later testified that Huffman's map \"violated the Voting Rights Act.\"\n\nPowell tried unsuccessfully to convince a court to delay the 2022 primary election. She dropped out of the race for reelection, and the powerful House veteran King took her seat.\n\nPowell's complaint about the district is now part of LULAC v. Abbott, the redistricting case now awaiting trial. Her case stands out because \"she has much more information about what happened than any of the rest of us do,\" said Nina Perales, vice president of litigation at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n\nRead More\n\nRepublicans have asserted privilege in the Senate mapping fight as well. Overall for all the mapping, their claims cover about two-thirds of the documents the Justice Department wants, including drafts of maps, emails and calendars that reflect protected \"thoughts, opinions and mental impressions,\" documents show. The legislature has disputed that estimate.\n\nThe case stalled for a year while the 5th Circuit weighed privilege in another Texas case. Written by Trump appointee Judge Don R. Willett, its decision defended legislative privilege \"even when constitutional rights are at stake.\" The 8th Circuit also ruled in June in a North Dakota redistricting case that privilege \"protects the functioning of the legislature.\"\n\nJudges in the redistricting case are weighing how these decisions impact 22 outstanding motions for documents and depositions.\n\nFor her part, Bonilla, the Fort Worth small business owner, says she's given up hope. \"The system has failed,\" she said.\n\nJosh Kaplan contributed reporting.

      "text": "Texas Banned Abortion. Then Sepsis Rates Soared.\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nPregnancy became far more dangerous in Texas after the state banned abortion in 2021, ProPublica found in a first-of-its-kind data analysis.\n\nThe rate of sepsis shot up more than 50% for women hospitalized when they lost their pregnancies in the second trimester, ProPublica found.\n\nThe surge in this life-threatening condition, caused by infection, was most pronounced for patients whose fetus may still have had a heartbeat when they arrived at the hospital.\n\nProPublica previously reported on two such cases in which miscarrying women in Texas died of sepsis after doctors delayed evacuating their uteruses. Doing so would have been considered an abortion.\n\nThe new reporting shows that, after the state banned abortion, dozens more pregnant and postpartum women died in Texas hospitals than had in pre-pandemic years, which ProPublica used as a baseline to avoid COVID-19-related distortions. As the maternal mortality rate dropped nationally, ProPublica found, it rose substantially in Texas.\n\nProPublica's analysis is the most detailed look yet at a rise in life-threatening complications for women losing a pregnancy after Texas banned abortion. It raises concerns that the same pattern may be occurring in more than a dozen other states with similar bans.\n\nTo chart the scope of pregnancy-related infections, ProPublica purchased and analyzed seven years of Texas' hospital discharge data.\n\nWhen abortion was legal in Texas, the rate of sepsis for women hospitalized during second-trimester pregnancy loss was relatively steady.\n\nThen the state's first abortion ban went into effect and the rate of sepsis spiked.\n\n\"This is exactly what we predicted would happen and exactly what we were afraid would happen,\" said Dr. Lorie Harper, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in Austin.\n\nShe and a dozen other maternal health experts who reviewed ProPublica's findings say they add to the  evidence that the state's abortion ban is leading to dangerous delays in care. Texas law threatens up to 99 years in prison for providing an abortion. Though the ban includes an exception for a \"medical emergency,\" the definition of what constitutes an emergency has been subject to confusion and debate.\n\nMany said the ban is the only explanation they could see for the sudden jump in sepsis cases.\n\nThe new analysis comes as Texas legislators consider amending the abortion ban in the wake of ProPublica's previous reporting, and as doctors, federal lawmakers and the state's largest newspaper have urged Texas officials to review pregnancy-related deaths from the first full years after the ban was enacted; the state maternal mortality review committee has, thus far, opted not to examine the death data for 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe standard of care for miscarrying patients in the second trimester is to offer to empty the uterus, according to leading medical organizations, which can lower the risk of contracting an infection and developing sepsis. If a patient's water breaks or her cervix opens, that risk rises with every passing hour.\n\nSepsis can lead to permanent kidney failure, brain damage and dangerous blood clotting. Nationally, it is one of the leading causes of deaths in hospitals.\n\nWhile some Texas doctors have told ProPublica they regularly offer to empty the uterus in these cases, others say their hospitals don't allow them to do so until the fetal heartbeat stops or they can document a life-threatening complication.\n\nLast year, ProPublica reported on the repercussions of these kinds of delays.\n\nForced to wait 40 hours as her dying fetus pressed against her cervix, Josseli Barnica risked a dangerous infection . Doctors didn't induce labor until her fetus no longer had a heartbeat.\n\nPhysicians waited, too, as Nevaeh Crain's organs failed . Before rushing the pregnant teenager to the operating room, they ran an extra test to confirm her fetus had expired.\n\nBoth women had hoped to carry their pregnancies to term, both suffered miscarriages and both died.\n\nIn response to their stories, 111 doctors wrote a letter to the Legislature saying the abortion ban kept them from providing lifesaving care and demanding a change.\n\n\"It's black and white in the law, but it's very vague when you're in the moment,\" said Dr. Tony Ogburn, an OB-GYN in San Antonio. When the fetus has a heartbeat, doctors can't simply follow the usual evidence-based guidelines, he said. Instead, there is a legal obligation to assess whether a woman's condition is dire enough to merit an abortion under a prosecutor's interpretation of the law.\n\nSome prominent Texas Republicans who helped write and pass Texas' strict abortion bans have recently said that the law should be changed to protect women's lives - though it's unclear if proposed amendments will receive a public hearing during the current legislative session.\n\nProPublica's findings indicate that the law is getting in the way of providing abortions that can protect against life-threatening infections, said Dr. Sarah Prager, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Washington.\n\n\"We have the ability to intervene before these patients get sick,\" she said. \"This is evidence that we aren't doing that.\"\n\nHealth experts, specially equipped to study maternal deaths, sit on federal agencies and state-appointed review panels. But, as ProPublica previously reported, none of these bodies have systematically assessed the consequences of abortion bans .\n\nSo ProPublica set out to do so, first by investigating preventable deaths , and now by using data to take a broader view, looking at what happened in Texas hospitals after the state banned abortion, in particular as women faced miscarriages.\n\n\"It is kind of mindblowing that even before the bans researchers barely looked into complications of pregnancy loss in hospitals,\" said perinatal epidemiologist Alison Gemmill, an expert on miscarriage at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nRead More\n\nIn consultation with Gemmill and more than a dozen other maternal health researchers and obstetricians, ProPublica built a framework for analyzing Texas hospital discharge data from 2017 to 2023, the most recent full year available. This billing data, kept by hospitals and collected by the state, catalogues what happens in every hospitalization. It is anonymized but remarkable in its granularity, including details such as gestational age, complications and procedures.\n\nTo study infections during pregnancy loss, ProPublica identified all hospitalizations that included miscarriages, terminations and births from the beginning of the second trimester up to 22 weeks' gestation, before fetal viability. Since first-trimester miscarriage is often managed in an outpatient setting, ProPublica did not include those cases in this analysis.\n\nWhen looking at stays for second-trimester pregnancy loss, ProPublica found a relatively steady rate of sepsis before Texas made abortion a crime. In late 2021, the state made it a civil offense to end a pregnancy after a fetus developed cardiac activity, and in the summer of 2022, the state made it a felony to terminate any pregnancy, with few exceptions.\n\nIn 2021, 67 patients who lost a pregnancy in the second trimester were diagnosed with sepsis - as in the previous years, they accounted for about 3% of the hospitalizations.\n\nIn 2022, that number jumped to 90.\n\nThe following year, it climbed to 99.\n\nProPublica's analysis was conservative and likely missed some cases. It doesn't capture what happened to miscarrying patients who were turned away from emergency rooms or those like Barnica who were made to wait, then discharged home before they returned with sepsis.\n\nOur analysis showed that patients who were admitted while their fetus was still believed to have a heartbeat were far more likely to develop sepsis.\n\nSepsis Rates Spiked for Patients Whose Initial Diagnosis Didn't Include Fetal Death\n\nFor patients in Texas hospitals who lost a pregnancy, about half were not diagnosed with fetal demise when they were admitted, meaning that their fetus may still have had a heartbeat at that time. Those patients saw a dramatic increase in sepsis after the state banned abortion.\n\n\"What this says to me is that once a fetal death is diagnosed, doctors can appropriately take care of someone to prevent sepsis, but if the fetus still has a heartbeat, then they aren't able to act and the risk for maternal sepsis goes way up,\" said Dr. Kristina Adams Waldorf, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UW Medicine and an expert in pregnancy complications. \"This is needlessly putting a woman's life in danger.\"\n\nStudies indicate that waiting to evacuate the uterus increases rates of sepsis for patients whose water breaks before the fetus can survive outside the womb, a condition called previable premature rupture of membranes or PPROM. Because of the risk of infection, major medical organizations like the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advise doctors to always offer abortions .\n\nResearchers in Dallas and Houston examined cases of previable pregnancy complications at their local hospitals after the state ban. Both studies found that when women weren't able to end their pregnancies right away, they were significantly more likely to develop dangerous conditions than before the ban. The study of the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston, not yet published, found that the rate of sepsis tripled after the ban.\n\nDr. Emily Fahl, a co-author of that study, recently urged professional societies and state medical boards to \"explicitly clarify\" that doctors need to recommend evacuating the uterus for patients with a PPROM diagnosis, even with no sign of infection, according to MedPage Today .\n\nUTHealth Houston did not respond to several requests for comment.\n\nProPublica zoomed out beyond the second trimester to look at deaths of all women hospitalized in Texas while pregnant or up to six weeks postpartum. Deaths peaked amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and most patients who died then were diagnosed with the virus. But looking at the two years before the pandemic, 2018 and 2019, and the two most recent years of data, 2022 and 2023, there is a clear shift:\n\nIn the two earlier years, there were 79 maternal hospital deaths.\n\nIn the two most recent, there were 120.\n\nCaitlin Myers, an economist at Middlebury College, said it's crucial to examine these deaths from different angles, as ProPublica has done. Data analyses help illuminate trends but can't reveal a patient's history or wishes, as a detailed medical chart might. Diving deep into individual cases can reveal the timeline of treatment and how doctors behave. \"When you see them together, it tells a really compelling story that people are dying as a result of the abortion restrictions.\"\n\nTexas has no plans to scrutinize those deaths. The chair of the maternal mortality review committee said the group is skipping data from 2022 and 2023 and picking up  its analysis with 2024 to get a more \"contemporary\" view of deaths . She added that the decision had \"absolutely no nefarious intent.\"\n\n\"The fact that Texas is not reviewing those years does a disservice to the 120 individuals you identified who died inpatient and were pregnant,\" said Dr. Jonas Swartz, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University. \"And that is an underestimation of the number of people who died.\"\n\nThe committee is also prohibited by law from reviewing cases that include an abortion medication or procedure, which can also be used during miscarriages. In response to ProPublica's reporting, a Democratic state representative filed a bill to overturn that prohibition and order those cases to be examined.\n\nBecause not all maternal deaths take place in hospitals and the Texas hospital data did not include cause of death, ProPublica also looked at data compiled from death certificates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIt shows that the rate of maternal deaths in Texas rose 33% between 2019 and 2023 even as the national rate fell by 7.5%.\n\nTexas' abortion law is under review this legislative session. Even the party that championed it and the senator who authored it say they would consider a change.\n\nOn a local television program last month, Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said the law should be amended .\n\n\"I do think we need to clarify any language,\" Patrick said, \"so that doctors are not in fear of being penalized if they think the life of the mother is at risk.\"\n\nState Sen. Bryan Hughes, who once argued that the abortion ban he wrote was \"plenty clear,\" has since reversed course , saying he is working to propose language to amend the ban. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told ProPublica, through a spokesperson, that he would \"look forward to seeing any clarifying language in any proposed legislation from the Legislature.\"\n\nPatrick, Hughes and Attorney General Ken Paxton did not respond to ProPublica's questions about what changes they would like to see made this session and did not comment on findings ProPublica shared.\n\nIn response to ProPublica's analysis, Abbott's office said in a statement that Texas law is clear and pointed to Texas health department data that shows 135 abortions have been performed since Roe was overturned without resulting in prosecution. The vast majority of the abortions were categorized as responses to an emergency but the data did not specify what kind. Only five were solely to \"preserve [the] health of [the] woman.\"\n\nAt least seven bills related to repealing or creating new exceptions to the abortion laws have been introduced in Texas.\n\nDoctors told ProPublica they would most like to see the bans overturned so all patients could receive standard care, including the option to terminate pregnancies for health considerations, regardless of whether it's an emergency. No list of exceptions can encompass every situation and risk a patient might face, obstetricians said.\n\n\"A list of exceptions is always going to exclude people,\" said Dallas OB-GYN Dr. Allison Gilbert.\n\nIt seems unlikely a Republican-controlled Legislature would overturn the ban. Gilbert and others are advocating to at least end criminal and civil penalties for doctors. Though no doctor has been prosecuted for violating the ban, the mere threat of criminal charges continues to obstruct care, she said.\n\nIn 2023, an amendment was passed that permitted physicians to intervene when patients are diagnosed with PPROM. But it is written in such a way that still exposes physicians to prosecution; it allows them to offer an \"affirmative defense,\" like arguing self-defense when charged with murder.\n\nRead More\n\n\"Anything that can reduce those severe penalties that have really chilled physicians in Texas would be helpful,\" Gilbert said. \"I think it will mean that we save patients' lives.\"\n\nRep. Mihaela Plesa, a Democrat from outside Dallas who filed a bill to create new health exceptions, said that ProPublica's latest findings were \"infuriating.\"\n\nShe is urging Republicans to bring the bills to a hearing for debate and discussion.\n\nLast session, there were no public hearings, even as women have sued the state after being denied treatment for their pregnancy complications. This year, though some Republicans appeared open to change, others have gone a different direction.\n\nOne recently filed a bill that would allow the state to charge women who get an abortion with homicide, for which they could face the death penalty.\n\nDo you live in a state that has passed laws affecting abortion in the last few years?

Cruz, who holds two Ivy League degrees and served as a clerk to the Chief Justice of the United States, is casting himself as an outsider against the \"Washington cartel\" in his bid to win the GOP nomination.\n\nCruz, a national debate champion at Princeton, made a name for himself at Harvard Law School as the man who organized a \"Republicans Take Back the House Party\" and tried to learn tennis to improve his chances of getting a clerkship with Chief Justice William Rehnquist. While Cruz landed the coveted job, he never quite mastered the game.\n\nIn 1998, Cruz served as the lawyer for Rep. John Boehner, the Ohio Republican who at the time was chairman of the House Republican Conference. Boehner sued Democratic Rep. Jim McDermott of Washington, alleging that McDermott leaked a recording of a GOP strategy phone call - involving Boehner and Newt Gingrich - which had been captured by a Florida couple using a police scanner. (Boehner won the suit in 2004, long after Cruz departed from the case.)\n\nCruz joined George W. Bush 's 2000 presidential campaign as a domestic policy aide. When the election became deadlocked, Cruz flew down to Florida to work on Bush's recount team (he met his wife, Heidi, on the trail). Years later, when Cruz was running for the GOP nomination against Bush's brother Jeb, George Bush said of Cruz, \"I just don't like the guy.\"\n\nAfter a brief stint as director of policy planning at the Federal Trade Commission, Cruz was appointed solicitor general of Texas in 2003. He turned the office into a high-profile platform for his favorite causes, and weighed in via amicus briefs on issues like the 2008 D.C. gun-rights case that had no direct bearing on the state of Texas. Cruz argued before the Supreme Court against the Bush administration for Texas's right to execute a Mexican national in Medellin v. Texas (he won) and for a controversial Texas redistricting plan that Democrats claimed was pure partisan gerrymandering , among other cases (he won that one, too, and Texas Republicans got to keep most of the new map).\n\nIn 2008, Cruz made the switch to private practice . When a Texas Senate seat opened in 2012, he ran against the GOP establishment's favored candidate, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. Riding a Tea Party wave and casting himself as an outsider and a fighter , Cruz managed to draw Dewhurst into a runoff and attract the attention-and money-of the conservative anti-tax group Club for Growth, which poured millions into his campaign. A New York Times report later revealed that Cruz got low-interest loans totaling $750,000 from Goldman Sachs (where his wife was an executive) and Citibank to help him spend more than $1 million of his own money on his campaign, loans that he didn't disclose to the Federal Election Commission. There was nothing improper about the loans themselves and Cruz's campaign said the omission on the federal finance reports was inadvertent.\n\nCruz won his Senate seat and wasted no time in alienating his Washington colleagues. He vehemently opposed the nomination of Chuck Hagel as Secretary of Defense, insinuating that Hagel accepted money that originated in countries including North Korea (even Republicans who opposed Hagel said those attacks went too far). Cruz helped precipitate the 2013 government shutdown with his vehement opposition to the Affordable Care Act, which included a 21-hour filibuster . In a nearly unheard-of breach of decorum, Cruz accused Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of telling a \" flat-out lie \" on the Senate floor.\n\nWhen the House GOP, led by Boehner, planned to approve $659 million to deal with unaccompanied minors at the border in the summer of 2014, Cruz worked the phones and met with House Republicans over pizza to help scuttle the legislation , earning him the nickname \"Speaker Cruz.\"\n\nA rundown of the best reporting on Donald Trump over the years. Read more.\n\nClinton has been in the public eye for four decades - and there have been investigative stories about her for nearly as long. Read more.\n\nHis Congressional colleagues, in turn, have called him a \" wacko bird ,\" a \" jackass ,\" and joked about getting away with his murder .\n\nTed Cruz was the first GOP candidate to announce his long-expected 2016 bid , working his \"outsider\" appeal and the religious angle. He repeatedly tells the story of his father, Rafael Cruz , on the trail-a Cuban-born immigrant and an alcoholic-turned-pastor who allegedly fought for Castro. However, a New York Times report claimed that those who knew Rafael Cruz at the time say his stories are exaggerated : The elder Cruz painted graffiti on walls and marched through the streets, but wasn't a rebel leader.\n\nIn another family matter, Cruz has spoken emotionally about his efforts to help his half-sister, who died after fighting drug addiction , and his nephew.\n\nAlthough the Canadian-born Cruz dropped his dual citizenship in 2014, he's been plagued by birther questions from Trump supporters. He also struggles with the perception in some quarters that he has run a dirty campaign .\n\nSarah Smith\n\nSarah Smith was a reporter covering housing, mental health, poverty and religion for ProPublica's South unit.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nSeries: Redistricting\n\nRedistricting is a hard-knuckled game, in which voters often lose. Here are the colorful, and telling, terms used by insiders.\n\nby Olga Pierce , Jeff Larson and Lois Beckett\n\nOpaque redistricting groups are being quietly bankrolled by corporations, unions and others to influence redistricting. They aim to help political allies - and in the process they're hurting voters.\n\nRedistricting should be a way of ensuring your vote counts. If all districts have roughly the same number of people in them and are drawn to respect natural communities - neighborhoods where people share a heritage, work in the same industry, or just generally feel tied to their neighbors - voters have a chance to be represented by politicians who represent their areas' collective interests.\n\nTo that end, states are required to redraw lines for districts, all the way from Congress to county boards of supervisors, every 10 years to reflect demographic changes.\n\nBut that's where theory meets the harsh reality. Instead of voters choosing politicians, redistricting at its worst lets politicians choose voters.\n\nCommunities can have their influence diluted or overly concentrated by line-drawers interested in partisan gain, limiting minorities' influence, or pleasing powerful interests. (See our earlier story, The Hidden Hands in Redistricting .) The right lines can all but guarantee an incumbent a decade's worth of electoral success, or alternatively can help send others into retirement.\n\nSuch shenanigans persist, despite the 1965 Voting Rights Act and subsequent legal decisions meant to limit them. Indeed, increased mapping technology and know-how have allowed for ever more subtle manipulation of district lines.\n\nHere's a rundown of the realities of redistricting, and the terms used by critics and insiders alike:\n\nCracking: This technique splits a community into multiple districts to ensure it doesn't have significant sway with a candidate. In the ugly racial history of redistricting, cracking was often used to ensure that African-Americans could not elect African-American politicians. The Voting Rights Act banned racially motivated cracking, with some success. But cracking is still common, with the goal now frequently to fracture communities for partisan gain.\n\nAustin: Texas Republicans, who control both the state legislature and the governor's office, approved very Republican-friendly congressional redistricting earlier this year. A case in point: liberal Austin, which the plan splits into six districts that radiate outward to encompass hundreds of miles of conservative suburban and rural territory. (The Justice Department recently moved in court to block the plan, but not because of cracking in Austin. Instead, the suit alleges, lawmakers tried deliberately to minimize the voices of minority voters. Lawyers defending the Texas plan on behalf of the state say it protects Latino incumbents and creates additional Latino-friendly districts.)\n\nRochester area: In the 2000 redistricting cycle, slow population growth cost New York State two congressional seats. In a backroom deal, Republicans and Democrats agreed to eliminate one seat each. As part of the deal, the Democrat-friendly Rochester area was creatively sliced into multiple districts so it would be represented by one Republican and one Democrat.\n\nThe 28th District is a wide and narrow ribbon along Lake Ontario that incorporates parts of the Rochester area and Buffalo, 75 miles away, and is represented by Democratic Congresswoman Louise Slaughter. The 29th District lumps another piece of the Rochester area into an Appalachian mountain district that spans 100 miles south, represented by Republican Tom Reed. New York is still in the midst of its latest redistricting, and it's an open question whether the Rochester area will be made whole again.\n\nPacking: When faced with too many unfriendly voters, it can also be a winning strategy to limit the damage by drawing them all into one district. The benefit for you is there are fewer of the voters you don't want in all the surrounding districts. When race is involved, redistricting pros call it bleaching .\n\nVoters in the packed district often lose out because no matter how large their influence in the district, they can only have sway with one representative. If the community members were spread over more districts, and had significant population in each, they could have the ear of multiple politicians.\n\nOrlando, Gainesville, Jacksonville: Florida's 3rd Congressional District scoops African-American neighborhoods out of three cities to form a district that has mostly swampland in between. Districts like this one, created in the 1990 redistricting cycle, helped African-American congressional candidates win historic victories. But the districts surrounding it are now much whiter, and thus more Republican, than ever before. Many credit the 1990 redistricting with turning Florida from a blue state to a red state.\n\nBirmingham, Montgomery: At 62 percent African-American, the Alabama 7th Congressional District was already a safe minority district. But when the Republican-controlled state legislature redistricted this year, they extended the district's tendrils further into Birmingham and Montgomery to carve out African-American neighborhoods and create a 64 percent African-American district. The result: The surrounding districts now have almost no African-American voters. Previously competitive, the districts are now safely Republicans.\n\nHijacking: If there's an incumbent you don't like, you can make their re-election difficult by putting them in a district with another incumbent to contend with. If you don't like either incumbent in the newly drawn district, even better, because only one can be re-elected. If the two incumbents are from your rival party, you can force a costly primary battle, weakening your likely opponent before general election.\n\nCleveland, Toledo: Which brings us to the curious case of Reps. Marcy Kaptur and Dennis Kucinich. Ideological kindred spirits, friends, and now incumbents in the same oddly-shaped district. A district the Republican state legislature appears to have designed by drawing a straight line connecting the two representatives' homes, 110 miles apart, in Toledo and Cleveland. Republicans in Ohio's state legislature have defended the new district maps, saying they don't break any laws.\n\nKidnapping: Most politicians have geographic political bases; places they came up in politics where they have supporters, political allies, donors and name recognition. But what if their home address ends up in a different district than their base? That can make re-election tough, as North Carolina Congressman Brad Miller is about to find out. A new district boundary adopted by the state legislature there elegantly sweeps out to cut his home in Raleigh out of his old district. Republicans in the state have said that gaining congressional seats is a goal of their redistricting effort.\n\nGerrymandering: Taken together, all of these handy techniques are known by this most famous redistricting term. In 1812, a Massachusetts governor named Eldridge Gerry was blamed for a redistricting plan designed to weaken the influence of the opposition Federalist party. The map, drawn to favor the Democratic-Republicans, included a long, squiggly district wrapped around the other districts like a salamander. The district, immortalized by a famous political cartoon, was dubbed the \"gerry-mander.\" (This was not fair to Gerry, since he was was not actually responsible for the map.) Gerrymandering has become the term of choice for all misbehavior in redistricting, but particularly refers to districts drawn in bizarre, wandering shapes for the benefit of particular politicians. A special subset of this is the sweetheart gerrymander, where incumbents of different parties collude to draw districts that make sure everyone stays in office.\n\nCorrection, November 2, 2011: An earlier version of this story stated that the City of Rochester was split into multiple districts. In fact, the city proper is entirely encompassed in the 28th congressional district. The urban area as defined by the U.S. Census, however, is split into four districts. This post has been updated accordingly.\n\nOlga Pierce\n\nOlga Pierce is a reporter at ProPublica, specializing in data-driven stories.\n\nJeff Larson\n\nJeff Larson is a reporter at ProPublica.\n\nLois Beckett\n\nLois Beckett is a ProPublica reporter covering politics, big data and information privacy issues.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "They Were Trying to Help Run Elections. Then They Got Criminally Investigated.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nIn the wake of the 2020 presidential election, Republican officials around the country have been giving increasing attention and resources to investigating election crimes. Most have focused on the alleged wrongdoing of voters.\n\nBut Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is also working a different angle: His office has been criminally investigating the people who help run elections.\n\nOver the past two years, Paxton's office opened at least 10 investigations into alleged crimes by election workers, a more extensive effort than previously known, according to records obtained by ProPublica. One of his probes was spurred by a complaint from a county GOP chair, who lost her reelection bid in a landslide. She then refused to certify the results, citing \"an active investigation\" by the attorney general.\n\nIn at least two of the cases, Paxton's office unsuccessfully tried to indict election workers , attempts that were first reported by the Austin American-Statesman. In the remaining eight investigations identified by ProPublica, it is unclear just how far the probes went. As of mid-October, none of the cases resulted in criminal charges.\n\nThe attorney general's office did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nMost of Paxton's investigations of election workers center on allegations of obstructing a poll watcher, which is banned by a controversial and recently expanded law that experts fear could open the door for turmoil in the election process. Texas is one of the few states where blocking the view or limiting the movements of poll watchers - partisan volunteers who monitor election sites - can bring criminal penalties. Obstruction is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail.\n\nExperts worry such investigations could exact a stiff price, chilling participation in the process, slowing down elections and fostering misinformation and distrust in the vote. These probes may be a harbinger of potential chaos in the midterms.\n\n\"To have law enforcement policing around and creating the perception that these elections are not secure is doing enormous damage to democracy,\" said Lorraine Minnite, a political scientist at Rutgers University, Camden who has studied voter fraud allegations.\n\nPaxton, who has been under a securities fraud indictment for seven years, has touted his eagerness to pursue election-related crimes . He created a unit dedicated to doing so five years ago, long before so-called election integrity units became a trend in Republican-controlled states. (He's denied wrongdoing in the ongoing securities fraud case.)\n\nBetween January 2020 and September 2022, records show, the office opened at least 390 cases looking into potential election crimes. That includes criminal investigations of both voters and election workers. It's not clear how many cases Paxton's office attempted to prosecute. But the records show that, like other prosecutors' efforts around the country, Paxton often comes up empty. His office secured five election-related convictions during that period.\n\nA skeptic of the legitimacy of President Joe Biden's election, Paxton has been soliciting tips from the public about the upcoming midterms, during which he will be operating with broad new powers. Last year, the Texas Legislature dramatically expanded the state's ability to pursue criminal sanctions against election officials. This year's midterms will be the first general election where law enforcement could use the new criminal statutes to prosecute.\n\nPaxton will also be sending a \"task force\" to Harris County, which contains Houston, a Democratic stronghold, to respond to \"legal issues\" with the election, according to a letter from the Texas secretary of state. Paxton is up for reelection in the midterms, in a race that polls indicate could be close .\n\nAmerica's voting system depends on the thousands of public employees and volunteers, often retirees, who do the tedious job of managing elections. Officials have long reported challenges in recruiting enough poll workers to run elections efficiently. Now, prospective poll workers may find themselves wrestling with the possibility of facing criminal charges.\n\nThis growing scrutiny and animosity have taken a toll. Officials have resigned en masse , as conspiracy theories and physical threats have increasingly become a part of the job. Over the last two years, roughly a third of Texas' election administrators have left their posts, according to the Texas secretary of state.\n\nPaxton's election worker investigations span large, heavily Democratic cities and deep-red rural counties alike. Some officials learned they were under scrutiny when they were contacted by sergeants in Paxton's office. Others told ProPublica they were unaware an investigation had occurred. At least five suspects were in their 60s or 70s. Several cases were prompted by a referral from the Texas secretary of state. Others stemmed from complaints made by small-town sheriffs or voters.\n\nSam Taylor, a spokesperson for the secretary of state, said the office is required to refer complaints to the attorney general if there is reasonable cause to believe a crime occurred.\n\nDana DeBeauvoir said she has already seen the impact of Paxton's efforts on the ground - and in her own life. She told ProPublica that in her 36 years as the top election official in Travis County, where Austin is located, nothing compared to the disruption she saw in the 2020 election.\n\nWhen an unmasked poll watcher named Jennifer Fleck began photographing the counting of ballots, which was against the rules, a volunteer asked her to leave. Fleck refused, then began screaming and banging on the window of the room where votes were being counted, DeBeauvoir said. Ultimately, the police arrived, arrested Fleck and charged her with criminal trespass.\n\nOfficers allegedly found that Fleck had a \"button camera on her shirt\" connected to a \"recording device that had been secreted in Fleck's pants,\" according to police records. Fleck also faces a perjury charge because she swore in an affidavit that she would not use recording devices. The case is pending.\n\nWeeks later, DeBeauvoir said, the county attorney informed her that Paxton's office had a different view of the incident: DeBeauvoir herself was now the subject of a criminal investigation. Attorneys advised her to not speak about the case.\n\n\"I never felt more alone,\" DeBeauvoir said. \"Everything that was being said was completely untrue. And I could not defend myself.\"\n\nThe next year, Paxton attempted to prosecute DeBeauvoir for obstructing a poll watcher, court records show. In an unusual move, when his office brought her case before a grand jury, prosecutors didn't do it in Travis County - where DeBeauvoir lives and the incident took place - but in a suburban county that is more conservative.\n\nYet, in a rarity for the criminal justice system, the grand jury in April 2021 declined to indict her.\n\n\"I was completely terrified\" by the investigation, DeBeauvoir said.\n\nFleck did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAmong the new powers Paxton will now be able to wield: The Legislature made it a felony for an election official to send a mail-in voting application to a person who didn't request one. It gave new authority to poll watchers, allowing them \"free movement\" around voting facilities. And it broadened the obstruction statute Paxton had used to try to prosecute officials like DeBeauvoir.\n\n\"We've seen this kind of onslaught of laws that are essentially treating voting booths like crime scenes,\" said Liz Avore, senior policy adviser at Voting Rights Lab, a nonprofit that analyzes election legislation. She said Texas' new poll-watching provisions could hamstring election officials who witness partisan volunteers harassing voters and make it hard to keep polling places \"a safe place for voters to cast their ballots.\"\n\nEven when investigations don't result in criminal charges, they can be used as a pretext to disrupt the election process.\n\nIn 2020, Cynthia Brehm was running for reelection as chair of the Bexar County Republican Party. She secured more votes than any other candidate in the March primary, but it was a close race and she'd have to go through a runoff to retain her seat. In June, Brehm made a Facebook post suggesting George Floyd's death was staged. Sen. Ted Cruz and other top Texas Republicans called for her to resign. Her chances were starting to look bleak.\n\nThen Brehm made a move that would have surprising consequences. She filed a complaint with Paxton's office about the election, records show, prompting the attorney general to open a criminal investigation into the county elections administrator.\n\nA police report details what the official stood accused of. First, that the primary results were incorrect. Second, that there were \"several other\" allegations \"that include obstructing poll watchers.\"\n\nIn July, Brehm lost in the runoff by 32 points. But as party chair, she held the authority to certify the results. She refused to do so - pointing to the fruits of her complaint.\n\n\"The Texas Attorney General has an active investigation ongoing into the results of the Primary Election,\" Brehm wrote in a press release justifying her decision. \"I Cynthia Brehm, have determined that every aspect of this election has been severely compromised.\"\n\nRead More\n\nIn response to a public records request, Paxton's office said the investigation into the elections administrator, Jacquelyn Callanen, is now closed. Brehm and Callanen did not respond to requests for comment. The winning candidate ultimately took over Brehm's post.\n\nAt least three suspects in Paxton's investigations were the top election officials in their counties, but his probes have also ensnared volunteers. In 2020, Robert Icsezen, a Houston-based attorney and self-described \"election nerd,\" volunteered to serve on his county's signature verification committee, which is responsible for checking the signatures on mail-in ballots. On Oct. 14, a poll watcher asked Icsezen to let her into the area where ballots were being processed, he said. He thought that wasn't permitted and turned her away. Later that morning, he received a call from a local official, who told him the secretary of state's office said he needed to let the poll watcher in. The woman never returned, Icsezen said.\n\nShortly thereafter, an officer in Paxton's election police unit contacted Icsezen. Assuming it was all a misunderstanding, Icsezen agreed to speak with him, he said.\n\nEight months later, Paxton's office brought the case before a grand jury and unsuccessfully tried to indict Icsezen for obstructing a poll watcher, records show.\n\n\"I have four kids,\" Icsezen told ProPublica. \"There could have been cops coming to my door to cuff me and take me away.\"\n\nHe will not volunteer to help in another election, he said.\n\nDo you have information about \"election integrity\" units that we should know?

Roger Adams, longtime pardon attorney at the Justice Department, acknowledges that lawmakers' support adds \"weight\" to applicants' prospects.\n\nby Dafna Linzer\n\nWhite criminals seeking presidential pardons are nearly four times as likely to succeed as people of color, a ProPublica examination has found.\n\nSecond of two parts. Part one here . This story was co-published with The Washington Post.\n\nDale Critz Jr. had millions riding on his bid for a presidential pardon . Scion of a prominent family in Savannah, Ga., Critz was poised to inherit the luxury car dealerships his grandfather had built in one of America's most historic cities.\n\nBut Critz's past blocked his way. Years earlier, while learning the ropes at an unrelated dealership in Florida, he took part in a scheme to falsify loan documents for low-income car buyers. He pleaded guilty in 1989 to a felony - a conviction that could have prevented him from owning the family business. Many automakers do not let felons run their franchises.\n\nSo in late 2000, Critz embarked on a campaign for forgiveness. He enlisted the help of Republican Rep. Jack Kingston, a family friend, Georgia neighbor, and regular recipient of political donations from Critz and his family.\n\nOver the next six years, Kingston personally pressed for Critz's pardon, writing the Justice Department and twice calling the top pardon official, Roger Adams. Adams's recommendations are first seen by the deputy attorney general and then sent to the White House for the president's approval or denial. In Critz's case, the deputy opposed the pardon, noting that Critz had lied on his pardon application and to the FBI during his background check, and the recommendation did not go to the White House.\n\nA year later, with a new deputy in place, Critz got what he wanted. On Dec. 21, 2006, he became, at 48, one of the youngest people pardoned by President George W. Bush.\n\nSince 2000, a total of 196 members of Congress - 126 Republicans and 70 Democrats - have written to the pardons office on behalf of more than 200 donors and constituents, according to copies of their letters obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. Many of the letters urged the White House and the Justice Department to take special note of felons whom lawmakers described as close friends.\n\nA statistical analysis of nearly 500 pardon applicants during the Bush administration suggests that advocacy makes a difference. Applicants with a member of Congress in their corner were three times as likely to win a pardon as those without such backing. Interviews and documents show a lawmaker's support can speed up a stalled application, counter negative information and ratchet up pressure for an approval.\n\nAdams, who ran the Justice Department's pardons office from 1998 to 2008, acknowledged the potential value of congressional letters. \"If the official does know the person,\" Adams said, \"it gives it some weight.\"\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman said that the agency would not comment on any individual cases but added that the process is not subject to influence.\n\n\"Any third party is free to express support for a pardon request, and those letters are part of the executive clemency file,\" the spokeswoman said. \"The title or position of the third party who expresses his support does not play a role in the review process.\"\n\nA ProPublica analysis of presidential pardons published Sunday revealed a pattern of racial disparities in pardon awards . The review found that white applicants were nearly four times as likely to receive pardons as all minorities combined. Congressional influence did not account for the racial disparity.\n\nOf the 54 applicants with congressional support for whom ProPublica was able to determine race, 47 were white, five were black and two were Hispanic.\n\nIn the case of Critz, who is white, his family gave Kingston $10,100 in the years before his pardon application in 2000. Since then it has given the congressman an additional $13,050.\n\nNeither Kingston nor any of the lawmakers who received campaign contributions voluntarily disclosed the donations in their letters to the pardons office.\n\nFor many members of Congress, a letter to the pardon lawyer is a routine constituent service. Pardons restore the right to own a firearm, sit on a jury or vote. Because felons are often denied professional licenses, a pardon can open the door to a new job or career advancement.\n\nBush began his presidency determined to prevent political interference in the granting of pardons. He had just witnessed a powerful example of how money and connections could mar the process: President Bill Clinton's last-minute pardon of Marc Rich , a fugitive financier whose ex-wife had donated large sums to the Clinton Presidential Library and the Democratic National Committee. Bush decided to rely more on career officials in the Justice Department's tiny pardons office.\n\n'You Just Can't Go There' Pardon applicants face extensive scrutiny. Officials review their personal, professional, marital and financial history. FBI agents interview friends and associates, even former spouses, and scour criminal records for offenses that applicants might have omitted. The Justice Department often solicits views from the sentencing judge and prosecutor. But no one takes note of campaign contributions made to members of Congress or other public officials writing in support of applicants. Some officials say this is by design, that it would be inappropriate for the White House or the Justice Department to research an applicant's political affiliation or history of donations. \"I truly did not want to know about campaign contributions and never allowed anyone on my staff to look at it,\" Adams said, \"because if you find that someone gave money, or didn't give money, then you can't have someone else wonder if that's part of the reason why they were recommended for a pardon or denied. You just can't go there.\" Congressional support does not ensure a pardon. In fact, the vast majority of applicants with congressional support failed, according to ProPublica's review of letters from members of Congress to the Justice Department and the White House. About 10 percent of Bush's 189 pardons went to people with congressional support. \"If a congressman called, you would listen to them,\" said Kenneth Lee, a former associate White House counsel who reviewed pardon cases during Bush's second term. \"Sometimes it was a prominent politician. Other times it was an anguished mother with a son in prison. It helped to the extent that I would open the file and look again, but rarely did it add useful information.\" Almost from their first day in office, lawyers in the Obama White House began receiving calls from members of Congress advocating pardons. \"One of the problems with the process was the inequality of access,\" said a former White House lawyer who asked to speak anonymously because he remains in government. \"People with resources hire lawyers, sometimes former U.S. attorneys or former White House lawyers. It's inherently unfair because the volume of applications is high and it's easy to pull one out of the stack with a call.\" A Close Call Critz's father and grandfather built the family dealerships in Savannah into a multimillion-dollar business. In the 1980s, hoping to gain experience, Critz went to Florida to work at a dealership outside the family orbit. Earning a promotion required selling as many as 20 cars per month. Critz, then in his mid-20s, fell in with a group of salesmen who developed a scheme to boost sales, records show. They placed newspaper ads appealing to customers with poor credit. When the potential buyers came in, the salesman put false income information on the loan applications. The deals went through and the salesmen met their quotas, but the purchasers were on the hook for payments they could not afford. Critz pleaded guilty in 1989 to falsifying one such loan, cooperated with federal prosecutors and testified against his co-workers. He was sentenced to three years' probation and allowed to live near his parents in Georgia. By 1993, Critz and his wife, Debbie, were featured in Savannah Magazine as one of the city's three \"power couples.\" Today, he is a well-known businessman and philanthropist who sponsors an annual half-marathon on Tybee Island in Kingston's district. He chaired the local United Way campaign and was appointed to two local boards by the Savannah City Council. Critz's good works made a case for his pardon, and he had need - two factors the pardons office considers. The federal conviction stood in the way of his taking over the family franchises, which included BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Buick dealerships. But federal officials investigating his application were disturbed by other aspects of his life, including a 1975 drunken-driving conviction and a 1982 arrest for allegedly standing on a car and being disrespectful to a police officer. On his pardon application, Critz failed to disclose those events, according to Justice Department memos. During an FBI interview, he also failed to mention that between 1998 and 2000, he had used a firearm to hunt birds. Agents had discovered that he had a hunting license during that period. Federally convicted felons are barred from possessing firearms. In addition, Critz's driver's license had been suspended three times before his 1989 conviction. In the years that followed, he was cited for speeding or other traffic violations 10 times. Kingston vouched for Critz in a 2003 letter to Adams . Describing Critz as an \"exemplary citizen,\" Kingston wrote, \"I have known Dale for twelve years and believe that he deserves a pardon.\" The congressman also shared a copy of the letter with Paul Murphy, then associate deputy attorney general and one of Adams's bosses at the Justice Department. Murphy forwarded the letter to Adams with a note: \"Let's discuss when you have a moment.\" In May 2003, Critz's attorney, John Hogan, who had worked at the Justice Department during the Clinton administration, called Adams to plead his client's case. Two months later, the U.S. attorney in Savannah, Richard Thompson, offered his unsolicited view to the pardon office - h \ne \"wholeheartedly'' and \"unequivocally\" endorsed Critz's application. Former Justice Department officials said this was unusual because the case had been prosecuted by federal officials in Florida. Persuaded, Adams recommended Critz for pardon. In 2005, Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey stayed up late one night to review pardon recommendations. He read Critz's - and spiked it. \"I am strongly opposed to this pardon,\" Comey wrote in an e-mail to his chief of staff the next morning. Comey was \"troubled,\" he wrote, by Critz's \"lack of candor about his prior convictions and his repeated driving offenses, as well as his illegal possession of a firearm. In short, he lied to the FBI during the pardon interview and lied to the Pardon Attorney on his application.\" Comey noted that Thompson, the Savannah prosecutor who wrote in support of Critz, resigned in 2004 after an internal Justice Department investigation determined he had misused his office to support a fellow Republican. \"A pardon is an act of grace, and so it was always important to me to see how the person conducted himself during the pardon application,\" Comey said in a recent interview. \"If you are going to pick a slice of life for them to be on their best behavior, this is it.\" Comey's dissent could have been the end for Critz, but it proved only a temporary setback. Two months after Comey resigned from the department, Associate White House Counsel Brett Gerry was nudging Adams for more pardon candidates. Adams suggested Critz, who had not yet been formally denied. In a memo to Comey's successor, Paul McNulty, Adams vouched personally and in writing that the likelihood of Critz \"ever committing another crime is almost nonexistent.\" A copy of his positive recommendation for Critz was enclosed. Three months later, Critz's pardon was official. In an email, Critz said he did \"not wish to be interviewed or to answer any questions\" for this story. Adams said he does not remember the specifics of the Critz case, only that it was a \"close call.\" \"If Comey recommended no, he probably had a good reason for it,\" Adams said. \"On the other hand, Paul McNulty recommended for it, and he's a man of goodwill as well.\" Adams said seeking a pardon to inherit property or win a franchise was a compelling reason. \"If the need is for licensing or business ownership or to obtain a franchise, that will help and the office will try to push [the case] further,\" he said. Adams also said an applicant's honesty in the process was significant. \"In some applications, unfortunately, the person is just not that honest about the extent of involvement in the offense or dishonest about other things,\" he said. \"Cases that showed dishonesty like that probably won't go in the right direction.\" But Critz's did. And the pardon worked. Today, Critz is the president and owner of the family business. Texas Ties The Critz family's campaign donations to Kingston took place over the course of many years. In the case of David B. McCall Jr., longtime relationships with elected officials also made a difference. McCall, a former mayor of Plano, Tex., who later became a banker, pleaded guilty in 1996 for falsifying loan records at his local savings and loan. He served six months in prison, spent five years on probation and paid $100,000 in restitution. In 2003, at age 79, McCall was dying from colon cancer. Citing health reasons, his sons embarked on an urgent quest for a pardon. They reached out to every high-placed official they knew, starting at the very top. \"We had a Texan in the White House,\" said McCall's son David McCall III. \"My brother Brian was in the state legislature. He had served and become well acquainted with the general counsel for the president, Alberto Gonzales, and he knew the president as well, so Brian took that half of it.\" David McCall III said he contacted Rep. Ralph M. Hall, who was then a Democrat, and two Republicans, Rep. Sam Johnson and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. Hall had known David McCall Jr. and his wife for more than 20 years. \"My mother and father went to state Democratic conventions with the Halls years before,\" the younger McCall said. The family relationship with Hutchison went back further. The elder McCall's sisters worked for Hutchison when she owned a candy company before entering politics. At the family's request, Hutchison and Hall served as character references for McCall in late December 2003. David McCall III said he believes the Texas Republicans also spoke directly to Bush about their efforts. In the following weeks, the McCall family gave $2,500 to Hutchison, campaign finance records show. Hall received $1,350, including one contribution three days before he wrote a personal letter to Gonzales on behalf of David McCall Jr.. The McCall family had a history of donating to Hutchison and Hall predating the pardon application. On Valentine's Day 2004, McCall became Bush's 12th pardon. The president personally called McCall's son Brian with the news. \"He was given the pardon on a Saturday and died on Tuesday,\" his son David recalled. Ten days later, the McCall family gave Hall an additional $1,650. Hutchison received another $1,000 on March 11, 2004, records show. One year later, Hutchison received another $11,400 in political contributions from the McCalls. It was the largest amount of money from the McCalls in a single year to Hutchison, who has received $21,400 from the family in all. Hall has received $5,750. \"It didn't have anything to do with the money they gave me,\" Hall said. \"I was in their district and expected them to support me, but that wasn't why I supported his pardon.\" Hall, who switched parties in early 2004 to become a Republican, said he was a believer in forgiveness and had written on behalf of five other applicants. Adams, the pardon attorney, said McCall's request had initially gone directly to the White House, but Associate White House Counsel Jennifer Brosnahan referred it to the Justice Department for review. \"We did do it within two to three business days, including the FBI background investigation,\" Adams recalled. It was an \"easy case,\" Adams said. \"It was the only thing he had ever done, he was close to death, and so there was no chance he would do anything wrong again.\" But internal Justice Department records show that there were concerns about granting McCall's request. Michael Savage, the assistant U.S. attorney who had prosecuted McCall, opposed the pardon. Savage said he spoke with McCall's son and believed that the family and \"a member of the Texas congressional delegation were attempting to circumvent the usual clemency process,\" according to Justice Department records. Matthew Orwig, then the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Texas, initially opposed the pardon because normal procedures were not followed, a Justice Department memo states. Facing a possible denial, the Justice Department agreed to a more thorough look. It worked. The FBI completed a background check, though McCall was too sick to be interviewed. With the pardons office involved, Orwig changed his views and supported the application, according to Justice Department memos. \"It was handled fast because the White House wanted it handled fast,\" Adams said in an interview. McCall's son David said that the family was grateful for the congressional support and that the money had little to do with it. \"I don't think they were substantial donations in the scheme of things,\" he said. \"We had supported Hall and Hutchison for 20 years or more.\" He said applicants of lesser means deserve the same treatment. \"I think members of Congress should weigh in on pardons and they ought to help people back at home,\" McCall said. \"Sometimes justice fails us and there are inequities.\" Although the pardons office routinely denies applicants who claim they are victims of injustice, McCall said his father had been innocent. \"We never thought he was guilty of anything,\" he said, \"and my father didn't think he was guilty, either.\" ProPublica writer Jennifer LaFleur and researchers Liz Day and Robin Respaut contributed to this report. Correction, Dec. 4, 2011: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that David B. McCall Jr. was convicted in 1996 of falsifying loan records. McCall pleaded guilty to that charge on Oct. 10, 1996. A judgment and sentencing were entered on Jan. 17, 1997. The article also misstated the timing of his family's quest for a pardon; the effort began seven years, not 24 years, after his conviction.\n\nPardon applicants face extensive scrutiny.

He read Critz's - and spiked it. \"I am strongly opposed to this pardon,\" Comey wrote in an e-mail to his chief of staff the next morning.\n\nComey was \"troubled,\" he wrote, by Critz's \"lack of candor about his prior convictions and his repeated driving offenses, as well as his illegal possession of a firearm. In short, he lied to the FBI during the pardon interview and lied to the Pardon Attorney on his application.\"\n\nComey noted that Thompson, the Savannah prosecutor who wrote in support of Critz, resigned in 2004 after an internal Justice Department investigation determined he had misused his office to support a fellow Republican.\n\n\"A pardon is an act of grace, and so it was always important to me to see how the person conducted himself during the pardon application,\" Comey said in a recent interview. \"If you are going to pick a slice of life for them to be on their best behavior, this is it.\"\n\nComey's dissent could have been the end for Critz, but it proved only a temporary setback. Two months after Comey resigned from the department, Associate White House Counsel Brett Gerry was nudging Adams for more pardon candidates. Adams suggested Critz, who had not yet been formally denied.\n\nIn a memo to Comey's successor, Paul McNulty, Adams vouched personally and in writing that the likelihood of Critz \"ever committing another crime is almost nonexistent.\" A copy of his positive recommendation for Critz was enclosed. Three months later, Critz's pardon was official.\n\nIn an email, Critz said he did \"not wish to be interviewed or to answer any questions\" for this story.\n\nAdams said he does not remember the specifics of the Critz case, only that it was a \"close call.\"\n\n\"If Comey recommended no, he probably had a good reason for it,\" Adams said. \"On the other hand, Paul McNulty recommended for it, and he's a man of goodwill as well.\"\n\nAdams said seeking a pardon to inherit property or win a franchise was a compelling reason.\n\n\"If the need is for licensing or business ownership or to obtain a franchise, that will help and the office will try to push [the case] further,\" he said.\n\nAdams also said an applicant's honesty in the process was significant. \"In some applications, unfortunately, the person is just not that honest about the extent of involvement in the offense or dishonest about other things,\" he said. \"Cases that showed dishonesty like that probably won't go in the right direction.\"\n\nBut Critz's did.\n\nAnd the pardon worked. Today, Critz is the president and owner of the family business.\n\nTexas Ties\n\nThe Critz family's campaign donations to Kingston took place over the course of many years. In the case of David B. McCall Jr., longtime relationships with elected officials also made a difference.\n\nMcCall, a former mayor of Plano, Tex., who later became a banker, pleaded guilty in 1996 for falsifying loan records at his local savings and loan. He served six months in prison, spent five years on probation and paid $100,000 in restitution.\n\nIn 2003, at age 79, McCall was dying from colon cancer. Citing health reasons, his sons embarked on an urgent quest for a pardon. They reached out to every high-placed official they knew, starting at the very top.\n\n\"We had a Texan in the White House,\" said McCall's son David McCall III. \"My brother Brian was in the state legislature. He had served and become well acquainted with the general counsel for the president, Alberto Gonzales, and he knew the president as well, so Brian took that half of it.\"\n\nDavid McCall III said he contacted Rep. Ralph M. Hall, who was then a Democrat, and two Republicans, Rep. Sam Johnson and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n\nHall had known David McCall Jr. and his wife for more than 20 years. \"My mother and father went to state Democratic conventions with the Halls years before,\" the younger McCall said.\n\nThe family relationship with Hutchison went back further. The elder McCall's sisters worked for Hutchison when she owned a candy company before entering politics.\n\nAt the family's request, Hutchison and Hall served as character references for McCall in late December 2003. David McCall III said he believes the Texas Republicans also spoke directly to Bush about their efforts.\n\nIn the following weeks, the McCall family gave $2,500 to Hutchison, campaign finance records show. Hall received $1,350, including one contribution three days before he wrote a personal letter to Gonzales on behalf of David McCall Jr.. The McCall family had a history of donating to Hutchison and Hall predating the pardon application.\n\nOn Valentine's Day 2004, McCall became Bush's 12th pardon. The president personally called McCall's son Brian with the news.\n\n\"He was given the pardon on a Saturday and died on Tuesday,\" his son David recalled.\n\nTen days later, the McCall family gave Hall an additional $1,650. Hutchison received another $1,000 on March 11, 2004, records show. One year later, Hutchison received another $11,400 in political contributions from the McCalls. It was the largest amount of money from the McCalls in a single year to Hutchison, who has received $21,400 from the family in all. Hall has received $5,750.\n\n\"It didn't have anything to do with the money they gave me,\" Hall said. \"I was in their district and expected them to support me, but that wasn't why I supported his pardon.\"\n\nHall, who switched parties in early 2004 to become a Republican, said he was a believer in forgiveness and had written on behalf of five other applicants.\n\nAdams, the pardon attorney, said McCall's request had initially gone directly to the White House, but Associate White House Counsel Jennifer Brosnahan referred it to the Justice Department for review.\n\n\"We did do it within two to three business days, including the FBI background investigation,\" Adams recalled. It was an \"easy case,\" Adams said. \"It was the only thing he had ever done, he was close to death, and so there was no chance he would do anything wrong again.\"\n\nBut internal Justice Department records show that there were concerns about granting McCall's request. Michael Savage, the assistant U.S. attorney who had prosecuted McCall, opposed the pardon. Savage said he spoke with McCall's son and believed that the family and \"a member of the Texas congressional delegation were attempting to circumvent the usual clemency process,\" according to Justice Department records.\n\nMatthew Orwig, then the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Texas, initially opposed the pardon because normal procedures were not followed, a Justice Department memo states.\n\nFacing a possible denial, the Justice Department agreed to a more thorough look.\n\nIt worked. The FBI completed a background check, though McCall was too sick to be interviewed. With the pardons office involved, Orwig changed his views and supported the application, according to Justice Department memos.\n\n\"It was handled fast because the White House wanted it handled fast,\" Adams said in an interview.\n\nMcCall's son David said that the family was grateful for the congressional support and that the money had little to do with it.\n\n\"I don't think they were substantial donations in the scheme of things,\" he said. \"We had supported Hall and Hutchison for 20 years or more.\" He said applicants of lesser means deserve the same treatment. \"I think members of Congress should weigh in on pardons and they ought to help people back at home,\" McCall said. \"Sometimes justice fails us and there are inequities.\"\n\nAlthough the pardons office routinely denies applicants who claim they are victims of injustice, McCall said his father had been innocent. \"We never thought he was guilty of anything,\" he said, \"and my father didn't think he was guilty, either.\"\n\nProPublica writer Jennifer LaFleur and researchers Liz Day and Robin Respaut contributed to this report.\n\nCorrection, Dec. 4, 2011: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that David B. McCall Jr. was convicted in 1996 of falsifying loan records. McCall pleaded guilty to that charge on Oct. 10, 1996. A judgment and sentencing were entered on Jan. 17, 1997. The article also misstated the timing of his family's quest for a pardon; the effort began seven years, not 24 years, after his conviction.\n\nDafna Linzer\n\nDafna Linzer was a senior reporter at ProPublica.

      "text": "Renegade Lawmakers May Be No Match for Trump's GOP\n\nThis article is part of the The DC Brief, TIME's politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox every weekday.\n\nThe legislation seemed unstoppable. The political party in the majority in the state capitol was hellbent on pushing through a partisan policy that no amount of reasoning, organizing or shouting was going to stop. So the lawmakers in the minority packed their bags and fled not just the statehouse, but the state entirely. The Governor threatened arrests if lawmakers didn't get back to work.\n\nSounds familiar, right?\n\nWell, that story isn't from Texas . We're talking about Oregon, where in 2019 and again in 2020 Republican lawmakers decided that they'd rather flee to Idaho than let Democrats have a quorum to pass climate-change legislation. Passports in hand and holed up in rural cabins, the Republicans wouldn't come back until the ambitious climate-change legislation fell off the calendar. Democrats abandoned their dreams and Oregon's Democratic Governor signed an executive order enacting the policies but remains subject to repeal from her successors.\n\nBut Oregon Democrats are not Texas Republicans. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden's activist fight for climate change pales next to former President Donald Trump's obsession with making it more difficult to vote in the name of eliminating so-called voting fraud that didn't make a lick of difference in his loss last year.\n\nIt's bad money to expect Texas Republicans to make a concession similar to Oregon Democrats' fall-back. Republicans control Texas politics at the moment and they are betting that most Lone Star State residents support their agenda. They are in a special session pushing an agenda that would limit voting rights in addition to a laundry list of conservatives' wishes including a ban on teaching critical race theory and reducing access to bail bonds for those accused of crimes. And judging from their ability to hold on despite new waves of blue, they may be in a very durable position this year and for years to come.\n\nSo why does anyone beyond Texas or Oregon care about these scofflaw lawmakers? The state legislatures in this country are uncomfortably uniform right now. After the 2018 elections, the number of states with divided control of the legislature hit a scant one in Minnesota, the lowest number since 1914. In other words, Red States are really red and Blue States are really blue. Minnesota remained the hold-out divided legislature again after the 2020 elections once again sent the two parties further into their partisan corners. Only 11 states don't have their state House, state Senate and Governorship under one-party rule.\n\nPolitical scientists, pragmatists and good-government nerds alike have all been bemoaning the effects of this polarization. The threat of intra-party primaries typically keeps the professional politician stuck in partisan orthodoxy. The one-party rule doesn't set up much room for compromise. And while Democrats-in state legislatures and at the U.S. Capitol alike-believe there is a good-faith compromise to be found, Republicans have shown time and time again that there's no incentive for them to do that. Just look at the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick Garland that went nowhere , the attempts to win GOP votes on immigration or many economic stimulus packages , let alone middle-of-the-road tries on guns , health care or even saying Joe Biden is the rightful President of the United States. There simply aren't a lot of-or even any, sometimes-Republicans willing to risk their hides. Those who do end up like Rep. Liz Cheney , booted from her position in Leadership, or booed like Rep. Adam Kinzinger .\n\nStill, Texas Democrats are underfoot as of last night. They landed at Dulles Airport, outside of Washington, and vowed to stay out of Austin until the special legislative session ends. Which they can do, barring Abbott dispatching Texas police to find them and haul them back to Texas. But Abbott can similarly call another special session after this one ends, which is in his power and stands to catch a lot of lawmakers in a never-ending loop unless and until someone blinks.\n\nTexas Democrats who hoofed it here to Washington are looking to boost the urgency of federal voting-rights legislation with their comrades who haven't exactly embraced their calls for it. President Joe Biden is giving a speech today in Philadelphia on the matter, and he's previously met with Texas and national lawmakers to talk about voting rights with civil rights leaders. But this simply has more energy in opposition on the Right than the Left has, thus far, been able to muster. Folks like Stacey Abrams have tried to clear the way for compromise with the proposal put forward by Sen. Joe Manchin on behalf of the centrists in his party, but it isn't sufficient.\n\nTrump is against it all, and thus so are Republicans, though there is exactly zero evidence that voter fraud cost Trump the election last year or made any difference in any state. Even Trump's own Attorney General has said so. But it's feeding Trump's rage, and thus it is tolerated even if privately mocked at the Republican National Committee. Trump remains the most powerful figure in the Republican Party, a king-maker and prince-slayer. So if he wants voting restrictions, Republicans will give it to him.\n\nBut there's a greater cost to all of this. Most Americans just want to believe their government can work for them. The massive government spending during COVID-19 helped a whole lot of Americans stay in their homes, keep their businesses open and figure out just how to pay the bills. Washington wasn't perfect, but it brought stability.\n\nNow, as it seems-probably wrongly-the worst of the pandemic is passing, and partisans are getting back into old habits. Any time politicians resort to tricks over truth to win an outcome is a tough day to stand up and defend a system allegedly rooted in meritocracy. If you're going to lambast about the \"stolen\" Garland nomination, you also need to lambast Texas Democrats taking their ball and going to D.C. If you're going to stan Texas Democrats for using their technical rules to block-or, really, delay-Abbott's voting crackdown, then you can't really carry too much contempt for the political theater Republicans summoned when they said without reason that Biden shouldn't be certified as President. In the absence of morals or ethics, if you rely solely on neutral rules to govern a system, there are pitfalls if the rules remain static. Just look at the gnashing on the Hill right now over the filibuster. If you live by the rules, you also have to die by them.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the daily D.C.

      "text": "How Republicans Learned to Love Tough Immigration Rhetoric\n\nW hen a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit hears arguments on Wednesday on whether to block a Texas law that allows police officers to arrest suspected undocumented immigrants, it will be just the latest chapter in the state's wrangling with the federal government over immigration and border policy. In February, Republican governors from around the country converged on the Texas border with Mexico to protest the Biden Administration's purportedly lackadaisical border policies and to flex their conservative muscles in front of a national audience. Texas Governor Greg Abbott rolled out the red carpet and welcomed their support for his crusade against the federal government, which has even included defying a Supreme Court edict to remove razor wire from areas along the border.\n\nThe gathering was both eerily similar to-and distinctly different from-a bipartisan meeting in 2005 in Texas that brought together governors concerned about violence at the border. There, governors Rick Perry (R-Tex.), Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), and Arnold Schwarzenegger (R-Calif.) stood together to oppose the mistreatment of migrants, both documented and undocumented, and pledged to take more responsibility for border security. \"One of the greatest challenges our nations face is cutting off the drug trade and ending the violence that it has brought to both sides of the border,\" Perry said .\n\nPerry's statement reflected the rather moderate line Republicans took on border security and immigration in those days. But times were already changing. Beginning in the mid-1990s, Republicans, especially in border states like Texas, recognized that hammering the federal government on security could be a major plus politically. Importantly, however, the tough rhetoric of Republicans like Perry was paired with moderate policy. Yet, increasingly, this combination did not go far enough for Republican base voters. This became evident when Perry ran for president in 2012, presaging the rise of Donald Trump, with his even harsher rhetoric and far more draconian policy.\n\nBorder state Republicans have a long history of assailing the federal government on many issues.\n\nAnd few states have more of a love-hate relationship with Washington, D.C., than Texas, especially over coastal land and borders. The agreement that brought Texas into the Union in 1845 permitted the state to keep all of its land, including setting the boundary three leagues (about 10 miles) from shore-which gave Texas roughly 2.5 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico. Yet, during the first half of the 20th century, the federal government initiated several cases challenging Texas's right to these lands. The \"tidelands controversy\" was so important that in 1952, conservative Democratic Governor Allan Shivers backed Republican Presidential candidate Dwight Eisenhower, after the latter promised to support the state in the dispute (he followed through in 1953).\n\nShivers' decision split the Democratic Party into liberal and conservative wings. They'd remain in uneasy tension for decades, with the conservative wing often haranguing the federal government. Gradually, as Republicans became more viable in Texas politics, conservative Democratic began switching parties.\n\nPerry epitomized this pattern. He joined the state legislature in 1984 as a conservative Democrat. In 1989, he switched parties, sensing that his brand of anti-federal power conservatism was now far more at home in the GOP. The following year, he became the first Republican to win the position of Agriculture Commissioner-often a stepping stone for ambitious politicians.\n\nOnce in statewide office, Perry capitalized on the value of railing against federal intrusion into state affairs in a state rapidly swinging to the right. The Agriculture Commissioner opposed federal regulations advanced by the Environmental Protection Agency, claiming that they burdened farmers, and assailed the water use restrictions of the federal Endangered Species Act in parched central Texas. This was largely rhetoric-the Agriculture Secretary had few tools to fight back-but the stage was set for conflict.\n\nOne issue where Perry didn't reflexively attack the federal government, however, was immigration and the border. His new party was divided on the topic and he recognized the need to court Latinos-soon to be a massive voting bloc in Texas. On one side of the GOP stood conservatives like former President Ronald Reagan who had suggested , \"Rather than talking about putting up a fence...Why don't we work out some recognition of our mutual problems?\" The other side included hardliner conservatives like Pat Buchanan, who won roughly a quarter of the votes in the Republican Presidential primary in 1992 with his right-wing populist rhetoric, including proposals to increase the Border Patrol and build \" structures \" necessary to secure the border.\n\nTexas Republicans, including Perry and George W. Bush, who captured the governorship in 1994,  tended to side with Reagan's approach. Once Bush left for the White House in 2001, Perry continued the former governor's moderate immigration policy by signing the Texas Dream Act, which provided the state's eligible undocumented immigrants with access to in-state tuition and state financial aid. Even at the 2005 border governor meeting, Perry objected to congressional funding for 700 miles of border fencing, saying it would be ineffective. \"If you build a 30-foot wall or fence, the 32-foot-ladder business is going to get real good,\" he said .\n\nBut nationally, Buchanan's wing of the GOP was beginning to wrest control of the party. In 2006, House Republicans-in opposition to President Bush's calls for a balanced approach to immigration-took a more punitive stance , introducing legislation to make it a felony to be in the country illegally.\n\nThe actions of Bush and Perry in 2006 epitomized the shift. Bush bowed to political reality and announced \"Operation Jump Start,\" which deployed National Guard troops to the border to help stop illegal immigration. Perry praised his former running mate, but reflecting the shift in gravity on the issue, he also made clear that , \"Texas cannot wait for the federal government to implement needed border security measures.\" He increased state law enforcement presence along the border and provided new investigative tools.\n\nThe election of Barack Obama cemented opposition to Washington as a key wedge issue for Republicans like Perry. The Texas governor sensed an opportunity to assail the federal government, not only for failing to secure the border, but also for violating states' rights by taking solutions out of their hands.\n\nEven so, Perry's anti-federal government rhetoric on immigration issues was more temperate than his screeds on other issues like taxes, reflecting the old moderate approach to the issue. At one 2009 anti-tax rally, for example, Perry vaguely suggested that secession might be an option if Washington continued to \"thumb their nose at the American people.\"\n\nBut Perry grasped that GOP politics had changed and he had to move rightward on immigration to satisfy the GOP base. Of Obama, he said in 2014 , \"I don't believe he particularly cares whether or not the border of the United States is secure,\" then declined an offer to meet the President for what the governor termed \"a quick handshake on the tarmac,\" instead suggesting the pair hold a \"substantive meeting.\" (In fact, they did meet, with a grim-faced Perry expressing his distrust on his face.) In addition to hammering Obama, Perry secured state and federal funding for \"Operation Rio Grande,\" a wide-ranging series of border security operations that went beyond what the federal government was doing.\n\nPolitically, Perry's newly tough actions and harsh attacks on the Obama administration worked like a charm. Texas voters rejected cuts to border security spending during the Great Recession and a supermajority approved of tightening U.S. border security by 2013.\n\nYet, Perry never fully renounced the more compassionate stance toward undocumented immigrations that had once been a staple of Texas Republican politics. On a presidential debate stage in 2011, he said people who opposed in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants have \" no heart .\"  This damaged Perry's candidacy and foreshadowed what was to come.\n\nFour years later, as Donald Trump rose to prominence with tough immigration rhetoric and promises of draconian action, it became clear how out of step Perry was on the issue. He shouldn't have been surprised given that he, along with other border governors and Texas politicians were the first to uncover the basic formula that Trump perfected for capturing the hearts and minds of GOP voters. Assailing the federal government on immigration is political gold for Republicans-as Trump is proving once again in 2024 with his campaign promises.\n\nBrandon Rottinghaus is a professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Houston.

      "text": "In Deep-Red Texas, National Democrats See Ted Cruz as a Potential 2024 Target\n\nF ive years ago, a punk rock, skateboarding Democratic phenom named Beto O'Rourke seemed like he might unseat Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. As liberals around the country went starry-eyed over his viral speeches, O'Rourke raised more than $80 million and lost by less than 3%. The former congressman went on to a failed presidential bid , and then lost a gubernatorial race last year by more than ten points.\n\nNow, Cruz is back up for reelection and national Democrats must decide if they can continue to justify pouring their resources into a state that's repeatedly let them down. No Democrat has won statewide in Texas since 1994, when Lieutenant Governor Bob Bullock was reelected. And Texas Republicans won resoundingly in last year's midterms. With Democrats nervous about holding on to their slim Senate majority in 2024, national Democratic groups may be slow to invest in the Lone Star State. But a number of factors, including Cruz's polarizing reputation, means the race could once again draw big money.\n\n\"You're calling at a good time, because I think a lot of us are changing our attitude right now,\" says Alex Morgan, the president of Progressive Turnout Project, which poured more than half a million dollars into a get-out-the-vote mail program for O'Rourke in 2018. \"With Colin Allred jumping in the race, I think Texas becomes our best pick-up opportunity in the U.S. Senate this year.\"\n\nAllred, a former NFL linebacker who made it to Congress after defeating a longtime Republican incumbent in a swing district in 2018, launched his campaign against Cruz on Wednesday. His introductory video , which highlighted his biography and bipartisan wins, recounted his experience inside the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and trashed Cruz as \"all hat, no cattle,\" quickly garnered millions of views on social media. Allred announced Thursday evening that his Senate campaign had raised more than $2 million in its first 36 hours.\n\nAlthough other Democrats are expected to vie for the chance to be the nominee, Cruz was quick to sic his supporters on Allred as an immediate threat.\n\n\"We can't let a radical leftist like Colin Allred flip our state blue in 2024,\" Cruz tweeted on Wednesday, with a link to a fundraising page.\n\nDemocrats face a tough Senate map this cycle, with at least seven Democratic-held seats at risk in battleground states. Losing just one could give Republicans control of the chamber. That means resources will already be spread thin. Yet party leaders are on the lookout for possible pickups, and the two clearest opportunities are Florida, which has only seemed to get redder over the past few years, and Texas.\n\nIn an interview with CQ Roll Call published Thursday morning, Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota, the vice chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, named Texas when asked about a place on the 2024 Senate map where Democrats could go on the offensive, saying the state was \"like Georgia was a few years ago.\"\n\n\"Democrats will look for every opportunity to put Republicans on defense, including in states like Texas,\" a DSCC aide tells TIME.\n\nDespite well over a decade of unfulfilled hopes among Democrats that Texas might finally turn blue, no one who spoke to TIME for this story was ready to write the state off as a lost cause. Harvey Kronberg, the publisher of Quorum Report , an insider newsletter on Texas politics, thinks that Democrats' long history of losses could end with a star candidate who knows how to land jabs at an opponent and use radio and TV to their advantage-areas where he thinks O'Rourke fell short.\n\n\"I actually think we will see us become authentically purple in the next decade,\" Kronberg tells TIME, adding, \"One statewide win will turn us purple.\"\n\nBut polling suggests the challenges for Texas Democrats remain as steep as ever. A survey of Texas voters from the University of Texas at Austin released Wednesday found that 45% approve of Cruz and 41% disapprove. Among Republicans, approval jumped to 78%.\n\n\"He just has locked down Republicans in the state,\" said Daron Shaw, a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin, in a podcast published this week with the poll. \"And it is awfully tough as a Democrat to beat somebody who generates so much enthusiasm and loyalty among the Republican base.\"\n\nFor now, many national Democrats and outside groups are hanging back to see how the race shakes out before they decide how much they want to put into Texas. That could be another point in Allred's favor, given his reputation as a strong fundraiser.\n\n\"On paper, he looks like a man that can raise tens of millions of dollars,\" Kronberg says.\n\nAllred hasn't cleared the primary field yet; State Senator Roland Gutierrez, who represents Uvalde , is widely expected to enter the race after the Texas legislative session ends this month. Texas Democrats say good things about both men and foresee their differing strengths in reaching Black and Latino Texans, respectively.\n\nWith their party's nominee still undecided, Democrats are for now uniting in their antipathy toward Cruz, who is among their biggest bogeymen; in 2021 he earned dozens of bruising headlines for traveling to Cancún while his constituents suffered the effects of a deadly winter storm. Allred's launch video slammed Cruz for that trip, and accused Cruz of hiding in a closet during the January 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nThey're also united around the idea that the Lone Star State remains a battleground. One Texas Democratic consultant says that the consensus among clients from a variety of sectors is that Texas will continue to see more and more political investment. Rahna Epting, the executive director of MoveOn, whose members backed O'Rourke decisively ahead of 2018, says fighting in Texas again this cycle remains a real possibility.\n\n\"Knowing that the Senate map is going to be challenging in 2024, if the Texas Senate race opens up a possibility for us to gain another Democratic seat, that is something definitely worth looking at,\" she says.\n\nAnother national Democratic strategist who spoke to TIME is optimistic about Texas, and particularly the prospect of Allred posing \"a real challenge\" in 2024.\n\n\"Is Colin Allred the one to flip it? I think that's still an open question,\" the strategist tells TIME. \"But it's one that I think is worth asking.\"\n\nAbhi Rahman, who served as senior communications adviser and spokesperson on O'Rourke's 2022 gubernatorial campaign, argues that a general lack of investment in the state hurt efforts to turn Texas blue last year. But he, too, thinks an Allred-Cruz match-up could change the game.\n\n\"Republicans were effective in the way that they branded Beto right at the beginning of the race,\" Rahman says. \"Republicans win when they're able to villainize the Democrat, which is something that Ted Cruz is not going to be able to do, because first of all, he's Ted Cruz, he's despised by everybody. And secondly, Colin Allred is a moderate Democrat who's really spent his time in Congress working on VA hospitals, doing bipartisan stuff.\"\n\nAdds Rahman: \"It's a completely different dynamic in this race.\"\n\nWrite to Mini Racker at mini.racker@time.com"

      "text": "Lone Star 'Wake Up Call': Texas Republicans Want to Ban ESG in Insurance\n\nO ver the past year, the backlash against so-called ESG investing has swept through red states as legislatures enacted laws punishing investment firms that use environmental, social, and governance metrics in their decision making.\n\nAs the saying goes, it's bigger in Texas.\n\nAfter banning 10 ESG-friendly financial firms from doing business with the state last summer, right-wing lawmakers in Austin have set their sights on another, bigger target: the insurance industry. Republican lawmakers in the Texas House and Senate have introduced legislation to ban insurers from considering ESG scores as they establish insurance rates. If enacted and implemented, the law could boot some of the country's best-known insurance brands from operating in Texas. Most big insurers-the Hartford, Allstate, and State Farm, to name a few-currently embrace ESG metrics.\n\nThe move would be a big blow for the industry, potentially beyond Texas. Insurance companies fear that restrictions on ESG considerations could hamper their ability to make sound decisions about policies they offer their customers given that environmental, social, and governance issues can represent real financial risks.\n\nLone Star lawmakers are not moved. \"I hope Texas delivers a wake up call,\" says Jason Isaac, a former state legislator who led the charge to pass anti-ESG legislation and now works on energy issues at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation. \"Insurance companies are licensed and regulated in the state of Texas, so [if this passes], they can no longer do business in the state.\"\n\nThe outcome of this showdown between right-wing lawmakers and the powerful insurance industry is not a foregone conclusion. Supporters and opponents alike acknowledge the legislation has a chance of passing this year in the Texas legislature, which has adopted a range of aggressive right-wing measures in recent years. But \"there's definitely going to be a fight,\" says Luke Metzger, who heads the non-profit Environment Texas, of the insurance legislation.\n\nESG investing has grown dramatically over the last decade, in step with concerns about climate change. Investors had $8.4 trillion placed in \"sustainable assets\" in 2022, according to data from Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment. That's up from less than $4 trillion a decade prior.\n\nLast year, opposition to the movement took off. Some businesses, in Texas and elsewhere, say that ESG measures make it harder to finance their operations and growth. Oil and gas and related projects, for example, can sometimes get low marks from ESG graders, making it more difficult to access capital. As of December, at least 18 states had passed or introduced anti-ESG laws.\n\nUntil recently, the insurance industry had received far less attention from ESG opponents than financiers. And, now, few seem eager to highlight the looming confrontation in Texas. Opponents, particularly corporate leaders, fear that openly opposing the House and Senate legislation will make them a target for state officials. On the other side, many leaders of anti-ESG efforts in Texas did not respond to requests for comment, or ultimately declined to talk on the record.\n\nBut the state business and political community is quietly paying attention, in large part because the insurance measure would in some ways shift the landscape more dramatically than those targeting financial firms. For one, the previously passed Texas ban on financial firms only stops the ten sanctioned firms from doing business with government entities within the state. It does not affect the ability of those firms to do business with corporations or retail customers. The insurance ban would go further, effectively restricting insurance companies that use ESG metric from doing any business in the state, including with consumers and other businesses.\n\nSome ESG supporters also argue that it would be harder to nix ESG consideration in the insurance business than in finance. Calculating risk is central to insurance companies, as risk determines how much customers pay and whether they're offered a policy at all. Increasingly, climate-linked concerns are a part of that risk. Physical risks like flooding or wildfires might strike an asset; transition risks like producing a carbon-intensive product that runs afoul of new regulations could hurt the business making it.\n\nThose are precisely the kinds of risks that ESG metrics aim to measure, and for that reason have taken on increased significance for the industry. A 2022 survey from the consulting firm PWC found that 85% of insurers said ESG would \"impact all functions of their business.\" \"There is not an industry more directly affected when you think of the costs of fires and floods and droughts, than the insurance industry,\" says Steven Rothstein, managing director of the Accelerator for Sustainable Capital Markets at the non-profit group Ceres.\n\nTo make matters worse for the insurers, Texas may only be the start. ESG experts say that behind closed doors fears have grown that Republicans may target the insurance industry in other states, too. \"They're definitely concerned,\" says Leslie Samuelrich, president at Green Century Capital Management, an investment advisory firm, of the insurance industry. \"If you can see it move from investments, and then it moves to insurance,\" says Samuelrich. \"Where does it go next?\"\n\nWrite to Justin Worland at justin.worland@time.com"

      "text": "Texas Democrats Faced Criticism for Fleeing to D.C.-But These Lawmakers See Their Gamble as a Deeply Personal Battle for the Future of Their State\n\nT he tears that slid down her cheeks took Texas state representative Senfronia Thompson, 82, by surprise.\n\nMaybe they were drawn by the words of Virginia state senator Jennifer McClellan, a Black Democrat who this year launched an unsuccessful bid for governor, as she described the barriers that had made it difficult and at times impossible for her parents and her grandparents to vote. Maybe by the setting, outside a library in Alexandria, Va., less than 10 miles from Capitol Hill, where, the very year Thompson was born, a group of Black residents had staged a sit-in to demand integrated access . Or maybe it was the reminder that even after her five decades in the Texas House-longer than any other woman, Black person or Democrat-the tools and tactics of Jim Crow are still functioning. Here she was in the capital region on July 16, come to beg the U.S. Congress to do something to protect voting rights.\n\n\"I think about how we had to come a long ways and watch signs that say 'No Dogs. No Negroes. No Mexicans,'\" Thompson says, to a bank of TV cameras at the library. \"When dogs [were un]leashed on our people. When they were beaten. When they were bombed. When they were killed and all of the things we had to endure. Haven't we done enough?\"\n\nThompson's voice rises, wavers, then breaks. \"Haven't we paid the price enough? What is it going to take for us to be able to be Americans in this country? I am an American.\"\n\nFour days earlier, Thompson and other Texas Democrats- a largely Latino and Black group -had arrived in the D.C. area in a strategic gambit, maybe even a desperate one, to leave their state's Republican-controlled government without the total number of legislators required to pass laws. The reason: a slate of bills that would further restrict how and when voting happens in the state. Leaving the state is an option that Texas legislators last exercised in full almost 20 years ago, when Republicans-who had just recently come to power in the legislature-drew up a redistricting plan that looked likely to eliminate every Democrat from representing Texas in the U.S. Congress. In the end, the plan moved ahead.\n\nThis time, the caucus that left Texas has animated and irritated people across the political spectrum. Former Democratic U.S. Representative from Texas Beto O'Rourke managed to raise over $600,000 as of Thursday to cover what his team has described as the major costs of the Texas Democrats' \"fight against voter suppression.\" And Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican who is reportedly interested in vying for the White House , has said publicly that he will have the lawmakers arrested when they come home .\n\n\"We need to find better ways than to fight each other over who is going to control what,\" Thompson tells me later, not long after the charter bus we were riding on had taken us south on 14th Street, past the National Mall and the U.S. Capitol in the distance on our left, the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture on our right. \"Right now, that's about all we do.\"\n\nIn the American imagination, Texas is a quintessentially Western, white and rural space, as Texas-born Harvard historian Annette Gordon-Reed describes in her book Juneteenth . But in reality, Texas-the last Confederate state to free the enslaved-is now home to some of the nation's largest Latino and Black populations, as well as five of the nation's 15 largest cities. Almost 58% of Texans identify as Black, Latino or Asian, and the big cities on the Eastern side of the state are home to about 86% of the state's entire population. These are the people in Texas who tend to vote for Democrats.\n\nBut that majority has not yet translated into power. Even after decades of speculation about Texas turning politically blue-and a 2020 election in which Trump won the state by a smaller than expected margin- only 13 of the 38-member Texas Congressional delegation are Democrats . The state's gubernatorial mansion, both state legislative bodies and all 27 state-wide offices are held by Republicans. A combination of gerrymandering, lagging voter registration among Latinos and a history of lower-than-average voter turnout have together allowed Republicans to exercise disproportionate power despite a shrinking voter base. That, Texas Democrats argue, is the real reason-not concern about election integrity, which supporters of the bills argue they will address-that Texas Republicans want to make it harder to vote, and in ways they believe are most likely to constrain Latino and Black Texans.\n\nThompson and the other lawmakers who decamped argue that the voting measures in question would mean that the already slow movement of political power in Texas-away from the state's mostly white, rural and Republican districts, toward fast-expanding urban centers and their surrounding suburbs-will grind to an undemocratic standstill.\n\n\"I thought, for a long time, that racism-the really bad, violent, dangerous stuff-was in the past,\" Thompson says. \"I thought for a long time we were moving forward...but how strange it is that we are here, in the capital of a country known for innovation, to deal with the reality that some folks think it's a crime if there's an election and they don't win. Some folks running the state of Texas think there's something terribly wrong if it looks like some time soon, they won't have all power and all control.\"\n\nThe day before Thompson spoke so emphatically in Virginia, representative Celia Israel celebrated her 57th birthday, if it can be called a celebration so far from family and most friends. It was supposed to have been her wedding day, too. Another Texas Democrat, Israel-a Latina who represents a district that includes Austin- had planned to wed her partner of 26 years, Celinda Garza , in a ceremony on the Texas House of Representatives floor, then honeymoon in Big Bend National Park. Instead, she found herself here at the U.S. Capitol in a small room, all dark wood paneling and gilded light fixtures, enumerating just what was at stake in that power battle back home.\n\n\"We're here to really just let you know how emotional this is for us,\" Israel tells U.S. Representative Adriano Espaillat, an Afro-Latino Democrat from New York. \"This is heartfelt. We love our state.\"\n\nRepublicans so completely dominate policy in Texas right now, she begins to explain, that during this year's regular session Texas lawmakers approved gun carrying without a permit and an abortion ban as early as six weeks gestation, without exceptions for rape or incest . While Israel doesn't mention this, they also approved abortion restrictions that put some enforcement power in the hands of private citizens. And Abbott signed into law a state tax revenue penalty for major cities that remove any money from police budgets .\n\nTexas representative Jarvis Johnson, a Black Democrat who represents a portion of Houston and who was there with Israel, picked up the thread. At least 53 of the more than 500 people arrested over the Jan. 6 insurrection live in Texas, according to a database compiled by USA Toda y, more than many other states. A video has been making the rounds of a meeting of Texas Republicans, in which they discuss a plan to send an \"army\" to heavily Black and Latino precincts in Houston where they claim voter fraud happens. That's an idea that leaves Jarvis and others concerned about the possibility of armed and angry Trump supporters descending on their cities.\n\nOne of the Texas bills that prompted the lawmakers to leave would allow some of these same people to join the ranks of poll watchers, who may stand close enough to voters to observe their actions and hear any conversations-and who are allowed to do so while armed. Jarvis tells Israel and Espaillat that the possibility brings to mind the intimidation tactics once favored by Jim Crow-era local law enforcement and the Klu Klux Klan. For similar reasons, while he's in D.C., Jarvis is worried about his 20 year old son, his namesake, driving a car registered in his name. Jarvis fears what could happen if his son passes the wrong police officer who has heard Abbott say the lawmakers \"fled,\" are wanted and subject to arrest upon sight. It's language another Black Texas Democrat told me brings to mind the pursuit of runaway slaves and lost animals.\n\nThere are also more subtle ways the Texas Democrats think the voting bills and the political fight over them could change who votes in the state. Around the country, Black and Latino workers are somewhat more likely to be assigned to evening and night shifts ; one pending bill would eliminate 24-hour voting, an option offered in Houston in 2020 that some believe contributed mightily to higher than usual turnout. In addition, under the pending Texas bills, polling site workers-the people who administer election sites, often retirees-could face criminal penalties for honest mistakes.\n\nThe success of the Texas Democrats' voting rights mission in D.C. is far from certain. There are at least three possible resolutions: Democrats could relent and return to Texas; that is unlikely to happen soon. Texas Republicans could agree to a compromise bill that addresses some or their concerns; this seems even more unlikely. Or, Congress could implement a federal law that bans or overrides some elements of proposals like the Texas bills. This is the possibility in which the Texas Democrats have placed their faith. And they're not the only ones hoping for action in that realm: Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democratic Congresswoman, was arrested on July 15 for protesting the failure of the U.S. Senate to take up the For the People Act or the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.\n\nSo Espaillat isn't the only person at the Capitol whom the Texas Democrats are meeting with. Israel tells Espaillat that some of her colleagues had \"a really good meeting\" with U.S. Senator Joseph Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia and one of two white Democrats, along with Senator Kyrsten Sinema from Arizona, who have thus far refused to vote to end the filibuster. Without that, any support both lawmakers have expressed for new federal voting rights legislation has a major limit; voting rights bills won't make it to the Senate floor for a vote and cannot become law. Both Manchin and Sinema hail from states where voters are almost evenly split between the two major parties. There have also been meetings with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Vice President Kamala Harris. And Texas Democrats have also joined in protest actions and press conferences with a number of civic and political organizations including Black Voters Matter. As Texas representative John Bucy III, a white Democrat who represents Austin and several suburbs, put it, the group is taking just about all meetings. Bucy is prepared to stay in Washington, D.C., so long that he brought his entire family. Still, many political analysts believe the Texas Democrats are unlikely to prevail.\n\n\"My goal is for us to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good,\" Israel tells Espaillat. \"Let's find the three or four good things that we can get through these senators and let's move forward.\"\n\nThen it's back to the hotel, followed by a return to the Capitol Hill area for a visit to the U.S. Supreme Court, via a misdirected Uber that first goes to the U.S. Court of Appeals. It's just after 5:00 p.m. and Israel and some of her colleagues, a group of women lawmakers, want to use the building as a backdrop to record videos for social media. After all, that's where in 2013 the court eviscerated part of the Voting Rights Act , making way for bills like those proposed in Texas.\n\n\"Gay marriage was made legal [here] in 2015,\" Israel says, when it's her turn to speak. \"I was supposed to get married but I'm a runaway bride. And I'm running from a really bad governor and running from a state that has so many misplaced priorities...This is our job right now, to speak up for the state that we love and the country that we love.\"\n\nAug. 6 will mark the 56th anniversary of the day when another Texan, then President Lyndon Johnson, signed that 1965 voting rights law. He and some of the lawmakers who backed it were prompted in part by the violent way that voting rights protesters were confronted, beaten and nearly killed on their march from Selma , Ala. Back in 1965, a young Mitch McConnell was there to watch the Voting Rights Act become law . He supported its contents and voted to renew it after he joined the Senate. For almost five decades, the Voting Rights Act required states with a history of voting discrimination, including Texas, to seek federal approval for voting-related changes. The Supreme Court stuck down that provision. As Senate Majority Leader, McConnell in 2020 refused to hold a vote on a new version of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nInside the antechamber where they met, Israel, Jarvis, Espaillat and his aides had all gone maskless, in keeping with CDC guidelines for those who have been vaccinated against the novel coronavirus. Days later, Israel became one of several Texas Democrats in the delegation to test positive for a breakthrough case of COVID-19. In-person activity largely came to a halt. But, before it did, Thompson, the Texas Black caucus and two members of the Mexican American caucus had their event in Virginia.\n\nThere, Thompson tells me it was the first time in at least 30 years she can remember crying, in public about politics. Someone gave her a tissue.\n\nThompson is a practicing lawyer, not afraid of a leopard-print blazer. When she talks politics, it's clear that the woman known as \"Ms. T\" has seen a lot of history and plans to shape the future.\n\n\"We deserve the same rights and consideration that everybody has,\" Thompson says. But a deep level of \"inhumanity\" runs through so much of American politics, she says-that, and power games.\n\nThompson tells me that she, like anyone might, once entertained dreams of moving up the political ladder, but that moments like this one remind her that she is where she needs to be. The national attention the Texas delegation is garnering is nice, but it will only matter if it comes with a successful defense of voting rights, the cornerstone of a truly inclusive and representative democracy, she says.\n\nWhen the bus stops again, we're at The Park at 14th, one of those downtown restaurants that, before the pandemic, made brunch a big part of D.C. weekend culture. State representative Jasmine Crockett, a freshman Texas lawmaker and Black Democrat who represents a district that includes parts of the Dallas area, stands near the door making calls as other lawmakers stream inside. She's wearing a red blazer, matching Converse and carrying a black purse embossed with the words \"PROTECT BLACK PEOPLE.\"\n\nCrockett, the only Black freshman this session, had told me that what shocked and troubled her most in this, her first year in the legislature, were the obvious assumptions about who should have power over what happens in Texas-and the lengths to which people were willing to go to maintain that status quo.\n\n\"I have no doubt in my mind what's going on,\" she said. \"[Republicans] see their power dissipating. It's a matter of, 'if we don't stop those Black people and them brown ones from deciding to vote, then we're screwed.'\"\n\nThis session, Republicans voted to restrict the ability of gang members-presumed to be \"Black and brown,\" Crockett says-to carry guns, but refused to curtail the gun rights of those who meet the federal definition of a white supremacist. This was the moment where Crockett found herself in tears on the Texas House floor.\n\n\"That was the one lesson I learned this session,\" she says. \"There is no logic in the leg.\"\n\nAnd so the Texas Democrats are planning to stay, for some time. They have until the Senate's session ends on Aug. 6 to convince federal lawmakers to do something to protect voting rights. And yet many political observers think that the dramatic act of leaving the state ultimately cannot be sustained or effective. The governor has called a second special session that could run into early September. Eventually, in September, the regular session will start up again.\n\nInside The Park, while trying to figure out where in D.C. she can go for her weekly wash and set, Thompson inadvertently begins to hold a kind of advisory court for younger, Black women in the state-lawmaking world. If Democrats had managed to flip more seats in the Texas House, Thompson would likely be it's speaker right now. Instead, a Maryland Delegate sitting immediately to Thompson's right asks her how long she's been in the legislature.\n\n\"Fifty years,\" Thompson says.\n\n\"And, you are not exhausted ?\" the Maryland lawmaker asks.\n\nIn Maryland, Democrats had a supermajority in 2020. So when lawmakers took on police reforms during that session, Democrats resolved to let Republicans have their say, to debate or interrupt as little as possible, then pass the legislation in question. But it became trying for the Democratic lawmaker to hear her mostly white Republican colleagues opine at length about things like the financial needs of officers and their families, without so much as a mention of the toll the disproportionate number of Black and Latino people killed by police takes on those families. A Virginia lawmaker seated to Thompson's left, who at the library gave an impassioned speech about the danger of rolling back civil rights gains, commiserated. She said she found herself oddly grateful that the pandemic forced their police reform hearings to take place over Zoom, a space where she could participate, camera off, eyerolls obscured.\n\nDidn't Thompson feel it too?\n\n\"No,\" Thompson says as a smile spreads across her face.\n\nWhat these women need is self care, she says, to work hard for the right things and the clear conscience that brings. Yes, there are frustrations: For example, many aspects of a Texas policing reform bill Thompson named in honor of George Floyd did not survive Texas House Republican opposition. Some did , after Thompson told her colleagues she wants the same freedom they have, not to live in fear their children will be killed by police, but even those measures died in the Texas Senate. She hasn't given up, so she'll need to get back to Texas eventually, where there is work to be done.\n\n\"I still wake up,\" she says, \"ready to kick ass every day.\"\n\nCorrection, July 26\n\nThe original version of this story misstated whether Senators Manchin and Sinema have refused to vote for new federal voting rights legislation. While their opposition to filibuster reform is seen as effectively blocking such legislation from passing, each has also expressed support for at least some version of a voting rights bill.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Texas Republicans fail to oust Muslim official over religion\n\nA Republican county official in Texas has survived a vote to oust him after several local party members took issue with his Muslim religion.\n\nThe motion to remove Shahid Shafi from his position as vice chairman of the Tarrant County Republican party failed by a vote of 139-49 on Thursday night.\n\nThe effort was led by several county Republicans who argued that Dr Shafi was more loyal to Islam than the US.\n\nThe movement led to criticism from prominent state Republican officials.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the vote at a church in Fort Worth, Dr Shafi said: \"As an immigrant to this great country, I am honoured and privileged to receive the support of my fellow Republicans.\"\n\n\"We were fighting for religious freedom - a founding principle of our nation. And today, we have come out victorious,\" he declared.\n\nIn addition to serving as the Republican vice chairman of Tarrant County - the third largest county in Texas - Dr Shafi is a surgeon and Southlake City Councilman who immigrated to the US nearly 30 years ago.\n\nHe reportedly is originally from India, and became a US citizen in 2009.\n\nAfter he was appointed by party officials to his post in July 2018, several of his colleagues took issue with his religion and claimed he had connections with terrorist organisations.\n\nGrand Prairie precinct chairwoman Dorrie O'Brien, who led the effort to oust him, recently reiterated her views in a Facebook post.\n\n\"We don't think he's suitable as a practising Muslim to be vice chair because he'd be the representative for ALL Republicans in Tarrant County, and not ALL Republicans in Tarrant County think Islam is safe or acceptable,\" Mrs O'Brien wrote on 31 December 2018.\n\n\"There are big questions surrounding exactly where Dr Shafi's loyalties lie, vis a vis Democrat and Republican policies.\"\n\nShe also previously slammed her Republican colleagues for not intervening in what she called a \"stealth jihad\" and \"Leftist/Shari'a Zuckerberg-ization of Tarrant County\".\n\nTarrant County Republican Party Chairman Darl Eason, who appointed Dr Shafi to his post, told the Star-Telegram when the vote was scheduled: \"It's just outrageous that we are doing this.\"\n\n\"It's disgusting,\" he added.\n\nFormer Tarrant County precinct chair Sara Legvold sat outside of the meeting room during the vote in protest, wearing a burqa which she said was to \"represent the Islamisation of our county, our state and our country\".\n\nThe vote was widely condemned by Texas Republican, including Governor Greg Abbott, Senator Ted Cruz and Republican Land Commissioner George P Bush.\n\n\"Religious freedom is at the core of who we are as a nation and state,\" Gov Abbott said in a statement on Wednesday, \"and attacks on Dr Shafi because of his faith are contrary to this guiding principle.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Texas Republicans endorse gay 'treatment'\n\nGay rights protesters gather as Texas Republicans meet in Ft Worth for their state party convention\n\nOn Saturday delegates to the Texas Republican Party state convention approved a party platform that embodies many of the most deeply held beliefs of the state's grass-roots, Tea Party conservative base.\n\nAmong the greatest hits in the document , external are: the closing of multiple federal cabinet-level departments, prohibiting the teaching of evolution at schools, a call to block attempts to institute national (or international) education standards such as Common Core, a condemnation of funding for climate change research, elimination of the minimum wage, a repeal of the Voting Rights Act, a call to disregard federal gun-control laws, the creation of a special federal prosecutor to investigate the \"Benghazi cover-up\" and a condemnation of the United Nation's \"Agenda 21\" plan to... do something nefarious, I'm sure.\n\nAlthough a debate over immigration and border security policy drew much of the fire , external within the convention halls, it was two paragraphs on policy directed toward gay people that generated the most heat outside:\n\nHomosexuality must not be presented as an acceptable alternative lifestyle, in public policy, nor should family be redefined to include homosexual couples. We believe there should be no granting of special legal entitlements or creation of special status for homosexual behavio u r, regardless of state of origin.\n\nAdditionally, we oppose any criminal or civil penalties against those who oppose homosexuality out of faith, conviction, or belief in traditional values. We recognise the legitimacy and value of counselling which offers reparative therapy and treatment to patients who are seeking escape from the homosexual lifestyle. No laws or executive orders shall be imposed to limit or restrict access to this type of therapy.\n\nThe endorsement of \"reparative therapy\" for gays was quickly condemned by gay rights groups and liberal commentators. As many noted, the American Psychological Association has called the practice , external a product of \"societal ignorance and prejudice\" that incorrectly treats same-gender sexual orientation as a mental illness.\n\n\"There is no legitimacy or value to this 'reparative therapy', just as there is no 'homosexual lifestyle', since being gay or lesbian or bisexual or transgender stems from biology, not choice,\" writes , external Andrew Rosenthal, editorial page editor of the New York Times. \"And there certainly should be laws and executive orders banning aversion therapy because it is based on non-science and is almost always deeply harmful to the people who undergo it.\"\n\nThe Texas Observer's Forrest Wilder writes , external that the platform \"endorses the wholly discredited, cruel and laughable-if-it-wasn't-so-damaging 'reparative therapy' racket that attempts to turn gay people straight.\"\n\nAlthough the platform is nonbinding on the state's Republican candidates, Wilder says it's still important for symbolic reasons, as the party's \"guiding document\".\n\n\"It's also a fascinating glimpse into the id of conservatism,\" he writes. \"The folks who write it are the true believers, and this is their wish list, their vision of a world that conforms to their ideals and beliefs.\"\n\nAccording to , external the Associated Press, the treatment language was the product of former Texas Republican Party chair Cathie Adams, who now leads a social conservative group called Texas Eagle Forum. It was formulated as a response, in part, to recent moves in New Jersey and California to prohibit the treatment's use on minors:\n\nAdams, whose group backed Tea Party outsiders who dominated Texas Republican primary races this year, said she simply promoted language proposed by a man who she says he was helped by such therapy.\n\n\"He knows what he's talking about. He is one of those who has benefited,\" Adams said. \"I think the majority of Texans feel that way too. It's not like this is mandatory. This is only a voluntary programme.\"\n\nIronically, the controversy over the new language overshadowed the removal of a stronger condemnation of gays that had been included in the platform , external for the past three decades:\n\nWe affirm that the practice of homosexuality tears at the fabric of society and contributes to the breakdown of the family unit. Homosexual behaviour is contrary to the fundamental, unchanging truths that have been ordained by God, recognized by our country's founders and shared by the majority of Texans.\n\nThe Associated Press quotes one party delegate, Elizabeth Hunter, who said she didn't find the original language offensive:\n\n\"I don't see anybody leaving the Republican Party because of that language,\" she said. \"I think it would actually encourage someone to join when they see that the Republican Party takes a strong stand rather than standing in the middle.\"\n\nComments can not be loaded\n\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser\n\nFestival organisers 'heartbroken' as Vancouver car ramming attack kills 11\n\n'Our community is grieving,' say Vancouver festival organisers\n\nVictim hurt in attack involving crossbow 'stable'\n\nHow the next Pope is chosen\n\n'Kicking butt' or 'going too fast'?

      "text": "Ken Paxton: Texas House votes to impeach Trump ally\n\nTexas' Republican-run House of Representatives has voted to impeach state Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, who is accused of bribery and abuse of public trust.\n\nMr Paxton, an ally of former President Donald Trump, is now suspended from office pending a trial in the Senate.\n\nA two-thirds vote in the upper chamber - where Republicans also dominate -  is required to permanently expel him.\n\nMr Paxton, aged 60, denies all the accusations against him.\n\nResponding to a 121-23 vote in the House on Saturday, Mr Paxton said in a statement: \"The ugly spectacle in the Texas House today confirmed the outrageous impeachment plot against me was never meant to be fair or just.\n\n\"It was a politically motivated sham from the beginning.\"\n\nThe impeachment vote was on 20 articles, which also include accusations of improperly aiding a wealthy political donor and conducting a sham investigation against whistleblowers.\n\nThe result demonstrates a very public split between Texas Republicans.\n\n\"Attorney General Paxton continuously and blatantly violated laws, rules, policies and procedures,\" House Republican David Spiller said.\n\n\"Today is a very grim and difficult day for this House and for the state of Texas,\" he added.\n\nBut John Smithee, another Texas House Republican, opposed the impeachment, arguing that the attorney general had not been given the chance to properly respond to the allegations against him.\n\n\"It's what I call the hang him now and judge him later policy,\" Mr Smithee said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Trump - who hopes to win a Republican nomination for the 2024 election - backed Mr Paxton.\n\nShortly before the vote, he wrote \"free Ken Paxton\" in a post on social media.\n\nThe House vote makes Mr Paxton the first state official in Texas to be impeached in almost 50 years.\n\nTexas' Republican Governor Greg Abbott has the powers to appoint an interim state attorney general even before the Senate trial is concluded.\n\nMr Paxton is well-known in America for his high-profile litigation campaigns.\n\nIn 2020, he unsuccessfully pressed the US Supreme Court to overturn Mr Trump's defeat to Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the presidential election.\n\nFive years earlier, Mr Paxton called the Supreme Court's decision legalising gay marriage in all 50 states a \"lawless ruling\", vowing to support state workers who refuse to marry couples on religious grounds.\n\nBut he is perhaps best known for spearheading the ongoing fight in the courts to challenge the Biden administration's changes to the immigration system.\n\nMr Paxton has said the measures he is fighting would encourage illegal crossings and burden Texas and other states with additional expenses for law enforcement, health care and education, the New York Times reports.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

In 2004 President George W Bush received 40% of their vote nationally. In 2008 the Republican candidate received 31%, and in 2012 it was 27%.\n\n\"Tea Party groups and other hard-line organisations that believe individuals of Mexican heritage are genetically inferior or incapable of understanding how to live in a representative democracy have controlled the GOP's stance on immigration,\" Mr Muniz writes.\n\nHe says that numbers like these indicate that his party is at a crossroads: \"Will it embrace true free-market solutions and support its own bootstrapping principles and the American dream, or will it allow dinosaur politics to lead us to extinction?\"\n\nFall of Mosul demands action , external - Civil war once again has erupted in Iraq, writes the Brookings Institution's Kenneth M Pollack, and the US must step in before the situation worsens, possibly destabilising the global energy market.\n\nThe US, he writes in the Wall Street Journal, needs to provide embattled Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki with military support, including drone strikes, reconnaissance, training, weapons and even manned air missions.\n\nIn exchange for this aid, the US should demand that Mr Maliki make much-needed political reforms, including term limits on the nation's leadership, limitations on the prime minister's powers, the depoliticisation of the Iraqi armed forces, and a new unity government that incorporates Sunni and Kurdish interests.\n\n\"If Iraq is to be saved, it will be saved only by Americans and Iraqis taking hard steps like these,\" he writes.\n\nShinzo Abe as the 'world's best leader' , external - Stony Brook University Prof Noah Smith says Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe provides \"an example that the rest of the world should be following\".\n\nThanks to monetary policies implemented following his re-election in 2012, Prof Smith writes in Bloomberg View, the Japanese prime minister has boosted his nation's economic growth, its stock market, and even the wages of its workers.\n\n\"In other words, unlike everyone else in the world, Abe listened to Milton Friedman, and the results are looking good,\" he says.\n\nIn addition, Mr Abe pushed for women's rights - which is an economic boon - cut the nation's corporate tax rate, endorsed government deregulation and backed a more robust foreign policy.\n\n\"For the first time in 25 years,\" he says, \"Japan looks like it could be at the head of the international pack.\"\n\nA government on the defensive , external - Despite the best efforts of the Venezuelan socialist dictatorship founded by Hugo Chavez, writes the Independent Institute's Alvaro Vargas Llosa, civil society in the nation is flourishing and the anti-government protestors are gaining strength.\n\nOpponents of President Nicolas Maduro have come to the realisation, he writes, that continued street protests can lead to negotiation and eventual victory.\n\n\"It's hard to know just how long it will take for Venezuelans to rid themselves of this 15-year tyranny,\" he says. \"But the process has begun.\"\n\n\"The economy is in free fall, with inflation at more than 60%, GDP growth at zero and acute shortages affecting 19 basic products,\" he concludes. \"As a result, whatever faith the people of the barrios had in the Chavez mystique is quickly eroding.\"\n\nDrilling trumps environment in the Amazon , external - In 2007 Ecuador offered to renounce drilling in the Amazon's Yasuni National Park in exchange for $3.6b (Â£2.14b) over 13 years from foreign nations. Last year, with only $13m (Â£7.74m) raised, Ecuador President Rafael Correa abandoned the programme. Last month, the nation moved ahead with plans to begin drilling in 2016.\n\n\"The green light to drill in one of the world's most biologically significant areas will come at an incalculable cost to Yasuni's biodiversity and harm the indigenous groups that live in the park,\" writes Amazon Watch's Kevin M Koenig in the New York Times.\n\n\"Today oil accounts for half of Ecuador's export earnings, and the country is caught in a cycle of dependence,\" he says. Ecuador should do more to wean itself from oil revenues, he writes, and increasing drilling is not the way to do it.\n\nPakistan commentators react to Sunday's Taliban attack on the Karachi airport and what it means for the nation's security.\n\n\"The fact that must be faced is that what happened at the airport on Sunday night [8 June] constituted a massive failure of the state, an indictment of the country's security strategyâ¦ Do we need further evidence that an overhaul of the country's security systems and personnel is urgently needed?\" - Editorial in Dawn , external .\n\n\"There is no time left for prevarication and policy paralysis.

the US Homeland Security secretary says the gunman should never have had a direct line of sight\n\nThis video can not be played\n\nA bandaged Trump walks into the Republican convention\n\nEdited by Brandon Livesay, at the convention\n\nBrandon Livesay Reporting from the convention\n\nWith the Republican convention on a short break, let's take a moment to check in on the latest updates into the investigation of the attempted assassination on Donald Trump.\n\nMy colleague Bernd Debusmann Jr is in Bethel Park - the town where the attacker identified by the FBI lived.\n\nBernd has been following the criminal investigation closely, and he was at the rally in Butler when Trump was attacked.\n\nKeep following this page for the latest from Bernd.\n\nBrandon Drenon US reporter\n\nFor many, this will be their first time seeing Usha Vance, the wife of Donald Trump's vice-presidential nominee, JD Vance.\n\nThe two met as students at Yale Law School in the 2010s, according to the New York Times, before getting married in 2014.\n\nUsha - the child of Indian immigrants - was born in California and raised in the suburbs of San Diego.\n\nShe's currently a corporate litigator at a San Francisco law firm and previously has clerked for conservative Supreme Court Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr.\n\nVance frequently praises his wife for her support in his career and considered her his âYale spirit guideâ when the two were classmates.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News last month, Usha said: \"I believe in JD, and I really love him, and so weâll just sort of see what happens with our life.â\n\nTogether, Vance and Usha have three children: two sons, Ewan and Vivek, and a daughter named Mirabel.\n\nMike Wendling Reporting from the convention\n\nGreg Simpson is a delegate from Milford Ohio, just a few dozen miles from Vanceâs childhood home.\n\nHe had an inkling that Vance would be picked as Trump's VP nominee.\n\nâOf the three on the shortlist, I donât think you could have done better,â he says.\n\nDemocrats will make light of Vanceâs anti-abortion views and previous opposition to Donald Trump, but Simpson is unbothered.\n\nâIf Trump is comfortable with him, then I am,â he says. âHeâs flexible on some things, and thatâs a good thing.â\n\nMike Wendling Reporting from the convention\n\nThe Republican National Convention is taking a short break - but don't worry, there's lots for us to bring you.\n\nI've been chatting to Ohio delegate Amanda Suffecool, who says there's \"going to be so much energy around\" fellow Ohioan JD Vance being named as the vice-presidential nominee.\n\nSuffecool, chair of her county's Republican Party in the north-east part of the state, says of Vance:\n\nHeâs from humble beginnings and heâs young and I think a lot of people are going to think he looks like them.\"\n\nVance was one of the first Republicans to blame Saturday's assassination attempt on  Trump on Democratic rhetoric - which Suffecool says is justified and that she's seen people celebrating the attack online.\n\nCalls for unity are fine, she adds, \"but I donât think itâs really achievable\".\n\nJude Sheerin Reporting from the convention\n\nThe Ohio delegation of Vanceâs home state, in particular, is deliriously happy - according to the stateâs Lt Gov Jon Husted.\n\nâAre we ready to nominate a vice-president?,\" he asked the crowd just moments ago.\n\nâHe is the living embodiment of the American dream,â says Lt Gov Husted.\n\nâHe came from humble beginnings and he never forgot where he came from.â\n\nWe're currently hearing from officials at the Republican convention.\n\nThey tell the crowd JD Vance is officially the running mate of Donald Trump.\n\nVance has a huge grin and holds his arms in the air.\n\nAnd a reminder, you can click watch live at the top of this page to watch along.\n\nMike Wendling Reporting from the convention\n\nThis video can not be played\n\nHigh fives, hugs and fist bumps welcome Vance as running mate\n\nA large cheer comes up as Vance enters along with his wife to the strains of a country music song.\n\nVance pauses to chat with delegates from Ohio who seem in a triumphant mood.\n\nRepublican vice-president candidate JD Vance and his wife Usha have arrived at the party's national convention in Milwaukee.\n\nHe's taking to the stage now to loud cheers and  a standing ovation from the crowd.\n\nStay with us as we bring you more on his first appearance as Trump's running mate.\n\nSome attendees took to taking selfies with the potential future vice president\n\nMike Wendling Reporting from the convention\n\nSporadic chants of âJDâ are breaking out here on the floor of the convention, and delegates are crowding forward to try and get a glimpse of Vance's arrival.\n\nSome people here have handwritten \"Vance\" underneath their Trump posters, making their own campaign signs after the recent announcement of Vance as Trump's running mate.\n\nWe are not sure when he will arrive here, but it could be soon.\n\nStick with us.\n\nJude Sheerin Reporting from the convention\n\nI've been speaking to some of the attendees here at the Republican convention.\n\nDr Elizabeth Hinds-Ferrick, 60, is a naturalised citizen, originally from Guyana, South America, but now of Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nThe Massachusetts delegate says: \"Itâs exhilarating, this is my first convention. Itâs exciting to be part of American history, especially after what happened to Trump on Saturday.\"\n\nHinds-Ferrick âstronglyâ believes the Republicans will win in November and is glad Trump picked JD Vance because Vance is âwiseâ and âvery knowledgeableâ.\n\nShe believes the US has gone âtoo far left\" - adding \"we need to come back to the centre\".\n\nAnthony Zurcher Reporting from the convention\n\nThe roll call of states relaying their primary results is over here in the convention hall.\n\nDonald Trump is now officially the nominee of the Republican Party. On Thursday he will take the stage to accept the nomination.\n\nAt the moment, the band is blasting old rock hits from one corner of the stage, and convention delegates are milling around the floor.\n\nLater tonight there will be speeches, videos and more music.\nThe formal part of Day One is over, and the week-long party is just starting.\n\nAnthony Zurcher Reporting from the convention\n\nItâs not hard to pick the Texas delegation out of the crowd on the floor of the Republican National Convention arena.\n\nTheyâre the ones in the red western shirts and the big white Stetson hats.\n\nTheyâre also one of the largest delegations to this convention, with prime seating near the front of the stage. This is because of the stateâs population and heavy Republican tilt.\n\nRegional garb is a bit of a tradition at political conventions, and the Texas Republicans take considerable pride in wearing their cowboy hats to the quadrennial gatherings.\n\nItâs just a taste of the Texas pride thatâs in store four years from now, when the Republican National Convention is scheduled to take place in Houston.\n\nAnthony Zurcher Reporting from the convention\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell may have made peace with Donald Trump, but the delegates to the Republican National Convention here in Wisconsin have not forgiven him.\n\nWhen the Kentucky senator appeared on the floor of the convention arena, his face shown on the large television screens, he was roundly booed by the crowd.\n\nAs Senate majority leader, McConnell regularly sparred with then-President Trump. And after the 6 January attack on the US Capitol, he had said the former president was âmorally responsible for provoking the events of that dayâ.\n\nYet McConnell announced in March that he would support the former presidentâs re-election bid - the last Republican leader in Congress to fall in line.\n\nMcConnell, who served as the Republican leader in the Senate since 2015, has proven to be an effective legislative tactician with a long record of accomplishment in the chamber, including helping to push through Trumpâs three nominees to the US Supreme Court.\n\nThat didnât seem to concern the Milwaukee convention crowd, though. Their response to McConnell is yet another sign that the delegates here in Wisconsin - and the Republican Party itself- have fully moved on from the partyâs old guard.\n\nDonald Trump is now officially the Republican party's candidate for the presidential election.\n\nHe has received a majority of delegate nominations at the Republican National Convention.\n\nTrump's son Eric, who was representing Florida, put Trump over the threshold.\n\nBack inside the Fiserv Forum, Republican National Convention (RNC) attendees have been reacting to the news that JD Vance will be Donald Trump's running mate.\n\nAs the former president announced his decision on social media, people at the convention in Milwaukee erupted into chants of \"JD\".\n\nBorn James David Bowman in Middletown, Ohio in 1984, Vance comes from a\nwhite, working class family mostly of Scottish-Irish decent. He was raised by\nhis maternal grandparents in the once-booming Appalachian coal country that is\nnow one of the country's poorest areas.\n\nVance joined the Marines for four years and served in Iraq before going\nto Ohio State University, where he received degrees in political science and\nphilosophy.\n\nFrom there, he attended Yale Law School, and then wrote a successful\nmemoir, Hillbilly Elegy, that some reviewers described as offering a window into a conservative\nwhite working class that is often overlooked.\n\nIn 2017, Vance moved back to Ohio from California, where he had been\nworking in biotech, and set up his own venture capital operation with support\nfrom PayPal founder Peter Thiel, a sometime libertarian and rare Republican in\nSilicon Valley.\n\nIn early 2021, Thiel gave $10m (Â£8m) to a committee seeking to recruit\nVance as a Senate candidate.\n\nOnce Vance joined the race, he abruptly changed his tone regarding\nTrump, apologising for previously calling him \"reprehensible\" and\neven repeating the president's false claims of voter fraud in the 2020\nelection.\n\nWith an endorsement from Trump, he clinched the Senate seat and has\nsince become an influential voice in Washington.\n\nYou can read more about Vance here .\n\nAnthony Zurcher North America correspondent\n\nDonald Trumpâs pick of Senator JD Vance suggests the former president\nknows that this election will be won and lost in a handful of industrial\nmidwest battleground states - Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nA native of Ohio, Vance gained popular attention after the release of\nhis bestselling memoir Hillbilly Elegy, which tells of his blue-collar upbringing\nand how it affected his politics and worldview. With his background, Vance\ncould be well positioned to connect with and turn out the kind of white,\nworking class voters who narrowly delivered those states to Trump in\n2016.\n\nVance had criticised Trump in the run-up to that race eight years ago -\nsomething Democrats are sure to point out - but he has since become an\noutspoken defender of the former president - particularly on television news\nnetworks. His recent loyalty, and effectiveness, certainly factored into\nTrumpâs decision.\n\nAt only 39, Vance will provide a youthful counterpoint to the elderly\ncandidates at the top of both presidential tickets. Trumpâs choice positions\nthe Ohioan to be at the forefront of a new generation of Maga Republicans. And\nif the former president returns to the Oval Office next year, Vance will\ninstantly join the conversation for the partyâs 2028 presidential nomination.\n\nDonald Trump has announced on his Truth Social platform , external that he has chosen  Ohio Senator JD Vance as his vice-presidential nominee.\n\n\"After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator JD Vance of the Great State of Ohio,\" Trump wrote.\n\nGareth Evans Reporting from Milwaukee\n\nOn the highway into Milwaukee, which many  state delegates will be driving along today, we passed more than a dozen huge billboards that underscore just how much politics is taking centre stage here this week.\n\nOne praises the Supreme Courtâs decision to overturn the Roe v Wade abortion ruling, one attacks Joe Bidenâs economic record â using the term âBidenflationâ â and there are Democratic billboards too, which label Donald Trump an extremist.\n\nThe former president also features in one which weâve seen multiple times.\n\nâI love Milwaukee,â it reads, with a picture of him pointing towards the city.\n\nJude Sheerin Reporting from Milwaukee\n\nGia Davila, 23, says many in her age group won't vote in November\n\nAt Red Arrow Park in downtown Milwaukee, the Coalition to March on the RNC is holding a rally before it heads to the convention centre.\n\nProtesters expressed cynicism not just about Donald Trump and Republicans, but about President Joe Biden and the Democrats. They held signs saying \"we can no longer afford the rich\". Another sign said: \"No racist Trump, No genocide Joe\". The image of Biden on the banner had bloody vampire teeth superimposed, while Trumpâs had a pig nose.\n\nGia Davila, 23, who lives in Tampa, Florida, is attending with the Freedom Road Socialist Organization. She describes herself as Marxist-Leninist.\n\nAsked why she is here, she says: \"Weâre tired as people who live in the United States, weâre tired of seeing the reality of the Republican attacks on the people from reproductive rights to racist attacks on everyday Americans.\"\n\nLike many people we spoke to at the rally, she doesn't support Biden either. \"Moderate doesnât even begin to describe him,\" she says. \"Heâs consistently supported a war on the people of Gaza.

      "text": "Texas governor seeks pardon for soldier who killed protester\n\nTexas Republicans are seeking to pardon a US Army sergeant convicted of killing a Black Lives Matter protester in 2020.\n\nOn Friday, a jury found Daniel Perry, 28, guilty of killing Garrett Foster, 27, during a demonstration in Austin. Perry is white, as was Foster.\n\nPerry's attorneys argue he acted in self-defence, but prosecutors say he instigated the confrontation.\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott said he would pardon Perry as soon as an official request \"hits my desk\".\n\nA judge is expected to set a sentencing date soon. Perry faces at least five years in prison, but could also be handed a life sentence, the Texas Tribune reported.\n\nPerry's supporters argue he should be pardoned because of the state's 'stand your ground' law, a type of statute that removes a person's obligation to retreat before using deadly force if their life is threatened and they are in a place they are permitted to be.\n\nOn 25 July 2020, Perry, a soldier who drove for Uber at the time, turned on to a street where Black Lives Matter demonstrators were marching, went through a red light and stopped his vehicle.\n\nFoster, a former Air Force mechanic who was openly carrying an AK-47 style weapon - which is legal in Texas - was one of several protesters who approached Perry's vehicle.\n\nPerry - who had no passenger at the time - said some of the demonstrators began banging on his car. The protesters told police they feared the vehicle might ram them, according to media accounts.\n\nPerry's lawyers said Foster \"began to raise the assault rifle toward Sgt Perry\", CNN reported.\n\nAccording to authorities, Perry lowered his window and shot Foster five times with a .357 revolver before driving off. He called 911 shortly afterwards. Foster died at a hospital from his injuries.\n\nOn Friday, a Travis County jury unanimously voted to convict him of Foster's murder. The jury found Perry not guilty on an additional charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nOn Saturday, Governor Abbott tweeted: \"I am working as swiftly as Texas law allows regarding the pardon of Sgt Perry.\"\n\nThe state's pardon board, which must approve such orders, said an \"expedited investigation\" would begin immediately.\n\nConservatives have attacked the prosecutor who brought the case, Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza, a Democrat.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton told Fox News that Mr Garza \"maliciously prosecutes people that he doesn't like for political purposes\".\n\nMr Garza described the pardon request as a \"naked political intrusion into our criminal justice system\".\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Texas Republicans confab hints at how GOP breakup with corporate America could play out\n\nAbraham George is about to take the helm of the Republican Party of Texas (RPT) at a time with the influential state-level political organization is casting aside its longstanding alliance with corporate America.\n\nIn its place, the RPT is embracing an anti-corporate, anti-elite populist agenda that is on the rise among Republicans across the country in the Trump era.\n\nThe annual Texas Republican Convention started Thursday in San Antonio, and culminated with George's election as party chair. The event has long featured lucrative corporate sponsorships by Fortune 500 companies. But this year, the names of its biggest past sponsors were missing from the banners and agendas.\n\nVerizon , Comcast and Union Pacific sponsored the 2020 Texas Republican convention, according to The Texas Tribune . But they are not listed as supporters this year.\n\nPepsi and Chevron were sponsors of the 2022 Texas Republican convention, but they are not backing this year's event.\n\nSpokespeople for Verizon, Comcast, Pepsi and Chevron did not reply to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Union Pacific said only that the company's \"political giving is bipartisan and publicly disclosed in accordance with state and federal laws.\"\n\nThe fight over corporate money also bubbled up in the election that George won on Friday, to lead the state party.\n\nVeteran Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak was among the group of candidates vying to be the next state GOP chair. In a memo declaring his candidacy, Mackowiak lamented that the \"party's corporate fundraising is virtually nonexistent.\"\n\nGriffin Perry, a Texas businessman and son of Republican former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, said earlier this week that it's time for the party to shift back to working with corporations.\n\n\"The next chair needs work with our corporations,\" Perry told CNBC. \"There's no reason the Republican Party of Texas should not have corporate support.\"\n\nAs for the lack of corporate sponsorship this year, Perry blamed the leadership team that was replaced on Friday. This team \"wears that as a badge of honor,\" he said, before the new chair of the state party was elected.\n\nIndeed, James Wesolek, the communications director for the RPT, told CNBC \"the Republican Party is the party of hard working Americans, not woke corporations seeking to destroy the America we love.\"\n\nWesolek denied that the disappearance of traditional sponsors impacted this week's state party convention.\n\n\"The party has fully funded our convention with sponsors that don't require us to compromise our values,\" he said.\n\nThis year, the sponsor list is almost entirely made up of political action committees and campaigns, and nearly devoid of corporate sponsors.\n\nAs of Thursday, the only two publicly traded companies on the sponsorship list were tobacco giant Altria and Houston-based electrical and natural gas utility CenterPoint Energy.\n\nPatriot Mobile, which bills itself as the nation's only \" Christian conservative wireless provider ,\" was also listed, as was Conn's HomePlus.\n\nBut it's not just the Texas GOP's state convention that is losing corporate sponsorships.\n\nCorporate donations to the state party's general fundraising account have sunk to their lowest levels in at least a decade, according to The Texas Tribune .\n\nIt's been eight years since the tech giant Google contributed money to the Republican Party of Texas, according to campaign finance records.\n\nIt's a similar story with over half a dozen other companies including BNSF Railway , the rail giant headquartered in the Lone Star State. BSNF's last donation to the Republican Party of Texas was in 2019 for $5,000, according to the records.\n\nSince then, no money has showed up in the state party's coffers from either BNSF or Google, according to campaign finance reports. A representative for Google declined to comment. BNSF did not return requests for comment.\n\nVerizon and Union Pacific have each given at least $5,000 to the Texas Republican Party this year, however, according to campaign finance records.\n\nAs the party continues to move further to the right, some companies who used to be regular supporters of the Texas Republican Party are now holding back their money, according to state campaign finance records.\n\nThese one-time corporate sponsors are put off, political operatives and fundraisers in the state tell CNBC, by Texas Republicans' increasingly anti-corporate rhetoric, their vicious infighting and a number of policy positions that are increasingly conservative.\n\nFor example, a law enacted in 2022 bars all abortions in Texas except in rare, extreme cases, and it allows for the prosecution of doctors and medical professionals. In 2023, Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill banning gender-affirming medical care for minors.\n\nEarlier this year, the Texas public school's investment fund pulled $8.5 billion out from under management by BlackRock , due to what it alleged was the firm's reluctance to invest in fossil fuels. BlackRock denied the allegation.\n\n\"I can understand why corporations don't want to participate in a convention, because they would appear to be supporting a [Republican] organization that attacks Republican office holders,\" said Wayne Hamilton, a longtime Republican operative who once served as an executive director of the RPT.\n\nHamilton and other political consultants who spoke to CNBC pointed to how the state party took the extraordinary step of formally censuring Texas House Republican Speaker Dade Phelan and U.S. Rep. Tony Gonzalez, R-Texas.\n\nPhelan was censured for his role in the impeachment of Republican state Attorney General Ken Paxton . Gonzales was censured for supporting a bipartisan gun safety law in Congress, and for voting in favor of a bill that codifies the right to same-sex marriage.\n\nDespite having few tangible legal consequences, the censures have had real political consequences for Phelan and Gonzalez: Both men face runoffs May 28 in their Republican primary elections.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Texas Republicans put Trump ally Attorney General Ken Paxton on trial\n\nAUSTIN, Texas - Attorney General Ken Paxton pleaded not guilty to 20 articles of impeachment alleging corruption, abuse of public trust, misuse of public funds and more, as the Texas Senate began a historic impeachment trial Tuesday.\n\nThe Republican firebrand was impeached in May by an overwhelming vote in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives over his involvement with real estate developer and donor Nate Paul. Now, the state Senate - convened as a high court of impeachment - will determine whether or not to remove him from office.\n\nRepublican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is presiding over the proceedings, swore in the Texas senators as jurors on Tuesday morning, while some 200 spectators - including members of the public and the media - watched from the Senate gallery above, before turning to pre-trial motions.\n\nPaxton's attorneys had filed more than a dozen motions to dismiss the articles of impeachment or exclude evidence from being considered, and all of them failed Tuesday morning when as many as a dozen Republican senators joined with the Democratic senators to vote against the motions.\n\nBut Paxton secured one key win Tuesday, when the lieutenant governor - who alone decides procedural matters, under the rules approved by the Senate - decided that Paxton could not be forced to appear as a witness at his own trial.\n\nHouse impeachment managers had sought to compel the attorney general to be called to the witness stand, though they said in a filing that they expected he would invoke his right not to self-incriminate.\n\nThe historic trial marks a dramatic fall for a man who gained a national profile as a leader of red states' opposition on everything from health care to immigration during President Barack Obama's administration and who became a key conservative ally of Donald Trump when he was in the White House. Paxton has denied all wrongdoing and vowed to fight the allegations.\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nMore than 100 people have received subpoenas to testify, and some of them appeared outside the Senate door on Tuesday. Two declined to speak, citing a gag order Patrick issued surrounding the case.\n\nThe potential witnesses reportedly include Paul, the developer and donor from whom Paxton is accused of accepting bribes, and current and former staffers from the attorney general's office - some of whom told the FBI he should be investigated for bribery and abuse of office. The attorney general's 2022 primary challenger George P. Bush and even famed Texas political strategist Karl Rove are also both on the list of potential witnesses, as is Laura Olson - the woman with whom Paxton was allegedly having an extramarital affair - according to The Dallas Morning News , which obtained the confidential witness.\n\nState Sen. Angela Paxton, the attorney general's wife, and state Sen. Bryan Hughes also appeared on the initial witness lists, a reminder of how inherently political and personal the proceedings are within the Texas Republican Party. Angela Paxton, who cannot vote in her husband's impeachment trial but must attend, has since been removed, according to The Dallas Morning News.\n\n\"It's not a criminal trial. It's not a civil trial. It's a political trial,\" Patrick said in an interview with Fox 26 Houston, a local television station , this summer.\n\nPaxton and his allies, including Trump, have already threatened political retribution for impeaching Paxton.\n\n\"Hopefully Republicans in the Texas House will agree that this is a very unfair process that should not be allowed to happen or proceed - I will fight you if it does,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social during House impeachment proceedings against Paxton.\n\nJonathan Stickland, president of the far-right Defend Texas Liberty PAC, recently appeared on Steve Bannon's \"War Room\" podcast with a candidate for Dallas County GOP chair, Lauren Davis. The pair rallied viewers to pressure a half-dozen specific Republican senators to vote against impeachment.\n\n\"We're spending millions of dollars,\" Stickland said on the show. \"Anyone who votes against Ken Paxton in this impeachment is risking their entire political career, and we will make sure that that is the case.\"\n\nSome Paxton supporters also showed up in hopes of seeing the articles of impeachment dismissed by the Senate.\n\n\"He got elected by us, they're trying to overturn our votes,\" said Kaci Sisk, president of the Bulverde Spring Branch Conservative Republicans. Sisk and members of her group arrived at the Capitol in matching red shirts just after 6 a.m. to wait in line for tickets to sit in the Senate gallery.\n\n\"We don't care, we don't care. We elected him knowing everything,\" Sisk said. \"He is the best attorney general that we have ever had. He's very important to not just the state of Texas, but to this country. He leads the way for this country.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Texas AG Ken Paxton's affair explains his illegal acts, former aide testifies at impeachment trial\n\nAn extramarital affair Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton had with a donor's employee helped connect the dots about why the Republican was using his power in ways that are now at the center of his impeachment trial on accusations of corruption, a former top aide testified Wednesday.\n\n\"It answered that 'why' question,\" said Jeff Mateer, who was Paxton's second-in-command at the Texas attorney general's office.\n\nThe account by Mateer, who went on to report Paxton to the FBI in 2020 over allegations of abuse of office, quickly injected an affair that Paxton has acknowledged to staff into the historic impeachment trial - the gravest threat to Paxton's political career after years of criminal charges and alleged scandal.\n\nAt the center of the case are accusations that Texas' top lawyer wrongfully used his power to help Austin real estate developer Nate Paul, one of his political supporters who was under FBI investigation at the time and was indicted this summer on charges of making false statements to banks.\n\nDuring hours of occasionally tense cross-examination, Paxton attorney Tony Buzbee did not delve into the affair, but waived off Paul's $25,000 campaign contribution as an unremarkable donation in Texas politics and suggested Mateer and other deputies wanted to seize power.\n\n\"You were staging a coup, weren't you?\" said Buzbee, a high-profile Houston attorney whose past clients have included former Texas Gov. Rick Perry.\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" Mateer replied.\n\nPaxton, who is not required to attend the proceedings in the Texas Senate, was again absent when Mateer took the stand as the first key witness in a trial that could last several weeks. Paxton's wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton, is not allowed to vote in the trial and watched from her desk while Mateer testified.\n\nMore than 100 people have been identified as potential witnesses for the trial, according to a list obtained by The Associated Press. They include the woman with whom Paxton had the affair, but it is unclear whether she or others on the list will testify.\n\nBy starting with Mateer, Republican impeachment managers opened their case with one of the closest members of Paxton's former inner circle. But they also put forth a first witness with firm conservative credentials before a jury of mostly Republican senators.\n\nMateer, a Christian conservative lawyer, was once nominated by former President Donald Trump for a federal judgeship. Paxton has argued that the impeachment is politically motivated and driven by members of the GOP who are \"RINOs\" - meaning \"Republicans in name only.\"\n\nThe Republican-led House voted 121-23 to impeach Paxton in May, with the 20 articles of impeachment including abuse of public trust, unfitness for office and bribery. The vote immediately suspended Paxton and made him only the third sitting official in Texas' nearly 200-year history to be impeached.\n\nA two-thirds majority - or 21 senators - is required for conviction, meaning that if all 12 Democrats vote against Paxton, at least nine Republicans would have to join them.\n\nAccording to Mateer, he and other senior staff under Paxton had grown increasingly concerned as their boss began taking what appeared to be a personal interest in Paul's claims that he had been unjustly targeted by the FBI. He said they became particularly troubled when Paxton hired an inexperienced outside lawyer to look into Paul's accusations that appeared baseless.\n\nMateer said he struggled to understand why Paxton was helping Paul, but that upon learning about the continued affair, the situation became clearer in his mind. He said he and other staff members, including seven other whistleblowers who also went to the FBI, tried to help Paxton but to no avail.\n\n\"We couldn't protect him because he didn't want to be protected,\" Mateer said.\n\nHow much Paxton will take part in Texas' first impeachment trial in nearly a half century is up in the air. Paxton left the proceedings early and cannot be compelled to testify.\n\n\"I want to thank you all for your prayers and support. I will never back down for defending freedom,\" Paxton posted Tuesday on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nOn Tuesday, dozens of Paxton supporters came to watch the start of the proceedings, some of whom traveled hundreds of miles. But on Wednesday, many rows in the Senate gallery were bare as the trial resumed.\n\nFor years, many Texas Republicans have resisted criticizing or facing head-on the litany of legal troubles surrounding Paxton, who has remained popular among the hard right by aligning himself closely to Trump and rushing his office into lawsuits that have halted priorities of the Biden administration.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Texan Republicans lose bid to halt drive-through voting but fight continues\n\nA group of Texas Republicans has lost one of two legal challenges they brought in the hope of halting drive-through voting in Houston and having more than 120,000 votes thrown out.\n\nIn a brief order issued on Sunday, the Texas Supreme Court denied a request by conservative activist Steven Hotze and others for an order that drive-through voting violates Texas election law.\n\nA nearly identical case brought by the same plaintiffs is pending in federal court. The judge assigned to that case has scheduled an emergency hearing for Monday morning.\n\n\"Tomorrow we will be in front of a federal judge who will have an opportunity to review the federal claims we have asserted,\" Jared Woodfill, a lawyer for Hotze, said in an e-mail.\n\nWoodfill added that his clients may eventually take their fight to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nDemocratic-leaning Harris County, home to about 4.7 million people, is the third-most populous county in the United States. It currently has 10 drive-through polling sites, which are available to all voters.\n\nHarris County Clerk Chris Hollins has called drive-through voting a safe alternative to in-person voting during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTexas, the second-largest U.S. state , is traditionally Republican, but polls show a close race between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden with more than 9 million ballots already cast, eclipsing the state's total turnout from the 2016 presidential election.\n\nSunday's order came as little surprise after the state's supreme court on Oct. 22 denied a similar request to halt drive-through voting, in a lawsuit filed by the Republican parties of Texas and Harris County.\n\nU.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen in Houston is due to hold an emergency hearing on Monday in the federal court action brought by Hotze and other plaintiffs, who include state Representative Steve Toth, a Republican.\n\nThey want Hanen to direct officials to halt drive-through voting and reject the roughly 127,000 ballots that have already been cast at ten drive-through voting sites.\n\nThe request to void votes is \"wholly unreasonable,\" Democratic groups, including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said on Friday in a motion asking to intervene in the case.\n\n\"Plaintiffs ask this Court to throw Texas's election into chaos by invalidating the votes of more than 100,000 eligible Texas voters who cast their ballots at drive-thru voting locations at the invitation of county officials and in reliance on the Texas Supreme Court's decision to allow drive-thru voting to proceed,\" the groups said.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Texas mail ballot rejections soar under new restrictions\n\nTexas threw out mail votes at an abnormally high rate during the nation's first primary of 2022, rejecting nearly 23,000 ballots outright under tougher voting rules that are part of a broad campaign by Republicans to reshape American elections, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.\n\nRoughly 13% of mail ballots returned in the March 1 primary were discarded and uncounted across 187 counties in Texas. While historical primary comparisons are lacking, the double-digit rejection rate would be far beyond what is typical in a general election, when experts say anything above 2% is usually cause for attention.\n\n\"My first reaction is 'yikes,'\" said Charles Stewart III, director of the Election Data and Science Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"It says to me that there's something seriously wrong with the way that the mail ballot policy is being administered.\"\n\nRepublicans promised new layers of voting rules would make it \"easier to vote and harder to cheat.\" But the final numbers recorded by AP lay bare the glaring gulf between that objective and the obstacles, frustration and tens of thousands of uncounted votes resulting from tighter restrictions and rushed implementation.\n\nIn Texas, a state former President Donald Trump easily won although by a smaller margin than 2016, the trouble of navigating new rules was felt in counties big and small, red and blue. But the rejection rate was higher in counties that lean Democratic (15.1%) than Republican (9.1%).\n\nThe unusually high rejection rate to start America's midterm election season is expected to put more attention on changes to the ballot box elsewhere in the country. Texas' election was the debut of more restrictive voting rules the GOP raced to put on the books across the U.S. in time for the midterm elections, a push that took particular aim at mail voting that soared in popularity during the pandemic.\n\nAt least 17 other states in the coming months will cast ballots under tougher election laws, in part driven by Trump's baseless and persistent claims of rampant fraud in the 2020 election. The rejected ballots in Texas alone far exceeds the hundreds of even possible voter fraud cases the AP has previously identified in six battleground states that Trump disputed.\n\nThe AP counted 22,898 rejected ballots across Texas by contacting all 254 counties and obtaining final vote reconciliation reports. Some smaller counties did not provide data or respond to requests, but the 187 counties that provided full numbers to AP accounted for 85% of the 3 million people who voted in the primary.\n\nLast week, AP reported that 27,000 ballots had been flagged in Texas for initial rejection , meaning those voters still had time to \"fix\" their ballot for several days after the primary and have it count. But the final figures suggest most voters did not.\n\nThe most rejections were around Houston, a Democratic stronghold, where Harris County elections officials reported that nearly 7,000 mail ballots - about 19% - were discarded. During the last midterm elections in 2018, Texas' largest county only rejected 135 mail ballots. Harris County elections officials said they received more than 8,000 calls since January from voters seeking help, which they attributed to \"confusion and frustration\" over the new requirements.\n\nIn the five counties won by Trump that had the most mail-in primary voters, a combined 2,006 mailed ballots were rejected, a rate of 10% of the total. In the counties won by Biden with the most mail-in voters, which include most of Texas' biggest cities, a combined 14,020 votes were similarly rejected, which amounted to 15.7%.\n\nIn rural East Texas, Annette Young voted by mail like usual but received a surprising letter a week after the primary, informing her that the ballot never counted because it didn't comply with a new state law requiring mail voters to include personal identification numbers.\n\n\"I just threw it right in the trash,\" she said.\n\nMost of the rejected ballots, according to county election officials and the Texas secretary of state, failed to adhere to the new identification requirements. The changes were part of the sweeping overhaul to Texas' elections that Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law in October, saying at the time that \"no one who is eligible to vote will be denied the opportunity to vote.\"\n\nAbbott and top Texas Republicans who championed the changes have largely been silent about the high rejection rates. Abbott's office did not respond to requests seeking comment, and messages for Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Republican House Speaker Dade Phelan also went unanswered.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Paul Bettencourt, a proponent of the changes, said in an email that one issue might have been that ballot instructions printed in different ink colors - red for signature, black for identification numbers - might have left voters with the wrong impression they did not need to provide both.\n\nFederal data on discarded mail ballots in general elections show few instances of double-digit rejection rates. The outliers include Indiana (14.5%) in 2006, Oregon (12.7%) in 2010 and New York (13.7%) in 2018, according to records from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.\n\nStewart, of MIT, said generally less is known about trends in primary elections because of lacking data. One assumption, he said, is that because primaries tend to draw the most habitual voters, they are less likely to mistakes that cause rejections. But Stewart said others believe that officials may have more time to scrutinize, and reject, ballot paperwork in low-turnout elections.\n\nThe new mail ballot requirements in Texas include listing an identification number - either a driver's license or a Social Security number - on the ballot's carrier envelope. That number must match the county's records, and if a ballot is rejected, voters are given the opportunity to supply the missing information or simply cast a ballot in person instead.\n\nIt is unknown how many Texas voters whose mail ballots were rejected may have still had their vote count by deciding to just show up in person instead.\n\nSam Taylor, a spokesman for the Texas secretary of state, said the office did not yet have its own final comprehensive numbers on ballot rejections. He said a \"significant portion\" of their efforts this year will be awareness about the new mail-in rules.\n\n\"We are confident we will have all the information we need to apply any lessons learned during the primary to an even more robust voter education campaign heading into the November general election,\" he said.\n\nDelores Tarver Smith, 87, took no chances with a mail ballot this year. She applied in Harris County for a mail ballot Feb. 1, but when none arrived by election day, she went and voted in person.\n\nLast Wednesday - more than a week after the primary - her absentee ballot finally showed up at her home.\n\n\"I just went in person to vote, because I had to make sure my vote counted,\" she said.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "GOP Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is acquitted of 16 impeachment charges following years of corruption allegations\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton was acquitted Saturday of all charges at a historic impeachment trial that divided Republicans over whether to remove a powerful defender of former President Donald Trump after years of scandal and criminal charges.\n\nThe verdict reaffirmed Paxton's durability in America's biggest red state and is a broader victory for Texas' hard right after an extraordinary trial that put on display fractures within the GOP nationally heading into the 2024 elections. In the end, Paxton was fully cleared by Senate Republicans, who serve alongside his wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton.\n\nAngela Paxton was not allowed to vote. But she attended all two weeks of the trial, including the reading of the verdict, when all but two of her fellow Republican senators consistently voted to acquit her husband on 16 impeachment articles that accused him of misconduct, bribery and corruption.\n\nKen Paxton, who was absent for most of the proceedings, did not attend the verdict but issued a triumphant statement immediately after the verdict, blasting his Republican rivals who impeached him in the Texas House in May.\n\n\"Today, the truth prevailed. The truth could not be buried by mudslinging politicians or their powerful benefactors,\" Paxton said. \"I've said many times: Seek the truth! And that is what was accomplished.\"\n\nThe Senate also voted to dismiss four impeachment articles that weren't taken up at the trial. It clears the way for Paxton to reclaim his role as Texas' top lawyer, more than three months after his stunning impeachment in the Texas House forced him to temporarily step aside.\n\nThe outcome far from ends Paxton's troubles. He still faces trial on felony securities fraud charges, remains under a separate FBI investigation and is in jeopardy of losing his ability to practice law in Texas because of his baseless attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe jury of 30 senators spent about eight hours deliberating behind closed doors before emerging for the historic vote. The Senate is led by Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who served as Texas chairman of Trump's previous presidential campaigns, and who served as the presiding judge for the trial.\n\nPatrick, a former conservative radio host in Houston, had said little about the case leading up to the trial but unleashed a blistering attack over the impeachment the moment it was over. Still sitting on the podium where he oversaw the trial, Patrick said the process had been \"rammed\" through the Texas House and vowed to pursue a change to the state constitution so it couldn't happen again.\n\n\"Millions of taxpayer dollars have been wasted on this impeachment,\" Patrick said.\n\nIn Senate gallery, among those who staked out an early seat for the impeachment vote were three of Paxton's former deputies who reported him to the FBI in 2020 and were key witnesses during the trial for House impeachment managers. One of them left before the conclusion of the verdict as it became clear the votes were going Paxton's way.\n\nThere was no visible reaction from the former deputies - David Maxwell, Ryan Vassar and Blake Brickman - after Paxton was acquitted on Article 6, termination of whistleblowers.\n\nAfter the trial was concluded, Angela Paxton went over to her husband's legal team and hugged them before leaving the chamber.\n\nThe trial had plunged Texas Republicans into unfamiliar waters as they confront whether Paxton should be removed over allegations that he abused his office to protect a political donor who was under FBI investigation.\n\nThe trial confronted Paxton, whose three terms in office have been marred by scandal and criminal charges, with a defining test of his political durability after an extraordinary impeachment that was driven by his fellow Republicans and has widened party fractures in America's biggest red state. For nearly a decade, Paxton has elevated his national profile by rushing his office into polarizing courtroom battles across the U.S., winning acclaim from Donald Trump and the GOP's hard right.\n\nMaking one final appeal to convict Texas' top lawyer, impeachment managers used their closing arguments Friday to cast him as a crook who needed to go.\n\n\"If we don't keep public officials from abusing the powers of their office, then frankly no one can,\" Republican state Rep. Andrew Murr, who helped lead the impeachment in the Texas House, said in his closing arguments.\n\nIn an angry and defiant rebuttal, Paxton lawyer Tony Buzbee on Friday unleashed attacks on a wide-ranging cast of figures both inside and outside the Texas Capitol, mocking a Texas Ranger who warned Paxton he was risking indictment and another accuser who cried on the witness stand.\n\nLeaning into divisions among Republicans, Buzbee portrayed the impeachment as a plot orchestrated by an old guard of GOP rivals. He singled out George P. Bush, the nephew of former President George W. Bush who challenged Paxton in the 2022 Republican primary, punctuating a blistering closing argument that questioned the integrity of FBI agents and railed against Texas' most famous political dynasty.\n\n\"I would suggest to you this is a political witch hunt,\" Buzbee said. \"I would suggest to you that this trial has displayed, for the country to see, a partisan fight within the Republican Party.\"\n\nThe case centers on accusations that Paxton misused his office to help one of his donors, Austin real estate developer Nate Paul, who was indicted in June on charges of making false statements to banks. Paul has pleaded not guilty.\n\nEight of Paxton's former deputies reported him to the FBI in 2020, setting off a federal investigation that will continue regardless of the verdict. Federal prosecutors investigating Paxton took testimony in August before a grand jury in San Antonio , according to two people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because of secrecy rules around the proceeding.\n\nOne said the grand jury heard from Drew Wicker, Paxton's former personal aide. At the impeachment trial, Wicker testified that he once heard a contractor tell Paxton he would need to check with \"Nate\" about the cost of renovations to the attorney general's Austin home.\n\nDuring closing arguments, the defense told senators there was either no evidence for the charges or that there wasn't enough to rise beyond a reasonable doubt. The House impeachment managers, by contrast, walked through specific documents and played clips of testimony by the deputies who reported Paxton to the FBI.\n\nOne of the impeachment articles centers on an alleged extramarital affair Paxton had with Laura Olson, who worked for Paul. It alleges that Paul's hiring of Olson amounted to a bribe. She was called to the witness stand but ultimately never testified. Another article alleges the developer also bribed Paxton by paying for his home renovations.\n\nPaxton faces an array of legal troubles beyond the impeachment. Besides the federal investigation for the same allegations that gave rise to his impeachment, he also faces a bar disciplinary proceeding over his effort to overturn the 2020 election and has yet to stand trial on state securities fraud charges dating to 2015.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty in the state case, but his lawyers have said removal from office might open the door to a plea agreement.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Supreme court largely backs Texas Republicans over electoral maps\n\nIn a 5-4 ruling, the court's conservative majority ruled that the challengers had not done enough to show that the Republican-led Texas legislature acted with discriminatory intent when it adopted new electoral maps in 2013 for state legislative and U.S. congressional seats. Republican President Donald Trump's administration had backed Texas in the case. The court did rule, however, that one of the state legislature districts was unlawful.\n\nLast September, the high court put on hold two lower court rulings from earlier in 2017 that had invalidated a series of Texas electoral districts. The justices then, as they were in Monday's ruling, were divided 5-4, with the conservative justices backing the Texas Republicans and the liberals dissenting.\n\nIn the ruling, conservative Justice Samuel Alito said the lower court had \"committed a fundamental legal error\" in the way it had analyzed the dispute.\n\nThe maps, adopted in 2013 and challenged by individual voters and civil rights groups representing blacks and Hispanics, were based on court-drawn districts imposed for the 2012 election after prior Republican-draw maps drawn the previous year also were tossed as racially discriminatory. The maps at issue in the case have been in effect throughout the litigation.\n\nThe Texas legislature was under no legal obligation to show it had \"cured\" the \"unlawful intent\" that led to the lower court to throw out the original maps, Alito wrote.\n\nThe lower court found that the configuration of two U.S. House of Representatives districts violated the Voting Rights Act, a 1965 federal law that protects minority voters and was enacted to address a history of racial discrimination in voting, especially in Southern states. Texas has 36 U.S. House districts, 25 held by Republicans and 11 by Democrats.\n\nThe same court found similar faults with Texas state House of Representatives maps.\n\nGerrymandering typically is accomplished by packing voters who tend to favor a particular party into a small number of districts to reduce their statewide voting power while scattering others in districts in numbers too small to be a majority.\n\nThe Supreme Court issued two gerrymandering rulings last week on narrow legal grounds in cases involving Wisconsin and Maryland but both those disputes involved allegations that districts were configured for partisan gain rather than for racial discrimination.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Texas Republicans Call for GOP House Speaker Dade Phelan to Resign\n\nTexas Republicans have formally called on Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan to resign, in part because of his campaign to impeach state Attorney General Ken Paxton.\n\nMr. Phelan and Mr. Paxton are both Republicans.\n\nThe resolution also faults Mr. Phelan for appointing Democrats to chair legislative committees and blocking legislation authored by Republicans.\n\n\"Speaker Dade Phelan ignored or actively undermined several GOP priorities during the regular session and failed to advance salient legislation to secure our borders and our elections,\" it reads.\n\n\"New leadership is needed in the Texas House of Representatives for the upcoming special session, and potential subsequent special sessions, to ensure that conservative priorities are achieved and that members are no longer pressured to act and vote contrary to the Platform, Principles, and Priorities of the Party they represent and of its voters.\"\n\nThe Texas Republican Party wants Mr. Phelan to resign as speaker, which would allow Republicans to select a new speaker.\n\nIf he doesn't, then Republicans should vote him out, the party stated.\n\nMr. Phelan's spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe party's Senate Republican Executive Committee voted 58-2 to approve the resolution, a spokesman told The Epoch Times in an email.\n\nBill Fairbrother and Morgan Graham are the two members who voted against the resolution.\n\nThe articles of impeachment included bribery and abusing public trust.\n\n\"We didn't vote to impeach because we wanted to punish our state's top attorney, but rather to open the door to a fair and thorough discussion of the evidence before determining whether Paxton abused his office to a degree so extreme that makes him unfit for office. I stand by that vote, and I stand by the belief that Paxton's conduct is beneath the office he holds.\"\n\nMr. Phelan claimed that the Senate allowed \"politics to prevail over principles,\" pointing to how some witnesses weren't called to testify. He said other legal matters, including lawsuits, may lead to Mr. Paxton's removal.\n\nMr. Paxton said in a statement that \"the truth could not be buried by mudslinging politicians or their powerful benefactors.\" He described Mr. Phelan as a liberal presiding over a kangaroo court. Mr. Paxton has previously urged Mr. Phelan to resign.\n\n\"Despite this embarrassing conduct, and his continuing erratic behavior, Phelan has refused to resign. He has also wasted millions of tax dollars on a politically motivated sham impeachment, killed a critical border security bill and empowered an Obama lawyer to stop conservative legislation,\" Mr. Patrick said in a new statement, referring to the House parliamentarian appointed by Mr. Phelan.\n\nMr. Patrick also criticized that the House voted to impeach Mr. Paxton without hearing any testimony.\n\n\"The Senate spent 90 days preparing for the trial, spent nine days in trial listening to some of the best attorneys in Texas question and cross-examine witnesses under oath. The jury took an oath to listen to the testimony, the evidence, the facts, and follow the law and the Constitution. They deliberated for nine hours and examined hundreds of exhibits,\" he said.\n\n\"Every Senator put their hand on the Sam Houston Bible and took an oath to follow the law and evidence. No one in the House put their hand on the Bible when they cast their vote nor did the Speaker. I respect each Senators vote no matter how they voted. The speaker should do the same.\"\n\nMr. Patrick has also asked for an audit of the impeachment process. The audit would detail all expenses, including document production and attorney fees."

      "text": "Texas Speaker Primary Election a Litmus Test for Republican Party\n\nIn a Texas primary contest with national implications, GOP heavy hitters are uniting to oust Republican House Speaker Dade Phelan from office on Super Tuesday.\n\nThe Republican speaker faces the fight of his political career with former President Donald Trump and Texas GOP leaders backing Mr. Phelan's main primary opponent, David Covey, in the March 5 Republican primary.\n\nMr. Phelan poked more than one bear in 2023, angering many grassroots Republicans during the last Texas legislative session by leading the House impeachment of Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, and failing to push GOP legislative priorities such as school choice.\n\nThe outcome of Mr. Phelan's race stands to be a referendum on the influence of the party's most conservative members. It could offer a glimpse into the future of the national Republican Party, according to Brendan Steinhauser, a partner with the political consulting firm Steinhauser Strategies in Austin, Texas.\n\n\"I think it's a fight for the heart and soul of the Republican Party,\" he said.\n\nUnder Mr. Phelan, Texas House lawmakers voted 123-23 to impeach Mr. Paxton, but he was acquitted by the Senate 19-11 on 16 articles of impeachment that alleged bribery, obstruction of justice, and abuse of public trust.\n\nPresident Trump, a supporter of Mr. Paxton, got involved in the local race after calling the impeachment \"unfair\" and accusing Mr. Phelan of being a \"RINO,\" or Republican in name only.\n\nBesides the former president, a powerful lineup of Texas Republicans-Mr. Paxton, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, and Republican Party of Texas Chairman Matt Rinaldi-are backing Mr. Phelan's main challenger.\n\nIt marked only the fourth such censure in the state party's history.\n\nMeanwhile, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, also a Republican, has remained silent on Mr. Phelan's primary race but notably hasn't endorsed him.\n\nGrassroots Republicans expressed outrage that one of their own party members had attempted to remove Mr. Paxton, a fierce opponent of the Biden administration.\n\nIn presidential politics, the ideological battle is similar. President Trump is betting his populist conservative message will beat his opponent Nikki Haily's more moderate one favored by establishment Republicans.\n\n\"I would look at Texas and say this primary is going to be really indicative of where the energy is,\" Mr. Steinhauser said.\n\nHe says the Republican Party has moved farther to the right for the past 14 years, beginning with the Tea Party movement in 2010 that ushered in notables such as senators Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Ted Cruz of Texas (R-Texas).\n\nThe grassroots movement was a mix of libertarians, conservatives, and populists.\n\n\"So there's a long history of this internecine warfare in the Republican Party,\" Mr. Steinhauser said.\n\nLikewise, the Democrats have been moving further to the left with the inclusion of socialists within their party, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\nPresident Trump is an excellent example of a grassroots candidate, Mr. Steinhauser said.\n\nThe former president now dominates the Republican Party and remains popular beyond his base, he said.\n\nPolitical opponents that once opposed him, such as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who ran against him in 2016 for the Republican presidential nomination, have lined up behind President Trump because they see him as the inevitable nominee, he said.\n\nPolitically, Texas represents a microcosm of issues facing Republicans, such as the use of lawfare against Trump and his supporters.\n\nTexas Republicans took to social media over Mr. Paxton's impeachment, suspicious that liberal Republicans used lawfare to usurp the will of voters and eliminate a staunch conservative.\n\nAccusations of wrongdoing against Mr. Paxton have been public for years, yet he easily won reelection in 2022 against George P. Bush, who was seen as an establishment candidate. Mr. Bush is the nephew of former president George W. Bush of Texas.\n\n\"I think the impeachment vote of Ken Paxton really stirred a hornet's nest,\" Mr. Steinhauser said. \"I expect grassroots candidates to do really well here in Texas and around the country.\"\n\nOther Texas issues, such as securing the border to stop illegal immigration, have become national issues for Republicans as well.\n\nKelly Perry, chair of the state GOP Border Security Committee, blames Mr. Phelan for letting a strong border protection bill die in the House.\n\nIt would have launched a new state Border Protection Unit, which would have allowed retired Border Patrol agents to serve, she said.\n\nThe Border Protection Unit Act declared that Texas was under threat from cartels and opioid trafficking and invoked Section 10, Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution, which gives states the right to defend themselves during an \"invasion.\"\n\nYet Mr. Phelan allowed a point of order to kill the bill, Ms. Perry said.\n\nA point of order can be called when there appears to be a flaw in the bill's language. It is a tactic often used by state Democrats to kill a bill.\n\nThe law makes it a Class B misdemeanor to cross the Mexico-Texas border illegally, between ports of entry.

Alicia Davis, a hairdresser, is the third candidate in the race.\n\nMr. Covey said in an email to The Epoch Times that Mr. Phelan and his Democratic allies killed important legislation.\n\n\"The support that I have seen, both in the community and from Republican leadership, sends the message that our elected officials work for the people and our values, and when they fail to do so, there are consequences,\" he said."

      "text": "What's the Matter With Texas Republicans When It Comes to School Choice Legislation?\n\nThis has been the year for school choice all over the country. At least six additional states joined Arizona and Florida to give parents the funds to send their children to private and charter schools.\n\nSurprisingly, deep-red Texas is not among these states-at least not yet. Currently, there is no school choice in the Lone Star State for low-income parents. Gov. Greg Abbott and a broad coalition of parent groups are pushing for the state House to clear a historic education savings account bill that has already passed the state Senate.\n\nBut a small handful of rural Republican politicians in the House are still voting with the Democrats and teachers unions to block a measure that would give over 5 million Texas students and their parents the power to decide which school to attend. Rural representatives are arguing that this would take money from their local grade schools and high schools.\n\nState Reps. Ken King, a former school board president from Canadian, Texas, Gary VanDeaver, a former school superintendent from New Boston, Texas, and Drew Darby of San Angelo, Texas, are among the Republicans holding up this game-changing bill. They all argue that the public schools in their districts are working just fine.\n\nReally? King represents a Texas Panhandle school district where less than half of students are at or above grade level in reading, and only 40 percent of students in his district are at or above grade level in math. VanDeaver represents a northeast Texas district where only 52 percent of students in his district are at or above grade level in reading, and only 43 percent are at or above grade level for math. Darby's Central Texas district has less than half of the children reading or doing math at or above grade level.\n\nAn additional Republican lawmaker, state Rep. Ernest Bailes from the small Southeast Texas city of Shepherd, is voting against choice even though only 27 percent of students are performing at or above grade level in math in his district.\n\nAre these Republicans really arguing this miserable performance is the best Texas can do for its children? The opponents also fail to acknowledge that the bill they oppose actually directs more money per student for rural district schools and higher pay for teachers. Meanwhile, states such as Arizona report improvements in test scores in rural areas once schools had to compete for students with private schools.\n\nAll this is to say that education choice is proving to be a win-win for Texas children that stay in public schools and the families who are given the funds to opt for better alternatives."

      "text": "As Midterms Approach, Texas Republicans Happy About Stronger Voter Integrity Laws\n\nWith midterm elections taking center stage in Texas-where Republicans hope to flip deep-blue territories in the Rio Grande Valley red-election integrity laws are key.\n\nLike other states, Texas began focusing on strengthening voting laws after the 2020 election raised questions about irregularities mainly centered on mail-in ballots, drop boxes, and ballot harvesting.\n\nIn 2021, the Republican-led legislature in Texas passed Senate Bill 1, a sweeping election reform bill applauded by conservatives for adding protection against voter fraud.\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, vehemently opposed the bill calling it voter suppression.\n\nThe law banned several practices, such as 24-hour and drive-thru voting, which Harris County used in 2020.\n\nIt forbids counties from sending out mail-in ballot applications to people who didn't request them. It also required mail-in ballots that are dropped off to be received by an election official, not a drop box.\n\nThe bill authorized election audits starting with the 2020 election. Phase one of the audit results released in December found a total of 11,737 potential non-U.S. citizens registered to vote in Texas.\n\nAuditors are now working on phase two of the audit to address voter rolls in four heavily populated counties-Collin, Dallas, Harris, and Tarrant, which account for about 10 million people or a third of Texas' population.\n\nWatchdog groups and politicians think the new voter integrity laws will help Texas administer fair elections going into 2022. But that doesn't mean Texas should let its guard down, especially with the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nIn South Texas, Republicans hope to flip three Congressional seats and win back control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nRepublican candidates Mayra Flores, Monica De la Cruz, and Cassy Garcia are running for Texas Congressional Districts 34, 28, and 15, respectively, in heavily Hispanic districts that are traditionally blue.\n\nFlores won her seat temporarily during a special election in June, making her the first Republican to win the district in more than a century. Flores must defeat Democrat Congressman Vicente Gonzalez in November to keep the seat.\n\nBallot harvesting, while illegal, has been around for years in Texas.\n\nDuring the 2017 special session of the Texas Legislature, lawmakers were concerned enough with ballot harvesting to pass Senate Bill 5. The law tightened mail-in ballot rules and increased criminal penalties for ballot fraud during the 2018 election cycle.\n\nIn June, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced the successful prosecution of a vote-harvesting in Victoria County, in the Rio Grande Valley area.\n\nMonica Mendez of Port Lavaca pleaded guilty to 26 felony counts of voter fraud, including three counts of illegal voting, eight counts of election fraud, seven counts of assisting a voter to submit a ballot by mail, and eight counts of unlawful possession of a mail ballot.\n\nMendez ran a vote-harvesting operation on behalf of a subsidized housing corporation in order to influence the outcome of a utility board election.\n\nAfter Mendez entered a guilty plea on all 26 counts, District Judge Eli Garza sentenced Mendez to five years' deferred adjudication probation.\n\nIn South Texas, the practice of paying operatives called \"politiqueras\" to get out the vote has sometimes crossed the line into guaranteeing the vote through ballot harvesting.\n\nOrthal Brand Jr., who ran for mayor of McAllen, Texas, was promised hundreds of votes in 2021.\n\nA politiquera walked into his office and told Brand he could deliver hundreds of ballots already signed by voters but with the chosen candidate left unchecked. Brand didn't accept the man's offer, which was illegal.\n\nAs a resident of South Texas for more than 60 years, Brand, whose father before him was a longtime mayor, told The Epoch Times he believes election integrity laws will cut back on vote harvesting. But, he has no illusions that it will stop.\n\n\"It's not gone by any stretch of the imagination,\" Brand said. \"Politics and the culture here are just different than anywhere else in the state of Texas.\"\n\nHe remembers stories in the past of politiqueras giving voters strings with knots in them.\n\nVoters would line up the string on a ballot and vote for the candidate next to the knot. These operatives would get paid per vote delivered. Most of their harvesting is conducted at adult daycare centers. Mail-in ballots are the most significant area of fraud, Brand said.\n\n\"I never used politiqueras. Obviously, maybe that's why I lost,\" Brand said of his unsuccessful mayoral bid.\n\nUp-to-date voter rolls play a part in securing elections as well.\n\nOf the 11,737 potential non-citizen records found statewide during phase one of the Texas audit, 327 records were identified in Collin County, 1,385 in Dallas County, 3,063 in Harris County, and 708 in Tarrant County.\n\nAs of December 2021 audit release, Dallas County had canceled 1,193 of these records, and Tarrant County canceled one. Neither Collin nor Harris canceled any potential non-voting forms.\n\nPhase two of the forensic audit will determine the counties' efforts to correct the records.\n\nChristian Adams, president and general counsel of Public Interest Legal Foundation, told The Epoch Times inaccurate voter rolls are a nationwide problem.\n\nThe voting watchdog foundation filed a lawsuit in federal court against the election administrator in Starr County, Texas, in 2016 for failing to make a reasonable effort to maintain the county's voter rolls.\n\nFederal and Texas data suggested that from 2010 to 2014, the registration rate ranged from 100 to 110 percent-very much outside the norm for other Texas counties of similar size.\n\nStarr County agreed to a settlement in 2018 on a process to update and maintain voter rolls, according to the foundation.\n\nAdams also pointed to a 2020 Texas case against Ann Harris Bennett in her capacity as Harris County Voter Registrar. She allegedly processed voter applications when applicants marked no on the citizenship question.\n\nWhile the Texas audit showed areas of concern, the secretary of state's office said the issues weren't significant enough to affect the presidential election in 2020.\n\nOf the four counties being audited, former president Donald Trump won Collin County, with President Joe Biden taking Dallas and Harris counties. Tarrant County, traditionally a red county, flipped to Biden with a slim 1,826 vote margin.\n\nOverall, Trump carried Texas with 52.1 percent of the vote to Biden's 46.5 percent.\n\nSecretary of state John Scott portrayed the Texas audit in November as the country's \"most comprehensive forensic audit of the 2020 election.\"\n\nScott added that the audit would use analytical tools to examine the literal nuts and bolts of election administration to determine if any illegal activity may have occurred."

      "text": "Texas Republicans Unveil Plan to Secure Border\n\n\"This morning as we gather, there are approximately 300,000 young Texans in the sex-slave industry in our state. Because of this open-border policy, they are in a life that is just a living hell,\" Brady, a Texas Republican who's retiring at the end of the 117th Congress, told reporters.\n\n\"No state pays a deeper price for these open borders than our state. This is a security crisis, this is a humanitarian crisis, it's a sex-trafficking crisis, it is a fentanyl crisis. No delegation in Congress has more expertise or better solutions to address this border crisis than here in the Texas delegation.\"\n\nBrady was among 23 lawmakers from Texas who repeatedly stressed their view that President Joe Biden's opening of the U.S. border with Mexico has allowed record numbers of illegal immigrants to surge into the United States in only two years.\n\nIn the month of November alone, federal officials said that more than 73,000 \"gotaways\"-illegal immigrants who manage to evade law enforcement authorities-made it into the United States, the largest single-month total ever for the category.\n\n\"Children, little girls, little boys being sold into the sex trafficking trade. In what world is this somehow compassionate?\" Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said. \"It's not. This is destroying lives. It's destroying American lives. It's empowering cartels. It's empowering China.\"\n\nRoy was referring to the fact that much of the materials and chemicals needed by the Mexican drug cartels to produce fentanyl are obtained from China.\n\n\"While the president dismisses this as unimportant, we're all here to say it's critically important,\" he said.\n\n\"At least 98 people on the terrorist screening database were apprehended in 2022. Further, more than 24,000 lbs. of fentanyl have been seized since President Biden took office. Texans are in imminent danger, and Texas leadership is right to use all powers under their authority to defend Texas' border and its citizens.\"\n\nThe border crisis has cost Texas more than $3 billion since 2021, the plan estimates.\n\nThe second point is to update U.S. law to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security can send illegal border-crossers back to Mexico to await their judicial proceedings to decide whether they will be allowed to return to this country. The Texans also want Congress to withdraw federal funding from all nongovernmental organizations that they believe are encouraging illegal immigration.\n\nThe third point is to enforce all current immigration laws that the Biden administration has failed to enforce and to increase enforcement and penalties against criminal aliens and visa overstayers.\n\nThe fourth point of the plan is to declare as terrorist organizations the Mexican drug cartels that are importing record amounts of illegal drugs into the United States across the southern border, including fentanyl, which has killed an estimated 100,000 Americans since 2021.\n\nMany of the Texans were especially critical of Biden for his remark earlier this week that he \"has more important things\" to do than visit the southern border.\n\n\"Today, we've got 300 people dying every day by fentanyl and the president doesn't care,\" Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas) told reporters. \"Every time you see the president, you should say 'Mr. President, what about the 300 Americans that are dying every day?'\"\n\nSimilarly, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) noted that \"as migrants and fentanyl continue to pour over our southern border, the Biden administration sits idly by and refuses to even acknowledge this devastating crisis.\"\n\nIn Texas, \"the hospitals are overrun, and the schools are overrun. Our law enforcement is overrun,\" Arrington said. \"And they're getting no help from their federal government, which is responsible for border security and the defense of our citizens.\"\n\nHe added that \"no one understands or appreciates the widespread social and economic costs of Biden's unprecedented open-border crisis like the people of Texas. It only makes sense for the Texas delegation to lead the way in using every tool and authority to secure the border, defend our sovereignty, and protect our citizens-and all Americans-from this epic disaster.\""

Given the dominance of Republicans in Texas politics, this is as good as the general election. Turns out it's a hell of a family fight between the lieutenant governor, David Dewhurst, and the grassroots fave, former state solicitor general Ted Cruz. The NYT reports:\n\n\"Ted taps into the energy on the right,\" said Matt Mackowiak , a Republican political consultant and former Hutchison spokesman who supports Mr. Cruz. \"It's a similar dynamic to what you've seen in some of these other states, where an established statewide elected official is somewhat conservative but not boldly conservative.

For Mr. Perry, the outburst the day before was a stunning moment, unlike anything he had faced in office - a Republican governor of a solidly Republican state being booed at a Republican convention for declaring his support for an influential Republican lieutenant governor.\n\n\"It shows that Perry is out of touch with the grass roots,\" said Konni Burton of Colleyville, a Cruz supporter who is the vice president of the Northeast Tarrant Tea Party in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. \"You get in a bubble, and I think that's where they are right now frankly.\"\n\nJust so you understand: Rick Perry, who patrolled the farthest borders of the right-wing ranch among the GOP presidential candidates, got booed for supporting the Republican lieutenant governor, considered too wussy and too liberal by many Texas Republicans.

One declared that Mr. Labay was tired of softhearted Republicans, though he used a more colorful adjective. The other read, \"We Need More Republicans Like Ted Cruz.\"\n\nMr. Labay, 55, made his signs by sticking 1,200 plastic foam cups, one by one, into the loops of his chain-link fence, a 90-minute project that filled much of the fencing around BL Oilfield Services in the town of El Campo.\n\n\"I was proud of him,\" Mr. Labay said of the state's junior senator. \"I was proud he was a Texan.

      "text": "A new poll from Quinnipiac Polling Group indicates that incumbent Governor Greg Abbott is well on his way to victory in the 2022 midterm elections. The survey of 1,224 registered voters found Abbott has opened a 53 percent to 37 percent lead, a whopping 15 point margin in the early going.\n\nBeto's poor early numbers suggest the \"purple Texas\" narrative is under threat of collapse. The Biden border catastrophe, Beto's insufferable Austin tech-bro liberalism, and collapsing support among Hispanic voters threaten humiliation for Texas Democrats.\n\nThe Democratic weakness in Texas may come as a surprise to Republicans who watched with horror as Beto threatened to lead a successful progressive insurgency to the Senate in 2018. Beto's campaign was a grassroots masterclass, turning out every possible Democrat vote in the state.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz would survive Beto's challenge with a 2.6 percent margin of victory, but the Democratic success emboldened national Democrats and brought \"purple Texas\" rhetoric to a fever pitch. By 2020, DNC confidence led Vice-President Biden to spend some of the crucial final days of his campaign rallying support across North and West Texas .\n\nThen, it all fell apart. Republicans overperformed optimistic polling across the state by sweeping every statewide election, retaining the legislature, and carving out significant gains with South Texas' traditionally Democratic Hispanic electorate.\n\nPresident Trump won Texas's 38 electoral votes by a margin of 5.58 percent, underperforming other prominent Texas Republicans like Senator John Cornyn, who turned in higher margins. While the turnout improved over recent presidential elections for Democrats, it was still a bitter pill after the Beto-induced media hype and record-setting cash investments from the DNC.\n\nNow, with the election well in the rear-view mirror, it's worth asking: What gave?\n\nFor starters, the Democratic standard-bearer Beto O' Rourke lost his political mind. After running a largely centrist race for Texas Senate, he entered the 2020 Democratic presidential primary and marched quickly to the left.\n\nBeto threatened churches' tax-exempt status if they didn't endorse same-sex marriage and told voters, \"hell yeah, I'm going to take your AR-15\" . He followed up by supporting a climate plan designed to destroy the oil and gas industry and called for an open borders immigration approach .\n\nTexan voters were rattled by his flip-flops and the extent of his previously hidden radicalism. His approval ratings in Texas cratered just before his presidential campaign did the same.\n\nWhen the smoke cleared from his campaign's crash and burn, Texas Republicans emerged with evidence that centrist appeals from Democrats were lies and that the liberal insurgency was shrouding a deeply unpopular national agenda out of step with the concerns of Texans.\n\nBeto's gift to conservatives compounded the threat of lockdowns, the rise of anti-police street violence, and the national Democratic embrace of lawlessness at the border. By 2020's election day, the DNC's 2018 momentum was squandered.\n\nAhead of 2022, it's unlikely Democrats will be able to regroup in Texas. Recent polling from the Wall Street Journal indicates that realignment trends with Hispanic voters are only intensifying, and national developments show that Democratic inroads with suburban voters were a temporary reaction to President Trump.\n\nIf the trends hold, Republicans will have regained the suburban constituencies they relied on to go undefeated in statewide elections for two decades and broken the Democrats' century-long stronghold with South Texas Hispanics.\n\nThese electoral trends represent a dual disaster for the DNC, one that could solidify Texas as a multi-ethnic Republican fortress and serve as an example for states like Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Georgia.\n\nDemocrats, fearful of this fast-approaching reality, are backing Beto trying to recapture 2018 magic. Unfortunately for the DNC, the margin of Beto's defeat will only serve as a benchmark by which Republicans can measure their renewed success.\n\nCollin Pruett is a contributing editor for The American Conservative .\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania briefly declared but backed out Monday evening.\n\nIf Emmer manages to secure the nomination, which is scheduled for Tuesday morning, the morning after a candidate forum for the conference Monday night, he will be the third Republican to receive the nod since McCarthy's ousting.\n\nMajority Leader Steve Scalise was the first to secure the GOP nomination for speaker, but his bid floundered amidst a conservative opposition that was calling for a change in the status quo and was concerned by setting a precedent that a motion to vacate could be used to elevate climbers in leadership. It completely fell apart when Scalise failed to place pressure on conservatives by bringing the fight to the House floor.\n\nRepresentative Jim Jordan of Ohio was the next to get the nod from the GOP conference. Unlike Scalise, he was willing to go to the floor. Jordan, like McCarthy in January, had twenty detractors, but while McCarthy's came from the right, Jordan's were scattered amongst the House Appropriations Committee, foreign policy hawks, and liberal Republicans. But Jordan made a costly error in tactics by taking the fight off the floor and into a conference meeting all of Thursday. At that point, the House had only voted twice on Jordan's bid. In the House Republican conference meeting, members considered a resolution that would have expanded Speaker Pro Tem Patrick Mchenry's powers to conduct House business and vote on a new permanent speaker in January. But the meeting made clear that the proposed resolution was not going anywhere.\n\nAnd Jordan, who initially spoke favorably about the resolution according to TAC sources, suffered for seeming to waver about his own candidacy. When Republicans returned to the House floor to vote on Jordan's bid a third time, he received 194 votes due to five additional objectors. Shortly thereafter, the Ohio Congressman abandoned his bid for Speaker of the House.\n\nBut it's far from a guarantee that Emmer will receive the GOP's nomination, much less the speakership. There are some candidates among the spoilers that might have a hard time getting to 217 on the floor, but could perform very well in the GOP conference vote.\n\nJohnson joined the race to become the next Speaker of the House on Saturday and could be a viable candidate not only in the conference meeting Monday night but also when it comes time to vote on the floor. \"It is incumbent upon us now to decide upon a consensus candidate who can serve as a trusted caretaker and a good steward of the gavel,\" the Louisiana Congressman wrote in a letter to his GOP colleagues.\n\n\"We all agree the urgency this hour demands a specific plan and bold, decisive action,\" Johnson added. Not only is Johnson the conference vice chair but he previously chaired the Republican Study Committee, the largest group among House Republicans. With a strong, conservative voting record that simultaneously can play to the various factions in the conference and a reputation for making few enemies, Johnson might receive the nomination if it becomes clear that Emmer's candidacy wouldn't survive the House floor. And he could always wait in the wings and strike if Emmer's candidacy struggles.\n\nDonalds could be another candidate that spoils Emmer's bid in the conference. The Florida Congressman announced his bid Friday night. \"My sole focus will be securing our border, funding our government responsibly, advancing a conservative vision for the House of Representatives and the American People, and expanding our Republican majority,\" Donalds said in a statement. \"Under my leadership, the House will lead the charge to advance a simple objective: put the American people first, keep them safe, and make their lives easier,\" Donalds later added.\n\nDonalds was deeply involved in the Speaker's fight in January and became the twenty McCarthy objector's nominee for the bulk of the 15 rounds of voting. Though Donalds was a part of the twenty, he was not viewed with the same disdain as the rest of the twenty at the time, and has since made inroads with the rest of the conference by working closely with leadership and other power players in the conference. Prior to the continuing resolution that ended up passing, Donalds worked with other prominent House Republicans to draft a continuing resolution that many members of the conference liked, but met opposition from Gaetz and a few other conservatives.\n\nFurthermore, any ill will that conference members may have had towards Donalds because of his involvement in January has for the most part been concentrated towards the members that voted for McCarthy's removal earlier this month. The members that have endorsed Donalds up until this point are a testament to this fact. Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida , who vociferously backed McCarthy in January, has thrown her weight behind Donalds. As has Rep. Carlos Gimenez of Florida, a Jordan objector who continued to vote for McCarthy. Rep. Mike Waltz, another Floridian, has also endorsed Donalds.\n\nThere is another interesting dynamic at play for the current crop of candidates hoping the third time's the charm, too. As the home state of Donald's endorsements makes obvious, there is a state and regional element to the considerations of House GOP members-something blatantly obvious and integral to our constitutional order but is often neglected or forgotten in the bean-counting politics of modern day Washington.\n\nSome of the current candidates are from states with sizable delegations in the House GOP. Such is the case with Rep. Sessions of Texas, the state with the largest delegation in the House GOP conference. Previously, when Scalise considered making a bid for speaker, one of the Majority Leader's first moves was meeting with Texas Republicans and asking for their support. Furthermore, Sessions, a long-time member of Congress who briefly was voted out in 2018, but regained his seat in 2020, also formerly ran the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC). There's also Bergman's bid, which comes with the expressed support of the House GOP's Michigan delegation, though its numbers are far fewer than the Texas delegation.\n\nSources on Capitol Hill tell TAC that Emmer is probably the least conservative among the candidates that have a realistic shot at becoming the next Speaker of the House. Sadly, sources suggest that might make him the best positioned to win.\n\nThere are serious concerns with Emmer's recent voting record. Emmer voted in favor of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, McCarthy's unpopular debt-ceiling deal with Democrats, September's continuing resolution, Ukraine aid, and the Respect for Marriage Act, which codified the government's recognition of gay marriage.\n\nAs TAC previously reported, support for Ukraine could be a problem for Emmer as he goes for the gavel. \"Ukraine has become a very big issue in the party. Republicans are heavily moving towards not funding them anymore. But it's important to note that it's because of increasing pressure from the American people. The people are tired of it. Republicans in favor of Ukraine funding are looked at very unfavorably by their constituents,\" the aforementioned staffer told TAC.\n\nOthers, however, are not so sure Emmer could survive on the floor because he'll run into the same problem that McCarthy ran into in January: a bloc of conservatives that will not vote for him in any circumstances.\n\n\"If House Republicans elect Tom Emmer Speaker, we will have learned nothing from the past 7 years,\" one GOP member told TAC.\n\nBradley Devlin is the former political editor for The American Conservative .

      "text": "It's difficult to see how these profound antipathies and fears will dissipate soon through any normal political processes.\n\nWhen House Republicans dislodged Kevin McCarthy from the speakership last October and then struggled for three weeks to select a replacement, it struck many as entirely aberrational. Without a permanent speaker, the House couldn't take up legislation, and Congress essentially stalled out like a rickety old truck. That wasn't how Congress was supposed to work.\n\nYet in the decade leading to the Civil War, the House experienced three such stall-out crises: one, in December 1849, lasting three weeks; the others in 1855 and 1959, each lasting fully two months. The recurrent difficulty in electing a speaker signaled that the nation was hopelessly split over whether slavery would be allowed in the new southwestern territories acquired through James Polk's war with Mexico.\n\n\"This is a fearful state of things, and may be the beginning of sorrows for our happy country,\" lamented the St. Louis Democrat in December 1849. Indeed, American politics throughout the next ten years yielded multiple episodes of governmental dysfunction, waves of civic animosity, bursts of violence, and finally disunion and war.\n\nThat poses a question: With America fraught with greater political tension and venomous discourse than the country has seen since the Civil War era, could we be heading into a new time of domestic bloodshed?\n\nMany have suggested as much. Richard Haass, former president of the Council of Foreign Relations, views the situation as \"truly dangerous\" and says he wouldn't rule out \"widespread political violence or even dissolution.\" Robert Kuttner, the liberal writer and Brandeis professor, declares that judicial overreach by conservatives feels like \"the run-up to a civil war.\" A conservative commentator named Vance Byers, writing in The American Mind , suggests that the unruly political forces of this campaign year \"could plausibly lead to violence.\" The only questions, he adds, are \"the scale of the violence and whether the American union will ultimately survive it.\"\n\nSuch warnings reflect a growing perception that today's civic discord echoes the enmity that swirled through the country in the 1850s. A gnawing question for anyone pondering the parallels between then and now is whether that long-ago conflict could have been prevented. Perhaps it could have, but a close study of those years suggests that the sectional conflict became, at some point, inevitable.\n\nWhy? In part because the slavery issue at the heart of the conflict became widely viewed by northerners as an issue of the highest moral significance. History suggests that political adjudication becomes extremely difficult, sometimes even impossible, when the central issues of the day are viewed in moral terms.\n\nBefore Polk's expansionism, for example, the slavery question in America, though troublesome, seemed to merely simmer over the flames of politics. It was widely assumed that the odious institution would eventually fade away on its own. Notably, Henry Clay's great Missouri Compromise of 1820 sought to pacify the anxieties generated by the issue primarily by maintaining a balance of political power between slave and free states. Implicit in the outcome was that there was no need for any northern agitation against the institution; it merely needed to be managed as it dwindled away.\n\nBut Polk's territorial acquisitions generated a powerful new sense of moral urgency throughout the North. Intellectuals and politicians now invoked the sanctity of a \"higher law\" that transcended man's law, including the Constitution, whose Framers had accepted slavery as a legacy institution of the South in order to get the document ratified. The eloquently antislavery novelist Harriet Beecher Stowe reflected the views of many when she excoriated Sen. Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois for having \"moved over to the side of evil\" when he \"scoffed at the idea that there was a law of God higher than any law or constitution of the United States.\"\n\nDouglas's outlook of \"popular sovereignty\" (let territorial voters decide) certainly reflected his moral obtuseness on slavery, but it also represented an effort to find a middle ground. For Stowe and other like-minded people of the North, there could be no middle ground.\n\nRelated to the moral dimension was a sense that the slavery issue had become \"definitional,\" meaning the country's very essence was defined by its policy on slavery. Northerners increasingly embraced the conviction that living in a country that permitted slavery simply wasn't acceptable. This conviction took on added force with a provision in Clay's later compromise, in 1850, that bolstered the injunction that northerners must help capture and return fugitive slaves, thus implicating antislavery northerners in a system they considered morally repugnant. This became untenable in the North, especially when southern slaveholders declared a constitutional right to take their slaves at will into the new lands.\n\nThen Chief Justice Roger Taney issued the Supreme Court's infamous Dred Scott decision upholding the right of slave transport into the territories and declaring that American blacks, free or enslaved, had no right of U.S. citizenship. The issue's moral dimension immediately became paramount as more and more northerners viewed slavery extension as tantamount to slavery entrenchment.\n\nThe South, meanwhile, reacted to the growing northern handwringing by insisting that slavery posed no moral questions at all. Southern intellectuals produced elaborate arguments extolling slavery as a generator of progress and civilization. Employing ballot-box manipulations and raw violence, southerners sought to dominate the new Kansas territory as a bulwark of bondage for further expansion and concocted heady plans for acquiring Cuba and Central America as additional slave territories.\n\nFurther, the South grappled with undulating waves of fear-fear of violent slave revolts spurred by northern antislavery agitations; of financial ruin without their chattel labor force; and more generally of the growing power of the North in population, wealth, and political might. That led to the widespread southern feeling that the only means of preserving the southern way of life was secession.\n\nSecession isn't a word heard in today's political discourse. And yet an extensive poll of 35,307 Americans conducted earlier this year by YouGov, a UK-based market research firm, revealed that some 23 percent of the U.S. population would actually favor the secession of their state from the union. For Texas Republicans, the figure was 44 percent. These are remarkable findings, suggesting rumblings of pessimism and anxiety reminiscent of the 1850s.\n\nCertainly no issue in America today carries the kind of profound moral weight that animated the American North on the slavery issue in the 1850s. But more and more Americans these days view politics as hinging upon moral questions and fundamental disputes over the country's national identity. Further, questions involving the fate of the republic and of various American subgroups are generating intensifying civic fears.\n\nThe fault line roiling the nation today is a political struggle between the nation's knowledge-sector elites centered along the coasts and in the large interior cities and university towns vs. what can generally be defined as heartland America, essentially the Trump constituency.\n\nThe elites embrace an ethos of globalism, which leads to open borders, free trade, anti-nationalism, cultural liberalism, and a foreign policy driven by humanitarian fervor. Since around the 1970s, this rising privileged class has proved extremely adept at gaining dominance over many major American institutions, including the Democratic Party, prestigious universities, influential think tanks and NGOs, popular culture, big finance, big tech, big corporations, and most of big media. As the late conservative polemicist Samuel Francis observed, throughout the postwar years (including the Reagan years), the right fought over ideas while the left fought for power.\n\nAnalyzing this power consolidation, Ron Brownstein of Atlantic Media conjured up what he called the \"coalition of the ascendant,\" including racial minorities, immigrants, millennials, and highly educated whites. And one more: \"just enough blue-collar Midwestern whites to put the president over the top.\"\n\nOver the years this ascendant coalition has manifested a strongly moralistic bent. Its leaders are universalists, meaning they see themselves as guided by hallowed principles of humanity that transcend petty nationalism and other parochial concerns. They view their opponents as hidebound racists and xenophobes. Once the morality-based issue of gay marriage was settled in their favor, they promptly moved on to the next morality-based crusade of transgender rights. It appeared back in 2016 that Brownstein's coalition would consolidate power firmly under the banner of Hillary Clinton.\n\nThen along came Donald Trump, almost alone among major politicians of either party in perceiving the powerful new fault line that had emerged in American politics. He spoke for the heartland folks that historian and Wall Street Journal columnist Walter Russell Mead has described as \"Jacksonians,\" meaning they reject the elite concept of America as dedicated to the fulfillment of a universal mission of global betterment. Rather they see America's governmental role as fulfilling \"the country's destiny by looking after the physical security and economic well-being of the American people in their national home.\" These people feel besieged by the power and programs of their own national elite.\n\nAnd so they embraced and still embrace Trump's truculent and often boorish attacks on Brownstein's coalition, particularly on the border issue, trade, anti-nationalism, and humanitarian warmaking.\n\nWith the two parties so far apart in values and residing on a knife's edge of near political parity (another parallel with the 1850s), small shifts in voting patterns can spawn large directional shifts for the country. This is particularly true given that, with America mired in political gridlock, presidents govern less by influencing Congress and more through executive action. As Thomas Edsall of the New York Times writes, this mix of political realities \"makes every election a high-stakes election.\"\n\nHigh-stakes elections breed emotion and anxiety, which in turn drive the factions further apart and toward \"gut level hatred and mistrust,\" as Jonathan Weiler of the University of North Carolina puts it. He notes that specific issues seem to matter less these days than \"the intensity with which partisans are likely to feel that [their opponents] threaten them existentially.\"\n\nThus do we see the inexorably widening gulf within the nation. Knowledge-sector elites view Trump and his constituency as a mortal threat to democracy, as people who \"do not respect the Constitution ... do not believe in the rule of law ... [and] do not recognize the will of the people,\" as President Biden put it in his 2022 speech at Philadelphia's Independence Hall. If granted power, in this view, the Trump contingent will destroy the republic, as Caesar did the Roman republic.\n\nThe heartland Americans, in return, consider the country's elites to be \"unhinged,\" to quote professor-emeritus Arlie Hochschild of the University of California, Berkeley, who conducted a sociological study of political and cultural attitudes of eastern Kentucky residents. \"Regarding threats felt by the right,\" she says, \"I'd say all of them-especially trans issues-evoke a sense that this is the last straw.\" The Kentuckians, she adds, see the increasingly powerful and moralistic elite as \"talking to itself in front of [them] while trying to put [them] under its cultural rule.\"\n\nIt's difficult to see how these profound antipathies and fears will dissipate soon through any normal political processes. More likely they will spread and harden, steadily diminishing prospects for compromise. When Abraham Lincoln ran for president in 1860, he sought to mollify southern hostility with numerous substantial concessions, including a recognition that the Constitution sanctioned slavery where it already existed; that fugitive slave laws, however distasteful, were also constitutionally mandated; and that slavery prohibition in the District of Columbia required approval by residents there. He even disavowed the idea of placing blacks on an equal social footing with whites.\n\nNone of it worked. Southerners couldn't get beyond his insistence that slavery was a moral wrong and must be placed upon a path of eventual extinction. Lincoln refused to yield \"one iota\" on that point, for it was here that his moral sensibility intersected with his practical politics. As he wrote to a friend, \"The tug has to come, and better now than at any time hereafter.\"\n\nThe tug led to secession and war. Can that happen again in America? We like to think not. After all, the Framers fashioned an elaborately balanced political system that has proved remarkably resilient over nearly two and a half centuries. But that system did break down once following a decade of discord that ultimately proved irreconcilable. Perhaps today's America hasn't reached any such point of irreconciliation. But the history of the 1850s suggests that today's America is headed in that direction.\n\nThis article appears in the July/August 2024 issue\n\nRobert W.

      "text": "Emerson Collective (EC) may not have the name recognition of a Tides or an Open Society Foundation, but this Silicon Valley-based \"social change organization\" is just as ambitious, and nearly as important in the world of left-wing philanthropy. It's the brainchild of Lauren Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs-and it seems the tech titans have put their own spin on giving.\n\nEC is structured not as a foundation but as a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC), making it a for-profit philanthropy. Powell Jobs has previously said she structured EC as an LLC for more flexibility. This is highly unusual for philanthropic organizations, but the same choice was made by Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, in establishing the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, LLC.\n\nBrian Crowley is a Certified Public Accountant and owner of Crowley Accounting and Consulting Services. He said the difference between an LLC and a traditional nonprofit is two-fold: \"ownership and taxation. Nonprofits have no owners and are not taxed. LLCs have owners and are taxed. Obviously, LLCs are profit motivated, and nonprofits are philanthropically inclined.\"\n\nWhile traditional philanthropies structured as nonprofits release their tax returns, called 990s, which list each of their grants, Emerson Collective does not because an LLC is not required to disclose their financial documents. Like many left-leaning philanthropic groups, EC's social change efforts rely heavily on \"impact investing,\" which is essentially venture capital with a political bent.\n\nEC invests resources in eight priority areas: immigration, social justice, health care, Chicago violence, education, media, a \"super school\" project, and elemental (\"radical remedies of the commons designed to address nature's tragedies of the commons\"). The causes include standard liberal pet projects like climate change and support for immigrants (legal and otherwise), but also general good works like cancer research.\n\nThese good works do sometimes overlap with the political. One such project is Chicago CRED, which seeks to combat inner-city Chicago violence. CRED is run by Arne Duncan, the former Secretary of Education under President Obama, who recently made a presentation on CRED's progress at the City Club of Chicago.\n\nWhile rejecting calls to defund the police altogether, Duncan did call for reducing police in Chicago and reallocating those resources. He said Chicago has twice as many police per capita as Los Angeles but three times as much crime, and as many cops per capita as New York but twice as much crime.\n\nDuncan said Chicago police use too many resources fighting mental illness and other issues not well suited for police intervention, and not enough time solving violent crime. Duncan also noted that 80% of Chicago crime occurs in fifteen of Chicago's seventy-seven neighborhoods. These neighborhoods, including Lawndale, Roselawn, Englewood, Auburn Gresham, and Chatham, are all on Chicago's South and West side.\n\nCRED recruits former gang members and criminals who have turned their lives around to mentor those who are trying to do the same. It works. Malik Tiger, who appeared at the event as well, was on his way to being a statistic after his most recent gun charge in 2014. Instead, he entered the program, has committed no new crimes, and works full time at the Greater Chicago Food Depository. Malik also said his father went to jail when he was young, so drug dealers became his role models. Malik recently had a child himself, who he is taking care of.\n\nAt the bottom of one page of EC's website is something like a disclaimer: \"Although Chicago CRED, Elemental Excelerator, and XQ Institute are related to Emerson Collective, they are separate entities.\" I sent a list of questions to EC, including a further explanation on this, but received no response; I also reached out to Chicago CRED but they also did not respond.\n\nOther EC projects are less impressive, and seemingly less substantial. For instance, the LLC has partnered with NowThis, a media company which focuses on slick 5-10 minute news videos which are primarily marketed through social media. With Now This, Emerson Collective has produced a series of videos on climate change, a couple of which appeal directly to farmers.\n\nThey talk about regenerative farming, disappearing coast lines, hydropower, and more. One video also backs the Green New Deal. The videos range from 10,000 to several hundred thousand views on occasion, and sometimes to a million and more. Calling agreement on climate change \"overwhelming,\" they aren't much different from standard videos produced by other climate change interests.\n\nOne video features Ray Mabus, the former Navy Secretary under President Obama, who calls climate change a national security threat. \"This president,\" Mabus says of Trump, \"not only is not taking climate change seriously, they're saying it doesn't exist.\"\n\nEC and NowThis also partnered for a series of videos on voting. The videos either targeted traditional Democrat constituencies like women, minorities, and millennials, or they accused Republicans of voter suppression. One video is entitled \"How Texas Republicans are trying to stop people from voting.\"\n\n\"Texas Republicans have been waging a war on voting rights for many years now but it's really heated up in 2020,\" said Marc Elias, founder of Democracy Docket in the video , \"Texas is one of a handful of states that didn't make voting easier during the pandemic, in general, and specifically did nothing to make it easier to vote by mail.\" Another video claimed Hispanic votes were being suppressed in Florida.\n\nThere are also videos on immigration promoting narratives from asylum seekers, immigrant families, and migrants in the country illegally. All of it seems like a rather modest effort, especially when you consider the extent of the Jobs family's resources and the ends they've been put to in the past.\n\nMaybe that's why Powell Jobs has recently stepped up the Emerson Collective's activity in the media sphere. In January 2020, EC invested in a production company, Concordia Studio, with some industry heavyweights. Here is more from Deadline:\n\nOscar-winning director of An Inconvenient Truth Davis Guggenheim and former Participant exec Jonathan King have teamed with Laurene Powell Jobs and Emerson Collective to launch Concordia Studio. The new company will focus on creating innovative nonfiction and scripted films, series, and streaming content.\n\nBy the following month, Concordia had four films entered at Sundance: A Thousand Cuts ; Time ; Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets ; and Boys State .\n\nTime is a movie about Fox Rich, a successful entrepreneur who in the 1990s committed an armed robbery of a bank-she said out of desperation-with her husband. She received three years in prison while he remains in prison on sixty year sentence; the movie tracks Rich as she tries to get her husband out of jail. Its dealings with race and incarceration are especially relevant to the progressive causes of the day, which Emerson Collective was established to support.\n\nA Thousand Cuts , meanwhile, moves into international politics, tracking the battle between Philippine journalist Maria Ressa and Phillipine leader Rodrigo Duterte. Duterte has waged a bloody war against drugs, killing tens of thousands and Ressa has been perhaps his chief critic, especially through her news website Rappler.\n\nShe has also been arrested multiple times, convicted of a seven-year-old crime, and faces six years in jail. Ressa has become a cause célèbre for global press freedom.\n\nThe narrative of the movie is that Duterte presents like a populist even as he engages in cut throat tactics like disinformation, threats, arrest, and indiscriminate killings. \"We are witnessing a death by a thousand cuts to democracy in the Philippines,\" Ressa says in the movie, the line which gives its title.\n\nThe movie is also noteworthy for its remarkable access. Not only was Ressa interviewed, but several other Rappler staff and her family. The filmmaker also sat for several interviews with Mocha, Duterte's chief media ally and Ronald De La Rosa, a former police chief turned senator.\n\nBut even this impressive foray into the documentary realm is hardly the entirety of Emerson Collective's media activity. Since 2017, the little-known Silicon Valley LLC has been the majority owner of The Atlantic -one of the nation's leading political magazines-and intends to move toward full ownership in the near future.\n\nThe move quickly made waves. Here is more from VOX:\n\nLaurene Powell Jobs, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur and philanthropist, is acquiring a majority stake in the Atlantic magazine.\n\nJobs, in a statement, called the Atlantic \"one of the country's most important and enduring journalistic institutions,\" and cited the links between her organization, the Emerson Collective , and the Atlantic's founder, Ralph Waldo Emerson, who \"created a magazine whose mission was to bring about equality for all people.\"\n\nBy the end of 2019, the longtime CEO was out and Politico was reporting that Laurene Powell Jobs was wrestling even more control :\n\nBillionaire philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs will assume greater control of the legendary Atlantic magazine as it seeks a new president/CEO and longtime Atlantic Media chairman David Bradley prepares to step away from management duties, Atlantic officials told POLITICO.\n\nThe move signals a changing of the guard in Washington media circles as Powell Jobs, the California-based widow of Apple founder Steve Jobs, asserts herself in the world of D.C. journalism, and Bradley, one of the city's best-known hosts and connectors of power, steps away from day-to-day control of the magazine he has shaped for decades.\n\nThat changing of the guard, though, is hardly limited to Laurene Powell Jobs-four years earlier, tech titan Jeff Bezos had already purchased The Washington Post from D.C.'s old-guard Graham family. That Emerson Collective, LLC now owns one of America's oldest and most respected publications is simply indicative of the rise of a new elite-and given EC's broad, ambitious goals, it may be suggestive of much more change to come.\n\nMichael Volpe has worked as a freelance journalist since 2009, after spending more than a decade in finance.

      "text": "I wish I had asked Viktor Orban last evening what he thought of Gov. Ron DeSantis. Why? Because DeSantis seems to be putting into practice some of the political lessons Orban has to teach the American Right. Yesterday Orban said that effective conservative governance has to recognize how power actually works today -- meaning, as I took him, that conservatives in political power have to recognize that the Left's hegemony over private-sector institutions, and some public ones (like state universities and public education), is an immense source of power that the Right doesn't really contest. Orban didn't speculate as to why the Right doesn't, but I will: we conservatives are still operating on an outdated classical-liberal model of governance, in which the private sector, as well as parts of the public sector (education), should be left alone. That's certainly defensible, and even admirable, if those institutions are led by good-faith liberals who believe in fairness, freedom of expression, and so forth.\n\nBut what happens when the old-school liberals have been replaced by woke Jacobins? The David French Republican way of looking at the world is outdated, and is guaranteed to deliver defeat after defeat -- including when conservatives are in power. As Orban said last night, you have to make up your mind that you don't care if the Left hates you, that you have a responsibility to your voters -- and then take the fight to them at the institutional level, either by fighting over who runs the institutions, or by creating countercultural institutions. What you cannot do is simply sit back and whine about how unfair they are, or keep hoping that if you continue to point out how they have abandoned old-fashioned liberalism, they will turn back. They won't. They really and truly hate us and what we stand for, and nothing is going to change that.\n\nThink about what's happening to poor Jack Philips, the Colorado baker. He was taken to court yet again, and lost yet again yesterday.\n\nColorado court rules AGAINST Masterpiece Cake Shop over gender transition cake https://t.co/zl3C914orQ pic.twitter.com/yV0J6xDAjr\n\n- ✟ Right Scoop ✟ (@trscoop) January 26, 2023\n\nThe Left -- specifically, LGBT activists -- torment this poor man. They will not be satisfied until he is crushed and bankrupted. There are, apparently, no other bakeries in Colorado. Now, you can say that Philips is the victim of an activist class that does not represent all on the Left. Even if that were true, so what? Who on the Left is speaking out in defense of Jack Philips? Even if they find the persecution of Philips by the woke brigades distasteful, they reason that it's a small price to pay to achieve JusticeTM. And anyway, he's a white Evangelical Christian, so the privileged SOB had it coming (they think).\n\nThe institutional Left believes it has the sovereign right to lay down the law and establish uncontested practices in the fields where it dominates, such as education. This explains the left-wing freakout over Gov. Ron DeSantis canceling the Advance Placement African American History class in Florida, not because he opposed teaching black history, but because he is not a fool: that is, he understands that ideologues who designed the course are jamming queer theory into the teaching of black history, via their theory of intersectionality, and as the elected chief executive officer of the State of Florida, he's not having it. He said in a press conference:\n\nOn Monday, DeSantis addressed the denial during a press conference in Jacksonville stating the state has an \"education, not indoctrination\" guideline all curriculums must follow.\n\n\"In the state of Florida, our education standards not only don't prevent but they require teaching Black history, all the important things, that's part of our core curriculum,\" DeSantis said.\n\n\"This was a separate course on top of that for Advanced Placement credit. And the issue is we have guidelines and standards in Florida. We want education, not indoctrination. If you fall on the side of indoctrination, we're going to decline, if it's education, then we will do. So when I heard it didn't meet the standards, I figured, yeah, they may be doing way more than that. This course on Black history, what's one of the lessons about? Queer theory,\" he said.\n\n\"Now, who would say that an important part of Black history is queer theory? That is somebody pushing an agenda on our kids. And so when you look to see they have stuff about intersectionality, abolishing prisons, that's a political agenda. And so, that's the wrong side of the line for Florida standards. We believe in teaching kids facts and how to think, but we don't believe they should have an agenda imposed on them. When you try to use Black history to shoehorn in queer theory, you are clearly trying to use that for political purposes,\" he added.\n\nThis is exactly right. The institutions (e.g., the College Board) that used to be trustworthy have now been compromised by ideologues. They will never, ever stop on their own; they must be stopped. I know Ron DeSantis isn't the only GOP governor in the US who has a GOP state legislature behind him. These people who run the institutions believe that it is their metaphysical right to do so without challenge. As political scientist Eric Kauffman said last year, if conservatives aren't willing to fight the culture war now, there won't be any conservatives left to fight anything in the future.\n\nThese leftie lunatics on MSNBC and in the activist core are accusing DeSantis of trying to \"exterminate black history.\" Nope. He just wants black history taught as black history, not used as a vehicle to deliver a broad woke worldview masquerading as history. Really now, who would say that an important part of black history is queer theory? Maybe the crackpot Jennifer Rubin at the Washington Post , who says DeSantis \"has gone full blown white supremacist\".\n\nThis is the kind of thing, and the kind of people, that anyone who challenges wokeness has to deal with. The normie conservatives live in the world of yesterday, when the Left was still dominated by old-fashioned liberals. Ron DeSantis and Viktor Orban live in the world as it is, and act accordingly.\n\nUPDATE: Daniel Kalder, writing in UnHerd from Texas:\n\nIn fact, as recent reporting from John Sailer of the National Association of Scholars shows, the ideological monoculture in Texas universities has only grown more entrenched since the last time the legislature gathered in Austin. Mandatory \"diversity statements\" are commonplace, even if all you want to do is teach the flute . Instruction in the catechisms of intersectionality is similarly widespread, while acolytes of Ibram X. Kendi and Robin DiAngelo lead the faithful in the study of their scriptures; the School of Information at UT Austin has called for mandatory training in \"anti-racist pedagogy \".\n\nAll of this, meanwhile, has happened under the nose of boards whose every member was appointed by governor Greg Abbott . Texas Republicans, it seems, are remarkably laissez faire when it comes to what the taxpayer is funding in public universities. If they are not swayed by eloquent arguments from liberals such as Jonathan Haidt, who has stressed the importance of intellectual and political diversity to the health of the academy, you might think that the desire to perpetuate their own species would cause them to pay more attention.\n\nKalder says DeSantis is taking Texas Republicans to school on how to fight the culture war we actually have. More:\n\nBut when it comes to the culture war Texas Republicans seem stuck in the '90s, focused on God, guns, abortion and free markets. DeSantis, however, is a 21st century man who appears to genuinely despise the ideas he rails against, and that gives him the edge.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "Texas Republican who tried to impeach Ken Paxton now trying to criminalize political memes\n\nIt is unclear whether the memes now mocking state Rep. Dade Phelan could land their creators in jail if the nominal Republican gets his way.\n\nTexas state Rep. Dade Phelan (R), the at-times incomprehensible former state House speaker who led the unsuccessful impeachment effort against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, is pushing a bill that would criminalize the publication, distribution, or broadcast of certain political memes or altered media.\n\nCritics have suggested that Phelan's House Bill 366 is unconstitutional, stressing that it would run afoul of the First Amendment.\n\nPhelan's bill would require \"political advertising that includes an image, audio recording, or video recording of an officeholder's or candidate's appearance, speech or conduct that did not occur in reality,\" including media manipulated with generative artificial intelligence , to include a disclosure accounting for the meme's creative deviations from reality.\n\nUnder the proposed law, the Texas Ethics Commission would determine what form that disclosure takes, including \"the font, size, and color of the disclosure.\"\n\nFailure to include a disclosure could land Texans in jail with a Class A misdemeanor charge.\n\nFort Worth attorney Tony McDonald, a specialist in First Amendment litigation, told Texas Scorecard, \"It's amazing that this ridiculous bill is the top priority of the Texas House's most powerful committee. This bill is obviously unconstitutional. It would criminalize protected speech on the basis of its content.\"\n\n'Tryin to bolster my outlaw cred.'\n\nWhen presiding over a 14-hour state House session in 2023, Phelan appeared to slur his words and have difficulty identifying a colleague. This prompted Paxton and others to allege that he was \"in an obviously intoxicated state,\" and to call for his resignation. Phelan dodged questions about the allegations. In the years since, criticism of Phelan has in some cases incorporated mockery of the incident.\n\nTexas Scorecard suggested that the \"Drunk Dade\" call-ins to Michael Berry's talk radio show - consisting of an impression of a supposedly inebriated Phelan - might, for instance, qualify as verboten speech under House Bill 366.\n\nBerry noted on Monday, \"DrunkDade tryin to bolster my outlaw cred,\" suggesting that the parodies make Phelan \"so mad he's tryin to make it illegal.\"\n\nPhelan's inspiration to push the bill might instead be the so-called deepfake political advertisement that targeted him ahead of the Republican primary runoff election last year.\n\nThe Texas Tribune reported that the offending political mailer, which was paid for by the Club for Growth Action PAC, featured two photoshops: one that swapped House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) out of a photograph and instead depicted Phelan hugging Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.); and another falsely depicting Phelan giving a speech at a Texas House Democratic Caucus news conference.\n\nThe mailer stated, \"Texas Republicans deserve better than Democrat puppet Dade Phelan!\"\n\nUnder the proposed legislation, such doctored images would require disclosures \"indicating that the image, audio recording, or video recording did not occur in reality.\"\n\nTexas Scorecard indicated that Phelan did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Texas Legislature's state affairs committee will hold a public hearing on the bill on Wednesday. In the meantime, critics are sharing memes and photoshops to social media of Phelan without disclosures, demonstrating what might qualify as criminal should he get his way.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "What's the matter with Texas Republicans?\n\nWhen our \"representatives\" aren't defeating important bills or passing dangerous ones, they're wasting taxpayer time and money on meaningless initiatives that aid Democrats.\n\nTexas is known as a strong conservative state, often viewed as a beacon of liberty in the storm of destructive and radical leftist activism ruining our nation. But that reputation is changing, and unfortunately, it's our own Republican representatives who are leading the effort to undermine conservative values and interests in our great state.\n\nWhile the ridiculous effort last year to impeach Attorney General Ken Paxton is one of the most egregious cases, it's certainly not the only example of elected Republicans failing to represent their conservative constituents. These bad-faith establishment actors frequently throw in with Democrats on policies that directly contradict conservative priorities, often facing no accountability for letting down their constituents. That needs to change.\n\nThe Paxton impeachment effort wasn't the only vote to expose how little our representatives care to advance conservative values and priorities.\n\nWhat happened to Paxton should terrify every conservative in America. Perhaps the hardest-working and most effective Republican attorney general in the country, Paxton has taken up the fight to protect conservative values and priorities in Texas, protecting us from an authoritarian federal government and advancing freedom. Texans appreciate that about him. That's why 4.2 million of us re-elected him to keep fighting for us.\n\nThen, Republicans in the Texas House thought they could undermine the will of voters and impeach him with no evidence or testimony under oath, likely because his hard work and tenacity threatened their power and agendas. They wasted time and millions of taxpayer dollars on an effort that directly contradicted the values and priorities of their constituents and the good of the state. Yet they call themselves our \"representatives.\"\n\nWhile Democrats aren't technically in charge, they have enough corrupt and self-serving allies among establishment Republicans that their agendas advance anyway. The Paxton impeachment effort wasn't the only vote to expose how little our representatives care to advance conservative values and priorities.\n\nAnother pivotal vote by disingenuous Republicans was to install Dade Phelan as speaker of the Texas House. This vote not only supported corrupt establishmentarianism and cronyism within our legislature but also paved the way for him to appoint Democrats as committee chairs and to key leadership positions, undermining conservative principles and placing individuals who represent the antithesis of those values in positions of influence. Real representatives wouldn't support someone who elevates the people who hate us, our state, and our nation.\n\nThis has paved the way for corrupt and activist politicians to undermine bills and initiatives that are in the best interest of Texans and conservative values. Several important bills find themselves dead in the water as establishment Republicans join with activist Democrats to support agendas like the radical transgender and LGBTQ movement that actively targets our children. We don't celebrate or facilitate anorexia or schizophrenia, so why are our \"representatives\" playing along with gender dysphoria?\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers voted to underwrite transgender social transitioning by allowing funding for hospitals that mutilate children. Worse, they killed a bill that would have at least required insurance companies to cover de-transition costs after the person had been mutilated for a radical activist agenda. Both of these votes occurred in a Republican-controlled House, directly contrary to conservative values and the best interest of vulnerable children.\n\nWhen our \"representatives\" aren't defeating important bills or passing dangerous ones, they're wasting taxpayer time and money on meaningless initiatives to virtue-signal to their constituents and prevent us from noticing whose interests they really serve.\n\nInstead of taking real steps to stop the devastating illegal immigration crisis, our lawmakers squabble over insignificant laws to classify the assault charges for mass shooters or up the felony degree for possessing a firearm as a felon or even facilitate the creation of illegal immigrant housing developments that line the pockets of their friends and families. These are not policies that will help the lives of hardworking Texans, but it's apparently the best our \"representatives\" can do.\n\nThe erosion of conservative values in Texas should be a wake-up call for the entire nation, but especially for Texas voters. Decent, hardworking citizens deserve better than politicians grabbing for power and pushing radical agendas while pretending to work for the people who trust them to safeguard their freedoms and the American way of life.\n\nThe nation is watching to see if Texans will rise to the occasion and demand accountability for the many failures of our \"representatives\" while reaffirming the principles that have long defined our great state and shaped our nation into the greatest, freest, and most prosperous in the world. Remember, it's a republic if we can keep it .\n\nTim Greeson"

      "text": "A school choice showdown in Texas\n\nAt stake is whether the Lone Star State's children will be forced into a system run for adults at the expense of children, parents, and taxpayers, or whether they will finally be freed from it.\n\nSchool choice will hit a milestone or be crushed under a millstone in Texas on Tuesday.\n\nThe Texas House of Representatives last fall defeated a bill to implement education savings accounts. The legislation would have let taxpayer dollars follow each child to the school or other education services of the family's choice. It would have been a vital boost for Texas families whose children are stuck in underachieving , unsafe , union-ruled , child-indoctrinating , government-run public schools.\n\nMore teachers in government schools equals more money for the union. The unions benefit from governments keeping children trapped in these schools.\n\n\"Gold-standard\" randomized control trials consistently show that school choice improves academic achievement among the students who enroll in these programs. Choice even improves education outcomes in the government-run schools, as the latter rush to improve to meet the competition. Everybody wins.\n\nEveryone, that is, except the teachers' unions, and they have a lot of money to spend on elections. These unions are behind the powerful opposition to this much-needed reform in Texas.\n\nThe Texas Senate passed the bill last fall, and the legislation was then blocked in the House by rural Republicans and anti-choice Democrats (which was all of them). Twenty-one Republicans voted with the Democrats against the plan, throwing away a victory for the state's children and families that the GOP could have achieved easily.\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott had strongly supported the choice plan and called multiple special sessions to push the House to vote on the legislation. The legislature went out of session without passing the bill, and it does not meet this year.\n\nThere will be a general election in Texas this November, and the primary election to select candidates is Tuesday. Voters can decide whether representatives who opposed school choice will get a chance to deny education opportunities to the state's children and families again next year.\n\nFollowing the lead of fellow Republican Governor Kim Reynolds of Iowa , Abbott has endorsed primary challengers to Republicans who voted against the choice plan. Abbott said 89% of Texas Republican voters approve of school choice. A recent story in the Texas Tribune reported a poll found 60% of GOP primary voters said they would be less likely to vote for state House members who opposed the school choice plan last year.\n\nIt is important to note that the Texas legislation would have raised teacher salaries across the board. Government schools would have ended up with more money per pupil than before.\n\nIt turns out, however, that the education establishment does not just want more money per student - or per teacher. Teachers and education administrators want access to all the children they can rope into their rotten institutions of indoctrination and mental torture . Thus, they oppose choice even if it provides their schools with more money.\n\nThe teachers' unions are the central player here. Each teacher in a government school typically ends up in the union - the unions and schools make it as difficult as possible for teachers to opt out, even though the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that teachers cannot be forced to join unions. More teachers in government schools equal more money for the union. The unions benefit from governments keeping children trapped in these schools.\n\nThe media openly side with the unions. The Dallas Morning News predictably depicts the Texas Republican school choice opponents as heroes, describing them as \"stalwart,\" \"defiant,\" \"nonpartisan,\" \"respected incumbents,\" and concerned about \"the future of conservative, rural life.\" The story claims that school-choice opponents are the real conservatives. \"There's nothing more conservative than supporting our public schools,\" the story quotes anti-choice Republican Glenn Rogers as saying.\n\nIf that is true, there's also nothing more conservative than massive government deficits, Obamacare, social media censorship, forcibly ending fossil fuel use, encouraging urban crime, and drag queen story hours.\n\nTexas Republicans who vote against family freedom may have ulterior motives: \"Many of these legislators oppose school choice because the largest interest group in their district is the public school system,\" writes Texas Tech economics professor Alexander William Salter. \"School choice won't harm students or schools, but teachers' unions, education bureaucrats, and others are worried it will diminish their government-granted privileges.\"\n\nIn voting with the unions and the self-interested education establishment, these Republicans go against the interests of their constituents, \"often while taking campaign contributions from teachers unions and sending their own kids to private school,\" as Salter notes.\n\nThe system is fighting as hard as it can, with teachers intent on stuffing the ballot boxes (legally, one presumes) for school choice opponents, Fox 7 Austin reports : \"According to the [Texas American Federation of Teachers] poll, 92% said they will be voting in the March primary, and a large majority listed school choice as an issue of concern.\"\n\nTexas has open primary elections, meaning the Texas AFT's 66,000 members might save the day for Republican anti-choice candidates.\n\nWhat is at stake in Texas is whether the state's children will be forced into a system run for adults at the expense of children, parents, and taxpayers, or whether they will finally be freed from it.\n\nWe will find out soon whether what worked for Reynolds in Iowa will work for Abbott - and Texas schoolchildren.\n\nS.T.

      "text": "Texas needs universal school choice now\n\nSo why are Republican Speaker of the House Dade Phelan and two dozen rural representatives standing in the way?\n\nOur rights as parents come from God, not government.\n\nUnfortunately, Texas is one of only 18 states where parents do not have the final say on their child's education, even though school choice is sweeping the country and 32 states have already passed some form of it - with more to follow.\n\nYes, big, deep-red Texas doesn't have school choice.\n\nThe abysmal education statistics here are staggering. Texas children deserve better.\n\nJust this year alone, seven states have already established new school choice programs or expanded existing ones. Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Iowa are among the states that went from no program at all to a universal one in 2023.\n\nTexas needs to be next.\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott (R) called a special legislative session so that legislators could enact school choice. He's aggressively pushing them to make this happen. He's even gone so far as to threaten those Republicans who oppose school choice with primary opponents if legislation doesn't pass. He is willing to campaign against incumbent Republicans if they stand in the way of school choice - or, perhaps better said, if they stand in the way of parental empowerment .\n\nGood for Governor Abbott. He's following in the courageous footsteps of Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds (R), who did the same. She demanded school choice, but Republican legislators kept it from happening. She pummeled them politically, and now Iowa is a leader in school choice, with one of the best programs in the nation.\n\nAnd we have similarly seen some fantastic universal school choice programs signed into law by Governor Ron DeSantis (R) in Florida, Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders (R) in Arkansas, and numbers of other states.\n\nWhat is so maddening about Texas is that it has just one chamber in its legislature. And just one leader in that chamber is standing in the way. That leader is Republican House Speaker Dade Phelan (R).\n\nPhelan has empowered 24 rural Republicans who oppose school choice to control the fate of school choice in all of Texas. In the special session just called by Abbott, Phelan stacked the Education Committee with a majority of anti-school-choice Republicans, and they refused to approve or pass any type of robust universal school choice program.\n\nAbbott will likely need to call the legislators back for another special session on school choice, but with Phelan in charge of the House, it is not likely it will pass in that session either. Or the one after that - or the next one.\n\nDade Phelan is the only major Republican figure in Texas who is on the wrong side of this issue. Both of the Lone Star State's U.S. senators support universal school choice. So do the governor, the lieutenant governor, and the rest of the statewide elected officials.\n\nThe term RINO - \"Republican in name only\" - is often thrown around too casually. Many fine conservatives get unfairly tagged with the label. But in the case of Dade Phelan, the label fits.\n\nThe Texas House under Phelan's speakership has killed many good conservative measures. In the general session, Phelan not blocked not only school choice but also border security measures as well as tax reduction and tax reform bills. Phelan also decided to keep alive COVID masking for Texas universities.\n\nPhelan actually appointed a liberal Democrat to chair the criminal jurisprudence committee, so our pro-law-enforcement measures in Texas were killed. One of Phelan's chief House officials is a liberal Democrat who was an Obama White House attorney and who now works for a law firm hired to kill conservative priorities.\n\nNo wonder Lt. Governor Dan Patrick (R) has called on Phelan to resign.\n\nRepublican House members need to get a backbone and get themselves a different speaker, someone who is not a certified RINO. In Texas, Phelan is the primary roadblock to parental empowerment and universal school choice.\n\nAnd think about how he is protecting and promoting socialism in Texas.\n\nSocialism is based on government monopolies and government control. It holds the big-government view that one size fits all. Socialism hates competition.\n\nThe free market is based on competition, and the more robust the competition and the more choices someone has, the better the final product tends to be.\n\nWithout a doubt, this is true for school choice.\n\nOf the 73 independent studies done on school choice programs across the country, 93% found they not only resulted in taxpayer savings but also produced higher academic outcomes. And not a single study found any negative effects on racial or ethnic diversity.\n\nChildren's education should not be determined by their economic status and by the zip code their parents can afford. How discriminatory! Parents should also have the choice of what school they send their children to.\n\nThe real problem is our philosophy of education that excludes competition, better ideas, better content, and more efficient and effective teaching methods.\n\nThe results of socialism are never good, especially when they occur in Texas.\n\nLet me tell you, it is not good in Texas. The abysmal education statistics here are staggering. Texas children deserve better.\n\nThe results of what Texas calls the STAAR test tell you everything you need to know.\n\nThis is the official state assessment test to determine how well students in grades 3 through 8 are performing academically. It measures the percentage of students performing at grade level to see if they are where they should be educationally.\n\nAccording to the most recent testing results, the average percentage of students performing at grade level in Texas in the following subjects is only:\n\nThe most recent testing results show that anywhere from 60% to 73% - that is, from two-thirds to three-quarters of Texas students - are performing below grade level.\n\nThis is unacceptable. We have to do better for kids in Texas.\n\nIn any sane grading system, these are failing scores - and not by a narrow margin. Texas testing results are abysmally and embarrassingly low, going past deplorable and approaching appalling. If Texas education were part of the free-market system, this embarrassment would have been completely reorganized and retooled long ago.\n\nYet our state continues to pour money into this failing system. Just this year, Texas teachers just got a 22% pay raise, and the state currently provides to schools more than $11,000 per student per year. Yet teachers and schools are demanding even more money.\n\nLet me stress this again: For $11,000 per student, more than 60% of our kids are performing below grade level. Any parents in Texas feel like you could take that $11,000 and bring it to a school that would give your child a better education?\n\nWhile some teachers may be underpaid, that is not the problem here. School choice in other states has clearly proven that money is not the issue. Students across the nation are getting higher scores at considerably less expense. The real problem is our philosophy of education that excludes competition, better ideas, better content, and more efficient and effective teaching methods.\n\nDade Phelan, teacher education groups, and the rural Republicans who oppose free-market competition in education are putting the interests of the system above the interests of kids. They care more about the status quo than about the students. Texas needs to stop being socialistic in education.\n\nLast year on the Republican primary referendum ballot, 88% of Texas Republicans voted in favor of universal school choice. And statewide polling shows that overall, 74% of Texas parents with schoolchildren support educational choice. This support is across both sides of the political aisle. This high number includes support from Democrats as well as Republicans, all races and ethnicities, and both rural and urban areas. Phelan is out of step not only with Republicans but with the entire state.\n\nThe two dozen rural Republican state representatives whom Phelan has gathered around him on this issue claim their rural schools are good and that no change is needed. But if their schools are as good as they believe, then they don't need to fear that students and parents will leave if given a choice. Yet apparently they do fear this.\n\nAnd they also wrongly assume that because their schools are rural, they are not woke. But things are not as they seem. Although some 81% of rural Texans vote Republican, an amazing 92% of political contributions made by rural teachers go to Democrats.\n\nThese representatives, believing their own school districts need no change, are selfishly denying millions of Texas schoolchildren throughout the rest of the state an opportunity to choose a quality education. They are standing in the way of the more than 60% of students who currently are not performing at grade level, and they are denying students in the inner cities of Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and elsewhere an opportunity for a good education.\n\nSchool choice is the civil rights issue of our time. It is time for Texas to step up and create a universal school choice program as our neighbors in Oklahoma and Arkansas have done.\n\nIf we keep doing what we've been doing, we'll keep getting the results we've been getting. It's time for a change.\n\nRural communities are not liberal or socialistic; they don't oppose competition. They, too, need school choice. In fact, of the 10 most rural states in America, eight already have school choice with private options. And the other two (Kentucky and North Dakota) are currently working on passing school choice.\n\nConsumers want choices, whether in their selection of cars, restaurants, entertainment, clothing, or anything else. Choice and competition always improve the quality of a product, and this includes school education.\n\nAlso, let's not ignore the fact that in the last few years the U.S. Supreme Court has held in multiple cases that school choice is constitutional. And in three of those cases, it ruled that in universal school choice programs, parents can have the right to choose even religious schools for their kids.\n\nThe court's decisions in these cases may be the most important education decisions since Brown v. Board of Education ended segregation in education because they open the door to full vindication of Brown 's promise of equal educational opportunity for all , including people of faith. In Texas, we trust parents to make decisions about their children's education, yet Phelan and his rural Republican cohorts clearly don't trust parents.\n\nAnd what do Texas Democrats have to say about school choice? True to form, progressive interest groups are labeling school choice racist. They call giving underprivileged Americans the chance at a private education an act of bigotry. This is an affront to common decency, not to mention common sense, but we can't expect leftists to act decently or think logically. We've come to expect them to use smears, fear, and bullying when they can't win an argument on logic and ideas, and this is what they are doing with school choice.\n\nThey even use phony front groups like Pastors for Children to make the claim, in some bizarre twist, that school choice is un-Christian. Ridiculous! We all know that Catholics, Baptists, and Christians of all stripes want school choice. They want the option to choose what they believe to be the best educational approach for their children. Every parent does.\n\nTexas boasts about being the biggest and best in almost every way - and we think there's a lot of truth in that and a lot for Texans to brag about. But on school choice, Texas is definitely behind the curve - far behind the curve.\n\nDuring COVID, parents were given an up-close look into their children's education, and what they saw disturbed them. They saw the curriculum and the lesson materials being taught, not to mention the mask mandates. As a result, we have seen a genuine awakening of moms and dads worried about their children's future.\n\nChildren deserve better in Texas. They are being failed by a broken system. Texas must listen, answer that call, and pass a school choice bill that allows parents to decide which education option works best for their children according to their values - the option that will actually give them the best chance at success in life. We cannot continue to have more than 60% performing under grade level.\n\nSchool choice is the civil rights issue of our time. It is time for Texas to step up and create a universal school choice program as our neighbors in Oklahoma and Arkansas have done.\n\nGovernor Abbott is planning to call the legislature back again and again in special sessions until a robust universal school choice measure is passed.\n\nWill the Texas speaker and House of Representatives do the right thing? If not, the representatives in the House should call for and vote in a new speaker of the House.\n\nIf you live in Texas, there are specific things you can do right now to make a difference. There is a powerful tool you can use, and you can connect your friends in Texas to this tool.\n\nIt's critical that your Texas representatives hear from you right now. There is a very simple and direct way you can do this today. And I urge you, if you are not in Texas but know people who are, please encourage them to do this.\n\nText KIDS to 80550, or go to the website Texas4SchoolChoice.org . You will get your representative's phone number, email, and address. These are three effective ways you can make your voice heard. I suggest you do all three.\n\nAlso, there is a button on the website; if you click it, it will call your representative's office. (Remember to call during working hours.)\n\nAnd there's another button on the website you can click that will send an email directly to your specific representative.\n\nTell your representatives you want universal school choice and that if Dade Phelan stands in the way, you want a new speaker. Do not be mean or threatening. Just remind them that this is important for Texas and for our kids.\n\nSo text KIDS to 80550, or go to the website Texas4SchoolChoice.org .\n\nGlenn Beck\n\nCo-Founder"

      "text": "Texas Primaries: Cornyn Slipping Well Below 50%\n\nA new Gravis Marketing poll (conducted Feb. 10 - 12; sampling 729 likely Texas Republican primary voters) may be a harbinger of trouble for establishment Republican Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas).\n\nHe faces Rep. Steve Stockman, Tea Party favorite Dwayne Stovall , and five others in a March 4 Republican primary election. If no candidate receives an absolute majority (50 percent plus one vote), the top two will face off in a May 27 run-off contest. The eventual Republican nominee will be a prohibitive favorite in the 2014 general election.\n\nThe run-off system is designed to ensure that the winning candidate receives a majority of support from the party voters. Therefore, when a universally known candidate in a primary race is forced to a secondary vote, like Sen. Cornyn in this case, the political death knell is usually sounded. The fact that a majority of the primary voters have already chosen an alternative candidate despite being keenly familiar with the front-runner normally spells eventual defeat for the under-performing first place finisher.\n\nU.S. Sen. John Cornyn speaks to supporters during his re-election campaign kickoff rally in Austin, Texas, on Friday, Nov. 15, 2013. Cornyn called Friday for inclusiveness among Republicans and suggested his party should be the \"responsible adults in the room and actually govern\" a sentiment that stands in stark contrast to Texan colleague and tea party firebrand Ted Cruz. Cornyn has been in office since 2002 and faces no credible tea party challenger in the Republican primary in March. No Democrat has yet filed to challenge him next November. (AP Photo/Austin American-Statesman, Rodolfo Gonzalez)\n\nSen. Ted Cruz's (R-Texas) 2012 electoral situation becomes an obvious model for the race in which Stockman, Stovall, and five others are currently embroiled with Mr. Cornyn.\n\nThe challengers' objective will be to place second, and deny the senator outright victory on March 4. Two years ago, Mr. Cruz scored 34.2 percent of the vote in a Republican primary field of nine candidates, holding favored candidate David Dewhurst, the state's sitting lieutenant governor, to 44.6 percent. In the run-off, with 22 percents less voters participating than from the first vote, Cruz went on to swamp Dewhurst, 57 to 43 percent.\n\nCould the same fate await Cornyn?\n\nTed Cruz has already blazed the path to victory here, hence the universe of Texas Republicans who will reject an establishment incumbent, or such figure, has already been exposed. Whether Sen. Cornyn falls by the political wayside the way Mr. Dewhurst did two years ago is of course undetermined, though visualizing the senator losing has still yet to come in focus.\n\nAccording to the current Gravis survey, Sen. Cornyn leads Rep. Stockman only 43 to 28 percent. The polling sample favorably views both men, though Cornyn's 49 to 27 percent positive-to-negative is somewhat weak, remembering that the polling sample is comprised exclusively of his own party's primary voters. Mr. Stockman scores a 28 to 18 percent favorability index, though 55 percent of the respondents either are unsure about him or don't have an opinion.\n\nRep. Steve Stockman talks during a press conference. Photo Credit: www.politico.com\n\nThe poll's flaw, however, is not testing any candidate beyond the aforementioned two, meaning the results are not an accurate depiction of the actual Texas primary ballot. Still, the omission is not likely to help Cornyn because choosing among a larger number of options would give respondents even more opportunity to oppose the incumbent.\n\nA word of caution about this poll, however. Gravis Marketing is a relative newcomer to national polling, coming on the scene in a big way for the first time two years ago. Some of their results were spotty, but the methodology of this Texas poll appears sound, the omission of the other candidates, notwithstanding.  Other pollsters will be releasing data shortly, so the culmination of the various surveys will likely give us a good idea as to what may happen in two weeks.\n\nTexas' primary turnouts, however, are among the lowest in the country. Therefore, projecting an exact voter participation model is extremely complicated, hence the difficulty in forecasting accurate conclusions.\n\nSen. Cornyn had raised more than $7.5 million for this primary race by the end of 2013, and holding another $6.5 million in the bank. Stockman obtained just under $435,000 but had already spent 90 percent of that total. Stovall didn't even reach $30,000 in receipts.\n\nA voter casts his ballot November 6, 2012 in Minerva Park, Ohio.

Dewhurst spent just under $34 million in his losing effort, more than $20 million from his own pocket, and almost $71 per final vote that he received.\n\nE lection Notes - An Impending Fight for Louie Gohmert?\n\nRemaining with Texas politics but moving to the House of Representatives, it appears Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) may be headed for yet another future confrontation with the Tea Party Caucus. Veteran Congressman Doc Hastings' (R-Wash.) retirement announcement is likely setting the stage for a major battle between the Speaker and the most conservative members of the party conference.\n\nMr. Hastings is the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, a panel that has jurisdiction over the nation's land use policy and many environmental laws. The Endangered Species Act is one law that comes under this committee's purview, and the fight between a Republican legislative body and a liberal federal bureaucracy over land use and hunting rights is always a defining one for western congressmen.\n\nWith Chairman Hastings now departing at the beginning of next year, the Republican Steering Committee - the panel that decides the Republican members' committee assignments - will be tasked with naming a replacement. The panel is comprised of largely senior GOP members from across the nation and is heavily leadership driven.\n\nU.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) speaks during a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on oversight of the U.S. Department of Justice May 15, 2013 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Credit: Getty Images\n\nThe individual next in line for the chairmanship, in terms of committee seniority, is Tea Party's favorite son Louie Gohmert of East Texas. Often the next senior member is voted in as the succeeding chairman, but even when said person isn't granted the post it is the rare occasion when such a member doesn't attempt to ascend.\n\nTherefore, will Louie Gohmert be awarded the position? Will this be a post-election Tea Party vs. Republican establishment fight?\n\nThe eventual decision likely comes down to Speaker Boehner, himself. He normally controls the Steering Committee with a rare strong hand, so it will be interesting to see, when the time comes early in 2015, whether such a conservative member will be allowed a position of importance under Boehner's speakership.\n\nWith Mr. Gohmert's ability to attract media attention, and the press always aspiring to drive the wedge in deeper between conservatives and establishment Republicans, expect the battle for this chairmanship to become a paramount post-election fight.\n\nIn the end, Mr. Gohmert may find himself as the focal point of a new intra-party House battle. Realistically, however, the General Election itself may decide this outcome even before the next Congress begins. A GOP landslide with more conservatives coming to Congress will almost assuredly favor the affable gentlemen from Tyler, Texas. A House divided in similar proportion to today will likely spur the leadership to attempt to force the Tea Party Caucus into the background, giving them yet another reason to deny conservatives.\n\nJim Ellis is a professional election analyst who has worked in national campaign politics and grassroots issue advocacy since 1978.

      "text": "Rick Perry's Trojan Horse\n\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry has recently become the most proactive governor in American history to actively seek out and convince businesses to relocate to his state.\n\nHe has focused on luring businesses from some of the most liberal states in the union - California, Washington, Colorado, New York, Missouri, and Illinois - to Texas.\n\nThese states have some of the highest personal and corporate income taxes, which makes the fact that Texas has no personal and corporate income taxes very inviting. If you are a business owner in one of these Democrat-controlled states, especially California , it simply makes good business sense to move to Texas.\n\nIn this March 7, 2014 file photo, Texas Gov. Rick Perry speaks at the Conservative Political Action Committee annual conference in National Harbor, Md. AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File\n\nPerry has been successful in luring well over a 100 businesses to the great state of Texas, mostly from the liberal stronghold of California. This has created an economic boom in Texas: lowering unemployment, creating high paying jobs all while increasing its population. In the last year, the United States has added over 2.4 million jobs and nearly 16 percent of those (383,000) were in Texas; which only has 8 percent of the population.\n\nThis has made Texas a great place to live for young adults and families all while giving Perry an undisputable bragging point if he decides to run for president again. Although, Perry has not totally thought his business-stealing plan all the way through, and it could have dire electoral consequences.\n\nMany large businesses have started to make their way to Texas and they are bringing thousands of loyal employees - correction - thousands of liberal employees.\n\nAs seen by the reelection of President Barack Obama, liberals hardly ever realize the error of their ways. These employees are being relocated to Texas from places like California and they are bringing with them thousands of votes for Democrats.\n\nPhoto Credit: Toyota\n\nJust this year, Toyota is relocating from Los Angeles to Dallas and bringing 4,000 employees. AIG is also moving 4,000 employees from California and New York to Texas. Chevron is moving some 800 jobs from the Bay Area to Texas. The enormous oil and natural gas company, Occidental Petroleum , is moving its headquarters to Houston. Active Network LLC has recently made public that it will be moving 1,000 jobs to Texas from San Diego. To date, well over 10,000 jobs have been moved to Texas from liberal states just this year.\n\nIn 2013, companies such as Apple , Ebay , Visa , and a dozen more moved over 10,000 jobs to Texas through the Texas Enterprise Fund . This is a fund that was created in 2003 by the Texas Legislature to help incentivize businesses to expand and move to Texas. This is the main tool Perry has used in his pursuit to bring these big companies to Texas.\n\nTexas is a Republican stronghold, but there are pockets where Democrats reign. Texas' major cities of Austin, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio are widely Democrat, although the suburbs of these cities are widely Republican. This has allowed Texas to maintain a 24-12 Republican edge in the 113th U.S. Congress and a 45-21 edge in their state legislature.\n\nWhen you add thousands of California, Washington, New York, and other liberal state residents to these suburbs in the next five years, Republicans will began to lose their edge quite quickly.\n\nA majority of these new Texas residents will vote Democrat, plain and simple. These individuals will not see that the reason their former state has such high unemployment, high taxes, and low standards of living was liberal Democrat politicians and policies; thus they will continue to vote Democrat.\n\nA large crowd, many wearing Planned Parenthood T-shirts that read Stand with Texas Woman, gather at the Texas State Capitol in Austin, Texas on Sunday, June 23, 2013. More than 600 women's rights protesters crowded into the Texas Capitol to watch Democrats begin a series of parliamentary maneuvers to stop the Republican majority from passing some of the toughest abortion restrictions in the country. Credit: AP\n\nFurthermore, these companies like Ebay and Apple will continue to expand at an accelerated rate and they will continue to hire young tech-savvy millennials, who lean overwhelmingly Democrat, coloring Texas purple.\n\nIt will take years before Texas goes completely purple, but Perry is speeding up the process of Democrats taking away Republicans' control of the Texas Legislature and the U.S. Congress. Now, with Republicans' suicidal epiphany to push amnesty, Texas could go all blue.\n\nIt takes years to realize electoral consequences. Former Sen. Ted Kennedy's immigration reform of 1965 was designed to cater to Asians and Hispanics, forever changing the national electoral landscape to favor Democrats.\n\nRepublicans have begun to feel this over the last 10 years and, I fear, Texas Republicans will feel the electoral consequences of Perry's business stealing blitz years from now as this Trojan Horse turns one of the greatest states in the union from red, to purple, to blue.\n\nSalvator La Mastra is an expert in millennials and the youth vote.

Jake Ellzey said in a news conference Thursday morning. 'Last year alone we lost 105,000 Americans to overdose, two thirds of those two thirds of that is from fentanyl. That number is 287 every day. If this were a war that was declared, we would be losing it.'\n\n'This is the cartels have brought every they are making more money trafficking in human beings than they are on drugs. They're responsible for this entire crisis. This time we declared them a clear and present danger to the national security the United States.'\n\nFormer President Trump put up about 458 miles of wall along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border before the Biden administration stopped construction.  Texas Republicans also want to build 700 miles of roads along the border and bolster recruitment for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers by offering better pay and bonuses.\n\n'We're stepping up today in anticipation of our Republican majority and saying every power - from the purse, to investigation, and if and when appropriate, impeachment, so that we can get our colleagues in Washington to have the same sense of urgency that are built in Texas,' said Rep. Jodey Arrington\n\nMexico-born outgoing Rep. Mayra Flores claimed Democrats had had the opportunity to give citizenship to DACA recipients, known as Dreamers, but instead used Hispanics as pawns\n\nThe Republican plan calls to reinstate the Migrant Protection Protocols undone by President Biden to ensure that anyone who cannot be detained until their asylum proceeding is turned away, essentially ending 'catch-and-release.'\n\nThe GOP plan also calls for reforming 'credible fear' and asylum policies to eliminate 'fraud.' It would establish up to 10 years' jail time for lying about a credible fear on an asylum application and tighten the standard for what counts as such.\n\nThose who come to the border and claim asylum must first claim they have a credible fear of being turned away. If an asylum officer determines their fear to be legitimate, they are released into the U.S. and told to return for a court date, which is often years down the line.\n\nIn a portion sure to draw controversy, Republicans also want to 'defund' any NGOs or other organizations that they say encourage the violation of border security. The proposal then calls for ending loosened enforcement of ICE policy and put limits on the prosecutorial discretion DHS uses to release immigrants into the interior.\n\nThe framework then calls for designating cartels as terrorist groups and increasing penalties for human and drug trafficking.\n\nThe Texas Republicans also pushed back on the White House's assertion that they have 'no plan' to deal with the border.\n\n'They had the nerve to call situations like this or when we go visit the border they call them political stunts. They said the other day the Republicans have no plan. They just want political stunts. We have a plan. We have a very detailed plan,' said Rep. Dan Crenshaw.\n\nThe U.S. saw a record 2.7 million migrant encounters in fiscal year 2022. That figure includes those who attempted to cross multiple times.\n\nWhile the Republican outline addressed border security, it did not include any immigration reform proposals. It's unlikely that a deal without immigration reform could make it through a Democrat-led Senate.\n\nIn the Senate Republican Thom Tillis and Democrat Kyrsten Sinema are working on a bipartisan proposal that would offer a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients in exchange for tightened border enforcement and sped-up asylum processing and an extension of Title 42, which is set to end Dec. 21.\n\nThe deal is a long-shot, and would need to be passed before Republicans take control of the House as many have said they will not vote for reform until they deem the border 'secure.'\n\nWithout Title 42, border agents are preparing to see up to 18,000 migrant encounters per day. Border officials have previously said their resources are exhausted when they encounter 5,000 migrants per day.\n\nMigrants, mostly from Nicaragua, board a bus to go to their destination after being released from U.S. Border Patrol custody in El Paso, Texas, U.S., December 5\n\nThe Dec. 21 deadline for the Covid-era policy that allows for the immediate expulsion of migrants is still in flux, as a dozen Republican states have asked a judge to let them defend the policy in court.\n\nAsked about the Senate proposal Texas Republicans acknowledged the need for immigration reform but refused to commit to including any reform in a border security bill.\n\nMexico-born outgoing Rep. Mayra Flores claimed Democrats had had the opportunity to give citizenship to DACA recipients, known as Dreamers, but instead used Hispanics as pawns.\n\n'You've had an opportunity to do something about DACA and you've done nothing. You made the border worse. Why they haven't done anything? They have the president, they're in the majority.'\n\nThe fiery South Texas Republican added: 'They're using this issue. Stop using us to get our vote. And then you toss us aside. That's exactly what the Democrat Party has been doing. They only remember about us and the issues that we care during the election. They're on their way out.'\n\n'We know we need to deal with immigration issues,' added Roy. 'But we need to secure the border right now for the reasons that everybody just articulated. And we need to get y'all to get your head wrapped around that.'\n\nThe Republicans also called on DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to resign and promised to call him in for testimony in the majority, and hinted at the potential for impeachment.\n\n'We're stepping up today in anticipation of our Republican majority and saying every power - from the purse, to investigation, and if and when appropriate, impeachment, so that we can get our colleagues in Washington to have the same sense of urgency that are built in Texas,' said Rep.

Brown Convention Center from Thursday until Saturday, and the vote to reject Biden's election win was a verbal one.\n\nThat resolution said: 'We believe that the 2020 election violated Article 1 and 2 of the US Constitution, that various secretaries of state illegally circumvented their state legislatures in conducting their elections in multiple ways, including by allowing ballots to be received after November 3 2020.'\n\nThe resolution went on to say that 'substantial election fraud' in cities helped Biden win.\n\nIt concluded: 'We reject the certified results of the 2020 Presidential election, and we hold that acting President Joseph Robinette Biden Jr was not legitimately elected by the people of the United States.'\n\nRepublicans were also urged to show up en masse to vote in the November midterms to minimize the effect of any future election fraud.\n\nThe other notable moments at the convention saw the Texas Republicans publicly rebuke Senator John Cornyn for engaging in bipartisan gun control talks, voted in favor of repealing the Voting Rights Act and voted on a measure demanding that schoolchildren 'learn about the humanity of the preborn child.'\n\nThe party's embrace of unfounded electoral fraud allegations in a bedrock Republican state came as a bipartisan congressional committee seeks to definitively and publicly debunk the false idea that Biden did not win the election.\n\nThe platform will be sent to the state capital Austin to be certified officially by the state Republican party.\n\nA Donald Trump cutout stands at Patriot Mobile display at the Republican Party of Texas convention at George R.

Brown Convention Center in Houston.\n\nParty spokesman James Wesolek said that it was unusual for votes of this nature to be rejected, reports the Texas Tribune.\n\nBiden received 7 million more votes than rival Donald Trump. Biden also received 306 votes from the Electoral College, more than the 270 needed to win.\n\nSpeaking to KUT, delegates at the convention echoed the sentiments of the resolution.\n\nMary Jo Bloomqvist said: 'There's no way in hell Biden got 81 million votes. Are you kidding me?'\n\nWhile Jessica Steels said that she saw the 'numbers change' and that she not longer trusts 'the voting system.' Steels added: 'I became a precinct chair two years ago when Donald Trump was running in 2020, which we all know he won.'\n\nDonald Trump comfortably defeated Joe Biden in the state of Texas by more than 600,000 votes in 2020\n\nTexas was one of the many states that conducted an extensive audit of the 2020 presidential election but found few discrepancies.\n\nDonald Trump comfortably won the state by more than 600,000 votes.\n\nAmong the events at the convention was a screening of the conspiracy theory movie '200 Mules.'

Dan Crenshaw heckled by conservative activists\n\nBiden said in signing the order: 'My message to all the young people: just be you. You are loved. You are heard. You are understood. You do belong.'\n\nVotes on the provision are being tallied and certified following the bi-annual state party convention, a party spokesperson said.\n\nThe Log Cabin Republicans of Houston, an organization that represents LGBT conservatives, said it was once again denied a request to set up a booth at the party's convention this week, as it has been for past conventions.\n\nThe group called the Texas Republican Convention's actions 'not just narrow-minded, but politically short-sighted.'\n\nHowever, the group is seeing 'no evidence' of other state Republican conventions adopting similar bans or exclusionary language, Charles Moran, Log Cabin Republican managing director, told Reuters.\n\n'If anything we are being more included' than in the past, he said, noting that the 2020 Republican presidential campaign had an official pride coalition, and the gay Republican vote doubled between 2016 and 2020. 'President Trump was the most pro-gay Republican that we have ever had,' he added.\n\nActing chairman of the Log Cabin Republicans of Texas, Michael Cargill, told KXAN: 'These are just crazy people. It's a small minority of people that are being un-Christian-like and spewing this hateful language.'\n\nThe station reported that one speaker at the convention attempted to get the party to temper its language on homosexuality.\n\nThat speaker said: 'We're the Republican Party of Texas.

      "text": "Texas GOP suggests death penalty for women who get abortions and doctors who perform them\n\nBy EVE SIMMONS HEALTH AND WELLNESS EDITOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 12:25 EDT, 30 May 2024 | Updated: 13:28 EDT, 30 May 2024\n\n84\n\nView comments\n\nThe Texas Republican Party have lodged a proposal that appears to call for the death penalty for women who seek abortions, as well as the doctors who help them.\n\nAt a GOP convention on Saturday, Texas delegates presented a detailed platform that defines abortion as 'not healthcare... homicide.'\n\nThe 50-page document calls for the 'equal protection of the laws to all preborn children from the moment of fertilization,' and for physicians to only be exempt from homicide charges when the abortion is 'non-elective, such as required to save the life of the mother.'\n\nAccording to Texas law, perpetrators of child homicide are punishable by death.\n\nPro-life protesters stand near the gate of the Texas state capitol at a protest outside the Texas state capitol on May 29, 2021 in Austin, Texas\n\nRepresentatives are currently voting on whether or not to approve all the proposals.\n\nCommenting on the platform , Farah Diaz-Tello, senior counsel and legal director at Lawyering for Reproductive Justice, told Huff Post that the death penalty is the 'next logical step' in the anti-abortion movement in Texas.\n\nHowever, speaking to DailyMail.com, legal experts in Texas have suggested that the party platform has 'no bearing on legislature' and, in practice, enforcing death penalties for abortions in Texas would be 'virtually impossible'.\n\n'Texas Republicans are just reaffirming beliefs that we've known they've held for a long time,' the attorney told DailyMail.com.\n\n'In order for women to be sentenced to capital punishment, a law would have to be enshrined clearly stating this, and party platforms have no influence on this.\n\n'Further, district attorneys rarely, if ever, prosecute women who have abortions. They are more likely to go after the doctor and even then, it is an uphill battle.'\n\nMore prisoners have been executed in Texas than any other state since 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center - with 586 capital deaths.\n\nAbortion is currently punishable by up to 99 years in prison in Texas, for both the woman who undergoes the procedure and the medical professional assisting her.\n\nHowever, in practice, the abortion-seeker is rarely brought to trial.\n\nThe legislation has been enforced since August 2022, two months after Roe v Wade, which prohibited states from banning abortion, was overturned.\n\nThe number of abortions in 2022 dropped by 59 percent compared to the previous year, from around 53,000 to 22,000, according to figures from the Lozier institute.\n\nAnd more recent figures suggest that this rate has plummeted dramatically since, with just 17 legal abortions recorded in the first four months of 2023, according to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.\n\nHowever, this is thought to be a major underestimation.\n\nAt an April press event, former President Donald Trump said he believed there was no need for a national abortion ban anymore\n\nThe new proposal also calls for 'preserving' the dignity of human embryos including 'banning human embryo trafficking', referring to people who wish to undergo IVF out of state.\n\nThis has sparked fears that Texas may soon follow in Alabama's footsteps - where human embryos are granted the same legal status as children.\n\nThe decision led to the shutdown of major IVF clinics in the state, due to fears of criminal prosecution should embryos become unintentionally damaged.\n\nAlso in the proposal is reference to homosexuality as an 'abnormal lifestyle choice', and a denouncement of 'all efforts to validate transgender identity'.\n\n'We believe gender modification and any form of gender affirming care for minors does not constitute medical care and is, in fact, child abuse,' the proposal reads.\n\nCurrently, abortion is illegal in 14 states, and a further seven restricts access to the procedure.\n\nLast month, Florida enacted a law banning abortion after six weeks, replacing the state's previous 15-week ban.\n\nMany women do not know they are pregnant until they are at least six weeks gone.\n\nIn the South, abortion is now either banned or severely restricted in Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas and Louisiana, meaning women must travel to Virginia to seek a procedure.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

Therefore, federally mandated legislation that infringes upon the 10th Amendment rights of Texas should be ignored, opposed, refused, and nullified.\n\n'Texas retains the right to secede from the United States, and the Texas Legislature should be called upon to pass a referendum consistent thereto.'\n\nTexas has long pushed an independent movement, called 'Texit.'\n\nAfter the area declared independence from Mexico in 1836, it was a sovereign state for nine years before it was annexed by the United States in 1845. There have been multiple secession movement since then.\n\nLegally Texas cannot secede from the union. There has been a myth that it can because of the way it was annexed but the Congressional order of annexation merely stated Texas could - at a future date - divide itself into five states. It says nothing about leaving the union.\n\nTexas Republicans want to hold a referendum next year to decide whether or not the state should secede from the U.S.\n\nState Republicans held their annual gathering at the George R. Brown Convention Center from Thursday until Saturday, and the secession issue was one of many voted upon, includng a provision to reject Biden's presidential win.\n\nThat resolution said: 'We believe that the 2020 election violated Article 1 and 2 of the US Constitution, that various secretaries of state illegally circumvented their state legislatures in conducting their elections in multiple ways, including by allowing ballots to be received after November 3 2020.'\n\nThe resolution went on to say that 'substantial election fraud' in cities helped Biden win.\n\nIt concluded: 'We reject the certified results of the 2020 Presidential election, and we hold that acting President Joseph Robinette Biden Jr was not legitimately elected by the people of the United States.'\n\nRepublicans were also urged to show up en masse to vote in the November midterms to minimize the effect of any future election fraud.\n\nThe other notable moments at the convention saw the Texas Republicans publicly rebuke Senator John Cornyn for engaging in bipartisan gun control talks, voted in favor of repealing the Voting Rights Act and voted on a measure demanding that schoolchildren 'learn about the humanity of the preborn child.'\n\nThe party's embrace of unfounded electoral fraud allegations in a bedrock Republican state came as a bipartisan congressional committee seeks to definitively and publicly debunk the false idea that Biden did not win the election.\n\nThe platform will be sent to the state capital Austin to be certified officially by the state Republican party.\n\nA Donald Trump cutout stands at Patriot Mobile display at the Republican Party of Texas convention at George R. Brown Convention Center on Thursday\n\nMembers voted to repeal the Voting Rights Act, a law that was passed to make it easier to Black Americans to vote\n\nAmong the events at the convention was a screening of the conspiracy theory movie '200 Mules.' The film claims to have revealed evidence of mass voter fraud\n\nThe convention was held at the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston.\n\nParty spokesman James Wesolek said that it was unusual for votes of this nature to be rejected, reports the Texas Tribune.\n\nBiden received 7 million more votes than rival Donald Trump. Biden also received 306 votes from the Electoral College, more than the 270 needed to win.\n\nSpeaking to KUT, delegates at the convention echoed the sentiments of the resolution.\n\nMary Jo Bloomqvist said: 'There's no way in hell Biden got 81 million votes. Are you kidding me?'\n\nWhile Jessica Steels said that she saw the 'numbers change' and that she not longer trusts 'the voting system.' Steels added: 'I became a precinct chair two years ago when Donald Trump was running in 2020, which we all know he won.'\n\nTexas was one of the many states that conducted an extensive audit of the 2020 presidential election but found few discrepancies.\n\nDonald Trump comfortably won the state by more than 600,000 votes.\n\nAmong the events at the convention was a screening of the conspiracy theory movie '200 Mules.' The film claims to have revealed evidence of mass voter fraud.\n\nThe congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol is building a case that Trump's efforts to overturn his defeat in the 2020 presidential election -- including by denying he lost -- amounted to conspiracy to illegally hold onto power.\n\nIn recent weeks, testimonies from members of former President Donald Trump inner circle admitted that they did not believe his claims of election fraud.\n\nTrump, the 45th U.S. president, has denied any wrongdoing with regard to the January 6 riot.\n\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick was one of the keynote speakers at the convention\n\nSpeaker of the Texas House of Representatives Dade Phelan addressing members of the party at a special reception\n\nTexas Republicans also passed a resolution declaring Joe Biden's 2020 win illegitimate\n\nTexas is a major player in U.S. national politics, with 38 electoral votes, the second highest after California. Voters there have backed Republican presidents for the past four decades.\n\nThe White House had no comment.\n\nAccording to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, about two-thirds of Republicans believe the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump.\n\nState and federal judges dismissed more than 50 lawsuits brought by Trump and his allies challenging the election while reviews and audits found no evidence of widespread fraud.\n\nOne of the proposed principles in the latest Texas Republican party platform also includes new language criticizing homosexuality and voicing opposition to 'all efforts to validate transgender identity.'\n\n'Homosexuality is an abnormal lifestyle choice,' it reads, a statement that is not in the 2020 platform.\n\nA week before the convention, President Joe Biden signed an executive order protecting members of the LGBTQ community from state laws that would prohibit them from health care access.\n\nAmong the most controversial moments of the convention saw Rep. Dan Crenshaw heckled by conservative activists\n\nBiden said in signing the order: 'My message to all the young people: just be you. You are loved. You are heard. You are understood. You do belong.'\n\nVotes on the provision are being tallied and certified following the bi-annual state party convention, a party spokesperson said.\n\nThe Log Cabin Republicans of Houston, an organization that represents LGBT conservatives, said it was once again denied a request to set up a booth at the party's convention this week, as it has been for past conventions.\n\nThe group called the Texas Republican Convention's actions 'not just narrow-minded, but politically short-sighted.'\n\nHowever, the group is seeing 'no evidence' of other state Republican conventions adopting similar bans or exclusionary language, Charles Moran, Log Cabin Republican managing director, told Reuters.\n\n'If anything we are being more included' than in the past, he said, noting that the 2020 Republican presidential campaign had an official pride coalition, and the gay Republican vote doubled between 2016 and 2020. 'President Trump was the most pro-gay Republican that we have ever had,' he added.\n\nActing chairman of the Log Cabin Republicans of Texas, Michael Cargill, told KXAN: 'These are just crazy people. It's a small minority of people that are being un-Christian-like and spewing this hateful language.'\n\nThe station reported that one speaker at the convention attempted to get the party to temper its language on homosexuality.\n\nThat speaker said: 'We're the Republican Party of Texas. We're not the Westboro Baptist Church.' A reference to the Topeka, Kansas, based church that consistently stage anti-LGBTQ protests nationwide.\n\nOn Friday, Senator John Cornyn who has represented Texas in the Senate since 2002.\n\nThere have been renewed nationwide calls for gun law reform following the deaths of 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.\n\nAnother highlight of the convention saw Texas Congressman and former Navy SEAL Rep.

Tony Gonzales beats YouTube star Brandon Herrera known as the 'AK Guy' and Speaker who impeached Ken Paxton survives: The takeaways from the Texas primary runoffs\n\nBy MORGAN PHILLIPS, CONGRESS REPORTER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 12:08 EDT, 29 May 2024 | Updated: 15:09 EDT, 29 May 2024\n\n1\n\nView comments\n\nTexas runoffs on Tuesday proved to be a win for establishment conservatives over burn-it-all-down types in a U.S. House race - but swept out Republican incumbents on the state level.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott's retribution tour against school choice opposers proved successful - embattled Attorney General Ken Paxton 's vengeance campaign against those who led impeachment efforts against him did not.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from the Lone Star State's runoff primary races:\n\nIncumbent Rep. Tony Gonzales beats out right-wing internet star Brandon Herrera\n\nIn a win for governing-minded Republicans, Texas Rep. Tony Gonzales, 43, beat out right-wing YouTube star Brandon Herrera, 28, in a contentious primary that had divided the House GOP .\n\nThe border district congressman won by a razor-thin margin, in what his supporters say will give Republicans a better chance of winning the general election over Democrats .\n\nGonzales clinched a win by 407 votes, according to the Texas Secretary of State's office.\n\nHerrera, a Youtube star known as 'AK guy,' ran on a gun rights platform in the district that includes Uvalde, where a gunman opened fire on an elementary school two years ago killing 19 students and two teachers.\n\nOn the campaign trail Herrera attacked Gonzales for support for a gun safety bill after the shooting. He was censured by the Republican Party of Texas in 2023 over his support for same-sex marriage protections at the federal level and the bipartisan gun bill.\n\nIn a win for governing-minded Republicans, Texas Rep.

Greg Abbott . His critics cast him as a moderate but on border he tacked to the right in recent months - leading the charge to impeach Homeland Security Sec. Alejandro Mayorkas .\n\nHerrera had the backing of Texas U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, House Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good, R-Va., and Reps. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., Ralph Norman, R-S.C., and Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.\n\nHouse Speaker Dade Phelan bests Trump-backed challenger  David Covey\n\nAnother Texas Republican, House Speaker Dade Phelan, edged out a victory over a Trump-backed challenger.\n\nPhelan led the state effort to impeach Attorney General Ken Paxton over abuse of office last year, a move that through Texas Republicans into turmoil.\n\nPaxton was acquitted by the state senate, but the show had pitted Trump acolytes against the state party's old guard.\n\nHouse Speaker Dade Phelan, edged out a victory over a Trump-backed challenger\n\n'He's bad, bad, bad for the Republican Party and democracy. We need him beaten and beaten badly,' Trump said of Phelan in a video on Truth Social ahead of the runoff.\n\nPaxton also hit out against Phelan ahead of the vote and the rest of 'the Austin establishment.'\n\nThe runoff races turned into revenge fights for both Paxton, whose term is not up until 2027, and Abbott, who went after state lawmakers who opposed his school voucher program.\n\nAbbot secures pro-school choice majority in state House after Republicans joined Dems to tank his signature policy platform\n\nIn November the Texas House voted 84-63 to remove school choice vouchers - a top priority for Abbott - from a massive education bill. Twenty-one Republicans joined all Democrats in opposing school choice.\n\nSix of eight state House GOP incumbents who were forced into runoffs when they failed to cinch 50 percent of the primary vote in March lost their races on Tuesday, including a handful who opposed school vouchers last fall.\n\nThe conservative Club for Growth Action and affiliated Freedom spent over $4.4 million in the primary runoffs and $4 million in the primaries to target 14 anti-school choice Republicans. Ten of them have now been defeated.\n\nThe results furthered a surge of anti-establishment sentiment from March when nine state House Republicans lost their primaries.\n\nThe 15 total state House GOP incumbents who lost primaries amounted to a record - and Abbott now has a pro-school voucher majority.\n\nOne of the new pro-voucher Republicans who won a primary on Tuesday is Katrina Pierson, who served as the national spokeswoman for Trump's 2016 campaign. Abbott and Paxton celebrated her win as a victory for hardline conservatives.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

The petition was submitted with 139,456 signatures.\n\nThe rejection prompted the movement to file a case against the GOP , but it was almost immediately rejected by the state's supreme court.\n\n'Well, we did everything we could but the Supreme Court of Texas screwed us,' Texas Nationalist Movement lawyer Paul M Davis wrote on X, formerly Twitter .\n\nTexas Supreme Court has rejected a petition for an independence referendum to be on the March primary ballot from the Texas Nationalist Movement\n\nThe Republican party had rejected the petition, despite it having above the number of signatories required to add the vote to the ballot, stating many were invalid signatures. That led to a legal challenge by the Texas Nationalist Movement. The state has long had cries of independence and often references the state's Battle of the Alamo.\n\n'Didn't even want to look at the petition TNM submitted to Rinaldi to see if what we said was true. Just \"nope.\" No explanation. No nothing. This is what the Republican establishment thinks of Texians.\n\n'You don't have the right to petition your government. You're the \"wrong type\" of voter according to Matt Rinaldi. The establishment won today, but we are not going away.'\n\nRinaldi rejected the petition stating 'the vast majority of petition signatures were invalid', Newsweek reports.\n\nHe claimed some signatures were missing vital information such as addresses, dates of birth and voter registration numbers.\n\nThe Texas GOP also said the petition was 'untimely' and did not meet the threshold for the number of signatures submitted by hand.\n\nThe bid for secession is not the first and the state has long pushed an independent movement, called 'Texit' today. The independence movement started more than 150 years ago with a bid to break free from Mexican control when it was known as 'Tejas.'\n\nA bitter struggle ensued including a huge battle at the Alamo in 1836, which saw up to 260 Texians killed while unsuccessfully trying to defend it. Around 1,600 Mexicans were also wounded or killed.\n\nDespite the loss, 'Remember the Alamo' became a rallying cry for cessation, still in parlance as part of the Texit movement today.\n\nTexas has a longstanding independence movement dating back to its struggle to break free from Mexico in the early 19th century. The Battle of the Alamo became a pivotal (rendered in this painting) moment in the movement's history\n\nIn 2022, Texas Republicans wanted to hold a referendum to decide whether or not the state should secede from the U.S.\n\nThe state eventually declared independence from Mexico in the same year as the Battle of the Alamo and became known as Texas.\n\nIt was a sovereign state for nine years before it was annexed by the United States in 1845. There have been multiple secession movements since then.\n\nIn 2022, Texas Republicans stated they wanted to decide whether or not the state should secede from the U.S. at their state convention.\n\nLegally, Texas cannot secede from the union. There has been a myth that it can because of the way it was annexed but the Congressional order of annexation merely stated Texas could - at a future date - divide itself into five states. It says nothing about leaving the union.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

Chip Roy spoke to Fox News Digital about the airports at which migrants are flying in under the CHNV parole program are landing.\n\nTexas Republicans are criticizing a Biden administration parole program for four nationalities after it was revealed this week that three of the top destinations for migrants under the program are in Texas -- on top of the numbers it is already seeing coming across the border.\n\n\"It's just another layer to the entirety of what we're dealing with,\" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"But that's what people need to understand, it's a very specific program designed to flood the system, misusing parole to do it.\"\n\nFox News reported this week on how official stats show that during an eight-month period from January through August 2023, roughly 200,000 migrants flew into the U.S. via a parole program for four nationalities. Of those, the vast majority landed in Florida, but three of the top 15 destinations were in Texas -- Austin, Dallas and Houston. Over 10,000 migrants traveled to those airports in that period.\n\nDHS DOCS REVEAL WHERE PAROLED MIGRANTS UNDER CONTROVERSIAL BIDEN FLIGHT PROGRAM ARE LANDING\n\nRep. Chip Roy is unveiling a new bill aimed at allowing people to sue over COVID-19 vaccine side effects (Getty Images)\n\nThe policy was first announced for Venezuelans in October 2022, which allowed a limited number to fly or travel directly into the U.S. as long as they had not entered illegally, had a sponsor in the U.S. already, and passed certain biometric and biographical vetting. The program does not itself facilitate flights, and migrants are responsible for their own travel.\n\nIn January 2023, the administration expanded the program to include Haitians, Nicaraguans and Cubans, with up to 30,000 people per month allowed into the U.S. It allows for migrants to receive work permits and a two-year authorization to live in the U.S. and was announced alongside an expansion of Title 42 expulsions to include those nationalities. By the end of February 2024, more than 400,000 nationals have arrived under the parole program, according to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data.\n\nDHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas recently said the program is a \"safe and orderly way to reach the United States\" and has \"led to a reduction in numbers of those nationalities.\"\n\n\"It is a key element of our efforts to address the unprecedented level of migration throughout our hemisphere, and other countries around the world see it as a model to tackle the challenge of increased irregular migration that they too are experiencing,\" Mayorkas said .\n\n'ILLEGAL PROGRAM': GOVERNOR VOWS TO FIGHT BIDEN FLYING MIGRANTS INTO US\n\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has championed the program. (Candice Ward/Getty Images)\n\nDHS has said that those who enter the U.S. under the program undergo and clear a \"robust security vetting\" as well as other eligibility criteria.\n\n\"These processes are publicly available online, and DHS has been providing regular updates on their use to the public. These processes are part of the administration's strategy to combine expanded lawful pathways with stronger consequences to reduce irregular migration, and have kept hundreds of thousands of people from migrating irregularly,\" a spokesperson told Fox News Digital last month.\n\nBut Republicans have claimed the program abuses the parole limits set by Congress, which say that the authority must be used on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or for significant public benefit. It also comes amid an ongoing border crisis that the Biden administration has blamed on a lack of resources and a \"broken\" immigration system in need of reform, but that Republicans have blamed on the policies of the Biden administration.\n\n\"The invasion at our southern border has turned every American city into a border city, and the Biden administration's efforts to fly illegal aliens across the country is the reason why,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Biden's fast-track processing, and programs like their CHNV parole program, are only pushing the border crisis further into the interior of the country. Every day, our national security is being undermined more and more by the Biden administration,\" he said. \"In Texas, Houston, Dallas, and Austin have been hit especially hard by the open border, finding themselves having to support tens of thousands of illegal aliens Biden has rolled out the red carpet for.\"\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, was asked on \"The Brian Kilmeade Show\" if he thought that the program was okay.\n\n\"No,\" he said. Cornyn has previously slammed the use of parole by the administration as \"cooking the books.\"\n\nRoy told Fox that the historic crisis, which has seen more than 2.4 million migrant encounters last fiscal year at the border, is having a \"severe\" impact on the state, and he believes Texans will be angry to learn that more migrants are flying in.\n\n\"So the impact is severe,\" Roy said. \"This parole program now I think the Texans are going to go: 'Wait a minute. You mean they're flooding across the border and you're flying people directly to our airports and to our communities?' And I think that's going to just continue to elevate the frustration people feel.\"\n\nIn terms of Republicans effecting change in Washington, Roy says that with a current stalemate that he blames on Speaker Mike Johnson for giving away leverage on Ukraine funding to fix the border, it will be up to governors to act to secure the border.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 06: Sen.

So I think this is more of a reason for Texas to do what it has to do, governors to do what they have to do, because, frankly, the federal government has abandoned them,\" he said. \"This is a reason to elect Donald Trump . This is a reason to, yes, send Republicans, to the House and to the Senate. So we can at least have an actual debate about border security.\"\n\nFox News' Aubrie Spady contributed to this report.\n\nAdam Shaw is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital, primarily covering immigration and border security.\n\nHe can be reached at adam.shaw2@fox.com or on Twitter .\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper .\n\nTexas governor attributes President-elect Donald Trump's victory in part to a 'Texas problem' with illegal immigration becoming a national problem on 'Hannity.'\n\nEXCLUSIVE - Ahead of President-elect Trump's inauguration , conservatives in the most populous red state in America are launching a new Texas Republican Leadership Fund (TRLF) to elect \"true\" conservatives to crucial leadership roles.\n\nDespite being led by a strongly conservative Republican governor and having a commanding majority in the legislature, the last four Texas House speakers have been elected through the support of Democrats. The result has been Democrats exercising an outsized level of power and influence in the largest Republican state in the nation. An inside track with the Texas speaker also gives Democrats significant control over some of the most important issues affecting the nation, such as enforcement of Texas' more than 1,250 miles of border.\n\nAlex Fairly, the TRLF's principal donor, told Fox News Digital it is time for that to change.\n\nTRLF, which is officially registering with the Texas Ethics Commission Tuesday and launching with $20 million of initial funding, has the support of many of Texas' most influential leaders who are intent on making the state the definitive leader in conservative politics.\n\nELON MUSK MOVES TO MAKE STARBASE, TEXAS, THE OFFICIAL 'GATEWAY TO MARS'\n\nA Texas flag attached to a bike waves in downtown Austin with the state Capitol dome in the background. (Reuters)\n\nWhile he hopes that all Republicans in the Texas House will stand with the caucus to elect a conservative leader, Fairly said the $20 million will be available for use in the primaries and upcoming 2026 general election to hold elected officials \"accountable\" if they side with a Democratic-backed speaker.\n\nAccording to Fairly, Texas conservatives are fed up with lukewarm Republicans cutting backroom deals with Democrats in the state legislature. And as Trump prepares to return to the White House in January, he said it will be more important than ever for Texas to support the new administration's agenda through strong conservative leadership at the state level.\n\n\"Texas leads the way on many of the biggest conservative issues,\" he said. \"I don't think there's any question that having a Republican majority in the House... has a massive impact on what happens across the country and supporting President Trump and his agenda.\"\n\nThis comes amid an ongoing battle in the Texas legislature over who will be the next speaker of the House. The most recent speaker, Rep. Dade Phelan , who came to power in 2021, dropped out from consideration after facing intense criticism from Republicans for failing to pass key conservative priorities such as school choice and for his role in the unsuccessful impeachment effort against vocal Trump ally Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton .\n\nTEXAS BLOCKS SCHOOL CHOICE AS OTHER REPUBLICAN-LED STATES GO ALL-IN\n\nSpeaker Dade Phelan presides over the House, Aug. 26, 2021, in Austin, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)\n\nNow, the Texas House of Representatives is set to elect a new speaker on Jan. 14. There are two frontrunners: Phelan ally Rep. Dustin Burrows and Rep. David Cook, who is backed by more hardline conservatives.\n\nAfter going to the Democratic side of the aisle to help him secure the necessary 76 votes to win the speakership, Burrows declared the race over.\n\nHowever, Burrows' attempt to bargain with Democrats has caused outrage from many conservatives, even including Donald Trump Jr. , who said the move was not in line with voters' election night \"mandate\" to Republicans.\n\n\"It's unbelievable what is happening in Texas right now,\" he said on X. \"There is a group of so-called Republicans cutting a deal with liberal Democrats to elect a speaker instead of uniting behind the Republican nominee, @DavidCookTexas! Unbelievable! Republicans have a mandate!\"\n\nLONGTIME DEMOCRAT TEXAS JUDGE SWITCHES PARTIES IN MONUMENTAL MOVE\n\nFairly said that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott \"carried the load for most of the nation\" on the border security issue during the \"darker years\" of the Biden administration. (Shelby Tauber/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nFairly, who is an entrepreneur and health care executive who has been a vocal supporter of school choice, says the race for the speakership is not set in stone. This time, he believes there is strong resolve among Texas Republicans to stop moderates from handing over control to the Democrats.\n\n\"In spite of the progress made in this past election cycle toward... conservative priorities, there may still be work to do in the next primary cycle,\" he said. \"These funds will be available to help expand a true Republican majority.\"\n\n\"Democrats don't give their votes away for free, they want things in return,\" he went on. \"So, we end up with a House that's not really run by the majority, it's co-run by Democrats and a minority of Republicans. It just puts Texas in just such a weak position to accomplish what we could if we really were led by a majority of Republicans.\"\n\n\"This time we're bringing this out into the light.\"\n\nPeter Pinedo is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, reacts to Vice President Kamala Harris' response to migrant crime on 'The Ingraham Angle.'\n\nFIRST ON FOX: More than a dozen Texas Republicans, from the governor to members of the U.S. House, slammed Vice President Kamala Harris' planned visit to the border state Friday, telling Fox News Digital the visit is \"one of the dumbest political decisions\" they've seen.\n\n\"'Border Czar' Kamala Harris can come all the way to Houston where Jocelyn Nungaray was killed by Tren de Aragua gang members that she let into the country, yet she can't be bothered to visit Jocelyn's family or even say her name. Kamala Harris and her open border policies have allowed over 11 million illegal immigrants and dangerous criminals like TdA into our country, putting every American's life at risk,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"President Donald Trump has shown real leadership on the border, with successful border policies that decreased illegal immigration to the lowest level in decades. While Kamala Harris refuses to take real action on this crisis, Texas will continue to step up with our historic border mission until we have a partner in the White House to make America secure again.\"\n\nHarris will travel to the red state just 10 days ahead of Election Day, and she is expected to speak about the state's abortion policies after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Abortion is a hallmark of the Harris campaign, including Harris saying she supports eliminating the filibuster in an effort to pass a law restoring abortion access nationwide.\n\nHARRIS STUMBLES ON THE BORDER WHEN PRESSED ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION: 'IS A BORDER WALL STUPID?'\n\nTexas Gov.

Dan Patrick slammed Harris' trip to Texas as \"one of the dumbest political decisions I've ever seen.\"\n\n\"Kamala Harris coming to Texas for a rally is one of the dumbest political decisions I've ever seen. She and Colin Allred are not going to win in Texas. I'm glad she is spending the day in Texas instead of campaigning in a swing state with only a few days left in the election. I hope she stays longer. Donald Trump is going to be the next president because the voters are fed up with the Harris-Biden regime and the chaos they've created,\" Patrick said.\n\nHarris will be joined by Democratic Senate candidate Colin Allred, who is making a long-shot run to unseat longtime Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nCruz slammed his Senate opponent in comments to Fox Digital, saying Allred and Harris share the same \"radical policies.\"\n\n\"Colin Allred is Kamala Harris. They have spent the last four years working hand-in-hand against Texans and the American people with their radical policies, whether those be pushing to allow boys in girls' sports, allowing dangerous illegal aliens to come into our country or trying to destroy the oil and gas industry in Texas,\" Cruz said.\n\nTEXAS AG SUES BIDEN-HARRIS ADMIN FOR NOT VERIFYING CITIZENSHIP OF 450K 'POTENTIALLY INELIGIBLE' VOTERS\n\n\"Colin and Kamala share an agenda, and now they'll share a stage for all Texans to see.\"\n\n\"I'm glad she is spending the day in Texas instead of campaigning in a swing state with only a few days left in the election. I hope she stays longer.\"  - Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick\n\nAs illegal immigration spiraled in 2021, the Biden-Harris administration's first year in office, President Biden announced Harris would lead the effort to determine the \"root causes\" of immigration. The administration pointed to issues such as climate change, poverty and violence driving migrants to the U.S.\n\nThe media and Republicans dubbed Harris the \"border czar\" shortly after, with the White House rejecting the title. The moniker, however, has continued years later, including Texas Republicans this week using it to slam Harris ahead of her visit.\n\n\"Millions of migrants have illegally entered our country on Border Czar Kamala Harris' watch, so it's no surprise that she'd rather talk about anything but her abysmal track record on the border. If she can't control the border, how can she run the country? We've never had a more secure border than under President Trump, and he will put a stop to this when he takes office. Nov. 5 can't come soon enough,\" Texas Sen. John Cornyn said.\n\nOBAMA CLAIMS TRUMP 'DID NOT SOLVE' IMMIGRATION 'PROBLEM.' THE NUMBERS TELL A DIFFERENT STORY\n\nThe U.S.-Mexico border wall is seen in Sasabe, Arizona, on Dec. 8, 2023.

If she were serious, she would've acted as a legitimate 'Border Czar.' Instead, she imported over 20 million illegals into our communities where they're rewarded with government benefits, leaving U.S. citizens to be raped and murdered by violent illegal criminals,\" Rep. Ronny Jackson said.\n\n\"Harris admitted that she's pro-mass amnesty and has gone so far as to support taxpayer-funded transition surgeries for detained illegals. She is the ultimate panderer, and, if elected, will continue her open-border policies. Texans, including our incredible Latino community, do not trust her, which is why they're projected to turn out in record numbers to vote for Trump.\"\n\n'UTTER BETRAYAL': NEW REPORT REVEALS DHS OFFICIAL USED SOCIAL MEDIA TO PROMOTE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\n\nTexas politicians respond to Vice President Kamala Harris' Texas visit. (Getty Images)\n\nNineteen Texas leaders submitted comments to Fox News Digital slamming Harris' planned visit, with a handful citing girls and women who have been murdered in recent years, allegedly at the hands of illegal immigrants.\n\n\"Harris should visit Houston, but not to campaign. She should come to apologize for purposefully allowing Texas border counties to be overrun and allowing young Houstonians like Jocelyn Nungaray to be murdered by the people she allowed in,\" Rep. Dan Crenshaw said.\n\nTwelve-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray was sexually assaulted and murdered by strangulation when two illegal immigrants in their 20s allegedly lured the young girl under a bridge before killing her in June.\n\nJocelyn Nungaray, 12, was found strangled to death in a Houston creek. (Fox Houston courtesy of the Nungaray family)\n\n\"Instead of coming to Texas to ask for our votes, Kamala should be asking for our forgiveness. Especially from the family of Jocelyn Nungaray and the countless others devastated by her administration's open border policies. For four years, she has ignored Texans and the deadly crisis she has created at our southern border,\" Rep. Roger Williams said.\n\n\"Her negligence as Border Czar contributed to the tragic deaths of Americans, including Jocelyn Nungaray, who was killed by two illegal aliens from Venezuela. Young women like Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray and Rachel Morin would be alive today if Kamala Harris had taken her responsibilities seriously,\" Rep. Wesley Hunt added.\n\nHarris' event will kick off Friday evening in Houston , with reports surfacing that she will be joined by singer-songwriter Beyoncé, who is originally from Houston.\n\n\"If she wanted a secure border, why did I have to sue her administration dozens of times to force them to follow federal immigration laws?\" - Ken Paxton, Texas attorney general\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the Texas Republicans' comments on her upcoming visit. The campaign also did not respond to a request for confirmation regarding whether Beyoncé will join the rally.\n\nHarris joined a CNN town hall on Wednesday evening outside Philadelphia, where moderator Anderson Cooper pressed the vice president about her border policies, including whether she supports a border wall after calling the wall \"stupid\" when it was championed by Trump during his administration.\n\nMIGRANTS CAUGHT AT BORDER BUSED, FLOWN OUT OF SAN DIEGO IN POSSIBLE 'COVER UP' BEFORE ELECTION: OFFICIAL\n\n\"Let's talk about this compromise bill that you want to pass if you are elected . You said that's going to be a priority. It includes $650 million in funding for the border wall. That's something Republicans wanted, that was part of the compromise. Under Donald Trump, you criticized the wall more than 50 times. You called it 'stupid, useless, and a medieval vanity project.' Is a border wall stupid?\" Cooper asked Harris.\n\n\"Let's talk about Donald Trump and that border wall,\" Harris said while laughing. \"So, remember, Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it. Come on, they didn't. How much of that wall did he build? I think the last number I saw was about 2%. And then when it came time for him to do a photo op, you know where he did it? In the part of the wall that President Obama built.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris speaks as CNN moderator Anderson Cooper looks on during a town hall at Sun Center Studios in Aston, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\n\"But you agreed to a bill that would earmark $650 million to continue building that wall, \" Cooper pressed.\n\n\"I pledge that I am going to bring forward that bipartisan bill to further strengthen and secure our border. Yes, I am, and I'm going to work across the aisle to pass a comprehensive bill that deals with a broken immigration system,\" Harris responded.\n\n\"So you don't think it's stupid anymore?\" Cooper continued.\n\n\"I think what [Trump] did and how he did it was... did not make much sense because he actually didn't do much of anything. I just talked about that wall, right? We just talked about it. He didn't actually do much of anything,\" she responded.\n\n\"Young women like Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray and Rachel Morin would be alive today if Kamala Harris had taken her responsibilities seriously.\" - Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton railed against Harris in comments to Fox Digital ahead of her visit, saying she and President Biden \"intentionally dismantled every successful Trump border policy to let in as many aliens as possible\" starting on their first day in office.\n\n\"Now, Kamala wants to come to Texas and talk about border security after four years of destroying American communities. If she wanted a secure border, why did I have to sue her administration dozens of times to force them to follow federal immigration laws? We're fighting Kamala's destructive open-borders doctrine in the courts because she has unlawfully weaponized power to make our country more dangerous instead of keeping Americans safe,\" Paxton said.\n\n\"Now, Texas is fighting Kamala's obvious effort to allow noncitizens to vote illegally in American elections. We need to end the insanity, secure the border, restore the rule of law and put American citizens first again by re-electing President Trump.\"\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Caroline Harris Davila, Travis County Chair Matt Mackowiak and RPT Chair Abraham George.\n\nGeorge is taking the helm of a party that is deeply divided and relying on an increasingly smaller pool of donors - notably, a massive reliance on West Texas oil billionaires Tim Dunn and Farris Wilk, whose donations have reportedly ballooned to 25% of the party's income via $450,000 from Dunn's Hexagon Partners LTD & $350,000 from Defend Texas Liberty Pac. In April's federal filing , the RPT reported an income of $2.8 million since 2023, three quarters of what the party previously had raised in the 2019-2020 cycle.\n\nOPPOSED BY TOP TEXAS REPUBLICANS AND TRUMP, STATE HOUSE SPEAKER SURVIVES GOP PRIMARY RUNOFF CHALLENGE\n\n\"I'm not worried about it, but I think my job as the new chairman is to expand that pool to the next group of people,\" George said. \"I haven't had a chance to talk to these big donors, or any of the donors honestly, but we're going to build financial committees where we can actually have fundraising throughout the state of Texas without depending on one or two people.\"\n\n\"However, big donors are always important to the party because they can bring in a huge amount of money from just a phone call away. But I don't want us to be the party of a few individuals, but the party of grassroots.\"\n\nIn his address at the convention, Texas Senator John Cornyn called for unity, \"What we got here in Texas is too important to squander by fighting the fights of the past as opposed to looking forward to winning in November.\"\n\nWhile there is always speculation about a blue Texas, George said he does not see a threat coming from the left anytime soon.\n\nSen. John Cornyn arrives to a luncheon with Senate Republicans at the U.S. Capitol on Feb. 7, 2024. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\n\n\"I don't see a huge threat honestly,\" George countered. \"Grassroots are energized, there are more volunteers for the Republican Party than ever before. South Texas is moving towards us, we're starting to pick up seats in those areas, and we're going to be working hand in hand with the county chairs there. I think we're in a great place to start. I don't think we're going blue anytime soon, although a lot of people like to talk about it.\"\n\nSeveral local party leaders and state representatives felt similarly. Williamson County Chairwoman Michelle Taff Evans told Fox News Digital, \"The biggest threat to the Republican majority is complacency, both on the part of the elected officials and the voters. I think the RPT division is most deeply felt by those who are losing control of the party, who see the grassroots as a threat to their long-held power, and who fear populism.\"\n\nOne of the more ambitious proposals in the new RPT platform is closing primaries, thereby allowing only Republicans to vote in Republican primaries. \"I think closing primaries was one of the most important policy achievements of convention,\" George explained. \"My job now is to go ahead and secure that. We are in conversation with legal counsel and I expect that to be the major thing to happen over the next few months.\"\n\nDetractors are concerned that this could entirely surrender the RPT to the hard right-wing of the party. The moderate speaker of the Texas House, Dade Phelan, recently won a razor-thin victory against Trump-backed Dave Covey in a runoff election. Lt. Governor Dan Patrick attributed Phelan's victory to the open primary system, saying \"The only way Dade Phelan, who doubled down on appointing Democrat chairs in his recent campaign, can be re-elected Speaker is by a handful of a small minority Republicans and a huge majority of Democrats.\"\n\nThe most consequential proposal, however, comes in the form of a new constitutional amendment. The proposed amendment would require a state office holder to win a majority of Texas' countries in a proposal similar to the electoral college. Given the GOP's reliance on low-populated, but numerous, rural counties, this would make a Democratic statewide victory virtually impossible. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott carried 235 out of 254 counties in 2022 despite only winning the popular vote by +10%. Legal experts expect this to be challenged under the Voter Rights Act, although the platform also calls for the repeal of the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\"I think it's great, they have eight [policy focuses] that they're highlighting. I will be focused on school choice. I think we have a huge opportunity to get that done,\" state Rep. Caroline Harris Davila told Fox News Digital, speaking on the platform's alignment with legislative priorities. \"We want to be the top of the list for education in Texas, and whether it's public schools, great private schools, we need to make sure parents have everything they can to get their kids the best education possible.\"\n\nState Rep. Caroline Harris, R-Williamson, in the Texas House. (Caroline Harris for Texas)\n\nTENNESSEE GOVERNOR JOINS GOP TREND OF VETTING CANDIDATES ON SUPPORT FOR SCHOOL CHOICE: 'SO IMPORTANT TO ME'\n\n\"The legislative priorities haven't been published yet, but I expect it'll be about closing our borders and election integrity is going to be major for us,\" George said.\n\nNot all Republicans are optimistic about the results of the election and the direction of the party. Travis County Chair Matt Mackowiak, who ran for election against George, told Fox News Digital, \"RPT needs competent leadership for the first time in five years. I doubt we will see that. The RPT needs to unify the party, register voters for the first time in years, raise $5 million as quickly as possible, support our targeted races, and win elections. Next year they will work to advance the platform and legislative priorities.\"\n\n\"I think Republican voters are yearning for decisive action against federal incompetence with regard to the border and federal overreach with regards to our civil liberties,\" Taff Evans said.\n\n\"My advice to the next chair is to always remember that the party should serve the people, not the politicians, and always stand on principle,\" former RPT Chairman Matt Rinaldi told Fox News Digital.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Chip Roy, R-Texas, urges Republican lawmakers to stand up to President Biden to put an end to the humanitarian 'horrors' taking place.\n\nTexas Republicans on Thursday called on their House colleagues to hold up federal funding for the Department of Homeland Security until President Biden signs border security legislation.\n\nFifteen House Republicans led by Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, signed a dear colleague letter urging the House to reject further appropriations for DHS unless Biden signs a GOP-backed border security bill and removes Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas from office, among other demands.\n\n\"The State of Texas is bearing the brunt of a national crisis at our southern border directly resulting from the unlawful and irresponsible actions of President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\n\"Governor Abbott has been forced to use Texas' limited resources to do at least part of the job the federal government refuses,\" the letter states. \"Rather than reimburse Texas for its efforts, which benefit all Americans, the Biden administration has filed suit against our state citing 'humanitarian concerns,' purposefully ignoring the humanitarian crisis of its own making.\"\n\nBORDER PATROL UNION RIPS REP.

(Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\n\nThe letter acknowledges several GOP-led attempts to secure the border and hold the Biden administration accountable for the migrant crisis. In May, House Republicans passed H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act, which hawkish immigration groups praised as a \"forceful and serious\" response to the ongoing crisis at the southern border. Republicans have also berated Mayorkas at committee hearings where he was called to testify.\n\nHowever, the Texas lawmakers wrote these efforts are \"nothing more than political theater\" if Congress is unwilling to use the power of the purse to leverage changes from the White House.\n\nBIDEN DISPATCHES TOP AIDE TO MEET WITH NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS AS MIGRANT CRISIS REACHES BOILING POINT: REPORT\n\nU.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas testifies before a House Appropriations Subcommittee on April 27, 2022 in Washington, D.C.

While the GOP's immigration and deficit hardliners welcome that fight, moderate lawmakers and Republican leadership may hesitate to threaten a government shutdown with next year's election looming.\n\nGOP LAWMAKERS FILE AMICUS BRIEF BACKING TEXAS AGAINST DOJ LAWSUIT OVER BORDER BARRIER\n\nA looming Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government sets up yet another confrontation between President Biden, left, and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.

He shared a story about a migrant girl who was held for ransom in a stash house in Fort Worth, Texas, and was threatened to be raped by the cartels.\n\n\"I would just ask every one of my Republican colleagues, is it not enough to stand up for that one little girl? To go tell the president, 'no, you're not going to get a taxdollar to fund the Department of Homeland Security that's allowing that to occur on our watch,'\" Roy said. \"That's what we're saying.\"\n\nThe letter was co-signed by Texas Republican Reps.

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, torpedo the president's border policies on 'Hannity.'\n\nThe Associated Press projects that Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan will survive a Republican primary runoff election challenge by David Covey.\n\nPhelan's victory in a state House district east of Houston is seen as a political setback for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and former President Donald Trump, and to a lesser degree for Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nPhelan oversaw the effort last year to impeach Paxton over corruption charges. Paxton was acquitted by the state Senate after the House overwhelmingly impeached the controversial attorney general.\n\nCONTROVERSIAL MOVE: ABBOTT PARDONS ARMY SERGEANT WHO KILLED BLM PROTESTER\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton, left, and Gov.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)\n\nIn response, Paxton targeted over 30 GOP incumbent state representatives, with Phelan at the top of the list. Paxton's most powerful ally, Trump, endorsed Covey.\n\nMeanwhile, Abbott was looking for payback over the downing in the state House last year of his education plan that would have opened the spigot for taxpayer funding of private schools. The school voucher measure, which was Abbott's top legislative item last year, passed the state Senate, but its downing in the state House was a rare political setback for the three-term governor.\n\nHEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS 2024 PRIMARY ELECTION RESULTS\n\nNine GOP state House lawmakers went down to defeat in the state's March primary, with eight more forced into runoffs.

(AP Photo/LM Otero)\n\n\"It's a power play and definitely a battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party of Texas and Gov. Abbott wants to get legislators in there who will support his agenda,\" veteran Texas-based Republican strategist Brendan Steinhauser told Fox News last week.\n\n\"For Ken Paxton and [Lt. Gov.] Dan Patrick and Donald Trump by proxy, for them, it is definitely trying to take out the person who led the impeachment against Ken Paxton and who stood in the way of Dan Patrick's agenda in the Senate. All those factors together make a really powerful force for the Speaker to overcome,\" he emphasized.\n\nTexas Speaker of the House Dade Phelan, R-Beaumont, oversees the House Chamber during a vote, Wednesday, May 5, 2021, in Austin, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)\n\nAbbott, in a statement Tuesday night, acknowledged that \"we did not win every race we fought in,\" but touted that \"The Texas Legislature now has enough votes to pass school choice.\"\n\nThe Phelan-Covey race was also seen as a proxy battle for the future of the GOP in Texas.\n\nPhelan was backed by old guard Republicans - including former Gov. Rick Perry - and conservative-leaning business leaders who helped bring the GOP to power in Texas in the 1980s and 1990s. Covey enjoyed the support of Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, Paxton and Trump, but also far-right activists who place more of an emphasis on social and cultural issues.\n\nIf Phelan had lost, he would have become the first Texas House speaker to be ousted in a primary in over a half century.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

August Pfluger, Pat Fallon, Jody Arrington, Chip Roy and Tony Gonzales, say in a letter to Biden.\n\nThe crisis that saw more than 1.7 million migrant encounters in FY 2021 and more than 2.3 million in FY 2022 has shown signs of eclipsing those numbers in FY 2023. January saw more than 250,000 migrant encounters alone, the highest month on record.\n\nWhile the Biden administration has pointed to a hemisphere-wide challenge and pursued a strategy that involves tackling \"root causes,\" cracking down on smuggling and expanding legal pathways, Republicans have blamed the administration's rollback of Trump-era border protections for the crisis.\n\nOVER QUARTER OF A MILLION MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS IN DECEMBER ALONE, CBP CONFIRMS\n\nUS President Joe Biden speaks with a member of the US Border Patrol as they walk along the US-Mexico border fence in El Paso, Texas, on January 8, 2023. (JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Image)\n\nThe delegation's letter says the crisis was brought upon \"by your administration's failed policies.\"\n\nIn response to the crisis, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott launched Operation Lone Star in 2021, which involved surging resources to the border, busing migrants to \"sanctuary\" cities and constructing its own version of the border wall after the Biden administration canceled construction of the Trump-era barrier.\n\nAbbott's office says that has led to more than 23,000 arrests and the busing of more than 16,000 migrants to New York City, Washington D.C., Chicago and Philadelphia. Abbott himself presented a letter to Biden during the latter's recent trip to El Paso, Texas.\n\nGOP Letter to POTUS on Operation Lone Star by Adam Shaw on Scribd\n\nBoth Abbott and the House lawmakers have accused the federal government of not doing enough to secure the border, leaving Texas to fend for itself -- noting also the national security threats posed at the border, including dozens of people on the terror watch list stopped by Border Patrol.\n\n\"Ranchers throughout west Texas routinely find bodies of dead migrants, or have their private property destroyed,\" the delegation writes. \"Drugs flowing across our border have led to a record-number of American lives being ruined by poisonings from synthetic drugs, such as fentanyl. Small localities along the border are suffering from the federal government's failures. These towns should not be forced to reallocate their already exhausted resources to secure their communities.\"\n\nBIDEN BLAMES GOP FOR SCORING 'POLITICAL POINTS' ON IMMIGRATION, AS BORDER NUMBERS HIT NEW HIGH\n\nThe lawmakers urge Biden to \"work with the Texas Delegation to pay Texas back for the resources expended through Operation Lone Star\" and to work with the delegation to stop the migrant flow across the border. They also request a meeting \"to discuss the border crisis and the solutions proposed by Members of the Texas Delegation to put an end to this crisis.\"\n\n\"Texans are united in condemning the Biden Administration's border crisis along our border that is ravaging our state and putting the safety of every American at risk,\" Rep. Pfluger said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Securing the border is a federal responsibility, and the State of Texas deserves to be reimbursed for the resources spent securing the border through Operation Lonestar. The President should also meet with the Texas Republican Congressional delegation to hear the real security threats and heartbreaking stories we hear from our constituents nearly every day.\"\n\nTOP HOMELAND REPUBLICAN BLASTS 'AFTER DARK' BORDER NUMBERS RELEASE, PROMISES 'TIDES ARE CHANGING'\n\nThe pressure from the Texas delegation is the latest in a broad push in the House to ramp up pressure on the administration over the crisis. Having taken control of the chamber, Republicans have promised to pass laws to end the crisis, and to hold hearings on the matter -- including at the border itself.\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, has looked to increase pressure on Congress to pass a sweeping immigration reform bill introduced two years ago on Biden's first day in office. That bill, which includes greater legal pathways for migration as well as a pathway to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants, has yet to pick up any Republican support.\n\n\"I'll continue to call on Congress to act to pass comprehensive immigration reform to fix the system,\" he said to the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Friday, before putting Republican opposition to the bill down to political expediency.\n\n\"So, we have a choice: They can keep using immigration to try to score political points, or we can help solve the problem.  Immigration reform used to be a bipartisan issue.  And we can make it that again, in my view,\" he said.\n\nAdam Shaw is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital, primarily covering immigration and border security.\n\nHe can be reached at adam.shaw2@fox.com or on Twitter .\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

The censure resolution cites Gonzales' votes in favor of the Respect for Marriage Act , which established federal protections for same-sex and interracial marriage and repealed the 1994 Defense of Marriage Act. President Biden signed the legislation into law in December.\n\nThe Medina County GOP said Gonzales' votes violated the Texas Republican Party's sixth core principle, which seeks to preserve \"self-sufficient families, founded on the traditional marriage of a natural man and a natural woman.\"\n\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS RENEW PUSH TO REIMBURSE TEXAS FOR 'OPERATION LONE STAR' BORDER SECURITY PUSH\n\nIf the censure resolution passes then Rep. Tony Gonzales, a two-term lawmaker, could lose the official backing of the state Republican Party in his next bid for re-election and face other disciplinary action. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\n\nThe resolution also calls out Gonzales for voting against the House GOP rules package, for failing to support border security legislation that is backed by every other Texas representative, and for voting in favor of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act - a bipartisan gun control law that was written in response to the mass shootings in Uvalde, which is in Gonzales' district, and in Buffalo, New York.\n\nMedina County Republicans said Gonzales \"has been a poor representative for his Republican constituents.\"\n\nGonzales' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThree-fifths of the State Republican Executive Committee must vote in favor of the resolution to censure Gonzales. If the resolution passes, Gonzales could face disciplinary action ranging from lifting the restriction on state GOP officials campaigning against him to cutting off financial support for his next re-election campaign, according to party rules .\n\nChris Pandolfo is a breaking news reporter for Fox News Digital.

Chip Roy, R-Texas, sounds off on the dangers of Biden's border policies on Varney & Co.\n\nMore than a dozen House Republicans from Texas have joined Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, in a call for lawmakers to stop funding for the Department of Homeland Security until a number of steps are taken \"to secure the border,\" as numbers once again increase at the border.\n\n\"Simply put, no member of Congress should agree to fund a federal agency at war with his state and people,\" the fiery letter to colleagues says. \"We have a moral obligation to protect our states, our nation, and, importantly, the migrant children getting abused from the disaster transpiring at our southern border.\"\n\n\"No border security, no funding.\"\n\nThe letter claims that Texas \"is bearing the brunt of a national crisis at our southern border directly resulting from the unlawful and irresponsible actions of President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas.\"\n\nCHIP ROY EXPLODES WITH ANGER OVER BORDER CRISIS UNDER BIDEN: 'CAN GO STRAIGHT TO HELL'\n\nRep.

Most recently the state set up a floating border barrier in the Rio Grande, which was immediately hit by a lawsuit from the Justice Department.\n\nBORDER PATROL SECTORS NEAR OR OVER CAPACITY AS MIGRANT NUMBERS SURGE AT THE BORDER\n\nThe lawmakers note the House's passage of a sweeping border security and asylum reform bill passed by the Republican majority earlier this year, but they say the legislation \"amounts to nothing more than political theater if we are unwilling to use the strongest tool granted to us by the founders - the power of the purse - to force the change necessary to protect Texas and secure the border.\n\nThe chamber is in recess but will need to pass a continuing resolution or appropriations measure before funding runs out at the end of September. The lawmakers say that there should be no appropriations for DHS until a number of steps are taken, including the signing into law by President Biden of HR 2, additional policies to allow law enforcement to target cartels, the removal of DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and a $10 billion reimbursement of Texas for its own border security efforts.\n\nRoy had made those calls earlier this week after images emerged, reported by Fox News, of armed men crossing into Texas.\n\nRoy called on Republicans to act and \"stop funding\" a \"government that is at war with the people of Texas.\"\n\n\"We are not going to fund the government that is perpetuating the lawlessness, empowering cartels, allowing fentanyl to kill Americans, and allowing little girls to get raped in stash houses in Texas. Enough! This is our fight, and I'm tired of Republicans who are giving lip service to it and for years have been supporting it because they want cheap labor.\"\n\nThe letter came on the same day as the Biden administration sent a new supplemental funding request, which included $4 billion for border and migration funding.\n\n\"As it relates to the border, the supplemental funding request represents the resource requirements DHS believes are essential to manage the border through the end of the calendar year. Border dynamics are fluid, and the Administration will continue to communicate with Congress as conditions evolve.\n\nBIDEN ADMIN MAKING MOVES AT BORDER AMID LOOMING MIGRANT TRAFFIC SHIFTS, INCREASES\n\nAugust 10, 2023: Migrants encountered at the southern border near Fronton Texas.

Mayorkas has rejected that narrative, instead calling on Congress to approve more funding and to pass legislation to fix a \"broken system.\" He had also pointed to a drop in numbers in June as a sign that recent policies are working.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Our approach to managing the borders securely and humanely, even within our fundamentally broken immigration system, is working,\" Mayorkas told lawmakers last month.\n\n\"Under President Biden's leadership, we have led the largest expansion of lawful, safe and orderly pathways for people to seek humanitarian relief under our laws. At the same time, imposing tougher consequences on those who instead resort to the ruthless smuggling organizations that prey on the most vulnerable.\"\n\nHowever, recently there have been signs that numbers have been going back up, with agents encountering around 6,000 migrants a day this week.\n\nFox News' Elizabeth Heckman and Brandon Gillespie contributed to this report.\n\nAdam Shaw is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital, primarily covering immigration and border security.\n\nHe can be reached at adam.shaw2@fox.com or on Twitter .\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.
