      "text": "LGBTQ rights: Where Trump and Vance stand\n\nFollowing Donald Trump's landslide victory in the 2024 presidential election , many people may be looking to his campaign speeches to understand his position on major issues such as LGBTQ rights.\n\nThe Republican Party's electoral promises in this area include cutting existing federal funding for gender-affirming care and restricting transgender students' participation in sports.\n\nYet as a legal scholar who has written extensively on the history of LGBTQ rights , I have seen that the clearest indication of how a politician will act once in office is not what they promise on the campaign trail. Instead, it is what they have done in the past.\n\nLet's examine the records of Trump and the vice president-elect, U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio .\n\nTrump and Vance are both relatively new to politics, so their records on LGBTQ rights issues are slim. That said, they have both done enough to qualify them as opponents of LGBTQ rights.\n\nTrump enacted two policies restricting LGBTQ rights early in his one term in office. The first was his 2017 executive order Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty , which reinforced that federal law must respect conscience-based objections to comply with the First Amendment. This order indirectly imperiled LGBTQ rights because many LGBTQ rights battles are fought over whether conservative Christian businesses run afoul of anti-discrimination laws when they refuse to serve same-sex couples .\n\nA few months later, Trump banned transgender individuals from serving in the U.S. armed forces . He ultimately revoked the directive , implementing instead a new policy that allowed existing transgender soldiers to remain in the military but barred new transgender recruits from enlisting.\n\nTrump's judicial appointments during his first term also indirectly affect LGBTQ rights. Of the 234 judges he appointed to the bench between 2017 and 2020, 40% had \"a demonstrable record of anti-LGBTQ bias,\" according to a January 2021 analysis by the legal advocacy group Lambda Legal .\n\nAll these judges, including the three conservative justices Trump added to the U.S. Supreme Court, have lifetime appointments.\n\nVance, a one-term senator, has spent much of his short time in office trying to roll back the rights of transgender Americans.\n\nBetween 2023 and 2024, Vance introduced or sponsored five bills opposing trans rights. One seeks to restrict gender-affirming care for minors by imposing criminal sanctions on doctors who perform such surgeries; another aims to do the same by exposing physicians to civil liability for either prescribing gender affirming hormones or performing surgeries.\n\nAnother Vance bill would expand health care workers' ability to make conscience-based objections to transgender rights . One more would amend Title IX, which prohibits discrimination based on sex in education, to limit transgender student participation in athletics .\n\nVance has also tried to pass legislation that would stop the Department of State from issuing passports with an unspecified \"X\" gender designation , a policy that launched in 2021. Gender-neutral passports allow transgender, intersex and nonbinary individuals to carry identity documents that reflect their gender identity and avoid what can be significant problems getting through airport security with misgendered IDs.\n\nCongress has not voted on any of these proposals. That may change in the next Congress, when Republicans will control the Senate .\n\nThe records of Trump and Vance strongly suggest that they will work to fulfill their campaign pledges to roll back LGBTQ rights, especially transgender rights.\n\nAt rallies, Trump regularly made false claims like , \"Your kid goes to school and comes home a few days later with an operation,\" changing their sex. Vance made similarly untrue allegations , chief among them that teenagers claim to be transgender to be more competitive in college admissions.\n\nTrump promised that if he was elected he would cut federal funds for public schools that \" push ... gender ideology \" and \" keep men out of women's sports .\" He also pledged to limit access to gender affirming care for transgender youth .\n\nOn this topic, at least, I trust that the candidates mean what they say.\n\nNotably, neither politician seems focused on ending marriage equality.\n\nIndeed, early in the race, Trump urged the Republican Party to soften its opposition to same-sex marriage in its policy platform . That move was likely linked to the fact that, although many social conservatives oppose marriage equality, about two-thirds of Americans support marriage equality .\n\nIt is possible that the Supreme Court, with its Trump-appointed conservative majority, could overturn Obergefell v. Hodges , the 2015 decision that declared same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional. Justice Clarence Thomas has signaled he is open to revisiting the marriage rights case, including in his concurrence to the 2021 ruling that ended federal abortion protection in the U.S., Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization .\n\nCurrently, there are no cases pending in lower courts that directly challenge Obergefell. Any case initiated soon could make its way to the Supreme Court in a few years.\n\nOver two dozen states still have same-sex marriage bans on the books . They have been unenforceable since 2015, but if the court were to overturn Obergefell, many would come back into effect.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect the results of the 2024 election. It was originally published on Oct. 24, 2024.\n\nMarie-Amelie George , Associate Professor of Law, Wake Forest University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "'Buffoonery': Far-right Florida AG suing Target over LGBTQ Pride mechanidise\n\nIn 2023, Target's Pride Collection became the subject of an intense legal battle between Republicans and Democrats. Seven GOP state attorneys general sent Target a letter attacking the merchandise as \"obscene,\" claiming the company featured \"anti-Christian\" designs on t-shirts. But 15 state attorneys general, in a letter to Target CEO Brian Cornell , vowed to stand up for the retail chain and its gay-themed merchandise.\n\nThe letter read , \"As Attorneys General with a strong commitment to protecting the civil rights of LGBTQIA+ individuals, we write to express our resolute and unequivocal support for the LGBTQIA+ community as well as our concern regarding recent events in Target stores involving intimidation and destruction of certain Pride-related merchandise and Target's resulting decision to remove some Pride merchandise from its stores.\"\n\nNow, in 2025, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier is attacking Target's Pride Collection in a new lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit, according to Miami New Times reporter Alex DeLuca , accuses Target of \"defrauding investors\" with the merchandise and accuses the company of \"not properly disclosing to investors the risk\" of \"offensive\" products.\n\n\"In a 163-page lawsuit filed in federal court last week,\" DeLuca explains , \"the (Florida) State Board of Administration, which manages Florida's pension fund and other investments, alleges that Target - which it describes as the 'self-proclaimed store of the boomer mom who drives a minivan and lives in the suburbs' - 'betrayed' its core customer base of 'working families and investors' by 'making false and misleading statements about Target's Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates that led to its disastrous 2023 children-and-family themed LGBT-Pride campaign.\"\n\nAttorney Ari Cohn, lead counsel for tech policy at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), is a scathing critic of Uthmeier's lawsuit.\n\nIn a February 20 thread on X , formerly Twitter, Cohn wrote, \"This is asinine, performative buffoonery and an attack on the First Amendment Uthmeier has a problem with products (described in my article linked downthread) based on the messages they convey - all of which are First Amendment-protected, and none of which 'sexualize children.'\"\n\nCohn also tweeted , \"It's beyond question that these expressive items are protected, as is Target's decision to sell them. That Florida's retirement fund holds shares of Target is irrelevant and meaningless. Government does not gain the power to regulate speech because it's a shareholder.\"\n\nRead the full Miami New Times article at this link ."

Nancy Mace (R-SC) has been one of the most outspoken lawmakers after Sarah McBride - who became the first openly transgender person elected to Congress - secured her win earlier this month.\n\nMace's and other GOP lawmakers' complaints resulted in Speaker Mike Johnson announcing that \"single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House office buildings would be available only to those of that biological sex,\" according to the New York Times.\n\nIn an op-ed published by MSNBC, independent journalist Brad Polumbo called out Mace's recent about-face on LGBTQ issues.\n\n\"I, for one, am surprised to see Mace launching this culture war crusade,\" Polumbo writes, \"because when I interviewed her in 2021, shortly after she took office, she framed herself as a pro-LGBT, social moderate.\"\n\n\"I strongly support LGBTQ rights and equality,\" the South Carolina congresswoman told Polumno. \"No one should be discriminated against. I have friends and family that identify as LGBTQ. Understanding how they feel and how they've been treated is important.

There is nothing the Radical Left can do to stop me from protecting women and girls.\"\n\nThe journalist emphasizes, \"But 'protecting women and girls' is not what Mace is actually doing, and it's not just the 'Radical Left' that disagrees with her stand: Many moderate right-of-center Americans like myself also find her grandstanding disappointing, because there's no actual 'safety' issue being addressed here.\"\n\nPolumbo's full column is available at this link."

      "text": "Florida library dumps hundreds of books about LGBTQ issues and gender in the trash\n\nThe latest casualty of Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis' culture war was on display in the dumpster outside the New College of Florida's library this week.\n\nSarasota Herald-Tribune reporter Steven Walker reported that there were hundreds of books pertaining to LGBTQ+ issues and gender studies being loaded into dump trucks on Tuesday. According to Walker, some of the books being thrown away included titles like \"Nine and Counting: The Women of the Senate\", \"The War of the Worlds\" and \"When I Knew\" - which he described as  \"a collection of stories from LGBTQ+ people recounting when they knew they were gay.\"\n\nPreviously, students were able to purchase books from the school if the library was planning on getting rid of some of its inventory. It wasn't immediately made clear why students weren't offered the chance to buy the library's books prior to them being taken to a landfill.\n\n21 year-old fourth-year student Natalia Benavites told the Herald-Tribune that books being throw away had a \"discard\" label on their spines. Florida state statute currently forbids the college from donating any books to the public that were purchased with taxpayer dollars. Additionally, the college was throwing away books from its now-shuttered Gender and Diversity Center, even though Walker reported that those books were not bought with public funds.\n\nAs a public college in the Sunshine State, the New College of Florida is subject to DeSantis' 2023 ban on public schools in Florida spending money on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programming. At last month's Republican National Convention, DeSantis bragged about his anti-DEI record during his two terms as Florida's chief executive and railed against President Joe Biden's administration for \"impos[ing] gender ideology on everyone from our infantry men to kindergarteners.\"\n\n\"They stand for DEI, which really means 'division, exclusion and indoctrination' and it is wrong,\" he said.\n\nDeSantis singled out the New College - which was previously known as a progressive \"community of free thinkers\" - as a target to be restructured as a conservative institution, according to a 2023 report in the New York Times. The two-term Florida governor replaced six of the school's 13 trustees with far-right allies, who then ousted the school's president and installed a career politician who was paid a salary more than twice that of his predecessor.\n\nAccording to the Times , DeSantis sought to remake the New College more in the vein of the Michigan-based Hillsdale College (a far-right institution on the vanguard of anti-LGBTQ politics). This initiative came after he signed controversial bills into law banning curriculum educating students in K-12 schools about LGBTQ+ issues, which were known as the \"Don't Say Gay\" law and the \"Stop WOKE Act.\"\n\n\"You knew it would eventually spiral to higher education,\" second-year New College student Sam Sharf told the Times . \"But I didn't anticipate it would happen this fast.\""

      "text": "LGBTQ rights: Where do Harris and Trump stand?\n\nPolls show that LGBTQ rights will likely factor into most Americans' pick for president this November as they choose between former Republican President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris , a Democrat.\n\nA March 2024 survey by independent pollster PRRI found that 68% of voters will take LGBTQ rights into consideration at the polls. Fully 30% stated that they would vote only for a candidate who shares their views on the issue.\n\nIt is no coincidence, then, that LGBTQ rights issues feature prominently in the party platforms.\n\nThe Republican Party's electoral promises include cutting existing federal funding for gender-affirming care and restricting transgender students' participation in sports. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party platform proposes to outlaw discrimination against LGBTQ people, including passing the Equality Act , which would prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in housing, health care and public accommodations.\n\nAs a legal scholar who has written extensively on the history of LGBTQ rights , I have seen that the clearest indication of how a politician will act once in office is not what they promise on the campaign trail. Instead, it's what they have done in the past.\n\nLet's examine their records.\n\nTrump and his running mate, U.S. Sen.

Gender-neutral passports allow transgender, intersex and nonbinary individuals to carry identity documents that reflect their gender identity and avoid what can be significant problems getting through airport security with misgendered IDs.\n\nCongress has not voted on any of these proposals.\n\nHarris and her vice presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have both made LGBTQ rights a legislative priority throughout their long political careers.\n\nHarris initially took public office in 2003 as San Francisco's district attorney. In that role, she established a hate crimes unit that prosecuted violence against LGBTQ youth in schools . She also trained prosecutors nationwide to counter the \"gay panic\" and \"trans panic\" defenses in court, which is when lawyers attempt to justify violence as a fear-based reaction to the victim's sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nHarris was elected California's attorney general in 2011 and declined to defend the state's ban on same-sex marriage when opponents challenged the law's constitutionality before the U.S. Supreme Court. She also joined amicus briefs supporting transgender bathroom access after North Carolina barred transgender people from using bathrooms that did not match the gender on their ID.\n\nHarris, however, did not unequivocally champion LGBTQ rights. In 2015, she opposed two prisoners' request for urgent gender-confirmation surgery . She has since called for a \" better understanding \" of transgender health needs.\n\nAs a U.S. senator from 2017 to 2021, Harris sponsored bills proposing to better address distinct LGBTQ issues in health care and the criminal justice system . She also sponsored five Senate bills to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment , housing and public accommodations . Other bills she sponsored focused on LGBTQ youth, aiming to prohibit discrimination in child welfare programs and barring federal funds from supporting so-called conversion therapy of LGBTQ teens .\n\nThe Senate did not vote on any of these bills.\n\nAs vice president, Harris has been part of what advocates describe as the most pro-LGBTQ administration in U.S. history .\n\nSince 2021, President Joe Biden has issued multiple executive orders to combat discrimination against the LGBTQ community , including by eliminating the Trump-era restrictions on transgender military service. Biden also signed into law the Respect for Marriage Act , which changed the federal definition of marriage from \"a man and a woman\" to \"two individuals.\" The statute ensures that the federal government would continue to recognize same-sex unions if the Supreme Court ever reversed its decision to legalize marriage equality.\n\nHarris' vice-presidential pick has a similarly extensive record backing LGBTQ rights.\n\nAs a U.S. representative from 2007 to 2019, Walz supported efforts to grant federal benefits to same-sex couples before marriage equality became federal law. He also co-sponsored many of the House versions of the same bills as Harris.\n\nAs Minnesota's governor, Walz has issued several executive orders promoting LGBTQ inclusion and equity and banned conversion therapy for minors . He also declared Minnesota as a \"trans refuge state\" that will not enforce laws interfering with children's access to gender-affirming care.\n\nIf elected, Trump has promised to cut federal funds for public schools that \" push ... gender ideology \" and \" keep men out of women's sports .\" Harris pledges to \" defend the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride .\"\n\nAs citizens head to the polls in November, they can be confident that, on this topic at least, the candidates mean what they say.\n\nMarie-Amelie George , Associate Professor of Law, Wake Forest University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "LGBTQ+ people relive old traumas as they age on their own\n\nBill Hall, 71, has been fighting for his life for 38 years. These days, he's feeling worn out.\n\nHall contracted HIV, the virus that can cause AIDS, in 1986. Since then, he's battled depression, heart disease, diabetes, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, kidney cancer, and prostate cancer. This past year, Hall has been hospitalized five times with dangerous infections and life-threatening internal bleeding.\n\nBut that's only part of what Hall, a gay man, has dealt with. Hall was born into the Tlingit tribe in a small fishing village in Alaska. He was separated from his family at age 9 and sent to a government boarding school. There, he told me, he endured years of bullying and sexual abuse that \"killed my spirit.\"\n\nBecause of the trauma, Hall said, he's never been able to form an intimate relationship. He contracted HIV from anonymous sex at bath houses he used to visit. He lives alone in Seattle and has been on his own throughout his adult life.\n\n\"It's really difficult to maintain a positive attitude when you're going through so much,\" said Hall, who works with Native American community organizations. \"You become mentally exhausted.\"\n\nIt's a sentiment shared by many older LGBTQ+ adults - most of whom, like Hall, are trying to manage on their own.\n\nOf the 3 million Americans over age 50 who identify as gay, bisexual, or transgender, about twice as many are single and living alone when compared with their heterosexual counterparts, according to the National Resource Center on LGBTQ+ Aging.\n\nThis slice of the older population is expanding rapidly. By 2030, the number of LGBTQ+ seniors is expected to double. Many won't have partners and most won't have children or grandchildren to help care for them, AARP research indicates.\n\nThey face a daunting array of problems, including higher-than-usual rates of anxiety and depression, chronic stress, disability, and chronic illnesses such as heart disease, according to numerous research studies. High rates of smoking, alcohol use, and drug use - all ways people try to cope with stress - contribute to poor health.\n\nKeep in mind, this generation grew up at a time when every state outlawed same-sex relations and when the American Psychiatric Association identified homosexuality as a psychiatric disorder. Many were rejected by their families and their churches when they came out. Then, they endured the horrifying impact of the AIDS crisis.\n\n\"Dozens of people were dying every day,\" Hall said. \"Your life becomes going to support groups, going to visit friends in the hospital, going to funerals.\"\n\nIt's no wonder that LGBTQ+ seniors often withdraw socially and experience isolation more commonly than other older adults. \"There was too much grief, too much anger, too much trauma - too many people were dying,\" said Vincent Crisostomo, director of aging services for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. \"It was just too much to bear.\"\n\nIn an AARP survey of 2,200 LGBTQ+ adults 45 or older this year, 48% said they felt isolated from others and 45% reported lacking companionship. Almost 80% reported being concerned about having adequate social support as they grow older.\n\nEmbracing aging isn't easy for anyone, but it can be especially difficult for LGBTQ+ seniors who are long-term HIV survivors like Hall.\n\nOf 1.2 million people living with HIV in the United States, about half are over age 50. By 2030, that's estimated to rise to 70%.\n\nChristopher Christensen, 72, of Palm Springs, California, has been HIV-positive since May 1981 and is deeply involved with local organizations serving HIV survivors. \"A lot of people living with HIV never thought they'd grow old - or planned for it - because they thought they would die quickly,\" Christensen said.\n\nJeff Berry is executive director of the Reunion Project , an alliance of long-term HIV survivors. \"Here people are who survived the AIDS epidemic, and all these years later their health issues are getting worse and they're losing their peers again,\" Berry said. \"And it's triggering this post-traumatic stress that's been underlying for many, many years. Yes, it's part of getting older. But it's very, very hard.\"\n\nBeing on their own, without people who understand how the past is informing current challenges, can magnify those difficulties.\n\n\"Not having access to supports and services that are both LGBTQ-friendly and age-friendly is a real hardship for many,\" said Christina DaCosta, chief experience officer at SAGE , the nation's largest and oldest organization for older LGBTQ+ adults.\n\nDiedra Nottingham, a 74-year-old gay woman, lives alone in a one-bedroom apartment in Stonewall House, an LGBTQ+-friendly elder housing complex in New York City. \"I just don't trust people,\" she said. \"And I don't want to get hurt, either, by the way people attack gay people.\"\n\nWhen I first spoke to Nottingham in 2022, she described a post-traumatic-stress-type reaction to so many people dying of covid-19 and the fear of becoming infected. This was a common reaction among older people who are gay, bisexual, or transgender and who bear psychological scars from the AIDS epidemic.\n\nNottingham was kicked out of her house by her mother at age 14 and spent the next four years on the streets. The only sibling she talks with regularly lives across the country in Seattle. Four partners whom she'd remained close with died in short order in 1999 and 2000, and her last partner passed away in 2003.\n\nWhen I talked to her in September, Nottingham said she was benefiting from weekly therapy sessions and time spent with a volunteer \"friendly visitor\" arranged by SAGE. Yet she acknowledged: \"I don't like being by myself all the time the way I am. I'm lonely.\"\n\nDonald Bell, a 74-year-old gay Black man who is co-chair of the Illinois Commission on LGBTQ Aging, lives alone in a studio apartment in subsidized LGBTQ+-friendly senior housing in Chicago. He spent 30 years caring for two elderly parents who had serious health issues, while he was also a single father, raising two sons he adopted from a niece.\n\nBell has very little money, he said, because he left work as a higher-education administrator to care for his parents. \"The cost of health care bankrupted us,\" he said. (According to SAGE, one-third of older LGBTQ+ adults live at or below 200% of the federal poverty level.) He has hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and nerve damage in his feet. These days, he walks with a cane.\n\nTo his great regret, Bell told me, he's never had a long-term relationship. But he has several good friends in his building and in the city.\n\n\"Of course I experience loneliness,\" Bell said when we spoke in June. \"But the fact that I am a Black man who has lived to 74, that I have not been destroyed, that I have the sanctity of my own life and my own person is a victory and something for which I am grateful.\"\n\nNow he wants to be a model to younger gay men and accept aging rather than feeling stuck in the past. \"My past is over,\" Bell said, \"and I must move on.\"\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF-an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

      "text": "The role of LGBTQ voters in the election shows a path for Democrats' future\n\nThere have been many post-mortems looking at how certain minority groups voted-and how they supposedly shifted their vote-but there's been very little written about one particular minority group: LGBTQ voters.\n\nAnd yet, in context, LGBTQ voters displayed the kind of influence as a bloc that politicians should be paying attention to moving forward.\n\nI suspect part of the reason they've not been focused on is because these voters don't fit an overwhelming corporate media narrative that positions Donald Trump as having broadened and diversified his coalition-because LGBTQ people actually went the other way.\n\nAccording to the NBC News Exit Poll , LGBTQ people doubled their share of the electorate, from 4% in 2020 to 8% in 2024, which is nothing to sneeze at. (Researchers have shown the percentage of the LGBTQ population appears to be roughly equal in all of the states.) And 86% of LGBTQ people voted for Kamala Harris-well over 10 million voters-a big increase from the 71% who voted for Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nDonald Trump saw a sharp decline in support from LGBTQ voters, from 25% in 2020 to just 14% in 2024.\n\nIt's true that national exit polls should often be taken with a grain of salt. Sample sizes of minorities are often small. Sometimes other polling of specific groups contradicts the national exit polls' results.\n\nFor example, Matt Barreto of BPS Research told Axios that the exit polls showing a majority of Latino men voted for Trump-somewhere in the 52% to 54% range-were wrong. He said his polling found 56% of Latino men supported Harris , explaining that his polling is more accurate because he had a larger sample size and it was conducted in multiple languages.\n\nStill, his result was less than the 59% that the national exit polls reported Joe Biden winning Latino men by in 2020. So, there was some movement, just not as much as the corporate media suggests. There's also a lot of discrepancy, depending on which exit poll you look at, about Black male voters and whether they moved slightly toward Trump or not at all.\n\nBut regarding LGBTQ voters, the shift in the national exit polling is big enough-and the growth in the percentage of the electorate is large enough-to assume that something happened. While many other groups moved toward Trump a bit-or saw less turnout in some places-LGBTQ people went in the opposite direction.\n\nI believe a few things came into play. The toxic masculinity that marked the Trump campaign was as threatening to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people as it is to many women. (Harris overwhelmingly won Black women, and, though Trump won white women, Harris did better with white women than Biden did in 2020).\n\nThe Trump campaign's bro culture on steroids, exemplified by the white supremacist elements of Trump's base as well as among the many young right-wing and even independent male podcasters Trump courted, often telegraphed homophobia and transphobia. Even if it wasn't overt, it sent a message that you're not included if you're queer.\n\nAnd the blatant anti-trans messaging from Trump and the GOP-and the vicious ads they aired in media markets-horrified almost the entire LGBTQ community.\n\nJD Vance idiotically said during the campaign, in an interview with Joe Rogan, that Trump would probably win what he called \"the normal gay guy vote.\"\n\nThat was evidently very wrong. First off, as far as many in Trump's base are concerned-including the aggressively anti-LGBTQ Christian right-there is no \"normal\" gay anything. They believe we're all abnormal-freaks and sinners. Secondly, the idea that some great majority of queer people-or the \"normal gay guys\"-would vote for Trump because they were eager to throw trans people under the bus is clearly false.\n\nI'm not saying all cisgender gay, lesbian, and bisexual people support all trans people-there are fissures, as there are in any movement-but I believe most do, understanding the clear connections we have about our bodies and our privacy and about how those who hate us view us.\n\nBeyond that, Trump and the justices he put on the Supreme Court are a threat to marriage equality and anti-discrimination laws protecting gay, bi and lesbian people, especially in public accommodations. Kamala Harris, meanwhile, was marrying gay couples going back to 2004 as a district attorney in San Francisco-before being shut down by the California Supreme Court-and enforced protections as California attorney general while being outspoken as a U.S. senator.\n\nThe other thing I would say is that queer people know a fascist when they see one.\n\nThey know what it's like to be scapegoated. And, if they know their history, they know the brutality and violence LGBTQ people experienced in the past at the hands of strongmen. So do Jews, of course, who also voted overwhelmingly for Harris-by 79% in one exit poll -which must have angered Trump, who demanded their vote at rallies and even berated them, claiming they owed it to him for his support of Israel.\n\nPre-election polling showed a majority of Jewish Americans, who represent a diversity of opinions on the war in Gaza, believed Trump was more supportive of Israel, while they also believed Harris would handle the war better. Whatever their opinions, however, they know a fascist when they see one and voted in big numbers against Trump.\n\nAs I wrote a couple of weeks ago , any move to blame transgender people or distance the Democratic Party from LGBTQ rights would be harmful to the party. The media finger-pointing has had some people calling for overcorrections that are not only morally wrong; they're bad political strategy.\n\nTrump, when all is said and done, will have won the popular vote by roughly 1.5%, the smallest popular vote win in a quarter of a century. The margins were tight in the battleground states. If the issue of inflation and the economy played the role they appear to have, and if the anti-incumbency fervor that gripped the world because of inflation was key, the last thing Democrats should do is push away constituencies that stayed loyal as well as those in the base who support those constituencies' rights.\n\nAt the risk of repeating myself: trans rights and LGBTQ rights in general have galvanized young voters, who embraced equality in elections over the past 10 years and often helped put Democrats over the top. And then there are the families and friends of LGBTQ people.\n\nIt's a polarized time, and elections are going to be very close indefinitely. Having been 8% of the electorate in 2024 and voting 86% for the Democratic presidential candidate, LGBTQ people showed they're a pivotal and loyal voting bloc that is key for Democrats in any future election.\n\nNOW READ: Democratic leadership missing in action as Trump tightens his grip"

      "text": "Trump's DHS can now spy more easily on LGBTQ Americans\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem in Detroit on June 14, 2024 (Gage Skidmore)\n\nA little-known but far-reaching office within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has removed protections for LGBTQ+ people from a policy that restricted intelligence gathering on certain groups, following an executive order from President Donald Trump to dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies. The DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), one of 18 organizations that comprise the U.S. intelligence community-now overseen by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard-reportedly has long faced allegations of civil liberties and civil rights abuses.\n\nThe Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) has stripped the words \"gender identity\" and \"sexual orientation\" from a policy manual \"that set guardrails on gathering intelligence,\" Bloomberg Government first reported. \"I&A's work has attracted close scrutiny for years because of its domestic focus, with intelligence often involving US citizens and others in the country.\"\n\nAccording to The Advocate , an archived version of the text previously read:\n\n\"OSIC Personnel are prohibited from engaging in intelligence activities based solely on an individual's or group's race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, country of birth, nationality, or disability. The use of these characteristics is permitted only in combination with other information, and only where (1) intended and reasonably believed to support one or more of I&A's national or departmental missions and (2) narrowly focused in support of that mission (or those missions).\"\n\nThe words \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity\" have since been removed.\n\n\"The Office of Intelligence & Analysis (I&A) is a unique member of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC),\" the office states on its homepage within the DHS domain. \"I&A is the only IC element statutorily charged with delivering intelligence to our State, Local, Tribal and Territorial (SLTT) and private sector partners, and developing intelligence from those partners for the Department and the IC.\"\n\n\"I&A specializes in sharing unique intelligence and analysis with operators and decision-makers to identify and mitigate threats to the homeland,\" it continues. \"I&A's main focus is to provide the Department with the intelligence and information it needs to keep the Homeland safe, secure, and resilient.\"\n\nIn January 2024, Just Security -an independent, nonpartisan law and policy journal led by co-editor-in-chief Ryan Goodman-reported that DHS's Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) \"has for years engaged in abusive domestic intelligence practices targeting Americans' political views and broadly painting certain groups of Americans as terrorists.\"\n\n\"Since at least 2016,\" Just Security's Spencer Reynolds wrote, \"I&A officers have conducted interviews with people held in jails without sufficient constitutional protections, targeted journalists and activists protesting local monuments under the guise of homeland security, surveilled racial justice demonstrators, and monitored political views shared by millions of Americans - about topics like abortion , government , and elections - that DHS baldly asserts will lead to violence.\"\n\nIt also alleged that \"I&A too often disseminates questionable intelligence to thousands of officials nationwide. This pattern of abuse continues today: I&A is currently engaged in an intelligence campaign that has empowered Georgia authorities to weaponize state terrorism and racketeering charges in a crackdown against activists protesting a police training facility in Atlanta.\"\n\nReynolds has an extensive background in intelligence and law, including serving as senior intelligence counsel in the Office of the General Counsel of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, \"where he advised on operations and policy related to domestic intelligence, counterterrorism, social media monitoring, and other national security matters,\" according to his bio .\n\nAs The Advocate noted, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem \"has a history of targeting LGBTQ+ rights, including by signing executive orders banning transgender athletes from participating on teams that align with their identities and banning gender-affirming care for youth.\""

      "text": "trans\n\nA surge of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer candidates are vying for political office in 2018.\n\nEarly last week, Fort Lauderdale voters gave a sweeping victory to attorney Dean Trantalis, 64, to succeed Mayor Jack Seiler. He led the polls with about 65 percent of the vote, the Sun-Sentinel reported .\n\nThe attorney's win makes him the city's first openly gay mayor, following mayors who at times collided with the community's LGBTQ groups and residents.\n\nThe city's former mayor, Jack Seiler, had a relatively positive relationship with the LGBTQ community, but he came under scrutiny in 2014 when he voted against a symbolic resolution supporting marriage equality, and again last year when he hosted a prayer breakfast featuring an organization known for opposing LGBTQ rights. Seiler's predecessor, Jim Naugle, has been blasted as a \"homophobe\" for his infamous anti-gay message and fervent attacks on the LGBTQ community.\n\nMayor-elect Trantalis told Salon his election victory indicates a shift in the city's attitudes. \"I think Florida has already changed, and I'm just a reflection of that change,\" he said. \"The city of Fort Lauderdale has always needed time to evolve on that issue, and I think we've now been able to do that.\"\n\nRep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) congratulated Trantalis, tweeting , \"Mayor-Elect Trantalis has a true passion for public service and fighting for civil rights. This is a massive victory for Broward County and the LGBT community nationwide.\"\n\nTrantalis is the latest openly out individual to ascend to political office - and given the number of LGBTQ candidates who are seeking local, state and national office this year, he likely won't be the last.\n\nNational, State and Local Races\n\nIn January, Chelsea Manning, the transgender former Army intelligence analyst who was found guilty of leaking classified military documents, announced she would run for a U.S. Senate seat in Maryland. She is running as a Democrat and will likely face off against two-term Senator Ben Cardin, who elevated his profile this year by investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election on the chamber's foreign affairs committee.\n\nAnnise Parker - the CEO of Victory fund, a political action committee dedicated to increasing the number of LGBTQ officials in the U.S., and Houston's first gay mayor - told Salon that the growing number of LGBTQ candidates is \"a natural progression.\"\n\n\"LGBTQ candidates are running for the same reason so many women are running,\" Parker said, referring to the surge of female candidates running for office in 2018. \"They are frustrated or concerned. They see hard-won rights being under attack at the federal level and in many of the states, and they want to do something about it.\"\n\nWhile Victory Fund has endorsed more than 70 openly gay candidates across various office levels so far this election cycle, the organization expects that number to grow to more than 150 before Election Day. And the group's endorsement slate does not include the total number of LGBTQ candidates who will be on ballots this year.\n\nThe Connection Between the Rise in LGBTQ and Female Candidates\n\nDonald Haider-Markel, a political science professor at the University of Kansas and author of \"Out and Running: Gay and Lesbian Candidates, Elections and Policy Representation,\" told Salon that the rise of LGBTQ candidates for national office can be traced back to the earlier successes of out candidates in state and local elections.\n\n\"The [LGBTQ] community is finally sort of reaching a level where they're been really successful with local level offices, with state level offices,\" he said. \"They've created a deep bench of potential candidates for national office, and you're seeing now more national candidates than ever before for the House and for the Senate than there has ever been in any election cycle.\"\n\nLike Mayor Parker, Haider-Markel also sees a connection between the increase in the number of women running for office and the rise of LGBTQ candidates.\n\n\"I think what you're seeing in the LGBT community is similar to what you're seeing with other minority communities and with women,\" he explained. \"In that their reaction to this administration is basically to get off the couch and run for office.\"\n\nDespite the possible connection between the rise in LGBTQ and female candidates, Haider-Markel acknowledged that LGBTQ representation is still male heavy - but added that could change this election year.\n\nHaider-Markel pointed to Tammy Baldwin, the first openly-gay candidate elected to the U.S. Senate, as a testament to that fact. He said, Baldwin \"tells the story right there, in the sense that there haven't been as many women running for office overall, so it makes sense there would be fewer LGBT women running for office as well.\"\n\nElectoral data reviewed by the Victory Fund reveals that LGBTQ women running for office win their elections at a higher rate than LGBTQ men, suggesting the political landscape could look a lot different - and a lot more representative for women - in 2018.\n\nLGBTQ Candidates and The Blue Wave: Will it help?\n\nWhy now? Haider-Markel pointed to the outcome of the 2016 election and to the number of anti-LGBTQ bills introduced over the last two years, including HB 2 in North Carolina. Often referred to as the \"bathroom bill,\" it sought to restrict transgender people from using bathrooms that align with their gender identity. HB2 is included in the more than 100 anti-LGBTQ bills that were introduced across 29 states in 2017, according to a report published by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC). In addition, FBI hate crime statistics from 2016 show an increase in the number of reported anti-LGBTQ hate crimes.\n\nLate Friday night, President Trump announced a new policy for the military that would ban most transgender people from serving in the armed forces.\n\nHaider-Markel pointed out that LGBTQ candidates are energized, and his findings show that their prospects look promising.\n\n\"These candidates that run, they're not Donald Trump candidates,\" he said. \"These are people that are connected politically. They have experience in politics, either through interest groups or working on campaigns, and they're better than the average candidate running for the offices they're running for. The evidence I have suggests the candidates do better than a comparable heterosexual candidate.\"\n\nHowever, Haider-Markel notes that \"saying that an LGBTQ candidate can win in any district in the country would be a fairly strict statement,\" and that it's important to acknowledge \"the vast majority of [LGBTQ candidates] are running as Democrats. It's going to be to their advantage.\"\n\nHe also stressed that candidates \"have to be strategic about when and where they run,\" and that \"they have to run in districts that are going to tend to lean more liberal, be better educated and more urban,\" but that \"even in a red state [a victory for an out candidate] is possible.\"\n\nAnd given Democrats are winning in unlikely places, including Kentucky , Wisconsin and Florida , it's possible that a blue wave is forming ahead of the midterm elections - and LGBTQ candidates could ride it to victory.\n\nNevertheless, Haider-Markel referenced his findings and said, \"Sexual orientation and LGBT status is not a major hurdle for them to cross. Candidates who are open about who they are, are going to be more successful, whether they're LGBT or not.\"\n\nThe trend of LGBTQ candidates has come to New York, too. Cynthia Nixon, the bisexual activist and Emmy Award-winning actress, perhaps best known as Miranda from \"Sex and the City,\" recently announced she would be challenging New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in the state's Democratic primary in 2018 - and New Yorkers can't help but wonder, \"Does Nixon have a shot?\" Only time will tell.\n\nThe following terms belong to a different era and have no place in our modern climate of heightened awareness, inclusion and empathy. Be cool, be aware, and consider not using these terms.\n\n\"My name is Princess and I'm an alcoholic!\"\n\nDo you know how many reports of transgender people assaulting others in bathrooms there have been? The grand tally stands at none, a number also expressed as zero, zip, nil, nada. Yet several jurisdictions and states-North Carolina most notoriously-have passed \"bathroom bills,\" and a number of others have pending legislation targeting trans people and restroom access. In response to the ginned-up scaremongering at the heart of these laws, Target issued a message stating it \"welcome[s] transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.\"\n\n[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_original\",\"fid\":\"609363\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"height\":\"608\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\",\"width\":\"600\"}}]]\n\nA transgender student who identifies as male was suspended from his South Carolina high school after a teacher saw him using the boy's bathroom, WMBF reports .\n\nSeth Meyers made a mockery of the absolutely ridiculous-and sadly successful-campaign against a citywide nondiscrimination law that failed to pass in Houston, Texas yesterday. The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance would have made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, age, ethnicity, marital status, and a host of other traits. But opponents of the law focused most on protections it provided LGBT- and more specifically, transgender-people. And by \"focused,\" I mean they convinced voters the bill would allow sketchy dudes to skulk around in women's bathrooms.\n\nJuliet Jacques has written a memoir, \" Trans \" (available now from Verso), based around her transition but encompassing a wide sweep of her life, from disaffected teendom in rural England to politically angry but established adulthood in London. Jacques' transition was chronicled in the Orwell Prize-nominated column she wrote for the Guardian, \" My Transgender Journey ,\" which began in 2010 and lasted three years. However, \"Trans\" is a broader take on what it was like coming of age in the transphobic '90s, navigating an identity via music, film, literature, football, gender theory and a slowly expanding circle of role models.\n\nThe following is an excerpt from the new book One Teacher in Ten in the New Millennium edited by Kevin Jennings (Beacon Press, 2015). Reprinted with permission from Beacon Press.\n\nIt was Gay Pride weekend in New York City, but the event's celebratory spirit was absent from Michelle Scott's tidy second-floor apartment on a leafy street near Brooklyn College. Her child, Carey Smith, is a transgender woman currently locked up in solitary confinement in Upstate Correctional Facility, a men's supermax prison located in the Adirondacks.\n\nWith the rising popularity of transgender stars like supermodel Carmen Carrera and author Janet Mock, the trans community seems to be carving a niche more deeply into the national consciousness than ever before. It has been a long, slow rise; even as notions of sexuality evolved within mainstream American culture, many LGBTQ activists have argued that the images and ideas of queer identity still possess the hang-ups of white supremacy and patriarchy. For a long time, they argue, transgendered people were especially excluded in the struggle for equal rights and recognition."

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)\n\nA surge of grant cancellations hit researchers focused on the health of gay, lesbian and transgender people last week, as the Trump administration continues to target what it describes as ideologically driven science.\n\nLast week the U.S. government terminated at least 68 grants to 46 institutions totaling nearly $40 million when awarded, according to a government website. Some of the grant money has already been spent, but at least $1.36 million in future support was yanked as a result of the cuts, a significant undercount because estimates were available for less than a third of grants.\n\nMost were in some way related to sexual minorities, including research focused on HIV prevention. Other canceled studies centered on cancer, youth suicide and bone health.\n\nHealth and Human Services spokesman Andrew Nixon said the agency is \"dedicated to restoring our agencies to their tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science.\" The grants were awarded by the National Institutes of Health, an agency under HHS.\n\nOne canceled project at Vanderbilt University had been following the overall health of more than 1,200 LGBTQ people age 50 and older. Most of the money has been spent from the grant funding the project, but it was up for renewal in April, said Tara McKay, who leads Vanderbilt's LGBTQ+ Policy Lab.\n\nShe said the grant won't be renewed because of the termination, which jeopardizes any long-term results. Still, the Vanderbilt project had already generated two dozen published papers, including work used to train doctors to provide better care to LGBTQ people, increasing the likelihood of cancer screenings and other preventive care.\n\n\"That saves us a lot of money in health care and saves lives,\" McKay said.\n\nInsights from minority populations can increase knowledge that affects everyone, said Simon Rosser, who studies cancer in gay and bisexual men at the University of Minnesota.\n\n\"We now no longer have anywhere studying LGBT cancer in the United States,\" said Rosser, who saw his grants canceled on Friday.\n\n\"When you decide to cancel all the grants on sexual minorities, you really slow down scientific discovery, for everyone,\" Rosser said. Young researchers will lose their jobs, and the field as a whole will suffer, he added.\n\n\"It's a loss of a whole generation of science,\" Rosser said.\n\nTermination letters seen by The Associated Press gave as reasons that the research was \"unscientific\" or did \"nothing to enhance the health of many Americans.\"\n\nThat language felt personal and stinging, McKay said.\n\n\"My project's been accused of having no benefit to the American people. And, you know, queer and trans folks are Americans also,\" McKay said.\n\n___ Associated Press data journalist Kasturi Pananjady contributed to this report. ___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nPeople march following a Pride rally at the Utah State Capitol Friday, June 2, 2023, in Salt Lake City. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Utah became the first state to prohibit flying LGBTQ+ pride flags at schools and all government buildings after the Republican governor announced he was allowing a ban on unsanctioned flag displays to become law without his signature.\n\nGov. Spencer Cox, who made the announcement late Thursday night, said he continues to have serious concerns with the policy but chose not to reject it because his veto would likely be overridden by the Republican-controlled Legislature.\n\nStarting May 7, state or local government buildings will be fined $500 a day for flying any flag other than the United States flag, the Utah state flag, military flags or a short list of others approved by lawmakers. Political flags supporting a certain candidate or party, such as President Donald Trump's signature \"Make America Great Again\" flags, are not allowed.\n\nThe new law could stoke conflict between the state and its largest city. City buildings in liberal Salt Lake City typically honor Pride Month each June by displaying flags that celebrate its large LGBTQ+ population. Local leaders have illuminated the Salt Lake City and County Building in rainbow lights to protest the flag ban each night since the Legislature sent it to Cox's desk.\n\nAndrew Wittenberg, a spokesperson for Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall's office, said their attorneys are evaluating the law and the capital city does not yet have information on what it will do once the law takes effect.\n\nThe bill's Republican sponsors, Rep. Trevor Lee and Sen. Dan McCay, said it's meant to encourage \"political neutrality\" from teachers and other government employees. Opponents argued it aims to erase LGBTQ+ expression and take authority away from cities and towns that don't align politically with the Republican Legislature.\n\nIn a letter to legislative leaders explaining his decision, Cox said he agreed with the \"underlying intent\" of the bill to make classrooms politically neutral but thought it went too far in regulating local governments. He also noted that by focusing narrowly on flags, the law does not prevent other political displays such as posters or lighting.\n\n\"To our LGBTQ community, I know that recent legislation has been difficult,\" Cox said. \"Politics can be a bit of a blood sport at times and I know we've had our disagreements. I want you to know that I love and appreciate you and I am grateful that you are part of our state. I know these words may ring hollow to many of you, but please know that I mean them sincerely.\"\n\nCox's decision came hours after the Sundance Film Festival announced it was leaving its home of four decades in Park City, Utah , for Boulder, Colorado . The flag bill created eleventh-hour tensions as some residents worried it would push the nation's premier independent film festival out of state. Festival leaders said state politics ultimately did not influence their move from conservative Utah to liberal Colorado. They did, however, make \"ethos and equity values\" one of their criteria in a nationwide search for a new home and referred to Boulder in their announcement as a \"welcoming environment.\"\n\nUtah's flag law goes further than one signed last week in Idaho that only applies to schools. But Idaho Republicans are also advancing a separate bill to ban government buildings from displaying certain flags.\n\nFlorida lawmakers have advanced a proposal to ban pride flags and others that represent political viewpoints in schools and public buildings after similar measures failed in the past two legislative sessions. Some federal agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, also have limited which flags can fly at their facilities.\n\nOther flags permitted under the Utah law include Olympic and Paralympic flags, official college or university flags, tribal flags and historic versions of other approved flags that might be used for educational purposes.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Chris Carlson, File)\n\nThe fight to allow same-sex marriage and gay clergy has defined much of the last half-century for major mainline Protestant denominations in the U.S., mirroring in many ways the broader fight for LGBTQ+ inclusion in civic life.\n\nWithin these theologically moderate-to-progressive Protestant groups, the decades of wrestling over whether to reaffirm or overturn longstanding anti-LGBTQ+ church policies sowed deep divisions throughout the denominations. It's caused hurt feelings, broken relationships, disciplinary church trials and schisms.\n\nThe United Methodist Church, which stripped out its bans and related social teachings over the past two weeks, is the last of the major mainline church bodies to go through this process.\n\nThis timeline highlights key milestones and flashpoints within the UMC, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Episcopal Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, United Church of Christ, as well as in civic life.\n\nJune 28, 1969 Police raid the Stonewall Inn , an underground gay bar in New York City.

(Bryan Terry/The Oklahoman via AP, File)\n\nA legal settlement in Florida, legislative action in Arkansas and a lawsuit in Georgia this week made waves in an ongoing national battle over the rights of LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\nOver the past three years or so, many Republican officials have been trying to limit those rights, imposing rules on which sports transgender students can play and which bathrooms they can use, among other policies.\n\nThe conservative pushback has coincided with more younger people identifying as LGBTQ+.\n\nA Gallup poll released this week based on telephone interviews of more than 12,000 Americans finds that about 1 in 13 U.S. adults identify as LGBTQ+, including less than 1 in 100 of the total population who say they are transgender. But a higher proportion of the youngest adults identified as LGBTQ+ - a little over one-fifth of those born from 1997 through 2005.\n\nThe legal and legislative issues at the heart of the debates remain in flux.\n\nSome things to know about this week's flurry of developments.\n\nFlorida this week settled a legal challenge to its 2022 law that bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools, a measure that critics had dubbed \"Don't Say Gay.\"\n\nUnder the deal, the law remains in place but some of the restrictions that resulted will be lifted.\n\nThe agreement clarifies, for example, that students and teachers are allowed to discuss LGBTQ+ issues. In addition, schools don't have to remove library books that feature LGBTQ+ characters, halt anti-bullying programs that address bullying of LGBTQ+ people, censor valedictorian speeches in which the speaker talks about their gender identity or sexual orientation, or force teachers to remove rainbow flags from classroom doors.\n\nFlorida's law barring the instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity, championed by the state's Republican governor and former presidential primary candidate Ron DeSantis, was one of the highest-profile among dozens of measures adopted in Republican-controlled states over the past few years to try to rein in what can be taught about LGBTQ+ issues - and the rights of LGBTQ+ people.\n\nA handful of other states have also limited school curriculums in similar ways.\n\nArkansas this week stopped allowing residents to use \"X\" rather than \"F\" or \"M\" to designate their sex on driver's licenses and official identifications.\n\nOn Thursday, a predominantly Republican subcommittee endorsed the move, approving the emergency rules for the new policy despite some Democratic lawmakers' objections. The full panel upheld that vote on Friday, allowing them to take effect immediately.\n\nEarlier in the week, a judge in Kansas left in place the state's policy of not allowing transgender people to change the listing for sex on their driver's licenses to something other than their sex at birth.\n\nThe policy grew out of a 2023 law that recognizes people's legal gender identities based only on their anatomy at birth. Lawmakers passed the measure by overriding the veto of Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, whose administration had previously allowed people to change the sex designation on their licenses and birth certificates.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas announced Thursday that it will appeal the latest ruling on behalf of transgender clients.\n\nLawmakers in Kansas are trying to do what most Republican-controlled states have done already: ban gender-affirming care for minors.\n\nThe Kansas House this week approved a ban on puberty blockers, hormones and gender-affirming surgery - which is rarely used - for those under 18. Senate Republicans delayed a vote that had been planned for Thursday to allow time to tweak the bill with the intent of getting two-thirds of the chamber to support it.\n\nIf they can do it, it would put the legislature in position to override an expected veto from Gov. Kelly.\n\nUnder the bill, doctors who violate the ban could lose their licenses.\n\nAt least 23 states have adopted bans on gender-affirming care for minors in recent years. One of those laws - in Arkansas - was struck down by a court. Judges have put the Idaho and Montana versions on hold while their constitutionality is considered.\n\nTennessee lawmakers are planning a hearing for Wednesday on a measure that would allow lawsuits against anyone who takes a minor to another state for gender-affirming care without a parent's consent.\n\nThe bill, framed as a parental rights measure, in some ways echoes an Idaho abortion law that was adopted last year and later put on hold by a court while its constitutionality is considered.\n\nThe move to prohibit helping minors travel for care is one of several Tennessee proposals that LGBTQ+ rights advocates are concerned about. Others include a bill that would block businesses from setting their own rules about bathroom access - a move that critics say could target transgender people. One measure would bar the state from requiring adoptive or foster parents to agree with a child's sexual orientation or gender identity. Another would require educators to tell the school's administration and student's parents of any request to affirm the student's gender identity.\n\nNone of these proposals have made it to Republican Gov. Bill Lee's desk for his signature.\n\nAn Idaho state Senate committee advanced a bill Thursday to block using public funding for gender-affirming care.\n\nThe ban would apply to Medicaid and the state employees heath insurance plan. It has already passed the House and could be up for a final vote in the Senate next week.\n\nThe issue of paying for gender-affirming care has been a big one in Idaho. In 2022, the state lost a lawsuit filed by a transgender prison inmate who said she was wrongly denied gender-affirming surgery. In a separate lawsuit, plaintiffs accuse the state's Medicaid program of moving too slowly to approve such surgeries.\n\nThe advocacy and information organization Movement Advancement Project says that nine states ban Medicaid funding for gender-affirming health care for people of all ages.\n\nMore than a dozen current and former women's college athletes on Thursday filed a lawsuit against the NCAA in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, accusing the college sports governing body of violating their rights by allowing transgender women to compete in women's sports.\n\nThe highest-profile plaintiff in the case is Riley Gaines, a former University of Kentucky swimmer who tied for fifth in the Division I 200 meter freestyle championship two years ago with Lia Thomas, a University of Pennsylvania swimmer. Thomas, who is transgender, also won the 500 freestyle and finished eighth in the 100 that year.\n\nGaines has remained a major voice against allowing transgender women to compete in women's events.\n\nShe and others assert in their legal claim that the NCAA violated the federal Title IX education equity legislation. A proposed federal rule would go the other way by barring outright bans on transgender women in sports.\n\nAt least 25 states have passed restrictions on transgender women and girls competing, though some of those measures have been put on hold by courts.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho; Andrew DeMillo in Little Rock, Arkansas; and Kimberlee Kruesi in Nashville, Tennessee, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Shakh Aivazov, File)\n\nTBILISI, Georgia (AP) - The speaker of the Georgian parliament signed into a law Thursday a bill that severely curtails LGBTQ+ rights in the country and mirrors legislation adopted in neighboring Russia .\n\nShalva Papuashvili, the parliament speaker, said on social media that the legislation does \"not reflect current, temporary, changing ideas and ideologies, but is based on common sense, historical experience and centuries-old Christian, Georgian and European values.\"\n\nGeorgian President Salome Zourabichvili had refused to sign the bill and returned it to parliament on Wednesday. It was introduced by the governing Georgian Dream party and approved by lawmakers last month.\n\nThe bill includes bans on same-sex marriages, adoptions by same-sex couples and public endorsement and depictions of LGBTQ+ relations and people in the media. It also bans gender-affirming care and changing gender designations in official documents.\n\n\"This law protects the rights of all citizens, including freedom of expression, so that the rights of others are not violated, which is the essence and idea of true democracy,\" Papuashvili wrote.\n\nParliament gave the legislation its final approval as Georgia, a largely conservative country where the Orthodox Church wields significant influence, prepares to vote in a parliamentary election. The law has been widely seen as an effort by the governing party to shore up support among conservative groups. It was decried by human rights advocates and LGBTQ+ activists, who said it further marginalized an already vulnerable community.\n\nBy signing the law, Georgian Dream \"have taken homophobia to a new level, and that is political and institutional homophobia,\" said Ana Tavadze, an activist with Tbilisi Pride, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group.\n\nGeorgian Dream's aim is to \"fabricate\" problems ahead of the election to distract people from \"their failure\" to solve issues involving unemployment, education and healthcare, Tavadze told The Associated Press.\n\nThe law has drawn comparisons with Russia, where the Kremlin has been highlighting what it calls traditional family values. Russian authorities in the last decade have banned public endorsement of \"nontraditional sexual relations\" and introduced laws against gender-affirming care , among other measures. Its Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism by labeling what the authorities called the LGBTQ+ \"movement\" operating in Russia as an extremist organization and banning it.\n\nIn Georgia, the LGBTQ+ community has struggled even before the legislation was introduced. Demonstrations and violent outbursts against LGBTQ+ people have been common, and last year hundreds of opponents of gay rights stormed an LGBTQ+ festival in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, forcing the event's cancellation. This year, tens of thousands marched in Tbilisi to promote \"traditional family values.\"\n\nA day after parliament gave its final approval to the anti-LGBTQ+ bill, transgender actor and model Kesaria Avramidze was stabbed to death in her apartment in Tbilisi. Rights advocates had worried that the bill would stoke more violence.\n\nPapuashvili, the parliament speaker, said that by not signing the bill, President Zourabichvili and the Georgian opposition \"did not have enough courage to openly express their opinion regarding this law.\"\n\nSome analysts say parts of the Georgian opposition are walking a fine line ahead of the Oct. 26 election between condemning the move to curtail LGBTQ+ rights and not wanting to alienate some voters.\n\nZourabichvili has long been at odds with the governing party and vetoed a \"foreign influence\" law adopted by parliament earlier this year. She was overridden by parliament, where Georgian Dream dominates.\n\nThe measure requires media and nongovernmental organizations to register as \"pursuing the interests of a foreign power\" if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad. It ignited weeks of protests and was widely criticized as threatening democratic freedoms. Those opposing the law compared it to similar legislation in Russia which is routinely used to suppress dissent, and accused the governing party of acting in concert with Moscow, jeopardizing Georgia's chances of joining the European Union.\n\nThe South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million formally applied to join the EU in 2022, after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but the bloc halted its accession in response to the \"foreign influence\" law and froze some of its financial support. The United States imposed sanctions on dozens of Georgian officials in response to the law.\n\nGeorgian Dream was set up by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia and served briefly as Georgia's prime minister in 2012. It promised to restore civil rights and \"reset\" relations with Moscow, which fought a brief war with Georgia in 2008 over the breakaway province of South Ossetia. Russia then recognized the independence of South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian province, Abkhazia, and established military bases there.\n\nMany Georgians backed Ukraine as Kyiv battled Russia's invasion in 2022. But the Georgian government abstained from joining sanctions against Moscow, barred dozens of Kremlin critics from entering the country, and accused the West of trying to drag Georgia into open conflict with Russia. The opposition has accused the governing party of steering the country into Russia's orbit to the detriment of its European aspirations.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(Zoltan Mathe/MTI via AP)\n\nBUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) - A new anti-LGBTQ+ law banning Pride events and allowing authorities to use facial recognition software to identify those attending the festivities was passed in Hungary on Tuesday, leading to a large demonstration on the streets of Budapest.\n\nSeveral thousand protesters chanting anti-government slogans gathered after the vote outside Hungary's parliament. They later staged a blockade of the Margaret Bridge over the Danube, blocking traffic and disregarding police instructions to leave the area.\n\nThe move by Hungarian lawmakers is part of a crackdown on the country's LGBTQ+ community by the nationalist-populist party of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán , who is an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nThe measure, which is reminiscent of similar restrictions against sexual minorities in Russia, was passed in a 136-27 vote. The law, supported by Orbán's Fidesz party and their minority coalition partner the Christian Democrats, was pushed through parliament in an accelerated procedure after being submitted on Monday.\n\nOpposing legislators led a vivid protest in the legislature involving rainbow-colored smoke bombs.\n\nAt the protest outside parliament, Evgeny Belyakov, a Russian citizen who immigrated to Hungary after facing repression in Russia, said the legislation went at the heart of people's rights to peacefully assemble.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban responds to speeches at the start of the spring session of the National Assembly in Budapest, Hungary, Monday, Feb. 24, 2025. (Zoltan Mathe/MTI via AP)\n\n\"It's quite terrifying to be honest, because we had the same in Russia. It was building up step by step, and I feel like this is what is going on here,\" he said. \"I just only hope that there will be more resistance like this in Hungary, because in Russia we didn't resist on time and now it's too late.\"\n\nThe bill amends Hungary's law on assembly to make it an offense to hold or attend events that violate Hungary's contentious \"child protection\" legislation , which prohibits the \"depiction or promotion\" of homosexuality to minors under 18.\n\nAttending a prohibited event will carry fines up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546), which the state must forward to \"child protection,\" according to the text of the law. Authorities may use facial recognition tools to identify individuals attending a prohibited event.\n\nIn a statement on Monday after lawmakers first submitted the bill, Budapest Pride organizers said the aim of the law was to \"scapegoat\" the LGBTQ+ community in order to silence voices critical of Orbán's government.\n\n\"This is not child protection, this is fascism,\" wrote the organizers of the event, which attracts thousands each year and celebrates the history of the LGBTQ+ movement while asserting the equal rights of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.\n\nFollowing the law's passage Tuesday, Budapest Pride spokesperson Jojó Majercsik told The Associated Press that despite Orbán's yearslong effort to stigmatize LGBTQ+ people, the organization had received an outpouring of support since the Hungarian leader hinted in February that his government would take steps to ban the event.\n\n\"Many, many people have been mobilized,\" Majercsik said. \"It's a new thing, compared to the attacks of the last years, that we've received many messages and comments from people saying, 'Until now I haven't gone to Pride, I didn't care about it, but this year I'll be there and I'll bring my family.'\"\n\nThe new legislation is the latest step against LGBTQ+ people taken by Orbán, whose government has passed other laws that rights groups and other European politicians have decried as repressive against sexual minorities.\n\nIn 2022, the European Union's executive commission filed a case with the EU's highest court against Hungary's 2021 child protection law. The European Commission argued that the law \"discriminates against people on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity.\"\n\nHungary's \"child protection\" law - aside from banning the \"depiction or promotion\" of homosexuality in content available to minors, including in television, films, advertisements and literature - also prohibits the mention of LGBTQ+ issues in school education programs, and forbids the public depiction of \"gender deviating from sex at birth.\"\n\nBooksellers in Hungary have faced hefty fines for failing to wrap books that contain LGBTQ+ themes in closed packaging. Critics have argued Orbán's campaign amounts to an attempt to cut LGBTQ+ visibility, and that by tying it to child protection, it falsely conflates homosexuality with pedophilia.\n\nHungary's government argues that its policies are designed to protect children from \"sexual propaganda.\"\n\nHungary's methods resemble tactics by Putin , who in December 2022 expanded Russia's ban on \"propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations\" from minors to adults, effectively outlawing any public endorsement of LGBTQ+ activities.\n\nOrbán, in power since 2010, faces an unprecedented challenge from a rising opposition party as Hungary's economy struggles to emerge from an inflation and cost of living crisis and an election approaches in 2026.\n\nTamás Dombos, a project coordinator at Hungarian LGBTQ+ rights group Háttér Society, said that Orbán's assault on minorities was a tactic to distract voters from more important issues facing the country. He said allowing the use of facial recognition software at prohibited demonstrations could be used against other protests the government chooses to deem unlawful.\n\n\"It's a very common strategy of authoritarian governments not to talk about the real issues that people are affected by: the inflation, the economy, the terrible condition of education and health care,\" Dombos said.\n\nOrbán, he continued, \"has been here with us for 15 years lying into people's faces, letting the country rot basically, and then coming up with these hate campaigns.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis, File)\n\nFriction has been simmering within the global Anglican Communion for many years over its 42 provinces' sharp differences on whether to recognize same-sex marriage and ordain LGBTQ clergy. This year, the divisions have widened, as conservative bishops - notably from Africa and Asia - affirmed their opposition to LGBTQ inclusion and demanded \"repentance\" by the more liberal provinces with inclusive policies.\n\nCaught in the middle of the fray is the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who is the top bishop of the Church of England and ceremonial leader of the Anglican Communion , which is one of the world's largest Christian communities. Welby has acknowledged \"deep disagreement\" among the provinces, while urging them to \"walk together\" to the extent possible.\n\nThe divide came into the spotlight four months ago at the communion's Lambeth Conference, typically held once every decade to bring together bishops from the more than 165 countries with Anglican-affiliated churches. It was the first Lambeth Conference since 2008, and the first to which married gay and lesbian bishops were invited.\n\nThe conservative primates of Nigeria, Rwanda and Uganda refused to attend, while other bishops who share their opposition to LGBTQ inclusion pushed unsuccessfully for the Lambeth gathering to reconfirm a 1998 resolution rejecting same-sex marriage.\n\nNow those primates, and their allies worldwide, are looking ahead to a conference in Kigali, Rwanda, in April. They're expected to discuss their dismay at support for same-sex marriage in some Anglican churches and what they see as Welby not taking a tough stand against such marriages.\n\nWelby, in turn, says neither the Lambeth Conference nor he individually has the authority to discipline a member province or impose demands on it.\n\nIn Nigeria, Anglican leaders say a formal separation from the global church over LGBTQ inclusion is more likely than ever. They cite Welby's comments at Lambeth and the subsequent appointment of the Very Rev. David Monteith - who has been part of a same-sex civil partnership since 2008 - as the new dean of the Canterbury cathedral.\n\nBishop Williams Aladekugbe of Nigeria's Ibadan North Anglican Diocese said same-sex unions are \"ungodly and devilish\" and their recognition by some provinces is a major reason \"we cannot continue to fellowship with them.\"\n\n\"If it is going to cause further division, let it be,\" Aladekugbe told The Associated Press. \"If they don't worship God the way we worship him, if they don't believe in what we believe in... let us divide (and) we go our own way.\"\n\nHenry Ndukuba, primate of the Anglican church in Nigeria, cited such divisions during an interview with a church-run television network.\n\nThe archbishop of Canterbury \"is a symbol of unity\" in the Anglican Communion, Ndukuba said, but \"because of the way things are going, we are not tied to the apron of Canterbury.\"\n\nThe umbrella group for the conservative bishops is the Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches (GFSA). Its steering committee is headed by South Sudan Archbishop Justin Badi, and includes archbishops from Bangladesh, Chile, Congo, Egypt, the Indian Ocean region and Myanmar.\n\nAt the Lambeth Conference, the committee issued a stern communique - in effect demanding their views on LGBTQ issues hold sway throughout the Anglican Communion and that the \"revisionist\" provinces be disciplined or marginalized.\n\nThat threat was aimed at the provinces which have embraced LGBTQ-inclusive politics - including the Episcopal Church in the United States, and the Anglican churches of Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, Scotland and Wales. For now, the Church of England refuses to conduct same-sex marriages, but some of its bishops want that policy to change.\n\nThe GFSA leaders contend that conservative-led jurisdictions are home to 75% of the global Anglican Communion population, which is estimated at 80 to 85 million.\n\n\"For too long the Anglican Communion has been driven by the views of the West,\" Badi told news media during the conference. \"We often feel that our voice is not listened to, or respected.\"\n\nIn their communique, Badi and his allies stressed they are not defecting. Yet they questioned whether the global Anglican community, under current circumstances, could consider itself a truly unified body.\n\n\"If there is no authentic repentance by the revisionist Provinces, then we will sadly accept a state of 'impaired communion' with them,\" the communique said.\n\nWelby, instead of reprimanding the LGBTQ-inclusive provinces, commended the sincerity of their approach to human sexuality.\n\n\"They are not careless about scripture. They do not reject Christ,\" Welby said at Lambeth. \"But they have come to a different view on sexuality after long prayer, deep study and reflection on understandings of human nature.\"\n\nThe Most Rev. Michael Curry, presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church, saw this as a breakthrough.\n\n\"What shifted in the rhetoric,\" he said, \"was a genuine acknowledgement that both sides had arrived at their views through serious study of scripture, theology, and modern understanding of human nature.\"\n\nThe Rev. Chuck Robertson, a top aide to Curry whose dossier includes relations with the Anglican Communion, described Welby's comments as \"a game-changer.\"\n\n\"It reflects that those who've been going beyond traditional teaching have done so with deep care,\" Robertson said. \"This is something new -- a corner had been turned.\"\n\nThe conservative bishops' frustrations with Welby intensified in October when Monteith was appointed the new dean of the Canterbury cathedral.\n\nWhile Welby did not personally make the appointment, he issued a statement expressing delight at the choice made by a selection panel. Within days, the GSFA steering committee conveyed its dismay.\n\nThe announcement \"puts in question the seriousness with which (Welby) wants to pursue the unity of the Communion,\" the committee said. \"We take exception to the Church of England's accommodation of a person in a same-sex union being appointed to an office of spiritual authority over the flock of God's people.\"\n\nA Rwandan bishop, Alexis Bilindabagabo of the diocese of Gahini, said he condemns the ordination of gay priests because \"weak\" people shouldn't stand at the pulpit.\n\n\"A gay man must be led, but he should not lead others,\" said Bilindabagabo.\n\nLGBTQ activists say most Anglican churches in Africa are led by conservative priests, including many averse to even discussing homosexuality.\n\n\"For Uganda, the Anglican church has almost played a leadership role in being intolerant,\" said Frank Mugisha, a prominent LGBT leader in the East African country where a lawmaker once introduced legislation seeking to punish some homosexual acts with execution.\n\nIn some cases, Mugisha said, Anglican priests take a hard-line stance because they fear losing their flock to more conservative evangelical groups.\n\nIn contrast to other Anglican provinces in Africa, the Anglican Church of Southern Africa has considered letting dioceses conduct same-sex marriages, though it has yet to take that step.\n\nThe church is based in South Africa - the only African country to legalize such unions - and also represents dioceses in several neighboring countries. It was led for many years by the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who was a staunch advocate of LGBTQ rights well as leading foe of apartheid.\n\nThe Southern Africa church has been critical of Anglican leaders elsewhere on the continent who support harsh laws against LGBTQ people.\n\n\"It is evident that some of the draconian laws in some African countries are in fact violations of human rights and some bishops of the Anglican Church in these countries have openly supported these laws,\" said Bishop Allan Kannemeyer, who heads the Diocese of Pretoria.\n\nIt's unclear what lies ahead for the Anglican Communion. The GSFA leaders, in their October statement, say that if Welby does not take the lead in \"safeguarding the Church's teaching,\" there may be an opening for conservative bishops to increase their influence.\n\nThat topic will likely be paramount at the April meeting in Rwanda, to which GSFA bishops have been invited. It will be hosted by the Global Anglican Future Conference - known as Gafcon - which includes the archbishops of Nigeria, Rwanda and Uganda, as well as leaders of conservative Anglican entities that already have split from the Anglican Communion, such as the Anglican Church in North America.\n\nNo one from the Anglican Communion's head office in London is expected to attend.\n\n\"Some in Gafcon see it as a movement for biblical renewal, which is fine, but others as a rival to the Anglican Communion,\" said Gavin Drake, the communion's communications director. 'There is a growing frustration within the Communion at this 'political wing' of Gafcon.\"\n\nBy the time they meet in April, Gafcon and GFSA members might be further angered by events within the Church of England, whose General Synod will gather in February to consider proposals on same-sex marriage developed during a lengthy discussion process. There's a possibility of an unprecedented vote allowing Church of England priests to conduct same-sex weddings for the first time.\n\nA significant development came in early November, when Steven Croft, the bishop of Oxford, became the church's first diocesan bishop to speak in favor of same-sex marriage. He published a 50-page essay urging a lifting of the ban and sent it to all members of the College of Bishops.\n\nAt stake, he said, was the Church of England's claim to serve the whole of society. Its anti-LGBTQ stance \"is leading to a radical dislocation between the Church of England and the culture and society we are attempting to serve,\" he said.\n\nFive other Anglican bishops have publicly backed Croft's call for change.\n\n___\n\nAsadu reported from Abuja, Nigeria; Crary from New York and Pepinster from London.

(AP Photo, File)\n\nBut the online threats began after the Kremlin in December 2022 expanded its ban of \"propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations\" from minors to adults, effectively outlawing any public endorsement of LGBTQ+ activities. Then came the complaints about them to authorities.\n\nThey were detained in 2023 and accused of spreading \"LGBT propaganda\" among minors. Gogishvili was given a hefty fine, while Xu was put in a detention center for migrants to await deportation.\n\nThey eventually fled abroad separately. Now reunited in France, where they're seeking asylum, they look with concern at Russia, where new, even harsher anti-LGBTQ+ measures have been adopted.\n\nJust over a year ago, Russia's Supreme Court effectively outlawed any LGBTQ+ activism in a ruling that designated \"the international LGBT movement\" as extremist. The move exposed anyone in the community or connected to it to criminal prosecution and prison, ushering in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation.\n\n\"I'm scared for the queer community in Russia that remains in the country,\" Gogishvili told The Associated Press.\n\nThat community in Russia has been under legal and public pressure for over a decade but especially since the Kremlin sent troops to Ukraine in 2022. Putin has argued that the war is a proxy battle with the West, which he says aims to destroy Russia and its \"traditional family values\" by pushing for LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nFILE - In this photo provided by the Russian State Duma, lawmakers attend a session in Moscow, Russia, on Nov. 24, 2022, to approve a bill that significantly expands restrictions on activities seen as promoting LGBTQ+ rights. (The State Duma, The Federal Assembly of The Russian Federation via AP, File)\n\nPutin insists Russia isn't discriminating against LGBTQ+ people, but he also decries \"perversions that lead to degradation and extinction.\" Parliament Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin last year called gender transitioning \"pure satanism\" and \"diabolical policy\" that should stay in the U.S.\n\nAny public representation of gay and transgender people is banned. Gender-affirming medical care and changing one's gender in official documents are prohibited. With the Supreme Court's ruling in November 2023, anyone involved with the LGBTQ+ community could be imprisoned for up to six years.\n\nAs a result, many left the country. But others remain -- and find themselves in a community pushed into the shadows, marginalized even further and dogged by fear of repression.\n\n\"Six years, it's not a joke,\" Olga Baranova, head of the Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives, said in an interview from outside Russia. \"'What is worth me going to prison for six years?' Every person who's doing something right now (in LGBTQ+ activism in Russia) has to answer this question these days.\"\n\nJust days after the Supreme Court ruling, the LGBTQ+ community was rattled by news of police raiding gay bars, nightclubs and venues that hosted drag shows in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities.\n\nFILE - Igor Kochetkov, founder of the Russian LGBT Network rights group, center, and other activists attend a May Day rally in St. Petersburg, Russia, on May 1, 2018. (AP Photo, File)\n\nLast spring, the first criminal case on charges of involvement with the \"LGBT movement\" extremist group was lodged against the owner and the staff of a bar in the southwestern city of Orenburg that held drag performances. A handful of similar cases came elsewhere.\n\nCharges have been launched for displaying symbols such as a rainbow flag - even though many of those accused had nothing to do with the LGBTQ+ community, said human rights lawyer Max Olenichev.\n\nMore raids of bars and nightclubs were reported in Moscow last month, almost exactly a year since the Supreme Court ruling. State media quoted law enforcement as saying they targeted those spreading \"LGBT propaganda.\"\n\nOne man arrested for allegedly running a travel agency for gay customers faces charges of organizing activities of an extremist organization. Independent news outlet Mediazona reported that Andrei Kotov rejected the charges and said in court that law enforcement officers beat him and administered electric shocks during the arrest, even though he didn't resist.\n\nOn Nov. 23, Putin signed into law a bill banning the adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender-affirming care is legal. He also approved legislation outlawing the spread of material that encourages people not to have children .\n\n\"All this, in general, speaks more about the desire of the authorities to create some kind of atmosphere of fear. It's not repressions, it's terror,\" said Vladimir, an LGBTQ+ rights advocate in Russia who like many interviewed by AP asked to be identified only by a first name out of security concerns.\n\nIkar, a fellow activist and transgender man, described the actions by authorities as \"an attempt to intimidate ... to make people lose their social connections, stay silent, stay home.\"\n\nVladimir and Ikar belong to an underground LGBTQ+ rights group that offers legal aid and holds offline events without fanfare. Activists thoroughly verify identities of anyone seeking its help.\n\nFILE - LGBTQ+ activists wave flags at a rally in Moscow on July 15, 2020. (AP Photo, File)\n\nFILE - A police officer detains a gay rights activist in Red Square in Moscow on Feb. 7, 2014. (AP Photo/Evgeny Feldman, File)\n\nThe group is seeing a growing number of cases related to violence against LGBTQ+ people, Vladimir said.\n\nSome regional organizations have shut down completely; others operate openly, but in a drastically different way. The Moscow Community Center for LGBT+ Initiatives moved its community-building efforts into a sprawling online network of chats and Zoom meeting rooms, according to Baranova.\n\n\"Our strategy today is to preserve the community in some form and size at least, for the people to just know each other, support each other,\" she said.\n\nCenter T, a prominent trans rights group, closed its Moscow shelter after visits from police and opened one in Yerevan, Armenia, said group leader Yan Dvorkin. Center T helps emigres as well as those still in Russia to find doctors and medical care, trying to resolve crises and still be a part of a community, if only online.\n\nAnna, a 25-year-old transgender woman in Moscow, said being part of the community provided the courage to transition. \"I can't imagine what it's like for new people, who are only opening up the possibility for themselves,\" she said.\n\nAnna transitioned and came out to her family and friends last year, after the ban on gender-affirming care was enacted.\n\nThe ban and other repressive laws and rulings hit the already-vulnerable transgender community hard, Dvorkin said.\n\nFinding a job has become more difficult, both for those who haven't changed their gender marker in documents and those who have, he said. Access to gender-affirming medical care is a major issue, with doctors wary of working with transgender people and with many turning to shoddy underground medications.\n\nViolence against transgender people has spiked, as has harassment and discrimination, Dvorkin said.\n\n\"Nowadays, you can intimidate people - blackmail them - by (saying) that 'I will report you and you will go to prison for extremism,'\" the activist said.\n\nAnna considers herself lucky and \"privileged.\" She has a well-paying job, can afford a doctor advising her from abroad on hormonal therapy, and can get the medicine in Moscow. She wouldn't elaborate on how and where she gets it, so authorities \"don't pull the plug.\"\n\nBut she said she hasn't come out to her colleagues for fear of losing her job, and she is sometimes harassed on the street because of her appearance. Her identity documents can't be changed under the ban.\n\nShe says she has a support network of friends and doesn't want to leave Russia, even though she's acutely aware of the risks.\n\n\"I somehow have managed to adapt,\" she said. \"I know how to live here.\"\n\nJulia, another transgender woman, also vowed to stay, describing it as sort of a mission to show that \"people like me are not necessarily weak, are not necessarily useless.\"\n\nIn her mid-40s, Julia has a family and children, a successful career in a male-dominated industry, and the respect and acceptance from her colleagues and friends. For her, \"it's about normalizing\" being trans, she said.\n\nHow much \"normalizing\" is possible in the current climate and the years ahead is still an open question.\n\nThe ban on \"propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations\" forces print, TV and movie censorship of LGBTQ+ relations. In a recent example, two Russian streaming services cut a transgender character from the 1990 drama series \"Twin Peaks.\"\n\nAt the same time, there is abundant official rhetoric from politicians, the Russian Orthodox clergy and media figures condemning LGBTQ+ people.\n\nMany like Gela Gogishvili, the gay man who fled Russia last year, worry about the next generation of LGBTQ+ people.\n\nHe said he's \"even more scared for those who are born there and are currently growing up -- from their childhood years onwards, they will be taught that (being queer) is bad.\"\n\n\"Like it was with me,\" Gogishvili adds. \"I couldn't accept myself until I was 20 years old.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "How the Gay-Rights Movement Lost Its Way\n\nWhat should activist groups such as GLAAD do after they fulfill their goals?\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nWhen Sarah Kate Ellis was named president of GLAAD more than a decade ago, the LGBTQ advocacy organization was in dire financial straits. \"I was given a scary mandate,\" she told The New York Times in 2019: \"Fix it or shut it down.\"\n\nShe should have done the latter.\n\nFounded in 1985 as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, the nonprofit originally had the mission of promoting more empathetic media coverage of people with AIDS. Over the years, its remit expanded to countering negative portrayals of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people in advertising and entertainment. Today, the proliferation of LGBTQ characters on our screens, largely sympathetic coverage in mainstream media, and the ubiquity of same-sex couples in advertisements and commercials all suggest that GLAAD achieved its mission. The group should have long ago taken the win and dissolved -just as the organization Freedom to Marry announced it would do shortly after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in the summer of 2015.\n\nRead: How GLAAD won the culture war and lost its reason to exist\n\nAccepting victory, however, can be difficult for people who devote their lives to a cause, and not only for emotional reasons. The impulse among activists, once successful, to keep raising money necessitates that they find things to spend it on. Recently, the Times published a devastating exposé revealing how GLAAD succumbed to this temptation, enabling Ellis to live luxuriously at the expense of the group's donors.\n\nThe trouble at GLAAD, however, is more than just a story of individual or organizational corruption. It's also a story about how-in the years since LGBTQ people earned the right to serve openly in the U.S. military, get married, and not be discriminated against in housing and employment-an entire movement has gone tragically adrift.\n\nAccording to documents obtained by the Times reporter Emily Steel , Ellis signed a contract two years ago enabling her to earn up to $1.3 million a year, far higher than the salaries of CEOs at charitable organizations of comparable size. She racked up nights at a Waldorf Astoria and other posh hotels and took 30 first-class flights in 18 months. A trip with a colleague to the Cannes Lions advertising festival, the purpose of which, according to GLAAD's spokesman, was to \"speak directly to companies about not turning their backs on the LGBTQ community,\" cost $60,000. GLAAD also gave Ellis an annual $25,000 allowance to rent a summer house in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and $20,000 to remodel her home office.\n\n\"The pattern of lavish spending is really despicable,\" William Waybourn, GLAAD's director from 1995 to 1997, told me. \"I can remember crawling underneath beds in cheap motels trying to find a telephone connection to get on AOL.\"\n\nToday, GLAAD's own statistics speak to its obsolescence. In 2013, GLAAD began publishing its \" Studio Responsibility Index ,\" a meticulous tabulation of gay, bisexual, and trans characters in film and television. According to its latest report , surveying the year 2022, 28.5 percent of films released by the top 10 movie distributors contained an overtly LGBTQ character. For having an LGBTQ character in only 17 percent of its films, the studio Lionsgate was given a \"failing\" score. GLAAD has gone from criticizing negative media portrayals-once pervasive, now vanishingly rare-to demanding quotas for positive ones.\n\nLike a censor in the days of the film industry's Hays Code, GLAAD reviews film and television scripts for what it considers offensive content. At the same time, the group seeks out \" strategic partnerships \" (nonprofit-speak for corporate sponsorship ) with some of the same companies whose content it ostensibly \" monitors .\" This practice creates an obvious conflict of interest. \"We monitored all media and never took a dime from any of them,\" Waybourn said. \"Now it's almost like blackmail. Either you support GLAAD or we're going to come after you.\" (In response to a request for comment for this article, GLAAD provided a lengthy statement asserting that the Times report \"excludes much of our critical advocacy work and grossly mischaracterizes the organization\" and citing three instances in which GLAAD had criticized \"LGBTQ representation/other LGBTQ issues by a company that is also a financial sponsor.\")\n\nAs gay people have become more fully integrated into the mainstream of American life, prominent activist groups have excelled at perpetuating themselves. The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's leading LGBTQ advocacy organization, issues a highly publicized Corporate Equality Index and, like GLAAD, accepts donations from the businesses it scrutinizes . It and other groups constantly gin up publicity on the faulty premise that life in the United States keeps getting worse for LGBTQ people. Last year, HRC declared , for the first time in its more than four-decade history, a \"national state of emergency for LGBTQ+ Americans\"-an absurd pronouncement that diminishes not only the suffering of the thousands of gay men lost to AIDS but also the terrible treatment endured by LGBTQ people in the 64 countries where homosexuality is illegal and in some cases punishable by death.\n\nFlailing about for relevance since the legalization of same-sex marriage, many gay-rights groups pivoted to a related but fundamentally different cause: transgender rights. Rather than emulate the movement's past approach-seeking allies across the political spectrum and accepting compromise as a precondition for legal and social progress-they have taken hard-line left-wing positions. LGBTQ groups repeat the mantra \"the science is settled\" on the extremely complex and fraught subject of youth gender medicine and insist that anyone who questions the provision of puberty blockers to gender-dysphoric children is transphobic. They continue to spread this message even as many European countries have backed away from such treatments after concluding that the evidence supporting them is weak . The reflexive promotion of major medical interventions for minors should be a red flag for gay men and lesbians, considering the research indicating that many gender-distressed and gender-nonconforming children grow up to be gay.\n\nHelen Lewis: The gender war is over in Britain\n\nLast year, though, GLAAD, HRC, and other organizations staked their reputations on a foolish crusade against the Times , condemning the newspaper's careful and empathetic reporting on youth gender medicine as \"irresponsible\" and \"biased.\" GLAAD has placed the Harry Potter novelist J. K. Rowling and the journalist Jesse Singal, who has reported extensively on youth gender medicine ( including in The Atlantic ), alongside such people as the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on a McCarthyite list of \"individual public figures and groups using their platforms to spread misinformation and false rhetoric against LGBTQ people, youth, and allies.\"\n\nMeanwhile, LGBTQ organizations have slowly been erasing the people whose interests they were established to advance. Less and less do they even use the words gay and lesbian to describe their ostensible constituencies; more and more, they use queer , a historically pejorative term reclaimed by left-wing ideologues. Two years ago, as the Times ' Pamela Paul pointed out, a six-and-a-half-minute video introducing the current president of HRC omitted the words gay and lesbian entirely. GLAAD itself replaced its original name with its acronym in 2013.\n\nIn their dogmatism, many prominent LGBTQ groups have become disconnected from the people they purport to represent. For the first several decades of their existence, gay organizations relied on the generosity of gay individuals and small, gay-owned businesses. In 2022, according to the organization Funders for LGBTQ Issues, foundations donated $258 million to the movement. Fundraising for LGBTQ causes has had an inverse relationship to the actual legal and social hardships faced by LGBTQ people, ballooning in the years since all of the most difficult battles were won.\n\nThe corruption of GLAAD and other LGBTQ groups should force a reckoning for the gay community, which has no shortage of underfunded grassroots organizations working to address real problems. Among them are Outright International, which supports gay-rights movements abroad, and SAGE, which helps LGBTQ seniors. The community has genuine needs-which do not include helping nonprofit executives enrich themselves and hobnob with celebrities. If there's a silver lining to the ethical collapse of GLAAD, it's to shine a bright light on the massive waste of resources spent on organizations that have no reason for being and, in some cases, cause more harm than good."

      "text": "New, Ominous Signs for Gay Rights Keep Emerging\n\nA growing faction supports rolling back the gains of the past quarter century.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nWhat happens to a dream undone? For many Americans, the progress of gay rights over the past quarter century was one of the country's greatest achievements. Even as social change on other fronts stagnated or reversed, LGBTQ Americans gained new acceptance and protections. In 2002, Gallup found that just 38 percent of Americans believed that homosexual behavior was morally acceptable. Barely more than a decade later, in 2015, that number was 63 percent; that year, the Supreme Court granted same-sex couples the right to marry. This change was celebrated by its beneficiaries, of course, and by progressives, but also more broadly. By 2022, 55 percent of Republicans supported same-sex marriage, according to Gallup-a huge leap from just 22 percent 10 years earlier.\n\nNow alarm bells are ringing for same-sex marriage and LGBTQ rights in general. A new Gallup poll shows that Republican approval of homosexual rights has dropped from 56 to 40 percent in two years, and that support for same-sex marriage is down to less than half, at 46 percent . Liberal justices on the Supreme Court warned in a dissent last week that their colleagues are chipping away at the right to marriage. Over the past four years, Republican policy makers have mounted a campaign against transgender rights and discussion of homosexuality in schools, but the result appears to be a wider backlash against LGBTQ rights.\n\nThe slippage belies the Whiggish view of inexorable if slow progress that many liberals, most notably former President Barack Obama, espoused in the early 21st century. The Supreme Court's abortion decision in Dobbs shows that even things that courts have long treated as fundamental rights can be reversed. But although that ruling was a shock to many, abortion has long been a subject of entrenched division. Gay rights seemed like an area where public opinion was moving quickly, and in one direction.\n\nWhether permanent or fleeting, the reversal fits with a general revanchist push by the MAGA movement against cultural change. The pushback on transgender and educational issues may have looked to some Americans like simply pumping the brakes-after such fast change on gay rights generally, slower movement was merited. These new developments, however, indicate that a growing faction supports not just pausing change but reversing it.\n\nDonald Trump makes for a strange figurehead for such a movement. Just as Trump was a libertine who favored abortion rights before transforming himself into a hero of evangelical Christians who brought down Roe v. Wade , he seems to have had little animus toward LGBTQ people before his political career. If anything, he brought a median New Yorker's shrugging acceptance. During his first presidential campaign, he spoke little about gay rights but still went further in affirming them than any prior Republican nominee had.\n\nBut just as Obama disingenuously claimed to have \"evolved\" toward greater support for gay rights once in the White House, Trump appears to have made a strategic choice to devolve. He first indicated that he'd preserve an Obama-era rule providing workplace protections for LGBTQ employees, but his administration proceeded to water down or roll back existing rules, and to institute carve-outs for religious organizations. Even so, Gallup found that GOP support for same-sex relations stayed stable during the Trump presidency. (Trump hosted a gay wedding at Mar-a-Lago a few months ago.)\n\nWhat happened from 2022 to 2024? The most obvious answer is that Republican candidates made attacks on LGBTQ people a centerpiece of the 2022 midterm elections. Red states and jurisdictions passed laws restricting discussion of sexual orientation in schools, some of the more than 1,800 anti-LGBTQ-rights bills introduced nationwide in the past four years. Bans on books that discussed the subject spread widely. Advocates claimed, with no basis, that these books and other events were part of a dark conspiracy to \"groom\" children into being gay. States also pushed to restrict gender-affirming care for transgender people, both children and adults, and to circumscribe transgender rights.\n\nMore than just an attempt to slow down change, these political campaigns have reversed public opinion, at least among Republicans. Views among Democrats and independents remain basically stable, which is one reason approval for same-sex marriage still sits at 69 percent, down from 71 percent a couple of years ago.\n\nSuch a shift could be consequential in policy terms. If Trump wins in November, his allies are pushing for a greater rollback of LGBTQ rights through executive policy, part of a larger assertion of presidential power; a Republican majority in Congress, bolstered by shifting GOP-voter opinions, could make changes statutory.\n\nThese moves might be constrained somewhat by electoral imperatives. The Supreme Court would not be. The Dobbs decision showed that the most conservative justices have no qualms about issuing politically incendiary opinions, and that Chief Justice John Roberts is unable or unwilling to restrain them. Justice Clarence Thomas has already argued in a concurring opinion that the Court should reverse its rulings protecting same-sex marriage and relationships as well as contraception. The conservative bloc's ruling in a case about an American woman and her immigrant husband last week drew the warnings from the minority that same-sex marriage could soon be threatened. And the next president is likely to appoint more justices, so a Trump victory would solidify the Court's rightward direction, and possibly shift it yet further.\n\nAmerican law has treated same-sex marriage, like abortion, as a fundamental right since the 2015 ruling. If Dobbs shows that such rights can be taken away, it still doesn't explain what that would look like. The end of a pregnancy is a moment in time, and past abortions aren't reversed. But if the Court revoked the right to same-sex marriage, what would happen to couples who married and established lives based on that right? No one knows, but surely the answer is nothing good."

      "text": "It's Time to Drop the 'LGBT' From 'LGBTQ'\n\nThe case for a new term that describes all sexual minorities\n\nFrank Kameny, the last century's greatest gay-rights activist , filed the first-ever Supreme Court petition challenging discrimination against homosexuals. He led some of the first gay-rights demonstrations. He was the first openly gay congressional candidate. He spearheaded the challenge to the psychiatric establishment's categorization of homosexuality as a mental illness. He fought tirelessly against sodomy laws. He did a lot more than that. But there is one thing he never did-at least to my own recollection and that of associates of his whom I consulted. He did not use the term LGBTQ , or any of its variations.\n\nThis is partly because he was a creature of his era, born in the 1920s and active in an age when the whole argot was different. But he lived until 2011, well into the age of LGBTQ . He had plenty of time to make peace with the term, but his friends say he abjured it. \"My recollection is LGBT or its derivatives were expressly disliked by Frank,\" one of them told me. \"He would use gay to cover the full range; or gay and lesbian .\" Another said: \"Frank was quite indignant about the alphabet soup. When it started in the '80s with gay and lesbian , he correctly predicted that there would be no end of it.\"\n\nKameny especially prized, among his many accomplishments, his slogan \"Gay is good!\"-a proud claim that homosexuals are heterosexuals' moral as well as legal equals. He wasn't excluding anyone by using the word gay . He didn't mean that gay is good but lesbian, bisexual, and transgender are not. He believed he was fighting for the values that define all Americans-the values he had fought for in combat during World War II. Gay rights, to him, meant American rights. Human rights.\n\nA generation younger than Kameny, I came of age accustomed to the phrase gay and lesbian . Later, when LGBT arrived, it seemed cumbersome and artificial, but its inclusive aspirations struck me as honorable. So I learned to live with it.\n\nIn the past couple of years, however, I have come to believe, at long last, that Kameny was right. The alphabet-soup designation for sexual minorities has become a synecdoche for the excesses of identity politics -excesses that have helped empower the likes of Donald Trump. It's time to retire the term and find a replacement. I propose a single letter: Q .\n\nRead: The irrationally divided critics of Donald Trump\n\nLike a lot of historical wrong turns, LGBTQ means well. As gay people fought the stereotype of brokenness, homosexual came to be seen as clinical and pathologizing. Gay , by contrast, had a long linguistic history and no pseudoscientific baggage. In Kameny's heyday and my youth, that seemed just fine. But the male and female homosexual populations differed in some ways, and so gay became gendered to complement lesbian . By the early 1990s, when some of us founded a group for homosexual journalists, we didn't think twice about calling it the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.\n\nMeanwhile, as recognition grew that trans people faced discrimination and ignorance comparable to what homosexuals endured, the addition of T made gradual inroads. By 2007, when gay-rights advocates decided to make their support for a federal antidiscrimination bill conditional on the inclusion of protections for transgender people, it was clear that the gay-and-lesbian and trans movements had become politically joined at the hip; including the T made undeniable sense. Bisexual people, concerned that their issues would be overlooked, also sought acknowledgment, and their initial was stapled in too.\n\nAnd so the unwieldy four-letter acronym reigned. It had its advantages. It signaled factional inclusion to those inside the movement, and factional solidarity to those outside the movement. In that sense, it was good politics and good symbolism. But it wasn't stable. Factionalism rarely is. As activists and theorists sought to cover every base, they recognized asexuality and intersexuality and various other identities by coining LGBTQIAA+ , LGBTTIQQ2SA , and other telescoping designations. Lately LGBTQ seems to have become the norm, on the assumption that Q , for queer , can stand in for all the rest.\n\nTo some extent, the very artificiality and awkwardness of the acronymic acrobatics speak to their ecumenical aspirations. Unlike designations popularized by oppressors ( Negro , Oriental ) or based on national or ethnic particularism ( Italian , Jew , wasp ), LGBTQ is pointedly coalitional and inclusive, and we chose it ourselves. In that respect, its intended message is admirable. But it carries an unintended message as well: an embrace of the identity politics and group separatism that have soured millions of Americans on progressivism and egalitarianism.\n\nRead: The threat of tribalism\n\nOnce activists started listing identities and groups, they realized that anyone not specifically included might feel specifically excluded. Their solution has been to keep expanding the list. But no matter how many letters are added, one group is still pointedly excluded: the cisgender heterosexuals who make up the vast majority of the U.S. population. Not surprisingly, many members of that group resent civil-rights claims that are presented as a succession of carve-outs for minorities, to the benefit of everyone except themselves. Imagine if the religious-liberty movement instead styled itself the CJMHBSBA+ (Catholic-Jewish-Muslim-Hindu-Buddhist-Sikh-Baha'i-Animist-plus) movement. The symbolism ceases to be about equality for all Americans and becomes instead about naming particularistic claimants. And the very act of asking ordinary Americans to drag themselves through a list of initials is redolent of special rights, not equal rights.\n\nFor me, the ugliness and unwieldiness of LGBTQ add insult to injury. As does the fact that it is not a label that accurately describes me or any other American. It describes a coalition, yes, but not any actual person. Even as it seeks to explicitly include groups, the concatenation of initials implicitly blots out individuals.\n\nIn his 2017 book, The Once and Future Liberal: After Identity Politics , Mark Lilla, a humanities professor at Columbia, makes a powerful case for returning to an earlier, more broadly inclusive vision of citizenship and civil rights. \"Identity liberalism banished the word we to the outer reaches of respectable political discourse,\" he writes. Lost was the vision of civil-rights leaders, like Kameny and Martin Luther King Jr., who always insisted that they were fighting for the equality, and the benefit, of all Americans. In Kameny's 1961 Supreme Court petition (challenging the federal government's ban on the employment of homosexuals), he built his argument on the Declaration of Independence's promise that the pursuit of happiness is an unalienable right. He insisted that \"our government exists to protect and assist all of its citizens,\" and he rested his claim on \"the interest of the public at large and of the nation as a whole.\" By contrast, writes Lilla, \"in movement politics, the forces are all centrifugal, encouraging splits into smaller and smaller factions obsessed with single issues and practicing rituals of ideological one-upmanship.\" It is hard to think of a clearer instance of that sort of balkanization than a string of initials like LGBTQ , much less an absurdity like LGBTQIAA +.\n\nRead: Selfishness is killing liberalism\n\nNone of this would matter much if today were, say, 2015, when identity politics seemed like a low-cost enterprise. Now, however, we see its price. So long as the libertarian right and the progressive left fail to speak to the country's yearning for a transcendent identity, and majorities feel they are being ignored or disfavored, someone is bound to fill the resulting political vacuum. Political analysts and researchers find that resentment of political correctness and identitarian excess drove a lot of voters , including a lot of nonbigoted voters, toward Trump's toxic version of national identity. When Steve Bannon, one of the Trump movement's leading strategists, said, \"If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats,\" he knew what he was talking about.\n\nNo, I am not blaming Trump's presidency on LGBTQ (or even LGBTQIAA+ ). Trump himself uses LGBTQ . But the term has become symptomatic of the parochialism that is alienating white, straight, male America from the claims of the civil-rights movement. Every time lesbian and/or gay and/or bisexual and/or transgender and/or QIAA+ activists demand the recitation of a string of initials, they implicitly tell a story about seeking equality and betterment for groups, not for individuals, and not for that other set of initials, U.S.A.\n\nIn short, if there ever was a time when sexual minorities were served by reminding the world of their factionalism, that time is past. Kameny's preference for a single, simple, overarching designation was well founded. It deserves to be rediscovered.\n\nToday, however, that designation can no longer be gay , which, apart from being gendered, won't do for transgender people. Queer is inclusive, but its radical baggage and derogatory undertones have precluded its mainstream acceptance. And so, herewith, my modest proposal: Q .\n\nIf you like, you can think of it as short for queer . Or, if you don't like, just Q . Give it any etymology you wish. Regardless, the term would be understood to encompass sexual minorities of all stripes. When we speak of ourselves as individuals, we would use gay or lesbian or transgender or whatever applies. When we need a blanket term, we would simply call ourselves Q . As in: the Q population and Q equality . Q is simple and inclusive, and carries minimal baggage. When we speak of Q equality, we are saying that discrimination against sexual minorities-or for that matter sexual majorities-is not the American way.\n\nIn that respect, although I am not LGBTQ, I am certainly Q. I think Frank Kameny might have been, too.\n\nThis article appears in the January/February 2019 print edition with the headline \"Don't Call Me LGBTQ.\"\n\nThis article is part of \"The Speech Wars,\" a project supported by the Charles Koch Foundation, the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press, and the Fetzer Institute."

      "text": "New, Ominous Signs for Gay Rights Keep Emerging\n\nA growing faction supports rolling back the gains of the past quarter century.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nWhat happens to a dream undone? For many Americans, the progress of gay rights over the past quarter century was one of the country's greatest achievements. Even as social change on other fronts stagnated or reversed, LGBTQ Americans gained new acceptance and protections. In 2002, Gallup found that just 38 percent of Americans believed that homosexual behavior was morally acceptable. Barely more than a decade later, in 2015, that number was 63 percent; that year, the Supreme Court granted same-sex couples the right to marry. This change was celebrated by its beneficiaries, of course, and by progressives, but also more broadly. By 2022, 55 percent of Republicans supported same-sex marriage, according to Gallup-a huge leap from just 22 percent 10 years earlier.\n\nNow alarm bells are ringing for same-sex marriage and LGBTQ rights in general. A new Gallup poll shows that Republican approval of homosexual rights has dropped from 56 to 40 percent in two years, and that support for same-sex marriage is down to less than half, at 46 percent . Liberal justices on the Supreme Court warned in a dissent last week that their colleagues are chipping away at the right to marriage. Over the past four years, Republican policy makers have mounted a campaign against transgender rights and discussion of homosexuality in schools, but the result appears to be a wider backlash against LGBTQ rights.\n\nThe slippage belies the Whiggish view of inexorable if slow progress that many liberals, most notably former President Barack Obama, espoused in the early 21st century. The Supreme Court's abortion decision in Dobbs shows that even things that courts have long treated as fundamental rights can be reversed. But although that ruling was a shock to many, abortion has long been a subject of entrenched division. Gay rights seemed like an area where public opinion was moving quickly, and in one direction.\n\nWhether permanent or fleeting, the reversal fits with a general revanchist push by the MAGA movement against cultural change. The pushback on transgender and educational issues may have looked to some Americans like simply pumping the brakes-after such fast change on gay rights generally, slower movement was merited. These new developments, however, indicate that a growing faction supports not just pausing change but reversing it.\n\nDonald Trump makes for a strange figurehead for such a movement. Just as Trump was a libertine who favored abortion rights before transforming himself into a hero of evangelical Christians who brought down Roe v. Wade , he seems to have had little animus toward LGBTQ people before his political career. If anything, he brought a median New Yorker's shrugging acceptance. During his first presidential campaign, he spoke little about gay rights but still went further in affirming them than any prior Republican nominee had.\n\nBut just as Obama disingenuously claimed to have \"evolved\" toward greater support for gay rights once in the White House, Trump appears to have made a strategic choice to devolve. He first indicated that he'd preserve an Obama-era rule providing workplace protections for LGBTQ employees, but his administration proceeded to water down or roll back existing rules, and to institute carve-outs for religious organizations. Even so, Gallup found that GOP support for same-sex relations stayed stable during the Trump presidency. (Trump hosted a gay wedding at Mar-a-Lago a few months ago.)\n\nWhat happened from 2022 to 2024? The most obvious answer is that Republican candidates made attacks on LGBTQ people a centerpiece of the 2022 midterm elections. Red states and jurisdictions passed laws restricting discussion of sexual orientation in schools, some of the more than 1,800 anti-LGBTQ-rights bills introduced nationwide in the past four years. Bans on books that discussed the subject spread widely. Advocates claimed, with no basis, that these books and other events were part of a dark conspiracy to \"groom\" children into being gay. States also pushed to restrict gender-affirming care for transgender people, both children and adults, and to circumscribe transgender rights.\n\nMore than just an attempt to slow down change, these political campaigns have reversed public opinion, at least among Republicans. Views among Democrats and independents remain basically stable, which is one reason approval for same-sex marriage still sits at 69 percent, down from 71 percent a couple of years ago.\n\nSuch a shift could be consequential in policy terms. If Trump wins in November, his allies are pushing for a greater rollback of LGBTQ rights through executive policy, part of a larger assertion of presidential power; a Republican majority in Congress, bolstered by shifting GOP-voter opinions, could make changes statutory.\n\nThese moves might be constrained somewhat by electoral imperatives. The Supreme Court would not be. The Dobbs decision showed that the most conservative justices have no qualms about issuing politically incendiary opinions, and that Chief Justice John Roberts is unable or unwilling to restrain them. Justice Clarence Thomas has already argued in a concurring opinion that the Court should reverse its rulings protecting same-sex marriage and relationships as well as contraception. The conservative bloc's ruling in a case about an American woman and her immigrant husband last week drew the warnings from the minority that same-sex marriage could soon be threatened. And the next president is likely to appoint more justices, so a Trump victory would solidify the Court's rightward direction, and possibly shift it yet further.\n\nAmerican law has treated same-sex marriage, like abortion, as a fundamental right since the 2015 ruling. If Dobbs shows that such rights can be taken away, it still doesn't explain what that would look like. The end of a pregnancy is a moment in time, and past abortions aren't reversed. But if the Court revoked the right to same-sex marriage, what would happen to couples who married and established lives based on that right? No one knows, but surely the answer is nothing good."

      "text": "The Pride Flag Has a Representation Problem\n\nSince its debut, the symbol has had several redesigns in the name of inclusion. But some fear that the changes are merely for the sake of branding, absent material steps toward real equality.\n\nSince its first flight at 1978's Gay Freedom Day Parade in San Francisco, the rainbow flag has evolved multiple times. That earliest iteration included pink and turquoise stripes , symbolizing sex and art, respectively-parts of queer life that the designers thought were worth fighting for. Later that year, though, the flag lost its pink stripe because of fabric unavailability at the local manufacturer, and turquoise fell off the year after for the same reason. The now-familiar six-stripe flag is actually a redesign.\n\nWhen I was young and newly out of the closet, around 2013, I saw LGBTQ flags for every community imaginable online, including esoteric variants , such as the green, black, white, and grey aromantic flag , and a pale pink and yellow flag for slim, hairless 20-something twinks . In 2017, Philadelphia's Office of LGBT Affairs introduced black and brown stripes to the Pride flag to recognize queer and trans people of color. One year later, the Oregon-based graphic designer Daniel Quasar added the trans flag's stripes as a horizontal chevron to make the Progress Pride Flag . And this year brought another version from Intersex Equality Rights UK, featuring a yellow triangle and purple circle to represent the intersex community, or people born with a reproductive anatomy that doesn't fit typical male or female definitions.\n\nFlags are political symbols, borrowed from the vocabulary of nationalism, with similar overtones of citizenship, belonging, borders. They represent what the historian Benedict Anderson called \"imagined communities\"-self-constituted entities, united less by shared experiences than by shared beliefs in shared experiences. \"Flags as symbols facilitate sociality between strangers, inviting community between people who may never actually meet,\" Elliott Tilleczek, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Toronto who is researching queer activism, told me. Tilleczek argued that expanding the symbolic range of the Pride flag, for example, can have real-world effects, enhancing intra- and intercommunal bonds by creating a sense of belonging: \"Shared symbols ... can interpolate people into a collective sense of community.\"\n\nRead: Pride can't go back to what it was before\n\nBut having a Pride flag to represent us contributes to the controversial idea that there is an us to represent. And despite the flag's noble intentions, its latest iteration garnered plenty of online vitriol . The queer people I spoke with conveyed mixed emotions about the flag's many versions and whether they succeed at stitching together the community. \"I celebrate adding new colors to the Pride flag, especially when those colors remind us to center historically marginalized ... members of the queer community,\" Ari Monts, a 30-year-old religious educator based in Texas, told me. \"People want to feel seen, and we should let them.\" Still, Monts worries that this change may be mere performance, creating the impression of inclusion without real commitment . \"Part of me,\" Monts said, \"hopes that it is a step towards a more liberatory queerness that rejects homonormativity and all the nonsense that comes with it.\"\n\nNatalia Shmueli, a 25-year-old tech entrepreneur in Tennessee shares Monts's skepticism. \"I am happy to see intersex health care being taken more seriously within medical contexts,\" she told me, referring to the ongoing fight to end surgeries forced on people born with intersex characteristics. \"Still, I don't think cutesy flags actually highlight anything for LGBT [people] other than [making] us look kitschy and marketable.\" Shmueli argued that tacking the intersex symbol on to the Pride flag inaccurately lumps intersex issues together with the broader LGBTQ imagined community, noting that the experiences of intersex people are often invoked without context or complexity, ultimately benefiting no one.\n\nValentine Amari, a 21-year-old New England-based artist from Los Angeles, is also ambivalent. \"I'm between 'not everything needs a flag' and 'flags in resistance to capitalist cis-heteropatriarchy and white supremacy are useful and powerful for the people waving them,'\" she wrote to me in an email. I got similar comments from Will Damarjian, a 21-year-old student from Utah. Damarjian was raised Mormon, and when they were younger, the flag was a valuable symbol for them. \"I think the flags ... are pretty ugly,\" they told me. \"But in Utah, the ugly is sometimes all we got.\"\n\nRead: The generational clash at pride is actually a sign of progress\n\nPride flags and parades are seen as symbolically representative of the queer community's fight for liberation. However, as more corporate sponsorships leak into the festivities, some people see the events as being at odds with the historical movement and the rainbow flag's progressive ethos. Amari told me that she loves Pride as a time to celebrate her queer ancestors and continue their political work. However, the predominantly white and cisgender nature of many mainstream Pride events leaves her feeling physically unsafe and politically isolated. Damarjian expressed similar concerns, pointing to partnerships between the Utah Pride Center and arms manufacturers , such as L3Harris and Northrop Grumman , as well as companies such as Wells Fargo , which invested in the Dakota Access Pipeline .\n\nThese issues reflect long-standing contention over the use of Pride's official symbols for the sake of \" pinkwashing ,\" the deployment of ostensibly LGBTQ-friendly discourse by corporations and governments to obscure their participation in oppression and occupation. This includes military contractors going rainbow as a PR-friendly spin, and former presidential candidates like Pete Buttigieg slapping the anti-racist Philadelphia flag on their 2020 campaign merch while supporting policies that endanger Black and brown people .\n\nThat contradiction between the progressiveness that the Pride flag purportedly represents and the material violence it often hides also connects to the much-disputed role of police at Pride events . One year before the city of Philadelphia unveiled its flag, Black Lives Matter Toronto staged a protest at its local 2016 parade, demanding meaningful inclusion for people of color and an end to police participation . Pro-police factions retaliated , Toronto Pride wavered, but BLM eventually won, which sparked further anti-police-presence protests at parades throughout Canada and the U.S . In 2021, after years of pressure from anti-racism and anti-poverty organizers who argued that police presence endangered LGBTQ people and betrayed Pride's radical roots, NYC Pride finally agreed to exclude police floats. But permanently removing the police and military from Pride events remains an uphill battle .\n\nThis is a common Pride-time problem-in which \"inclusion\" and \"community\" are invoked for the sake of branding, absent material steps toward safety and equality. Historically and today, the movements that birthed Pride were criminalized, radical, and led by organizers living in poverty. Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson, the mythic heroes of Stonewall, were sex workers and anti-imperialists. They both militantly resisted police brutality . Rivera was banned from reformist institutions and even publicly booed when she spoke out about the plight of queer people in jail. She also warned of those she called \" normal homosexuals ,\" who eschewed fighting capitalism in favor of assimilation into the professional class.\n\nThe historical reality of queer struggle is lost in Pride's whitewashed corporate branding, which is remarkably apolitical on the issues that matter to the most marginalized people in the LGBTQ community: affordable housing and health care, sex-work decriminalization, and an end to policing and incarceration. \"I don't mind the constantly amended Pride flags,\" Shmueli said. \"But I find that they've become increasingly corporate in nature in more recent years. They're less now a symbol of LGBT liberation and more about being a product to sell.\" As long as some queer people are made to feel second to corporate interests and assimilationist politics, real inclusion will always be out of reach. Focusing on the flag is a great start. But it is just the start."

      "text": "Why 'Because of Sex' Should Protect Gay People\n\nIf a majority of the Supreme Court concludes that discrimination against LGBTQ people is discrimination \"because of sex,\" thousands of people will be protected on the job. If not, many stand to lose their livelihoods.\n\nForty years ago, I rented a rural Virginia cottage from a local grande dame imposingly named Butler Brayne Thornton Robinson Franklin but known to all as \"Muzz.\" Muzz died in 2003 at the age of 104, having lived an extraordinary life, with stints in revolutionary Spain and wartime China, followed by decades of stateside activism as a comrade of the feminist leader Alice Paul , founder of the National Woman's Party and author of the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nMuzz told me she personally had helped change history by asking Representative Howard W. Smith , a Democrat from Virginia and the powerful chair of the House Rules Committee, to include \"sex\" in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964-the section that prohibits employment discrimination. She was telling the truth . Civil-rights advocates had purposely left \"sex\" out of the bill, believing its addition would galvanize opposition. Suspecting that the bill was going to pass, Paul had asked Muzz and another Virginia feminist, Nina Avery, to write to Smith, an ardent segregationist. Muzz and Avery argued that forbidding job discrimination by race without doing so by sex would further disadvantage women-and especially white women. Smith complied with their request, offering the amendment as if it were a joke. But it was adopted, and the bill passed.\n\nThus, today, Title VII forbids most employers \"to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\"\n\n\"Judge\" Smith, as he was known, died in 1976. But imagine that we could summon his shade and ask, \"Judge, did you intend for your amendment to protect gay men, lesbians, and transgender people from job discrimination? Did your colleagues in the House?\"\n\nI suspect he'd say, \"I did not understand a word you said. Can I go now?\"\n\nSuppose we decide that Smith's \"intention\" in introducing the amendment was to protect white women; suppose we conclude that nobody in Congress in 1964 imagined that Title VII might one day be applied to protect LGBTQ people. Would we then be required to read \"because of ... sex\" to mean \"because she is a woman\" or even \"because she is a white woman\"? Of course not. The text says \"because of ... sex,\" and its application starts there.\n\nHow the Supreme Court reads that text this fall will make a huge difference in the lives of people all over the country. If a majority concludes that discrimination by sexual orientation or transgender status is discrimination \"because of ... sex,\" thousands of LGBTQ people will be protected on the job; if the Court rejects that argument, many stand to lose their livelihoods.\n\nIs discrimination because of sexual orientation, or gender identity, discrimination because of sex , or because of some other thing altogether? In a trio of cases to be argued in October, employers, supported by the Trump administration, insist that the two things are unconnected. The three cases are:\n\nThus, the lower courts need the Supreme Court to settle the question. That resolution will reveal a good deal about the fidelity of the conservatives to a theory several of them espouse. That theory, pioneered by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, is called \"textualism.\" To give a simplified summary, textualism holds that judges should not guess at the \"legislative intent\" behind a statute-or even research it by consulting the committee reports and floor speeches that accompanied its passage. The very words of the statute are the only thing that became law with its passage, textualists argue. \"The text is the law, and it is the text that must be observed,\" Scalia wrote in his influential 1997 book, A Matter of Interpretation: Federal Courts and the Law. In the same book, he wrote, \"A text should not be construed strictly and it should not be construed leniently; it should be construed reasonably, to contain all that it fairly means.\"\n\nThe two newest justices say they follow a similar approach. Brett Kavanaugh said in 2017, \"Text matters. The text of a law is the law.\" Neil Gorsuch proclaimed his admiration for Scalia's approach in a 2016 lecture , saying judges should not ask which result they favor but \"apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be.\"\n\nDo the words because of such individual's sex reasonably contain sexual orientation or transgender status? Here, in brief, are three ways to interpret the text, beginning with the textual:\n\nScalia-style textualists usually reject the \"intent\" and \"purpose\" questions, which focus on the meaning of the words at the time of adoption. I know which arguments I buy; to me the question is what because and sex mean-not what sexual orientation or gender identity , neither of which appears in the statute, did or didn't mean in 1964. I can, however, imagine a conscientious judge struggling with the choice.\n\nScalia's analysis in a case called Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services demonstrates how his textualist approach works in practice. The plaintiff, a man, was employed on an oil rig, and other men on the crew made his life hell with \"sex-related, humiliating actions\" until he left the job, feeling that \"if I didn't leave my job ... I would be raped or forced to have sex.\" (The plaintiff's sexual orientation is not part of the case record.) He sued the company for sexual harassment-a violation of Title VII. But lower courts held that the statute didn't cover sexualized harassment of a man by a man (or a woman by a woman, for that matter).\n\nAt oral argument, Scalia had been skeptical of Oncale's claim: \"I don't know why singling him out on the basis of his sexuality means that you're singling him out on the basis of his sex.\" But in the end, he wrote for a unanimous Court, \"Male-on-male sexual harassment in the workplace was assuredly not the principal evil Congress was concerned with when it enacted Title VII. But statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\"\n\nHe then quoted Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's words from an earlier case: \"The critical issue, Title VII's text indicates, is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.\"\n\nOncale wasn't a case about sexual orientation. Nevertheless, Scalia's opinion suggests that while applying Title VII provisions to LGBTQ people may not serve the intentions of its framers, that isn't relevant- if, that is, an employee is being treated differently from one of the other sex.\n\nSo-if an employer fires or otherwise penalizes a gay, lesbian, or trans employee, is the adverse action \"because of such individual's ... sex\"? Is that employee being exposed to \"disadvantageous terms to which members of the other sex are not exposed\"?\n\nHere's the \"yes\" argument: A woman attracted to, sexually involved with, or married to a man would be fine with this employer; a man in the same position would not. Congress in 1964 might not have understood the connection, but the words say what they say. In 1976, the Supreme Court, then all male, decided that discrimination against pregnant women was not \"because of ... sex,\" because, well, some women aren't pregnant. Congress responded promptly to clarify that, in a statutory amendment saying that the words \"'because of sex' or 'on the basis of sex' include, but are not limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.\" That language makes the 1964 \"understanding\" even less relevant.\n\nA brief on behalf of the funeral-home operator by the religious-rights advocacy firm Alliance Defending Freedom makes the \"no\" argument: \"The proper comparison puts [the plaintiff], a man who identifies as the opposite sex, alongside a woman who identifies as the opposite sex.\" In this case, the employer would fire a transgender woman who wanted to wear the male uniform just as it fired the male plaintiff who wanted to wear the female uniform-thus, no discrimination. The brief further argues, \"The concept of 'gender identity' was not part of the American lexicon in 1964.\" Thus, the bill should not now be read to prohibit that kind of discrimination.\n\nThe argument against the \"because of\" relationship, it seems to me, rests on an unspoken, or barely spoken-and perhaps unconscious-assumption about sexual orientation and gender identity. Both of these are obviously related to sex-but only if same-sex attraction ought to exist at all; only, that is, if being gay is an actual mode of being a healthy adult. Until a few decades ago, official psychiatric sources considered homosexuality a \"disorder\"-and many religious conservatives still believe it is a sin that can be \"cured\" by various forms of prayer and conditioning.\n\nAs for transgender people, religious conservatives continue to insist they don't even exist. In a revealing footnote to its brief to the Court, the lawyers for the funeral home explain that while the plaintiff's \"counsel indicates it is proper to refer to Stephens as 'she' and 'a woman,'\" the funeral home does not wish to; instead, the brief \"tries to avoid use of pronouns,\" but when necessary \"uses sex-based language consistent with Title VII's meaning.\"\n\nIn other words, wink wink, Stephens is deluded about who she is. \"Transgender,\" in this view, is the equivalent of a person who says she is a unicorn. An employer who fired a male employee for insisting he was a female unicorn is not discriminating because of sex, but because of unicorn delusion. Effectively, the right sought by the employers is not merely to discriminate against LGBTQ people; it is to proclaim that, as a matter of law, they do not exist.\n\nIn other words, they need to get over themselves. That would be a devastating result."

      "text": "How Gay Culture Helped Everyone Come Out of the Closet\n\nThe queer-rights movement, Dan Savage argues, helped American culture do something it has traditionally been reluctant to do: talk honestly and openly about sex.\n\nThis is, in the United States, an age of (relative) sexual liberation: Sex outside of marriage is common to the point of normalcy. Homosexuality and gender fluidity are increasingly accepted as natural expressions of human sexuality. Sex, in general, is the subject of public and open discussion in a way it hasn't been before. Within the space of only a few generations-and with an acceleration that occurred over just the past several decades-American culture has done what in the centuries before would have seemed unimaginable: It has become (mostly, sort of, relatively) comfortable with sex.\n\nYou can attribute at least some of that, says the sex columnist and LGBTQ advocate Dan Savage, to the queer rights movement-and to the speedy normalization of gay culture in American life that arose as a result of its efforts. As more and more gay characters appeared on TV, and as more actors and athletes came out and encouraged their non-famous counterparts to do the same, and as queer rights advocates worked with their communities, Americans in general became, quickly, much more aware than they had been about gay life. And with that came an awareness, too, of gay sex.\n\nThat changed things for the better, and not just for the LGBTQ community. As Savage said today in a conversation at the Aspen Ideas Festival, co-sponsored by the Aspen Institute and The Atlantic : \"Gay people coming out, in the face of judgment and shame, about their sexual expressions encouraged a lot of straight people to express their sexual identities beyond just 'I want to meet someone, get married, and have some babies.'\"\n\nAmerican cultural life is still-still!-informed by our origin story: Americans, when it comes to sex as well as many other things, tend to maintain, in subtle ways and not-so-subtle ones, what Savage termed \"this puritan hatred of pleasure.\" Gay sex, however, disentangles sexual pleasure from the possibility of procreation: It exists for itself, and for its participants, on its-and on their-own terms. (Or, as Savage put it: \"Gay people were the original recreational sex-ers.\") And their awareness of that kind of pleasure-for-pleasure's-sake sexual expression, Savage said, helped to create a model for straight sex that emphasized desire over obligation, and pleasure over guilt.\n\nOne thing in particular helped to bring gay sex to the forefront of the American consciousness, Savage argued: the AIDS crisis. The crisis, when it was finally discussed openly in American culture, in some ways flipped traditional ideas of what was permissible, and what was deviant, in sex. \"Things that were 'normal' were suddenly less safe than things that were 'perverse,'\" Savage said. Sexual activities that had been held up as signs of moral depravity-oral sex and the like-were suddenly safer than penetrative sex. As a result: \"I think the AIDS epidemic,\" Savage said, \"forced people to talk about not the sex we thought we should be having, but the sex we were actually having.\"\n\nAnd that permission for frankness opened the door, Savage suggested, for straight people to think more liberally-and more permissively-about their own sex lives. As gay culture left the shadows, the sense of sex as pleasure alone came out along with it. \"I really think that that changed the way people talk about sex,\" Savage said, \"and the way that they're entitled to sex and desire.\" That forced the members of an aggressively heteronormative culture to question, for themselves, what sex is really for. And it opened up the possibility, formerly foreclosed by Americans' latent puritanism, that sex could exist, if you wanted it to, for pleasure alone.\n\nOr, as Savage summed it up: \"A lot of closets were opened after gay people came out of them.\""

      "text": "The Mormon Church Tries to Create a Little More Space for LGBTQ Families\n\nBut for many current and former members, the consequences of a former policy cannot be undone. Their relationships-with the Church, with their families, and with God-have been irreparably damaged.\n\nTom Christofferson was in the shower on Thursday morning when he missed a phone call with huge implications for the lives of LGBTQ Mormons and their families.\n\nChristofferson is gay. His brother, Todd Christofferson, is a member of the highest body of authority in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Todd was calling Tom to let him know that the LDS Church was about to roll back a controversial 2015 policy that automatically labeled Mormons in same-sex marriages apostates and barred their minor children from being baptized-a rite required for membership in the LDS Church and seen as necessary for eternal salvation. Under the new policy, same-sex marriages are still considered a \"serious transgression,\" according to a Church announcement, but not definitively apostasy. The children of LGBTQ couples can now be baptized.\n\nThe presence of LGBTQ Mormons is an undeniable reality in the LDS Church. The Church acknowledged the widespread pain caused by the former policy: \"While we cannot change the Lord's doctrine, we want our members and our policies to be considerate of those struggling with the challenges of mortality,\" said Dallin Oaks, one of two counselors to the president of the LDS Church, in a statement.\n\nUnder the new policy, LDS teachings on same-sex relationships and transgender identity haven't changed, but the language around them has shifted. Married LGBTQ Mormons are no longer automatically labeled apostates, and they are put on slightly more even footing with straight couples: \"Immoral conduct in heterosexual or homosexual relationships will be treated in the same way,\" Oaks wrote in the announcement. Children living with these couples can be baptized, as long as parents know that they will be taught that LGBTQ relationships are wrong.\n\nRead: The changing ways parents react to their kids coming out of the closet\n\nThe new policy will create space for LGBTQ Mormons and their families to engage more comfortably in their Church communities, and many hope it means they will find greater welcome there. The former policy \"caused a lot of pain and turmoil to people that I love,\" Christofferson said. \"I know a number of folks for whom that was a breaking point.\" Although Christofferson openly identifies as gay and left the Church for a number of years while he was in a relationship with another man, he has since rejoined the Church. For other LGBTQ Mormons, \"my hope is, now that [the policy has] changed, they will consider rejoining and worshipping with us and help us to keep moving forward,\" he said. For many current and former Mormons, however, the consequences of the 2015 policy cannot be undone. Their relationships-with the Church, with their families, and with God-have been irreparably damaged.\n\nLDS leaders consider both the 2015 policy and Thursday's new policy to be matters of revelation, even though one effectively reverses the other. \"The public by and large, and Mormons in particular, tend to think of revelation in very dramatic, charismatic ways,\" says Terryl Givens, a Mormon historian at the University of Richmond. \"In the founding days of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, revelation often was spectacular and involved visions, visitations, audible voices that Joseph Smith [the founder of the Church] heard.\"\n\nBut as this new announcement demonstrates, Church leaders clearly heard the objections from LDS community members. In a living faith tradition like Mormonism, relationships-between neighbors, relatives, or, say, a gay Mormon and his brother in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles-have the power to shape the context of revelation. \"The historical record would suggest that [Church leaders] are open to concerns, to historical developments, to scholarly input,\" Givens said. \"Revelation never occurs in a vacuum.\"\n\nEven with this new policy change, LGBTQ Mormons occupy a fraught space in LDS life. Those in same-sex relationships, or who have gone through a gender transition, live with the knowledge that their choices are condemned by Church teachings. And for LGBTQ believers, the theological consequences of their sexuality and identity are serious: Mormons teach that families can be bound together for eternity, and LGBTQ families are not included in that vision. Although the LDS Church has tried, in its way, to welcome LGBTQ Mormons, this core theological teaching is not likely to change. \"For Latter-day Saints, it was not just a matter of sociological debates as to the merits or demerits of gender transformation,\" Givens said. \"The point that is nonnegotiable for Latter-day Saints is that gender is eternal.\"\n\nThe former LDS policy on married LGBTQ couples and their children was announced in November 2015, just months after the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges , which legalized same-sex marriage in the United States. \"When the Supreme Court made its decision, and it became the law of the land ... the Latter-day Saints said, 'We will obey the law of the land,'\" says Kathleen Flake, a scholar of Mormon history at the University of Virginia. But, she says, the Church also added, \"Let us restate that it's not lawful marriage in the eyes of the Church.\"\n\nAt the time, in a letter to Church leaders announcing the 2015 policy, former LDS President Thomas Monson wrote that \"revealed doctrine is clear that families are eternal in nature and purpose,\" and the policy on apostasy and forbidden baptism was designed to protect \"the welfare of both adults and children.\" This was partly motivated by a desire to protect families from painful divisions, Todd Christofferson said in an interview shortly after the announcement: \"We don't want the child to have to deal with issues that might arise where the parents feel one way and the expectations of the Church are very different.\" Following that logic, the former policy prevented children of LGBTQ couples from being baptized into a Church that their parents could not be part of.\n\nRead: The LGBT politics of Christian colleges\n\nMany LGBTQ Mormons and their families found this hurtful, and \"spoke up about their concern and their sorrow over that policy,\" says Erika Munson, the founder of an organization called Mormons Building Bridges, which encourages \"love and acceptance\" for LGBTQ people. To these Mormons, the 2015 policy didn't \"feel like the Gospel of Jesus Christ,\" she says. \"Figuring out what the will of the Lord is is hard. And it's a lifelong process.\"\n\nOn a practical level, the 2015 policy cut many LGBTQ families off from participation in LDS communities. Parents couldn't stay even loosely connected to the Church through their children, and some felt that it was cruel for the Church to ostracize kids because of their parents' choices and identities. And the \" apostate\" label was painful: John Gustav-Wrathall, the executive director of Affirmation, an organization that offers support and community to LGBTQ Mormons, says he would \"have that question in the back of my head: Do people look at me and see me as an apostate?\" Apostasy essentially means someone is leading others away from the Church, he said-it's \"one of the worst things you can be.\" Although Gustav-Wrathall is in a same-sex relationship and was excommunicated in the 1980s, he is an active member of a ward, or local church, in Minneapolis. The 2015 policy introduced an extra layer of stigma, he says, but eventually, \"I had to just trust that people knew me. ... They knew of my love for the Gospel and my faith in Jesus Christ.\"\n\nOther LGBTQ Mormons-and their families-left the church over the policy. Although LDS policies are guided by the central authority of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, local leaders have some degree of autonomy in how they deal with individual cases, and that can make all the difference in whether LGBTQ people find welcoming space in Mormon communities. The 2015 policy took away some of that flexibility, adding extra strain to family relationships and friendships-and people's faith. \"There was a lot of suffering caused by the policy, and it's going to be hard for a lot of hearts to heal from that,\" says Gustav-Wrathall. Like others, he draws a connection between the policies of the LDS Church and the high rate of suicide among LGBTQ teens in Utah, while acknowledging that it's impossible to know the cause of most suicides. \"What parents must be feeling,\" he said, is: \"Would my child still be here with me if this policy hadn't happened?\"\n\nDespite all of this pain, many LDS leaders say they want to invite LGBTQ people into the Church-and some LGBTQ people want to be there. \"My life has been blessed by people that I have profound disagreements with,\" Gustav-Wrathall says. \"I can't be a good disciple of Jesus Christ if I'm out of fellowship with any other member of the human race ... At some point, God is going to resolve this difference for us. And at some point, whatever scales there are on any of our eyes will fall away.\""

According to the ACLU , nearly 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced in state legislatures nationwide so far this year, many focused on trans people.\n\n\"What we found is alarming,\" Data for Progress reported. \"A worse quality of life and mental health, experiences of discrimination and harassment, and difficulties accessing health care.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA majority of LGBTQ+ adults (53 percent)-including 79 percent of transgender adults and 65 percent of LGBTQ+ adults, ages 18 to 24-said that recent anti-LGBTQ+ policies and rhetoric have negatively impacted their mental health. Sixty-five percent of transgender adults said quality of life had gotten worse for LGBTQ+ Americans in the past year. Forty-four percent of transgender adults said that they have considered moving or already moved out of their community or state as a result of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation. Sixty-one percent of trans adults had heard anti-trans remarks from a family, friend, co-worker, or neighbor.\n\nMore than 60 percent of transgender adults told Data for Progress they were concerned the following actions would result in LGBTQ+ discrimination or harassment: going to a new health care provider to receive care (73 percent); using a public bathroom (68 percent); going to non-LGBTQ+ bars or nightclubs (64 percent); and engaging in public displays of affection with their significant other (62 percent).\n\nResponding to the survey, Delphine Luneau, a spokesperson with the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), told The Daily Beast, \"There's not much in these survey results that's going to come as a surprise to most trans people-we know that in a lot of contexts, our safety and wellbeing are not prioritized by those we interact with, that we're being lied about and treated as a political football, and that the people who demonize us are often happy to say so to our faces. I have had a lot of these same experiences and fears myself.\n\n\"But here's what we do know: the more people know us, the more likely they are to support us existing fully and openly and joyfully, and in the cities and states where our rights are protected, often that is exactly what is happening. That's why the Human Rights Campaign works tirelessly with our allies to pass laws that ensure transgender people can live complete, fulfilling lives without discrimination or fear.\"\n\nLast year-foreshadowing the 2024 survey results of Data for Progress-HRC itself declared a state of emergency for LGBTQ+ Americans for the first time in its four-decade history, as a result of the more than 75 anti-LGBTQ+ bills that were signed into law in 2023. At the time, HRC called it \"an unprecedented and dangerous spike in anti-LGBTQ+ legislative assaults sweeping state houses.\"\n\n\"Over the last several years we have seen a record number of bills targeting the LGBTQ+ community-particularly trans and non-binary people, and particularly young people,\" Data for Progress spokesperson Rob Todaro told The Daily Beast. \"We know that LGBTQ+ young people are placed at significantly increased risks of mental health challenges and suicide because of the way they are treated. This poll shines a light on the real harm caused to people's lives by this barrage of attacks.\n\n\"Trans people are a small population of people, who have received so much attention from Republicans and right-wing media really trying to stir up hysteria to distract from Republicans' other unpopular policies,\" Todaro added. \"Republicans want to make this election about transgender athletes and what healthcare trans kids and their families can and can't receive-to distract from the fact that Republicans want to cut Social Security and give tax breaks to the rich, and do anything Donald Trump says they should do.\"\n\nThe report \"emphasizes the importance of LGBTQ+-affirming communities, policies, representation in media, and online spaces and resources for LGBTQ+ people,\" its authors write, finding that more than 3 in 4 LGBTQ+ adults say they would prefer to: live in cities or states that have passed pro-LGBTQ+ policies and nondiscrimination protections (82 percent); work at a company that has stated policies protecting its LGBTQ+ workers (86 percent); and buy from brands that have publicly supported the LGBTQ+ community (76 percent).\n\nAdditionally, majorities of transgender adults (68 percent), LGBTQ+ adults ages 18 to 24 (57 percent), Latino LGBTQ+ adults (51 percent), and Black LGBTQ+ adults (51 percent) said that LGBTQ+ representation in media was important to the process of discovering their LGBTQ+ identity.\n\nTodaro said that while TDOV offered a moment to celebrate the \"monumental progress of the last decade for the LGBTQ+ community, including the transgender community, especially in terms of increased visibility in the media and public affairs, the survey also shows there is a lot we still have to reckon with-in the disparities we see within the LGBTQ+ community, and in the challenges trans people face every day.\"\n\nSenior Editor and Writer\n\ntim.teeman@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "LGBTQ Books Are Being Banned. Their Authors Are Fighting Back.\n\nSenior Editor and Writer\n\nAt a pre-publication meeting with their publishers, the award-winning journalist and author George M. Johnson had predicted their acclaimed \"memoir-manifesto\" All Boys Aren't Blue , would get banned.\n\n\"Now it's getting out of hand,\" Johnson told The Daily Beast.\n\nSo far, Johnson said, the book, which focuses on their experience of growing up Black and queer in New Jersey, had been targeted for removal in at least 14 states. School boards and libraries across the country are considering or facing demands around the banning of a range of titles-themed around race, sexuality and gender-aimed at young readers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJohnson told The Daily Beast that their book had first been negatively cited at a school board meeting in September.\n\n\"When you grow up as a Black, queer person you just know that the white powers-that-be don't have a liking for you telling a narrative that doesn't center them, especially when you put it into the hands of teenagers,\" Johnson said. \"I knew the book would have some kind of pushback, but nothing like this.\"\n\nThe multi-award-winning gay author Edmund White-whose most recent book is the just-published A Previous Life -noted to The Daily Beast that \"Hitler banned books and burned them, and various regimes to this day still do, like Russia.\"\n\nWhite said he had cousins in Texas, \"real pious Baptists, who definitely are of that kind who want to root out the type of stuff they see as a sin, and against God's plan, and leading young people astray by suggesting being LGBTQ could be normal, acceptable behavior. My cousins drive around in big Cadillacs, with flashcards on the visors so they can memorize passages from the Bible at the stoplight.\"\n\n\"Christianity seems to be losing its hold over people, but remains a powerful force in some communities, and social media exacerbates hostility around issues like this,\" White said. \"Christianity is waning, white superiority is waning, Trumpism is waning-all of which is making very religious people more intransigent over issues like what books children can and cannot read.\"\n\nAs the New York Times reported , the relentless flood of proposed book bans is dizzying in both scale and overtly political animus. The Daily Beast reported this week how a 10th grade English class in North Carolina is no longer allowed to read the acclaimed book Dear Martin , about a teen's experience of racial profiling, after one parent complained that it contained profanity.\n\nThe Daily Beast has also reported how Johnson's books, and others, often have spurious allegations of \"pornography\" leveled against them as a reason to ban them. Students themselves are rebelling over efforts to stop them from being able to read titles like Maia Kobabe's Gender Queer .\n\nFor Johnson, the book-banning rush is connected to the renewed efforts by those on the right to strike down Roe v. Wade and stripping away voting rights, as well as the multi-state proliferation of legislative attacks on LGBTQ people , particularly trans people.\n\n\"This is all part of the white majority's effort to try and protect their demographic and control the population. It is always stated that white people will be the minority in this country by 2050, but we are watching the demographic shift happen faster than that, so now districts are being redrawn, abortion must be stopped because white women are having too many of them. Gen Z is the most diverse population this country has ever seen, so now these books must be banned so whiteness can remain the most powerful thing and most powerful conditioning tool as the school system begins to look more diverse.\"\n\nJohnson said they were not surprised that Black LGBTQ storytellers like him were being singled out. \"Black LGBTQ people create the culture, lingo, slang, style of dress. A lot of that comes from Black femmes, Black non-binary people, Black transgender women. Things are appropriated and stolen from us, but now we are in an age where we get to tell the truth about us, and live as culture creators. This is very fearful for a population who was always able to steal from us and commodify it.\"\n\nThe more identities are blurred, \"the less power those in identities who have always held power have,\" Johnson said. As equity grows, the less access to the tools of discrimination the white power-holders have, they added.\n\nJohnson is hopeful that Gen Z will reject old prejudices, and is also optimistic that an even younger generation will reject sexism, racism, and anti-LGBTQ beliefs. \"I grew up looking at white kids a certain way because of the way their parents had indoctrinated them to see Black people. Now I watch young heterosexual cousins having trans friends, and it's just not a thing.\"\n\nFor White, the bans show how \"the friendly exchange of ideas and honorable opposition have faded as ideas. Opposition is something that now you want to exterminate. This is part of a larger movement we see in the January 6th attack on the Capitol, and Trump's rallies. The real issue is the linking of evangelical Christianity and the extreme right. That combination is really deadly. All violence feels justified to them because they are trying to root out the devil, and they really believe in the devil and God's word. There is no room for free discourse for them. They worry these books will 'convert' their children.\"\n\nWhite noted the power of LGBTQ-themed books; his A Boy's Own Story remains a coming-out classic. He recalls getting a letter from a 16-year-old from Ghana, saying how much it had meant to them. \"And you think what could this story written by a privileged white boy, who grew up in the 1950s in the Midwest in the Eisenhower era, say to a young guy in Ghana in the 1980s? But it goes to show that feelings of desire, self-hatred, conflicts with family and religion are universal.\"\n\nThe effect of having bans placed on their work had profoundly affected Johnson. \"To have someone attack your story and then spew it out to the world hits you in places you never knew existed,\" Johnson said. \"I do feel supported, by teachers, librarians, and parents. My own parents have been very vocal and supportive. They both read it, my mom knew it all. But for my dad, a 70-year-old Black heterosexual man, to get through it and feel proud is something.\"\n\nJohnson told The Daily Beast it had been alarming to see people bring guns to school board meetings, but \"as a Black queer person there is never not a time when I'm not thinking about my safety. Safety is part of my existence. I do feel we are winning in the court of public opinion. But as loud as conservatives can be, I am not seeing so-called progressives be as loud.\n\n\"You can't just be loud about the Voting Rights Act or whatever the thing is that gets you the most clicks. You have to be as loud about other issues. You can't just pick a hot topic and lean into it all the way and forget everything else that is going on-especially if you are a person of color or Black person in Congress. If you're watching your own people being attacked you have to say something-the same goes for white allies and advocates because they have even more privilege and power.\"\n\nJohnson paused. \"But whether they do or not, I'm going to keep running my mouth.\"\n\nWhite laughed as he recalled when his book, The Joy of Gay Sex (1977), co-written with Charles Silverstein, \"ran into some trouble\" in Canada. \"There was this woman who complained she thought she was buying The Joy of Cooking , and looked up 'Chicken' and was very shocked.\"\n\n\"In those days, it was even more sinister than today,\" said White. \"Books were just silently removed from shelves.\"\n\nBook-banning was \"embedded in the fabric\" of America, said Johnson, pointing to the example of Phyllis Wheatley, the first African American woman to publish a book of poetry, who was forced to defend her own authorship of poetry in court. \"What is happening now is not modern,\" said Johnson. \"It is history repeating itself, and a history no one knows about.\"\n\nJohnson said a coalition of students, parents, and librarians across the country were successfully mobilizing to counter the bans. The publicity the story was generating also undermining the banners' intent, in that it was just eliciting more interest for the books under attack.\n\n\"Sure, you may get me banned in one place, but it equals more access in six others, so thanks for that,\" Johnson told The Daily Beast. \"This is only making me more determined to put more of my work into the world because you can't ban it all. I've already put queerness into the young adult space, I'm going to put it in the middle grade space. I'm going to put it in every space it is allowed to be put in. Our stories deserve to be told because we've always existed.\"\n\nSenior Editor and Writer\n\ntim.teeman@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Biden and Top Dems Need to Throw Some Punches for LGBTQ Rights\n\nThe United States is experiencing its worst wave of homophobia in decades.\n\nHatred for LGBTQ people has roared back into American life with the amplification of Republican governors , senators , and propagandists . State legislatures across the country have proposed approximately 240 anti-LGBT bills . And high-ranking Republican officials have likened law-abiding gay and trans teachers, government employees, and librarians to pedophiles.\n\nChristian Nationalists and far-right extremists are running on the noxious fumes of paranoid conspiracy theories involving secretive cabals of sex traffickers, maniacal pederasty, and devious plots in schools, libraries, and pizza parlors. As a consequence, states like Florida (with its infamous \"Don't Say Gay\" policy), have passed laws eliminating LGBTQ history from school curricula, and banned books with gay or trans protagonists from libraries. Under the old con of \"religious liberty,\" several states are also proposing to allow business owners and medical providers to discriminate against LGBTQ customers and patients. The Texas Republican Party, in its official platform , makes no attempt to even conceal its agenda of persecution. Denigrating homosexuality as an \"abnormal lifestyle choice,\" the Texas GOP announced opposition against \"all efforts to validate the transgender lifestyle,\" and denied the Log Cabin Republicans an opportunity to participate in its convention.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs the unhinged QAnon conspiracy theory has become increasingly influential within mainstream Republican Party politics, some of its adherents have ascended to Congress and right-wing media stardom. Mayra Flores , after winning a congressional seat in Texas, will soon join the Q-caucus alongside Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert.\n\nThe belief that Hollywood, the Democratic Party, and major media publications are collaborators in a widespread pedophiliac campaign against American children, coupled with the false notion that people with same sex attraction are likelier to abuse minors, is not only enabling legislative homophobia, but also an alarming rise in violence against LGBTQ Americans.\n\nPatriot Front, a white supremacist organization, recently attempted to assault participants in an LGBTQ pride parade in Idaho. A few days later, the Proud Boys (no longer content to \"stand by\" ) disrupted a drag queen story hour at a San Francisco library, shouting homophobic slurs and violent threats.\n\nThese are not isolated incidents. Hate crimes against LGBTQ Americans have steadily risen since 2015. The Human Rights Campaign reports that 2021 was the worst year on record for targeted murders of LGBTQ citizens since 2013.\n\nAccording to the American Library Association , the same year saw the worst book banning effort in two decades: Five of the ten \"most challenged books\" in schools and libraries feature LGBTQ content. The targeting of schools has escalated in recent months as right-wing pundits and politicians have advanced the dangerous smear that LGBTQ teachers are \"grooming\" their students for sexual predation.\n\nThe \"grooming\" charge is a resurrection of one of the oldest, and unfortunately, most effective weapons of homophobia.\n\nIn the 1970s, the singer and beauty pageant winner, Anita Bryant , joined forces with the Rev. Jerry Falwell and the religious right to advocate for the revocation of ordinances prohibiting discrimination against gay employees and applicants in the public sector. Bryant's campaign succeeded in Florida and Oklahoma, which banned gays and lesbians from teaching in public schools. Bryant named her hate movement, \"Save Our Children,\" absurdly claiming that gay teachers were \"recruiting\" adolescent boys and girls to their sexual orientation.\n\nWhen I exchanged emails with John D'Emilio , one of the country's most accomplished and influential historians in the field of gay and lesbian studies, about the frightening recrudescence of homophobia, he wrote: \"There is a long history of attacking LGBTQ people, and especially gay men, with the claim that they will corrupt children.\" D'Emilio expressed particular concern for transgendered Americans, who have \"fewer legal protections\" than gays.\n\nAs much as his analysis provided further justification for rage and worry, he also articulated a promise of hope: \"In the past, organized political attacks on the LGBTQ community have led to an upsurge in organizing by the community. As a Chicago activist told a reporter who asked about the impact of Anita Bryant's homophobic campaigns, 'every kick is a boost.'\"\n\nThe Democratic Party should accept the boost, and fight for the full protection and representation of LGBTQ Americans. The party's most prominent officials have demonstrated resistance against rising right-wing homophobic hatred, but as is too often characteristic of Democrats, they've done so with insufficient aggression.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris spoke powerfully at a Pride event in Washington, D.C., and many Democratic governors , senators , and mayors have made similar appearances in their cities, states, and districts. Public declarations of support are laudable, but the anti-LGBTQ hate movement will not end next month, and the Democratic counterpunch should not either.\n\nPresident Joe Biden should also become more consistently involved. He delivered an excellent address at a White House Pride event on June 14, and signed an executive order directing federal agencies to oppose the anti-LGBTQ laws passing at the state level. The president should continue to raise the issue to public prominence, but Democrats must recognize that executive orders are vulnerable to reversal from future presidents.\n\nOnly legislation on the municipal, state, and federal levels can codify protections for LGBTQ Americans-and permanently revoke the gains that right-wing homophobes have made over the past two years. The party boasts a roster of impressive LGBTQ officials who can lead the charge, including Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\n\nDemocrats have overcome their rhetorical passivity on LGBTQ rights, and most of the American public has joined them. A Public Religion Research Institute poll from March 2022 demonstrates that more Americans support anti-discrimination measures for LGBTQ Americans-including gay marriage-than at any point in history.\n\nEven so, there are foreboding indicators that the cultural collision between social liberalism and puritanical hostility is about to grow more severe, and the rights of millions of LGBT Americans hang in the balance. According to an April Politico/Morning Consult poll , only 25 percent of Republican voters object to a political candidate making anti-LGBT remarks. Reactionary right-wing propaganda is beginning to succeed, and Democrats must prevent further regression with a muscular commitment to LGBTQ advocacy in ways legal, political, and cultural.\n\nGiven the centrality of Christian nationalism to the American right, and the importance of LGBTQ voters to the Democratic coalition, weakness in the face of homophobia would amount to political and moral failure.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "This Pride, LGBTQ Allies Need to Do More Than Just Wave Rainbow Flags\n\n\"Happy Pride\" feels a little ironic this year.\n\nBecause along with our parties and parades, the new wave of anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ laws in Republican-led states across the country has been horrifying. To many, it seems to have to come out of nowhere, and it is more vicious, mean, and extreme than anything we've seen in years: banning hormone therapy for trans kids (as Arkansas , Florida , and Texas have done), banning any talk about sexuality or gender (including one's own) in schools, banning books from school libraries, calling every liberal a \"groomer,\" and openly stating that once abortion rights fall, same-sex marriage is next.\n\nIt is terrifying for every queer person, including me, and even more so for every trans person.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJay Brown, a senior vice president at the Human Rights Campaign, said that as a trans man, he \"shares the fear and despair\" that many are feeling right now. \"At the essence, these laws are trying to make sure no trans person exists: providing no support for us in our early lives, making medically necessary health care a felony, prohibiting even mental healthcare. It is hard to find the words for how damaging these laws and policies are.\"\n\nSo how can LGBTQ people, activists, and allies fight back?\n\nThe answers are simple, but not easy. The LGBTQ activists I spoke with were optimistic, in some ways: they've seen the Christian Right and the Republican Party run this playbook before, and they've beaten it before. But, to put it bluntly, it's going to take a lot more people giving a shit about this war on queer people, and voting, speaking out, and getting their friends to do the same, than we've seen so far.\n\nIn other words, it's going to be up to you. So consider these your marching orders.\n\n1. Vote out the bigots\n\nFirst, it's obvious that this wave of attacks is largely about pandering to the Republican party's base of religious fundamentalists (who comprise over half of the party) and angry, white populists who are scared and resentful of any change from how things used to be.\n\nAs Brown put it, \"Of course, our opponents are using these tactics in advance of the midterms in the hope they can turn out their extremist base.  But a lot of this is also rooted in our success. We are more visible and more open about who we are. As a trans person, I see that in a powerful way....  We are part of folks' communities, workplaces, churches, and schools. This is a reaction to that reality.\"\n\nThe way the campaign is unfolding reflects that.  In fact, as new as this wave of laws may seem, a lot of the rhetoric is actually quite old.\n\nAs far back as Anita Bryant in the 1970s and anti-gay paranoia of the 1950s and '60s, conservatives attacked gay people the same way they're attacking trans people and \"groomers\" today. We're child molesters, they said. We're trying to \"recruit\" your kids. (LGBTQ icon Harvey Milk turned that charge on its head, telling gay people in 1977 that he wanted to recruit them to be activists for their civil rights.) We're mentally ill. And, for good measure, we go against God's plan .\n\n\"They're saying the quiet part out loud,\" said Cathryn Oakley, HRC's state legislative director. \"They're not pretending anymore that they care about the efficacy of puberty blockers or whatever...  [Alabama Governor] Kay Ivey just came out and said she doesn't believe trans kids should exist, because that's not how God made them.\"\n\nBut this could actually be good news. Because while this kind of rhetoric may help Ron DeSantis, Greg Abbott, and others burnish their credentials with the Republican base of angry, white religious fundamentalists, it does not reflect the mainstream of public opinion. They've overreached.\n\n\"They have underestimated our community,\" Brown said. \"They are starting to say things that remind us of what they said before: family values, God's plan... It is the same thing they tried to say when gay kids were coming out in the 1990s. This is the same playbook-and we have the muscle to fight back.\"\n\nThat's why every activist I spoke to talked about voting in the upcoming elections. Remember, Ron DeSantis only won his last election by 0.5 percent, and had former felons actually been allowed to vote as Floridians overwhelmingly approved in a referendum, he most likely would have lost. If enough people care about their queer families and friends, he will lose this year.\n\nBut of course, that only works if people who say they care about us f-ing vote accordingly. That's especially true this year, with Republican voter suppression targeted largely at communities of color, with Republican Big-Lie believers now running many state and local elections, and with many voters are focused on inflation and the economy. Allies have to actually f-ing vote.\n\n2. Tell and amplify LGBTQ stories\n\nOf course, people only vote for pro-LGBTQ politicians if they're pro-LGBTQ themselves. And that takes deeper, and more personal, work.\n\nI worked as an LGBTQ activist from 2003 to 2013. Exhaustive research had already shown that greater intergroup contact corresponds with lower intergroup prejudice, whether with regard to people with a different sexuality or gender, or people from a different ethnic group. Ultimately, knowing someone L,G,B,T, or Q was the greatest predictor of supporting our right.\n\nSo, in the 2000s and 2010s, activists focused not only on rights and lawsuits, but on gay visibility in the media ( Will & Grace , Ellen , Brokeback Mountain ) and, even more importantly, in people's churches, schools, and communities.\n\nTo an extent, it worked. Gradually, year by year, support of LGBTQ equality in general and same-sex marriage in particular rose , from 35 percent in 1999 to 60 percent, when Obergefell v. Hodges was decided, to 70 percent today.\n\nRoss Murray, an activist friend of mine from those days who is now the vice president of the GLAAD Media Institute, was part of that work then and now. \"We have to make sure that people know the reality of LGBTQ people's lives, especially trans lives,\" he said. \"They need to know and understand that we are their friends and neighbors and coworkers, and that they don't want to see harm come to people they have a relationship with.\"\n\nCulturally, in the 2000s, Murray and GLAAD worked with shows like Will and Grace- which President Biden has credited with changing his own mind about LGBTQ equality. In the 2020s, they work with visibly transgender celebrities like Laverne Cox or \"regular folks\" like Jeopardy! champion Amy Schneider, who was told by many people that she was the first trans person they'd been exposed to.\n\nThe public work also includes highlighting the stories of actual transgender kids, rather than the mythical ones demonized by politicians like DeSantis. Brown said, \"We have to make sure that people understand what it really means to be a 12-year-old trans kid,\" said Brown. \"It's not about surgery, you're not going to dominate JV lacrosse...  When our opponents lie to people and say 'Do you know what they're doing to these kids?' they make people afraid.\"\n\nThat's why we've seen incredible footage of transgender teens and their parents testifying in front of hostile state legislatures , and even the U.S. Senate , about what trans lives are actually like.\n\nBut this strategy works only up to a point. While 87 percent of Americans report knowing someone gay or lesbian, only 30 percent say they know someone transgender, according to a recent poll . Most Americans don't know someone trans, so they are more susceptible to misinformation and exaggeration.\n\nThat's why allies need to step up.\n\n3. Want to be an ally? Say something\n\n\"This is a moment where we need allies to be courageous,\" said Brandon Wolf, press Ssecretary at Equality Florida, who has been on the front lines fighting that state's so-called \"Don't Say Gay\" law. \"We need people speaking out vocally in solidarity with LGBTQ people-not just at Pride, not just in our circle of friends where it's comfortable, but at city council meeting, talking to their neighbors, their fellow church-goers. The rhetoric of 'grooming' is making life dangerous for LGBTQ people-it's incumbent on allies to be courageous.\"\n\nEvery activist I spoke to cited the now-viral speech by Michigan Senator Mallory McMorrow, who is straight and devoutly Christian but was smeared as a 'groomer' by a colleague, as the perfect example. Said Wolf, \"She is an ally who stood fiercely and refused to back down, and said 'This is why I do what I do, and I'm not going anywhere.' That's what we need from allies right now.\"\n\nUltimately, these personal stories-especially what are called \"feel/felt/found\" stories by allies, meaning \"I understand how you feel, because I felt the same way, but then I found....\" - were shown during the marriage battles to persuade the 'movable middle' to support equality. Such narratives are especially compelling because they give \"permission\" for people to admit their hesitation, the exact opposite of the puritanical \"cancel culture\" that often predominates today.\n\nFor example, President Obama's carefully prepared 2012 interview (with the lesbian journalist Robin Roberts) in which he declared his \"evolution\" on same-sex marriage fit this pattern. \"I was sensitive to the fact that for a lot of people, the word marriage was something that evokes very powerful traditions, religious beliefs, and so forth,\" he said. \"But I have to tell you that over the course of several years, as I talk to friends and family and neighbors,\" his view \"evolved.\"\n\nAllies can also amplify the stories of trans people being misrepresented by opportunistic politicians on social media.  Yes, it means putting yourself at risk of angry trolls, relatives, and even friends. But that risk pales into comparison with the risks a visibly transgender person takes every time they walk down the street. Want to fight the Christian right's lies?  Speak your truth, loudly and clearly.\n\n\"This is a dark time in our nation's history,\" said Wolf. \"We need to lift the stories and experiences of trans folks, non-binary folks, people living at the intersections of marginalized identities. This is a time for allies to lift up those stories, and to share their own stories of why they stand in solidarity with LGBTQ people.\"\n\n4. Here's why there's hope\n\nTo be sure, there's no one action, no one speech, no one law that will turn back this tide.  It's not even solely about queer people: these attacks are part of wider attacks on women, people of color, and immigrants, not to mention \"wokeness,\" democracy, science, and the truth itself. Legal and political activism remains essential, and it is happening.\n\nThe ACLU and others are suing )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/alabama-wants-to-criminalize-medically-necessary-care-for-trans-youth-two-dads-are-fighting-back__;!!LsXw!QzG8MCa2VvUw1H311POrSBQO_3lxa1R_twC49x310dJG2eeWqQNBHhFdPmgTE_ND256-FakS-r-FvMkfQ4CTCj4$\">suing in Texas, Florida and Alabama. GLAAD, HRC, and others are pushing their celebrity and corporate partners to pressure state governments, as Disney has (belatedly) done in Florida. And organizations like Equality Florida continuing their safe schools programs, despite the new law.\n\nMeanwhile, the Biden administration's Department of Justice has warned )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-reinforces-federal-nondiscrimination-obligations-letter-state-officials__;!!LsXw!QzG8MCa2VvUw1H311POrSBQO_3lxa1R_twC49x310dJG2eeWqQNBHhFdPmgTE_ND256-FakS-r-FvMkf-f02n00$\">warned states that many anti-trans laws violate both the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act-a prelude to suing them. Of course, much more needs to be done in the legal and political arenas. Local governments can and must pass laws to protect vulnerable youth, fund LGBTQ service programs, and ensure that no doctor or parent is ever punished for providing appropriate care to a transgender child. And if it weren't for two conservative Democratic Senators, we'd have a national LGBTQ equality bill-not to mention a national reproductive rights bill, action on climate change, and so much more.\n\nUltimately, though, this battle is going to be fought and won by millions of individual people either caring enough to do something, or not. I'll put it bluntly: either you vote for equality, speak out on LGBTQ issues, and get supportive friends and family to vote too, or you can't call yourself an ally, no matter how fierce your pride party looks are.\n\nWe all know that, mostly owing to larger forces global economic instability and the continued effects of the pandemic, America is poised to return Republicans to power. If you're not LGBTQ-identified yourself, I invite you to pause and really imagine what that feels like. My community is under vicious attack, and Americans are about to reward our attackers.\n\nBut, speaking as a confirmed pessimist here, there is reason for hope. The hatred and misinformation that's part of this wave of anti-LGBTQ animus is actually good news, because our enemies are revealing who they really are. And that makes them vulnerable.\n\nHRC's Oakley put it this way. \"If this was a movie,\" she said, \"the person who puts the kid in harm's way to advance their own political career-that person is the villain. These people are the villains. The glimmer of hope that I see is that our opponents have way overplayed their hand.\"\n\njay@jaymichaelson.net\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "The World Is Becoming More LGBTQ-Diverse. TV Should Catch Up.\n\nIt's official: America is queerer than it's ever been before-no matter the anti-trans poison spouted in recent days by Republican politicians including former President Donald Trump in response to the passage of the Equality Act through Congress, which would federally outlaw discrimination against LGBTQ people.\n\nThe Equality Act may or may not be passed in the Senate. If it fails to, it will show how far politics lags behind how people are living their lives.\n\nA recent Gallup poll revealed that 5.6 percent of American adults identify as either lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender-up from 4.5 percent the last time the company collected such data in 2017. Unlike the previous poll, which simply asked participants to answer \"yes or no\" regarding their sexual orientation, Gallup allowed people to self-identify this time around and found that more than half of LGBTQ adults (54.6 percent) identify as bisexual, 24.5 percent as gay, 11.7 percent as lesbian and 11.3 percent as transgender.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs a result, the poll found that more Americans are identifying as LGBTQ across the board, with young Gen Zers being the generational group with the biggest percentage of people who identify as LGBT, at 15.9 percent.\n\nAll of this feels good and almost like a no-brainer given the increased visibility and awareness of LGBTQ culture, people, and rights in the workplace, schools, and across various media. From the increase of gender neutral bathrooms to the inclusion of preferred pronouns on name badges, society has been integrating LGBTQ-friendly norms into everyday life.\n\nThis progress is in stark contrast to the ugly transphobia we witnessed last week as Republicans lined up to proudly voice their bigoted opposition to the Equality Act in Congress-including Marjorie Taylor Greene's vicious insults leveled at colleague Marie Newman's trans child. On Sunday, our twice-impeached former president gave a transphobic speech at CPAC referring to transgender female athletes as \"biological males.\"\n\nHollywood, meanwhile, is trying to embrace diverse representations-even if the pace of change could come quicker.\n\nIf you were to watch most of the television shows out right now that are not from the likes of Shonda Rhimes, Greg Berlanti, Lena Waithe, or Ryan Murphy, you're either getting no positive images of LGBTQ people or tired tropes. I find myself bored with characters coming out as if it's some sort of major reveal that's supposed to shock us.\n\nNothing gets more played out than watching the low-hanging fruit of a female character who shares that they may or may not have \"dipped into the lady pond\" as if they are some risqué daredevil. Rather than normalize LGBTQ lives, current television shows still treat our existence as some sort of spectacle or cautionary tale.\n\nFor example, when watching a recent episode of Grown-ish on Freeform, there was much chatter on social media about one of the male characters, Vivek (played by Jordan Buhat), confessing to his friends that he and his girlfriend had an experimental threesome with another man.\n\nThe entire episode was pretty much a farce of his friends coming to terms with how their non-gay friend could still consider himself heterosexual in spite of a casual encounter with the same sex. Although the script of the episode, called \"Know Yourself,\" was written by Des Moran, who identifies as Black and queer, I felt it was a let-down that a LGBTQ storyline was reduced to a retold experimental sexcapade that ended with the main character involved pronouncing his heterosexuality.\n\nI felt similar disappointment in how Michael K. Williams' queer character of Montrose Freeman was portrayed in the hit HBO show Lovecraft Country . How many miserable Black queer men do I need to watch on television who are struggling with their sexuality or masculinity based on it? Or how many do I need to see played by Williams (still not over Omar Little in The Wire) ?\n\nWhile I found the show to be groundbreaking sci-fi that was filled with breathtaking fantasy sequences, it was deeply devastating that such imagination and creativity could not be given to Freeman or his scorned lover, whose relationship was dysfunctional and fractured by the end. Once again, Black queer viewers like myself were left feeling empty-handed. (Shows like Pose and Euphoria have given us better LGBTQ representation and nuance, but are facing production hurdles due to the pandemic.)\n\nAccording to GLAAD's 2021 report of TV character representation, only 9.1 percent of series regular characters scheduled to appear on broadcast scripted primetime television this season are LGBTQ (70 out of 773)-1 percentage point lower than last year. What's more telling is that the report found that nearly one in every five LGBTQ characters that appear on a series is tied to one of just four creators: Rhimes ( Grey's Anatomy , Bridgerton ), Berlanti ( Supergirl, Arrow , The Flash ), Waithe ( The Chi , Boomerang , Twenties ), and Murphy ( Pose , Ratched , Hollywood , The Politician , American Horror Story ).\n\nIn other words, I can count on less than the number of fingers on my first hand how many television showrunners are committed to keeping LGBTQ representation on air.\n\nAll of this reveals how disjointed representation and progress can appear. In one sense, more is less when watching several LGBTQ characters on channels like FX and Netflix, only to realize that many of them are from shows that are being produced by Rhimes and Murphy. The industry's limited scope of LGBTQ characters is a let-down during a time where more Americans are self-identifying as such.\n\nAnd just when you thought film would be better, those numbers are worse.\n\nGLAAD's 2020 Studio Responsibility Index revealed increased LGBTQ film representation for white cis-gender gay men-but zero transgender film characters three years in a row and a decline for queer people of color. Although more LGBTQ adults are identifying as bisexual, recent films lacked any male characters who identified as such.\n\nJust a little over a third of LGBTQ film characters (34 percent) were people of color (compared to 42 percent the previous year), pushing GLAAD to demand that studios strive to have at least half of their LGBTQ characters be of color by 2022. All of this shows how out of touch the industry is to the current population trends of the audiences they're striving to appeal to.\n\nIf television and film can give us an overrepresentation of violence, thin bodies, wealth, and white people, they sure can offset some of these disparities with more diverse, nuanced, and imaginative LGBTQ characters. For every other cover model love interest that enters a scene, can we get a Black or brown queer character that's in a healthy romantic relationship? Or how about for every fourth hyper-aggressive male archetype written on television, there's a transgender character written to counteract such stale plot-spoilers?\n\nWhatever, both Washington and Hollywood need to wake up, and recognize, respect, and respond to the diversity of the public they serve.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Casey DeSantis Is the Smiling Face of Anti-LGBTQ Activism\n\nIf anybody wondered whether Casey DeSantis shared her husband's distaste for anything deemed \"woke,\" there's no more wondering.\n\nThe first lady of Florida delivered a hard-right video attacking LGBTQ and trans rights, presenting herself as the lead Mama of \"Mamas for DeSantis,\" an arm of the campaign, on a mission to protect children from a litany of imagined horrors-among them Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs and \"child mutilation.\"\n\n\"When you come after our kids, we fight back, because there's nothing we won't do to protect our children. They're not yours,\" she said over a montage of fussy toddlers in masks, footage from Pride parades, and photos of transgender athletes in women's sports. In a practiced air of defiance, she declares, \"We will not allow you to exploit their innocence to advance your agenda.\" Stunning in a royal blue halter top in a light-filled family room, Casey puts a pretty face on a dark message.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome of us had wished she would help her husband dial back some of his virulent rhetoric about LGBTQ rights (after his campaign circulated a transphobic video). Well, we got our answer with Casey jumping directly into the fray and doubling down on the worst aspects of the GOP's parental rights movement.\n\n\"It's surprising because the spouse of the candidate is supposed to soften his image, a role that has been written about ad nauseam,\" says Paul Costello, who worked with first lady Rosalynn Carter and with Kitty Dukakis, when her spouse was the Democratic Party's 1988 nominee. \"She's a likable person who could be a great advocate for her husband. She should let him do whatever he needs to do politically and then tell the story of his family. I don't know what going down the rabbit hole of the culture war gets them.\"\n\nIt doesn't take a political scientist to explain what the DeSantis campaign is doing, but I consulted one anyway. Casey's diatribe about all the evils of wokeness struck Elaine Kamarck at the Brookings Institution as \"reinforcing the (anti-woke) message, that's for sure, and doing it from the female point of view, where they do have trouble with women's issues. It's an effort to mobilize women who are fearful and suspicious of all the cultural change that is going on,\" and those are the women who are the GOP base.\n\nCasey is telling women she's one of them, and that she's concerned about her kids-and ginning up that concern is a way to win back suburban white women who might otherwise vote Democratic because of the Supreme Court's stripping women of the federal right to an abortion in 2022.\n\n\"Adapt or die\" is the adage in politics, as in life, and what Casey DeSantis is doing aligns her with a message guaranteed to inspire an equal or greater reaction on the other side. \"It's an odd campaign strategy but it could work in a Republican primary,\" says Kamarck, where chipping away at Donald Trump's substantial GOP primary polling lead by outflanking him on the right appears to be the DeSantis strategy.\n\nCasey DeSantis is the complete package: mediagenic, smart, and (like her husband) driven by ambition. She's his No. 1 adviser in a closed circle that seems to play mainly to the Twitter universe. So far, judging by the polls, they're making the wrong calls.\n\nDeSantis is running to Trump's right, presenting himself as someone who can get done what Trump started. But, in 2023, portraying Trump as too friendly to the LGBTQ community is a hard sell, even among hard core Republican voters.\n\nCan Casey's intervention rescue their campaign from oblivion? She stands out among the GOP spouses as the only one carving out a public space for herself-with a cheeky demeanor reminiscent of Sarah Palin's \"hockey mom,\" only more dangerously polarizing.\n\nIn the famed poem, \"Casey at the Bat,\" there is no joy in Mudville as the Mighty Casey, passing up two chances to swing that might have had a better result, strikes out with the third. Casey DeSantis is just getting started, taking her first swing.\n\nThere is a long tradition in conservative politics of women taking the lead on social issues, says Jack Pitney, professor of American politics at Claremont McKenna College. He cites Phyllis Schlafly, a mother of six who played an outsized role in Republican efforts to  kill the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), and singer Anita Bryant, whose \"Save the Children\" campaign in the 1970s was a precursor to the policies championed by DeSantis. Bryant eventually lost her job as Florida's citrus commission's brand ambassador because of her anti-gay activism.\n\nCasey DeSantis is playing the long game, betting on her husband to set down some markers that can last beyond 2024. She doesn't have an independent record and it's safe to assume there is no daylight between this native of South Carolina and her husband on policies or politics.\n\nProfile writers may differ over whether she is more like Hillary Clinton, a spouse as ambitious for herself as she is for her husband, or Nancy Reagan, remembered for whispering to her husband when he faltered for words, \"doing everything we can.\"\n\nSoftening their husbands' hard edges wasn't in their portfolios; often it was quite the opposite. Still relative newcomers to the national political scene, we don't know a lot about either DeSantis beyond what they're telling us, and they're telling us they're really, really, really opposed to gay and lesbian and transgender rights.\n\nWe should believe them, even if Trump's voters don't.\n\neleanor.clift@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "LGBTQ Rights Are in Peril-as Senate Marriage Equality Mess Reveals\n\nSenior Editor and Writer\n\nThe news came as no surprise, more a sense of resigned confirmation. There will be no debate or vote on marriage equality in the Senate until after the midterm elections. Democrats accept that there aren't yet the 10 Republican votes to get the vote over the line, but remain optimistic that there will be at some point.\n\nWhere this positivity comes from is a mystery. Some say that Republican senators wouldn't want to vote for the bill before the elections, because a \"no vote\" would not fly with voters, the majority of whom support marriage equality. Republican senators will be more receptive after the midterm elections when they don't have to show their right-wing credentials in tooth and claw.\n\nSome Dems like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wanted the vote to happen, even if it did not succeed, so voters could see how Republican senators voted-and could then vote accordingly in the midterms having again, post- Roe , seen evidence of how out of step Republicans are with mainstream public opinion.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo, pick your narrative. And even if the vote does eventually pass (some think Republicans will sink it whatever happens in November), the fact that this is even an issue in 2022 is yet another depressing yardstick of where LGBTQ rights are in the country. Marriage equality was made the law in 2015, as a result of a decision taken by the Supreme Court. Now the concern is that the same court, packed with right-wing judges-one of whom, Clarence Thomas, has made it clear he is gunning for marriage equality next-may put the law in peril again. So, the idea is to pass marriage equality as federal law and make it untouchable.\n\nThis is where we have reached. We cannot trust the Supreme Court to uphold and respect a law of the land it itself enshrined, hence the need for, well, a new law. A significant piece of our civil rights jigsaw could be removed, and even Democrats who support it are terrified about how best to handle it-and this is a policy the public wholeheartedly supports. It isn't just a mess, it's a tragic, depressing mess. This should not be happening. The news stories about it are couched in the usual lingo of political horse-trading, rather than contemplating and analyzing what a huge failure of democracy it represents that marriage equality should have returned as a hot-button issue.\n\nNone of this, however, comes as any surprise to LGBTQ people who have watched, in the last few years, their rights come under sustained attack, first by the Trump administration and then by Republican-led state legislatures. Their immediate focus has been to pick on the most marginalized of the marginalized-trans youth-seeking to pass laws restricting their rights to gender-affirming healthcare, their ability to go to the bathroom at school, and their ability to play sports at school.\n\nNo matter the startlingly small numbers of trans youth in the states rabidly pursuing such hatred, no matter that they need help rather than state-sponsored persecution. The prohibition enshrined in law, and the cruelty that thrums alongside it, is the point.\n\nThen, most famously in Florida, there have been the \"Don't Say Gay\" bills-aimed at not just stopping discussion of LGBTQ issues and history in schools, but also stigmatizing LGBTQ lives and people, essentially hoping to scare and unsettle kids to go back into the closet, and who knows, try some conversion therapy. There have been the ongoing campaigns to ban LGBTQ-themed books from libraries, and the violent attempts to interfere with the smooth running of Drag Queen Story Hour events, and the hideous bomb threats to hospitals providing gender-affirming care to trans youth. The anti-LGBTQ extremists-legislators and private individuals alike-know no bounds in their efforts to cause harm.\n\nIn Republican-led states, there has been an attempt to not just discriminate against LGBTQ young people, but to invalidate them and who they love and how they wish to live in ever more vicious ways. One of the most heartening things has been to see young people themselves fight back. Even if a terrible law isn't immediately changed, they have inspiringly shown they will not be victims.\n\nHowever, none of this mitigates the parlous state of LGBTQ equality and rights in this country. These rights are under constant attack by a right-wing that does not just feverishly hate LGBTQ people but wishes to do them as much harm as possible, in not just state houses but the Supreme Court and in their day-to-day lives.\n\nThe calculated destruction of LGBTQ rights is being used as a trial balloon by Republicans to see just how far they can go in their efforts to introduce their brand of authoritarianism. And there has been no effective mass pushback against it-fine words, for sure, especially during Pride month. But generally those opposed to LGBTQ equality seem far more motivated in their destructive mission than those politicians who claim to cherish it.\n\nThere is a disconnect between how much Americans say they support LGBTQ equality, and many of their political representatives doing all they can to undermine it. The next challenge for LGBTQ organizations and their allies and supporters, and the Democratic Party if it is serious in its supportive intent, is to go beyond expressing shock and whining that Americans support LGBTQ rights every time an anti-LGBTQ bill is debated or passed. We know: Americans don't support such bills, sure, got that thanks-but the bills are still being introduced and passed.\n\nThose same organizations need to galvanize those Americans ticking the right box on surveys to make their support of LGBTQ people far more active-in mass lobbying of their public representatives, in demonstrations, and other activism. It is not enough to say the right thing about LGBTQ equality on paper; it is also not enough to present those statistics as a shield every time something terrible passes into law. Now is the time for action.\n\n\"The right side of history\" is often invoked as a natural endpoint that means LGBTQ equality will ultimately be assured, whatever hideous bill is under discussion in whatever news cycle. It's a misty, feel-good illusion, based on people kind of doing the right thing, and kind of voting the right way, and everyone kind of coming to an understanding that justice and equality are good things. Kind of . Eventually.\n\nBut \"the right side of history\" has never been a natural progression point for LGBTQ rights. Yes, there has been progress, but for all the many steps forward, there have been many steps back-and in recent years the steps back have been immense, and they have been bolstered by a gale of ugly anti-LGBTQ bigotry online.\n\nActivists and politicians need to stop crowing about sympathetic public surveys. Republican politicians, and bigots generating clicks and hate, don't give a damn about them. Everyone needs to stop saying, \"We are on the right side of history.\" It sounds smug, self-complacent and means nothing, until you galvanize a far greater critical mass of public support to actively campaign and vote for America to get there.\n\nUntil then, all the hoping and wishing that politicians and voters will do the right thing and that we'll almost by happy coincidence end up on \"the right side of history\" will count for nothing. The mess over marriage equality in the Senate isn't an administrative blip. It isn't a great tactical maneuver. The fact that we are debating and worrying about it seven years after we thought it was won is a stubbornly persistent and sad symbol of where LGBTQ rights have reached in this country. Only intense campaigning and public engagement will resolve this, and, if successful, finally put us on a surer, more purposeful footing to \"the right side of history.\"\n\nSenior Editor and Writer\n\ntim.teeman@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "This Pride Month, the LGBTQ Community Must Confront Its Racism\n\nAs Pride Month begins, my fiancé and I can't even begin to think about celebrating it right now.\n\nWe are both black gay millennials watching our country burn before our very eyes. Another black man, black woman, and black transgender person was killed by the police. Our rage and heart breaks as we see protesters be further terrorized and tear-gassed by cops.\n\nLast week, George Floyd , a 46-year-old unarmed black man, was killed on the ground on tape in broad daylight. Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old unarmed black woman, was shot to death after police allegedly executed a search warrant of the wrong house. Tony McDade, a 37-year old black trans-masculine person, was killed during a suspicious police encounter.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor all of this to happen in the middle of a global pandemic that is disproportionately afflicting black people is beyond triggering, but another reminder of how our lives continue to be devalued, underrepresented, and further marginalized.\n\nAs I begin to see people post rainbows on social media and remind others that it's Pride Month, I begin to reflect on my own relationship within this very community.\n\nThe mainstream LGBTQ community and movement as we know it has been dominated by white cisgender men and women who have socially, institutionally, and culturally excluded black people. Although more than 50 years ago, black transgender women such as Marsha P. Johnson and other queer activists of color risked their lives during the historic Stonewall Riots -we are still witnessing racial discrimination and antagonism in the fight for queer liberation.\n\nI write this while living in Philadelphia, a city with an infamous racist history etched into its diversity. Thirty-five years ago, the MOVE Bombing , a tragedy that involved the \"City of Brotherly Love and Sisterly Affection\" authorizing a bomb to drop in a black neighborhood as a response to a black protesting group, killed eleven black people, including five children.\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney has yet to formally apologize on behalf of the city for a racial nightmare that continues to haunt the poorest major municipality in America.\n\nI watched this weekend as protesters defaced and set fire to the Frank Rizzo statue, created in honor of the former Philly mayor who had a racist and homophobic history of enforcing police brutality. Racism in this town is as Philadelphian as its celebrated cheesesteak.\n\nIt was only a few years ago that I was extensively covering racial discrimination in Philadelphia's Gayborhood, an LGBTQ section of the city. White gay bars racially profiled black patrons, with one owner even going as far as calling one the n-word on tape .\n\nLocal black and brown queer activists led the charge in getting the City of Philadelphia, who had dragged its feet on addressing the problem, to respond with a new law and a progressive addition of black and brown stripes on the Pride flag.\n\nBut that didn't immediately fix the ongoing devastation that continued to set black LGBTQ people apart from their white counterparts. Locally and nationally, black members of the LGBTQ community are often hit the hardest in terms of disparity. And although there has been more awareness campaigns and reports on this, black queer and transgender people continue to be underrepresented in LGBTQ leadership, media, and visibility .\n\nCurrently, there's been public gestures from some LGBTQ companies trying to appeal to their black audience. Grindr, which has had a history of racism taking place on their dating app, informed users that they were donating to black LGBTQ nonprofits and eliminating their ethnicity filter option for good.\n\nBut it's still very hard right now to see these predominately white-led LGBTQ companies, nonprofits, and groups try to sell me their version of \"pride\" in the middle of racial unrest in America. It's hard to take any of these groups seriously after seeing how silent they are when racial oppression takes place daily in their own backyards.\n\nThe hypocrisy of only speaking up when racism is affiliated with white cisgender straight people-and being silent when it's happening within the LGBTQ community-is glaring.\n\nTruth be told: My blackness never felt included in what mainstream society's view of the LGBTQ \"community\". In fact, the more I stay quarantined, the more I begin to question exactly what such a \"community\" ever looked like.\n\nFor what it's worth, there needs to be a true racial reckoning within the LGBTQ movement that calls for real accountability and change from white gay people. Black queer and trans bodies have been exploited, underpaid, and overworked. We have been fetishized and targeted, while being gaslighted simultaneously. I can no longer discuss LGBTQ issues monolithically knowing how segregated we are as a community.\n\nWhen I say that #BlackTransLivesMatter, it's because even within the transgender community at large-it's black transgender people who are disproportionately being killed and left impoverished. When I call for more support for black gay men living with HIV, that is because the larger LGBTQ community, along with society overall, has allowed for the virus to disrupt this particular demographic without much disruption.\n\nSo if there will be anything I'm going to \"celebrate\" during Pride Month is another awakening that my black queer identity, along with my other melanated LGBTQ siblings, is sacred. I will no longer allow it to be compromised alongside the margins of a white supremacist LGBTQ structure that treats me as less than.\n\nWe are all we got. \"We\" being black LGBTQ people.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "The Supreme Court's Decision on Anti-LGBTQ Discrimination Is Incoherent\n\nOn ideological lines, the conservative-supermajority Supreme Court today voted 6-3 to allow a Colorado web designer to refuse to design websites for same-sex couples.\n\nNo doubt, Republicans and others on the right will celebrate this decision, 303 Creative v. Elenis , in broad terms: businesses may now \"turn away the gays.\"\n\nBut Justice Neil Gorsuch , who wrote the Court's opinion, insists otherwise. No, no, no, Justice Gorsuch assures us: you can't turn away the gays, you can only turn away gay weddings .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf you see a distinction there, then the Court's opinion makes sense. If you don't, then it's preposterous.\n\nJustice Gorsuch is definitely right on the technical details of the law. The web designer in the case, Lorie Smith, has stipulated that she'll make a website for anyone, queers included. What she won't do, though, is make a website celebrating a gay wedding, because she thinks those weddings are \"false.\"\n\nSo, technically, she's not discriminating against gay people, see? And then the case starts to look different, because Colorado, whose anti-discrimination law protects LGBTQ people, would be forcing her to say things she doesn't believe. This ends up being a free speech case, and the web designer wins.\n\nBut Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in her dissent, completely refuses this framing. The designer is \"a business open to the public seek[ing] to deny gay and lesbian customers the full and equal enjoyment of its services.\" Full and equal enjoyment-meaning, I as a gay person get to utilize those services the same way a straight person does. That makes this case about what, in legal terms, is known as \"public accommodations\" because there's no distinction between status and conduct.\n\nSupporters of web designer Lorie Smith and counter-protesters demonstrate in front of the U.S. Supreme Court Building on Dec. 5, 2022, in Washington, DC.\n\nCan you hang a sign on your door saying \"No Blacks Allowed\" or \" No Jews Allowed \"? No-even if you really don't like Blacks or Jews, and even if you have a religious reason for doing so. Likewise here.\n\nOr, in Justice Sotomayor's words, quoting an earlier case, 303 Creative \"cannot define their service as 'opposite-sex wedding [websites]' any more than a hotel can recast its services as 'whites-only lodgings.'\"\n\nMoreover, Justice Sotomayor continued, Smith isn't just saying she personally won't type the words for a website. She's saying that her for-profit company, 303 Creative, wants to publicly advertise their services to everyone, but then withhold them categorically from all gay customers.\n\nThere were many other ways that Smith could have accommodated her religious beliefs, writes Justice Sotomayor. \"The company could, for example, offer only wedding websites with biblical quotations describing marriage as between one man and one woman... [it] could also refuse to include the words \"Love is Love\" if it would not provide those words to any customer. All the company has to do is offer its services without regard to customers' protected characteristics.\"\n\nBut of course, that's not really what this case is about.\n\nSmith, and, more accurately, the Alliance Defending Freedom and other Christian Right groups supporting her, wanted to make that broad statement. They wanted to say exactly what Justice Gorsuch says they aren't saying: that it's OK to turn away the gays.\n\nWhich, obviously, is how this opinion will be received. No doubt, the GOP presidential candidates will praise it in their press releases. No doubt, it will be perceived as part of the widespread backlash against LGBTQ (especially trans) equality, and will pave the way for future decisions that expand this right. Everybody knows this. It's how the Supreme Court functions in our society.\n\nMeanwhile, the notion that this case is really about free speech is belied by some logical consequences of the decision. Suppose a web designer publicly refuses to make a website for a mixed-race wedding. Under the Court's logic, that is protected speech. After all, they're not discriminating against Black or white people-they're only refusing to say things about interracial weddings. Speech, not discrimination. Right?\n\nObviously not right.\n\nBut why stop there? Remember this case is also, per Gorsuch, about conduct, not status. So suppose a racist opens a bed and breakfast. They say, \"Anyone can stay here, but I can't let a Black and a white person sleep in the same bed, since race-mixing is forbidden by God . After all, they might have sex.\" Conduct, not status, right?\n\nObviously not right. But if the status/conduct distinction that Justice Gorsuch makes is applicable, and if that distinction lets one weasel out of public accommodation law, it applies as much to the odious B&B owner as to this web designer.\n\nA protester gestures at a man holding signs in support of Lorie Smith/303 Creative as people gather in front of the Supreme Court of the United States on Monday, Dec. 5, 2022, in Washington, DC.\n\nBut here's a twist: in an odd way, Justice Gorsuch's narrow framing may be of value to LGBTQ people. Because it's important to not let our haters define this case.\n\nIn 2018, when Masterpiece Cakeshop , the case about a Colorado baker refusing to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple, was decided, many journalists and LGBTQ organizations decried it as granting businesses a broad license to discriminate. There may be good reasons for that: raising money, raising awareness, getting people engaged and motivated.\n\nBut there are better reasons not to do that.\n\nMasterpiece Cakeshop was actually a very narrow case, decided on the faulty way that the baker's claims were adjudicated by a civil rights commission. It did not grant a license to discriminate by any means. But court decisions shape culture. Once everyone agreed that Masterpiece Cakeshop made LGBTQ people second-class citizens, then that's how it was understood in society, even if that's not what it actually said. Our interpretations of these cases affect their impacts.\n\nLikewise here. Even if Justice Gorsuch's distinctions are specious, they are now the law of the land. That means that 303 Creative is about freedom of speech narrowly-not \"turn away the gays\" broadly. It is not a license to discriminate, and it is not about limiting same-sex marriage. It does not impact non-speech-related activities, like running a restaurant or offering health insurance to same-sex spouses. It is only about when the state compels someone to write or say something they don't want to say.\n\nSo let's take Justice Gorsuch at his word-even if we think Justice Sotomayor has the better argument. Let's not allow those who want to take away our rights to define this as a big victory for family values. Let's frame it exactly as the Supreme Court has: as about free speech and nothing more. Let's not give our enemies more of our freedom than they've actually taken away.\n\njay@jaymichaelson.net\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

Many gay rights leaders are now redirecting their attention to obtaining federal, state and local legal protections in areas of employment, housing and commerce. Nationwide, anti-discrimination laws for gay people are inconsistent and unequal with only 22 states barring discrimination based on sexual orientation. The Human Rights Campaign is now advocating for a broad federal shield that would protect people of all sexual orientations and gender identities under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nMeanwhile, grassroots LGBTQ activists are calling for large, national organizations to also focus their attention and resources on other pressing issues, including lesbian and gay refugees and asylum seekers, the plight of homeless youth ostracized by their families, and the disproportionately high levels of violence experienced by transgender people. During the first two months of this year, transgender women of color were murdered at a rate of almost one per week in the United States. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, transgender women of color are among the groups most victimized by hate violence in the country.\n\nFor more, we go to Los Angeles, California, where we're joined by Jennicet Gutiérrez, an undocumented trans activist from Mexico. Last week, she made national headlines when she interrupted President Obama at the White House to say, \"No more deportation!\" Gutiérrez was a founding member of Familia: TQLM , established to advocate for LGBTQ immigrants often excluded in the immigration debate. And we're here in New York with Marc Solomon still, national campaign director of Freedom to Marry.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Jennicet, your reaction to the Supreme Court's ruling on Friday?\n\nJENNICET GUTIÉRREZ: Good morning, and thank you for having me again. I do believe the U.S. Supreme Court made the right decision, and this is a huge victory for the LGBT community and for justice in this country. However, you know, many people in the LGBTQ , especially people of color, marriage is not a priority. So we're facing many challenges.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about those challenges and what you think needs to be the focus of LGBTQ activism today?\n\nJENNICET GUTIÉRREZ: Yes. Well, personally, as an undocumented trans woman of color, and, you know, my community is facing a lot of incarceration, police brutality and deportation. So I do believe that we are at a point where we have to-you know, the mainstream LGBT community can come and get behind the transgender community and include all the voices and listen to the struggles that we are facing. And hopefully we can move in the right direction and make progress for all of us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Marc Solomon, you're the national campaign director of Freedom to Marry. What happens with this organization now?\n\nMARC SOLOMON : So, our organization, as we have always promised, will shut down in the next few months. But the fight for equality for LGBT people must continue. And there are some crucial items on the agenda that-I believe we can harness all of the momentum and all of the conversations and all of the goodwill that's come out of this marriage ruling to make steady and actually rapid progress.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Your book is called Winning Marriage: The Inside Story of How Same-Sex Couples Took on the Politicians and Pundits-and Won . Do you have any strategy suggestions for all that you have won, for all you've learned in this victory, for how people organize effectively?\n\nMARC SOLOMON : Absolutely. I think-I mean, I have a number of them. And of course people can look at the book if they want the full picture. But I think a couple are having a powerful vision of what you want to accomplish, which I think motivated so many people in our community and so many of our allies to get motivated, and then it's, you know, really looking strategically at the map and where we can put wins on the board and build momentum every single day towards that, towards that end.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Jennicet Gutiérrez, if you could talk specifically about the experience of immigrants, you, yourself, an undocumented trans activist from Mexico? I mean, it's quite astounding. I want to go back to that moment. You know, we had you on when you interrupted President Obama Wednesday as he spoke to a gathering celebrating LGBT Pride Month at the White House. You got in. This is what happened.\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : I want to thank all of you-advocates, organizers, friends, families-for being here today. And over the years, we've gathered to celebrate Pride Month, and I've told you that I'm so hopeful about what we can accomplish. I've told you that the civil rights of LGBT Americans-\n\nJENNICET GUTIÉRREZ: President Obama-\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : Yeah, hold on a second.\n\nJENNICET GUTIÉRREZ: Release all LGBTQ detention centers! President Obama, stop the torture and abuse of trans women in detention centers! President Obama, I am a trans woman. I'm tired of the abuse. I'm tired of [inaudible]-\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : Listen, you're in my house. ... As a general rule, I am just fine with a few hecklers, but not when I'm up in the house.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was President Obama and Jennicet Gutiérrez last Wednesday at the White House. If you had the microphone for longer, Jennicet, if you could talk about the plight of undocumented trans immigrants-a six-month Fusion investigation found some 75 transgender detainees are detained by immigration authorities every day?\n\nJENNICET GUTIÉRREZ: Yes, that is correct. And I have been involved, especially in the last two months, with this community, in particular, that has been affected. And I have spoken to specifically two transgender women from Guatemala who came to the U.S. in hope of a better treatment and a better future. And they turned themselves in to the immigration officials, and only to be put into these detention centers. So they shared their horrific stories, the abuse, the torture, that they're being-going through in these facilities. And, you know, the abuse that they're facing is like sexual abuse. They're being harassed. When they need to take showers, the officials say, like, \"Turn around. Let me see your breasts.\" And they want to touch them. And other people detained, they're sexually abusing them. So, to me, that was very heartbreaking to hear. And I connected with her-you know, with that, because I am an undocumented woman, and I am potentially at risk to be put in one of these detention centers. So it is very important for the mainstream LGBT community to listen to these struggles and to unite and do something that will benefit us all and move us in the right direction.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And the issue of housing?\n\nJENNICET GUTIÉRREZ: Yes, housing is a huge issue that we face, as well. And, you know, I have known people, transgender people, who I've been coming in contact to through the last year or so, and they have employment, and they transition during the work, and they-once they transition, they get fired, because they don't support it, and then they have to be demoted with the risk of losing housing. So that is another very critical issue that we have to come together and face this and get behind our community and, you know, do see something productive and positive in the struggles that we're facing.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : U.S. Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning has a new piece in The Guardian . It's called \"Same-sex marriage isn't equality for all LGBT people. Our movement can't end,\" she wrote. In it, Chelsea Manning writes, \"I worry that, with full marriage equality, much of the queer community will be left wondering how else to engage with a society that still wants to define who we are-and who in our community will be left to push for full equality for all transgender and queer people, now that this one fight has been won. I fear that our precious movements for social justice and all the remarkable advancements we have made are now vulnerable to being taken over by monied people and institutions, and that those of us for whom same-sex marriage rights brings no equality will be slowly erased from our movement and our history.\" She wrote this in prison. Chelsea Manning, of course, is the whistleblower who was an Iraq intelligence officer, released documents to WikiLeaks revealing U.S. killings in Iraq, and has been sentenced to decades in prison. As you hear Chelsea's words, Marc Solomon, your response?\n\nMARC SOLOMON : I am much more positive or much more optimistic than that. I think that with this tremendous win nationwide for equality and dignity for so many people, I believe that Americans now see a much more multidimensional aspect of who our entire community is, and I think that they are-I mean, they are fully behind protections on employment, on housing, on public accommodations. And I think, you know, we also now have a huge amount of power, that we've harnessed through the marriage conversation, with all of these companies that are behind us, you know, and I think we just need to take that power and move it and drive it towards nondiscrimination protections. And I think we can-we can do it. I think we can do it with a Republican Congress. I think we can do it in red states. We just need to move, you know, forward.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, here in New York City, the Stonewall Inn, the site of the uprising that helped launch the modern LGBT movement, has been granted landmark status by a city commission. The Stonewall uprising began the morning of June 28th, 1969, when members of the gay community decided to fight back against yet another New York City police raid on a Greenwich Village gay bar. Stacy Lentz, co-owner of the Stonewall Inn, praised its new landmark status.\n\nSTACY LENTZ : On that particular night, they had enough. They were fed up. And it was the first time that people from LBGT backgrounds actually stood up and kind of said, \"We're queer, we're here, get used to it,\" shut the police outside and started throwing pennies and that thing. They call it a riot, but it was pretty peaceful, for the most part, you know, a few cars overturned and those kind of things and throwing things. But for the most part, though, people gathered for three days after that. And the next year, there was actually the first LBGT pride parade.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Jennicet Gutiérrez, it was trans activists the led that uprising, is that right? Sylvia Rivera.\n\nJENNICET GUTIÉRREZ: Yes, that is correct. And that is something that we must not forget. You know, transgender women of color were at the frontlines of this current LGBTQ movement, and we need to give them credit. And we also need to be listening to the concerns that these people were bringing up to the community and that were still trying to be ignored. So now I think we are at a critical moment where our mainstream LGBTQ community can reach out to organizations who have been advocating for transgender people, and to start providing funds and to start opening up resources so that more members of our community do see the benefit and are treated with respect and dignity.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Cathy Marino-Thomas of Marriage Equality USA .\n\nCATHY MARINO - THOMAS : No, no, no. You know, we're not fully equal. We have still some of our brothers and sisters that suffer. Our transgender brothers and sisters have virtually no legal protection. We have over 5,000 LGBT homeless youth in Manhattan alone every night. We have to fix those problems. We have to be able to move freely around the world as equal and supported citizens. But this is a significant step. For today, we enjoy the win.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Cathy Marino-Thomas of Marriage Equality USA . As we wrap up, final comments, Jennicet?\n\nJENNICET GUTIÉRREZ: I just want to say, you know, my mainstream community, it was heartbreaking, and it really-I felt betrayed when they turned their back on me. So I believe now they are in a position to do the right thing and to reach out to us and to include us in the conversation and listen to our struggles.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Jennicet Gutiérrez, I want to thank you for being back with us, undocumented trans activist from Mexico, founding member of Familia: TQLM , established to advocate for LGBTQ immigrants often excluded in the immigration debate. And again, thank you to Marc Solomon, national campaign director of Freedom to Marry, the author of Winning Marriage: The Inside Story of How Same-Sex Couples Took on the Politicians and Pundits-and Won . Marc just wrote an article for the New York Daily News headlined \"A field guide to making history,\" and we'll link to it at democracynow.org.\n\nWhen we come back, speaking of making history, Bree Newsome scales the flagpole in Columbia, South Carolina, on the Capitol grounds and takes down the Confederate battle flag.

There have been more than 70 anti-LGBTQ+ bills signed into law so far in 2023 - more than double last year's number, which was previously the worst year for discriminatory legislation. These laws have primarily targeted the transgender community, with many states banning gender-affirming medical care and participation in sports by trans youth. The Human Rights Campaign, which is the largest organization devoted to the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people in the U.S., made its declaration on Tuesday, just a few days into Pride Month. \"There is an imminent health and safety crisis facing our community,\" says the group's president, Kelley Robinson.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nThe largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer civil rights organization in the United States has declared its first-ever state of emergency due to an unprecedented wave of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation. The Human Rights Campaign says more than 525 anti- LGBTQ state bills have been introduced this year, in the 2023 legislative session; over 70 have become law.\n\nIn the latest move, on Tuesday, Louisiana's Republican-dominated Legislature passed a ban on gender-affirming care for most minors, sending the bill to the Democratic governor, who's opposed it, but a GOP supermajority in the Legislature could override his veto.\n\nMost major medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, support gender-affirming healthcare for transgender minors and adults.\n\nAlso Tuesday, a federal judge temporarily blocked Florida's bans on gender transition care for three transgender children amidst ongoing legal challenges. Their families filed a lawsuit arguing the bans are unconstitutional, and the judge agreed they represent, quote, \"purposeful discrimination against transgenders.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale, police declared an unlawful assembly Tuesday night after more than 500 people protested outside a school board meeting where a vote was scheduled on recognizing June as Pride month. A physical fight broke out between anti- LGBTQ protesters and LGBTQ supporters, and the brawl was so big, it was picked up by a local news traffic cam.\n\nThis comes as 2024 Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley tried to connect teen girls' suicidal ideation to transgender rights during a CNN town hall Sunday.\n\nNIKKI HALEY : The idea that we have biological boys playing in girls' sports, it is the women's issue of our time. My daughter ran track in high school. I don't even know how I would have that conversation with her. How are we supposed to get our girls used to the fact that biological boys are in their locker rooms? And then we wonder why a third of our teenage girls seriously contemplated suicide last year?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : A recent report by The Trevor Project, the world's largest suicide prevention and mental health organization for LGBTQ young people, found roughly half of transgender and nonbinary young people said they had seriously considered suicide over the last year. And 30% said laws and policies that target LGBTQ people had worsened their mental health.\n\nThis is Nebraska state Senator Megan Hunt, whose son is transgender, responding to Republican Governor Jim Pillen after he signed a bill last month that bans gender-affirming treatment for transgender youth. Hunt had joined a months-long filibuster to block the measure.\n\nSEN . MEGAN HUNT : This person said that they had attempted suicide during this session in Nebraska, a trans person. And I said to them, \"Do not let one of these trash people who I work with be the reason that you're not here. They don't matter. The potential you have for the rest of your life is so much bigger than the damage any of these trash people can do in their little four-year or eight-year term.\" ... Senator Kauth has stood up and said that trans kids are suicidal and depressed because they're trans. No, it's because of bullies like her, who are trying to legislate their existence and take away their right to be viewed as fully human in our culture and society.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we're joined by Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ+ civil rights organization in the United States.\n\nThis is the first time in the 40-year history of your group that you've decided to issue this emergency declaration. Talk about why you did this, Kelley Robinson.\n\nKELLEY ROBINSON : Thank you.\n\nYou know, we felt like we had a responsibility to do so. I mean, you've laid it out. We've seen unprecedented attacks at the legislative level. We're seeing real-life violence impacting our community, from California to the one in five of every hate crime being motivated by anti-LGBTQ+ bias.\n\nAnd in this moment, when people are traveling across the country, when they're deciding to move or what schools to go to, we had a responsibility to let people know that, one, there's an imminent health and safety crisis facing our community, and, two, there's a dizzying patchwork the protections for us and for our families depending on the state that you're in. This report lays it out and also gives resources on what your rights are and what you can do if you find yourself in one of these hostile states.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about what's behind this wave of - and \"wave\" doesn't really state it accurately. We're talking about, as you've documented, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of bills that have been put forward across the country.\n\nKELLEY ROBINSON : This is political theater. They are doing this to pander to a MAGA Republican base in so many of these states. Look, the majority of the people support the LGBTQ+ community. Seventy percent of Americans support the LGBTQ+ community and believe that legislatures should be standing with our values. One in five of Generation Z identifies as a member of one of this community, 20 million American adults. This is not an issue of the margins.\n\nWhat we're seeing play out is a loud and vocal minority that is sowing hate and fear against our community because they're not willing to solve the real problems. If they actually cared about the safety of our kids, they would be moving forward legislation to prevent gun violence, the number one killer of our children, not taking away the rights of parents to support our kids in growing into their fullest selves.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Over the weekend, U.S. District Judge Thomas Parker ruled a new Tennessee law restricting drag performances in public was unconstitutional. This is drag performer Cya Inhale at a Pride event in Franklin, Tennessee.\n\nCYA INHALE : Having the answer finally delivered and that breath of fresh air and that weight off our shoulders that it's finally gone, we don't have to worry about it, is lovely. We can breathe easy for the rest of the year. There's still a fight, and we still have to continue fighting. There are still other states that we are - drag is still being criminalized, that we still have to work on, but this is definitely a step in the right direction.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And in related news, a federal judge blocked parts of a Florida law banning gender-affirming care for transgender youth. Judge Robert Hinkle asserted, \"Gender identity is real,\" and he ruled in favor of three families with three transgender children who will be allowed to obtain prescription puberty blockers. So there is very bad news but also good news, and some of these rulings are by Trump-appointed judges.\n\nKELLEY ROBINSON : Yes, that's very true. I mean, that's just showing the extent to which they are going, how unconstitutional the laws are that they're passing in these states.\n\nBut the thing that I really want to pull forward is the impact is real. The fact that over 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced, even if they don't pass into law, it is having a devastating impact on the safety and well-being of our community. And when you match that with easy access to firearms, with an extreme rhetoric of hate, that's when we're getting these real-life outcomes of violence, from kids having increased incidence of mental health crises to real assaults at Drag Queen Story Hours or bomb threats on hospitals.\n\nThat's why this is such a crisis right now, because it's got the legislative impact, the human impact, and then it's creating a culture of fear for our community, because we know they're trying to push us back into the closet right now. And we are doing all that we can to show up in joyful resistance and resilience to make that not the case, not only for ourselves today but for every young person that's watching this play out.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, talk about doing this as presidential candidates are coming forward and taking very strong stands against the gay community in the Republican field, everyone from Governor DeSantis of Florida to the former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. Can you talk about what you hope declaring this national state of emergency, how it will affect the presidential campaign?\n\nKELLEY ROBINSON : You know, I have to say that what I see playing out in the Republican primary is devastating, it's sickening, and it's horrifying. They are pandering, again, to an extremist base and sowing fear against our kids, against our trans children, only for political gain. They know that this isn't where the majority of the country is. They know that we've identified 62 million voters in the country that prioritize LGBTQ+ issues when deciding who to vote for. That's, of course, LGBTQ+ people, but that's also our allies, our friends, our family.\n\nWe can't allow them to continue this line of attack. And even more so, we've got to bolster up our champions. We've got to make sure that everyone that is a supporter and ally of this community turns into a champion in 2024 to hold the strongest line possible. We can't cede ground to these bullies, especially politically.\n\nAt the end of the day, we also have to recognize that this is an intersectional attack. The same people that are coming after gender-affirming care are also attacking our access to abortion. The same people that are trying to outlaw the ability to teach queer theories in schools are trying outlaw - excuse me, ban books and outlaw the ability to teach about Black history. They are launching an attack on all of our communities that is truly a crisis to our democracy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask you about what's happening in the United States going global, Kelley. In May, the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, signed a sweeping anti- LGBTQ measure into law that makes same-sex relationship punishable by life in prison - even the death penalty in some cases. It's one of the most draconian anti- LGBTQ laws in the world. In April, we spoke to the Ugandan activist Frank Mugisha about the role of U.S. evangelicals in pushing this law forward in Uganda.\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : The homophobia and transphobia we are seeing towards queer and trans persons in Uganda is from the West. It is mostly peddled by extreme American evangelicals.\n\nJust last week, we had American evangelicals in Uganda attending a conference that was titled \"The Interparliamentary Conference on African Values.\" But the agenda for this conference was anti-gay and anti-gender. In fact, some of the African members of parliament who attended this conference are trying to introduce similar legislation in other countries. For example, Kenya, a member of parliament who attended this conference in Uganda, that was heavily supported by American evangelicals, is now trying to introduce a similar legislation in Kenya. We are seeing this anti-gay propaganda and anti-gay legislations moving around Africa. Ghana already has one. We are worried about other countries, like Burundi, Tanzania, that could introduce similar legislations.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that's Frank Mugisha, the LGBTQ activist in Uganda. So many LGBTQ people are fleeing Uganda right now with the passage and signing of this law, Kelley Robinson. In that conversation, he particularly focused on the American evangelical Scott Lively, who talked about homosexuality as a Western agenda. Can you talk about how what's happening in the United States is having such a massive effect globally?\n\nKELLEY ROBINSON : I mean, it's heartbreaking. It truly is. It is devastating to see how impactful that piece of legislation is in Uganda. And we know that it's true, what he's saying, that the same people that are pushing these anti-LGBTQ+ laws in the United States, they are exporting this hate. They are using places like Uganda and the full African region as a testing ground for what they hope to do in the United States of America. These are groups that are designated hate groups, like the Alliance to Defend Freedom. This is a true crisis.\n\nYou know, and it's also heartbreaking because America used to be the beacon of hope. We used to be going to countries talking about what it means to expand rights to people. And now this is the legacy that we're moving forward. All of us need to see this for exactly what it is: a precursor to what they also want to make true in the United States of America.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And finally, Kelley, if you can talk about what you feel people need to do in this time, as your organization has designated a national emergency?\n\nKELLEY ROBINSON : I think that we need to recognize that, first, there are children looking to us to see what we are going to do and say in this moment, to see if we will stand up for their lives, if we will validate their humanity and their dignity. And all of us have a responsibility to do that vocally and proudly. We have to stand up and tell our stories in every way that we can about being a member of the community or being an ally to this community.\n\nYou have to take political action. Contact your legislators and tell them not to mess with our trans kids, not to mess with the LGBTQ+ community. And ultimately, we have to vote. We have to change the political dynamics in this country so that it is no longer advantageous to our opposition to attack the LGBTQ+ community. We can get on the other side of this issue, but we've got to do it together.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Kelley Robinson, I thank you so much for being with us, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBTQ+ civil rights organization. For the first time in its 40-year history, it has declared a national emergency for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nComing up, Cornel West, the famed public intellectual, has just announced he is running for president to challenge both the Democratic and Republican parties. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Other bills have targeted drag performers, doctors and trans adults seeking transition-related care. For more on growing conservative attacks on transgender people and the LGBTQ+ community, we speak to Chase Strangio, deputy director for trans justice with the ACLU LGBTQ & HIV Project, who says the backlash \"at its core has always been about pushing trans people out of public life and eradicating transness.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, as we look now at the growing conservative attacks on transgender people and the LGBTQ+ community. At this weekend's CPAC meeting - that's Conservative Political Action Conference - a number of speakers drew alarm with their transphobic comments, including former Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka, who warned Democrats who support trans rights are, quote, \"mutilating boys and girls.\" Right-wing Republican Congressmember Marjorie Taylor Greene vowed to reintroduce a bill called the Protect Children's Innocence Act, that would make it a felony to provide gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth. Another speaker was Daily Wire host Michael Knowles.\n\nMICHAEL KNOWLES : If transgenderism is false, as it is, if men really can't become women, as they cannot, then it's false for everybody, too. And if it's false, then we should not indulge it, especially since that indulgence requires taking away the rights and customs of so many people. If it is false, then for the good of society, and especially for the good of the poor people who have fallen prey to this confusion, transgenderism must be eradicated from public life entirely, the whole preposterous ideology at every level.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Michael Knowles' transphobic comments were widely condemned. Variety 's Adam Vary wrote, \"Pay attention. This is genocidal,\" unquote.\n\nThis comes as at least 150 bills have been filed by Republican lawmakers across the United States that target transgender people and criminalize doctors who provide transition-related healthcare for trans youth. Just law week, several pieces of anti-trans legislation were signed into law. Tennessee Thursday became the latest state to enact a law banning gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth. Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Mississippi, South Dakota and Utah have also enacted bans on the lifesaving treatment. The new Mississippi bill blocks public funding for clinics and institutions that offer this type of care. This comes as Nebraska state Senator Machaela Cavanaugh has vowed to bring the state Legislature to a halt with a filibuster if lawmakers try to pass anti-trans bills.\n\nSEN . MACHAELA CAVANAUGH : If this Legislature collectively decides that legislating hate against children is our priority, then I am going to make it painful, painful for everyone, because if you want to inflict pain upon our children, I am going to inflict pain upon this body. ... There is not a bill on this agenda, on any agenda coming forward, that will be spared. Every bill will go to cloture.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Meanwhile, Tennessee's Republican Governor Bill Lee has faced backlash after a high school photo of him dressed in drag went viral after he said he would sign a bill criminalizing drag performances performed in public or in front of children. Nationwide, at least 14 bills have been introduced targeting drag shows. In Montana, the House endorsed a bill barring anyone under age 18 from attending drag shows, even after emotional testimony from one of the Legislature's first openly transgender members, Representative Zooey Zephyr.\n\nREP . ZOOEY ZEPHYR : The bill purports to be about drag. And let me start by saying what drag is. Drag is art. Drag is beautiful. Drag is important to my community, my community and the rest of the LGBTQ community. There were comments about people who had gone 30 years ago to drag shows and saw adult-focused experiences. There's questions as to why are children coming to them now. Well, I'll tell you what happened: We lived. We lived through the AIDS epidemic. We lived through people trying to disallow our marriage. We adopted children. We grew up. And now we're taking some of our children and sharing an art form that's valuable to our community in a way that is age-appropriate to them. That's why if you would have come to the drag show on Saturday, what you would have seen is people in full-length dresses, in beautiful gowns, celebrating our art, our history, and the fact that we're alive today.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more on all of this, we're joined in New York by Chase Strangio, deputy director for trans justice with the ACLU LGBTQ & HIV Project.\n\nChase, welcome back to Democracy Now! Talk about what happened in Tennessee, and talk about what's happening across this country, after that very powerful testimony.\n\nCHASE STRANGIO : Yeah. Thanks, Amy.\n\nI mean, I've been coming on this show for the last seven years to talk about this very issue. And I think, taking a step back, what we have to acknowledge is how quickly this has escalated. In 2016, in the wake of marriage equality, we saw the first aggressive contemporary backlash against trans people in the form of the wave of anti-trans bathroom bills, and that rhetoric escalated to attacks on trans participation in sports, attacks on trans youth in schools, using the restroom, participating on sports teams. And how quickly have we gone from that rhetoric - which was understood to be false, including by proponents of it - to this current climate in which we are criminalizing trans adults going to the bathroom, where we are banning evidence-based medical care that is supported by every major medical association, where we are criminalizing gender expression in drag performance, and now we hear the rhetoric behind all of this, which at its core has always been about pushing trans people out of public life and eradicating transness. We see it so clearly. And if we look over the course of seven years, this arc bring us to this moment where we are absolutely in crisis.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, talk specifically about Tennessee and Governor Bill Lee.\n\nCHASE STRANGIO : Yeah. So, a few things have happened in Tennessee, and I will say Tennessee has often been a site of pushing anti-trans legislation. I've spent a lot of time there over the last seven years testifying against bills and supporting the incredible community there. What happened over this last week was S.B. 1 and S.B. 3 were both signed into law. S.B. 1 is the law that categorically bans gender-affirming care for trans adolescents, which, in essence, will have the effect of cutting down some - excuse me, of shutting down some of the most robust and important sites of gender-affirming care in the South. And then we also have S.B. 3, which is the intended prohibition on drag performance. It is, in fact, a relatively narrow law, and if it is properly enforced, and I think there's a real question about whether that is anything that we could trust, that it is intended to ban drag performance. The governor signed both bills. He has come under fire for the hypocrisy, because he himself has presented in drag.\n\nAnd then, of course, the reality is that these bills aren't about banning drag performance. They are not about banning expressions of gender nonconformity, as long as those expressions are seen as serving the status quo . What these bills are about is policing that which is seen as deviant and disruptive of the status quo , policing transness, policing communities coming together to support and celebrate their histories and legacies. They cannot be understood as separate from the many attempts to ban curricula, curriculum connections to historically accurate movements of resistance. This is a part of a national effort to cut off communities from their history, whether those histories are histories of drag, whether those histories are histories of other resistance. We have to understand the bans on drag performance as central and connected to the bans on what we're seeing in the curriculum, what was categorized as so-called critical race theory. And, in fact, these two movements, to ban drag and to ban so-called critical race theory, which is really just a banning of accurate history, came from the same sources. These are dynamic processes coming from the right that are designed to control and regulate our bodies and our understanding of our lineages.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And the fact that Bill Lee himself is shown in drag?\n\nCHASE STRANGIO : I mean, I think the fact that there are so - I mean, look at Rudy Giuliani. Look at President Trump. Drag is something that is wide-reaching in its experience in the world. Some of it is done in a way that's based in mockery. Some of it's done in a way that's based in celebration. There is no such thing as an easy and simple way to police gender nonconformity, except in a way that targets communities that are already under assault.\n\nI think it's very clear that in every instance of what we're seeing in state legislatures, we can identify the hypocrisy. We have lawmakers who consider themselves pro-life who are introducing bills that would punish abortion with the death penalty. We have individuals who are claiming that they are concerned about protecting children, when the leading cause of death among children is death by firearms, and that they are focusing their energy on cutting off healthcare, removing children from loving homes, banning drag performance, and doing nothing to prevent the actual harms that are coming to our children, at a time when, by the way, there is substantial evidence that our young people are facing significant mental health crisis across the country. And that crisis is not borne of the fact of their transness. It is not borne by the fact that they are connecting to their histories or they have more diverse experiences. We know that that's not the reality. The reality is, is that young people have more anxiety. They've been living in a pandemic. They have witnessed gun violence for the entirety of their lives. And we have real, real problems when it comes to what our young people need. And we are legislating in areas that are designed to eradicate populations, to harm young people, and the hypocrisy is staggering.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, I want to talk about the laws banning gender-affirming healthcare - in Tennessee on Thursday, also last week the Kentucky House voted to ban access to gender-affirming medical care for youth. Let's turn to Democratic state Senator Karen Berg of Louisville, Kentucky, who lost her transgender son, Henry Berg-Brousseau, to suicide in December at the age of 24. She condemned Kentucky's anti-trans bill and shared her son's last actions before he died.\n\nSEN . KAREN BERG : The last thing he did at work, before he went home and killed himself, was to send out a press release warning us of what was coming, warning the world of this!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was state Senator Karen Berg. Chase Strangio, take it from there. Talk about these particular bills.\n\nCHASE STRANGIO : Yeah, there is something so insidious about what's going on with these attacks on gender-affirming care, and it is manifesting in ways that are so harmful for our communities.\n\nI want to first just acknowledge that I knew Henry when he was a youth advocate in Tennessee. I saw him testify before his Legislature at a time when they were pushing anti-trans bathroom bills. So, there is a population of young people that has spent the entirety or a significant portion of their lives begging their governments not to target them, and the cost of that is significant.\n\nAnd right now what we're seeing in state after state is something that three years ago I thought would have been unimaginable. We are having healthcare that is evidence-based, that is being recommended by doctors in consultation with parents for young people who are suffering and struggling. And this care works. And what we're seeing now is the legislatures intruding upon the decision-making of doctors, parents and young people, to take away the only evidence-based treatment that transgender people have when they are suffering and there are no other options. And in state after state, we're seeing these bills moved.\n\nAnd I must say that they are being fueled in part by a public discourse that has allowed there to be a legitimate debate over whether there are too many transgender people, over whether we have too much access to healthcare. And I urge people to take a step back and use information you already know about how healthcare works in this country. It is not easy to access. It is, in fact, incredibly difficult. And it is particularly difficult when it is stigmatized healthcare, that a population that faces so much stigma and discrimination needs. We are in a position now - I just got out of a two-week trial in Arkansas over a very similar piece of legislation that we're now seeing in Tennessee and South Dakota and Utah and Mississippi and elsewhere. We had a two-week trial. When tested, when the evidence goes before the court, there is absolutely no basis for these categorical bans.\n\nAnd we should be concerned for everyone, if every time a group of lawmakers believes that it is a conspiracy for a group of people to thrive, that they start taking away our healthcare, with nothing more than ideological opposition and unverified accounts of things that are simply not happening. We've seen it with abortion, and we're seeing it now with trans-affirming healthcare. And this is a crisis for our communities. Families are fleeing their states, but they don't know where to go.\n\nAnd I just want to say, too - oh, sorry, go ahead.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Go ahead.\n\nCHASE STRANGIO : Just that we've heard a lot about this is about children, this is about protecting children. First and foremost, these bills harm children. And second, as we've heard from the comments from CPAC and as we've seen from legislation targeting adults, this is not about targeting only children. This is about categorically attacking the trans community and all of us, at all ages.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And I wanted to ask you, finally, about the role of the media. And we just have about a minute. But over 200 New York Times contributors have published an open letter criticizing the Times ' recent coverage of stories involving transgender, nonbinary, gender nonconforming people, in particular concerning medical issues. The letter says Republican lawmakers have cited the Times ' coverage to justify bans on gender-affirming care for youth. In response, the top editor of The New York Times has defended the paper's coverage of trans issues, warning journalists that such public criticism will, quote, \"not be tolerated,\" unquote. GLAAD has accused The New York Times of, quote, \"irresponsible, biased coverage of transgender people\" going back more than a year. Chase, can you just summarize this debate?\n\nCHASE STRANGIO : Yeah, and it is not going back more than a year; this is going back more than seven years, by my count. And we have in the last eight months, I think, 15,000 front-page words over just the question of whether trans people are getting too much healthcare. There is an effort to identify a conspiracy of healthcare rather than understand the very powerful forces that are at play to try to attack and destabilize the material conditions of trans life. They are asking the wrong questions. They are asking questions that are effused with bias, that are informed by a global set of imperatives to attack not only trans people, but bodily autonomy and gender nonconformity more generally. And I think this coverage is abhorrent. And I think the idea that they will not tolerate criticism is quite a statement coming from the paper of record, when absolutely we need robust discussions. But there is a lot to look at in their coverage that shows that their entry point is one of bias, not one of fleshing out what is truly going on to the trans community right now in this country and around the world.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Chase Strangio, I want to thank you for being with us, deputy director for trans justice with the ACLU LGBTQ & HIV Project.\n\nNext up, brand threat. That's what Fox executives have called Fox reporters and anchors questioning Trump's false election claims. We're going to speak to the president of Media Matters about this, the Dominion lawsuit and much more. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nFull interview with Ugandan LGBTQ activist Frank Mugisha about a draconian new anti-gay bill the country is on the verge of imposing, which makes it a crime to identify as queer, considers all same-sex conduct to be nonconsensual, and even allows for the death penalty in certain cases.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe look now at how LGBTQ and human rights activists are raising alarm about a sweeping new measure in Uganda that further criminalizes LGBTQ people and allows for the death sentence in certain cases. It appears to be the first attempt to outlaw even identifying as LGBTQ . It also targets HIV -positive people who engage in same-sex relations, bans the so-called promotion of homosexuality, and declares all same-sex conduct as nonconsensual. Uganda's Parliament has passed the measure. It now awaits the signature of the president.\n\nThis comes as a recent editorial by The Washington Post notes Uganda is hardly alone in its anti- LGBT posture. Of the 64 or so countries that still criminalize same-sex relationships, at least half, at least 32, by most counts, are in Africa.\n\nFor more, we're joined by Frank Mugisha, a leading Ugandan LGBTQ and human rights activist, who is here in Washington, D.C., this week.\n\nFrank, welcome to Democracy Now! Talk about the legislation that's being passed.\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : Thank you so much for having me.\n\nThe legislation that has been passed by our Parliament, that is pending the signature of the president, is one of the most extreme legislations, anti-gay legislations, to be passed in Africa. This legislation would compel any person who knows an LGBTQ person to report them to the authorities. A Catholic like myself, if I confess to my priest, my priest has to report me to the authorities. Any person who goes to seek treatment from a health practitioner, they would have to report them to the authority. This law, further, would criminalize any landlord who provides housing to an LGBTQ person. This law would outlaw the work I am doing on speaking out for LGBTQ persons, but also it would criminalize anything I post on my social media that advocates or promotes the human rights of LGBTQ persons. This interview that I'm having now, if I had it in Uganda, the studio, the entity, myself would be criminalized. This legislation is here to erase the entire livelihood of the LGBTQ person in Uganda.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Where does the death penalty fit into this, Frank Mugisha?\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : The death penalty - first of all, it's important to note that the initial text of the bill did not have the death penalty. To show you how extreme the members of the Ugandan Parliament are, the death penalty was introduced during the debate.\n\nThe death penalty would criminalize any person who engages in sexual acts with a minor, or if someone is an authority. But let us not confuse the death penalty for only punishing people - pedophiles, people who abuse children. The death penalty would criminalize any person who is a serial offender. It means that any person who breaks the law more than once, under this legislation, would be criminalized. If a landlord rents out their premises to a person who is known or perceived to be LGBTQ , and they are convicted under this law more than once, they are defined as a serial offender. If any LGBTQ person who is living their life in Uganda breaks the law more than once - that could be speaking out, that could be identifying as LGBTQ , that could be two consenting adults - but as long as you're convicted more than once, then you become a serial offender, and you could be executed.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What about two young people, two minors?\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : That's very interesting. This law, that the Ugandans, the Ugandan members of Parliament, are saying is here to protect children, this law would criminalize young queer persons, young LGBTQ persons, and I'm saying young LGBTQ persons who are under the age of 18, to three years in prison, if they're identified as LGBTQ . Well, previously, we have seen that young people, if they identified as LGBTQ , they could get frowned upon, they could get suspended from school or expelled from school. Right now this law proposes that they should go to prison for three years. And three years in Uganda for a child, that is the maximum penalty under the Children's Act.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Now, already there is a ban on gay sex. Is that right, Frank?\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : There's already a law that criminalizes same-sex acts to life in prison. We have the sodomy laws that most of the African countries have, that were, unfortunately, introduced by the British.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Where is all of this coming from? Talk about the trajectory of this increasing targeting, oppression of the LGBTQ community in Uganda.\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : The oppression we are seeing now in Uganda is not Ugandan at all. The hatred, the radicalization of the Ugandan population to hate and fear LGBTQ persons is not Ugandan at all. The Ugandan society has always lived with homosexual persons, as we call homosexuals in Uganda, with LGBTQ persons in societies. They were never killed. They were never arrested. The homophobia and transphobia we are seeing towards queer and trans persons in Uganda is from the West. It is mostly peddled by extreme American evangelicals.\n\nJust last week, we had American evangelicals in Uganda attending a conference that was titled \"The Interparliamentary Conference on African Values.\" But the agenda for this conference was anti-gay and anti-gender. In fact, some of the African members of parliament who attended this conference are trying to introduce similar legislation in other countries. For example, Kenya, a member of parliament who attended this conference in Uganda, that was heavily supported by American evangelicals, is now trying to introduce a similar legislation in Kenya. We are seeing this anti-gay propaganda and anti-gay legislations moving around Africa. Ghana already has one. We are worried about other countries, like Burundi, Tanzania, that could introduce similar legislations.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The Washington Post recently ran an article headlined \"The U.S. connection to Uganda's 'kill the gays' bill.\" I want to read from the article. It says, \"In 2020, London-based OpenDemocracy found that more than 20 American religious organizations advocating against LGBTQ rights, safe abortion, access to contraceptives and comprehensive sex education had spent at least $54 million furthering their agendas in Africa since 2007. Close to half that figure was spent in conservative, predominantly Christian Uganda alone.\" That's the piece from The Washington Post . Frank, can you talk more about this, and specifically about the U.S. evangelical pastor Scott Lively, who's told the Ugandan Parliament that homosexuality is a Western-imported disease?\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : Scott Lively is an American evangelical pastor. And I'm sure many people in America, in the United States, may not know him. But in Uganda he's famous. When he first traveled to Uganda and he publicly held meetings with politicians, Ugandan government officials, he told Ugandans homosexuality is a Western agenda that needs to be fought. He introduced Western - excuse me - Western language that was not Ugandan. He introduced the language of \"homosexuals promote homosexuality.\" He introduced language like \"homosexuals recruit children into homosexuality.\" He introduced language, \"Homosexuality is a Western agenda.\" This was not Ugandan language. This was language that was introduced to Ugandans by American evangelical Scott Lively.\n\nWe worked together with our partner, the Center for Constitutional Rights, CCR , to hold Scott Lively accountable. In fact, we went to court. And for the first time, a judge in Massachusetts said that persecution of LGBTQ persons could amount to crimes against humanity. And for us, we exposed the hatred that Scott Lively was exporting to Uganda.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And talk about the role of the Ugandan president.\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : The Ugandan president has had different views on this issue. He has told Ugandans many times that homosexuality has always existed in Uganda, that homosexuals have always been in Uganda. But as a politician, he looks at the majority of Ugandans and what their views are. So, for my thinking is that, when he signed the legislation back then, he was responding to the views of a majority of Ugandans. But right now he's thinking deeply about, you know, if LGBTQ Ugandans existed in Uganda, why should they be criminalized? Why should they be killed? Why should they be sent to prison? I think those are thoughts that are weighing on in the president's mind at this moment.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, talk about why you're in the United States.\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : I am in the United States to draw attention to this very extreme anti-gay legislation in Uganda. And very many times, activists like myself have used advocacy to draw attention, but not only to draw attention on the fact that this legislation is in Uganda, to draw attention that the biggest supporters and the biggest people driving this legislation in Uganda and other countries are actually from the United States. And that is very key for very many Americans to know, that the homophobia we are seeing rising and growing in Africa is not African. That is being - it is homophobia and transphobia being exported by American evangelicals. So I'm here to draw attention to that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : President Biden is expected to make his first visit to Africa as president of the United States. What role could he play, do you think? What are you calling on him to say? And what about U.S. support for countries and presidents like Museveni in Uganda?\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : President Biden has a very big role. The U.S. is a very key and strategic partner to many countries in Africa. So, I think for President Biden to raise the concern of these legislations and how these legislations affect the partnerships with countries like Uganda and other countries in Africa, the concern how the citizens, the American citizens, are asking him questions - What are you doing about extreme legislations that are exported and supported by Americans themselves? - to raise the concern around the safety and protection of LGBTQ persons in the region, but also the partnerships that the United States has with Africa, and how that could be affected by countries that have these legislations.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : To follow up, I want to talk about people in Uganda and what kind of organizing is going on, both grassroots organizing, though they face great danger, though you face great danger - and I want to ask what it even means for it to be known you're here organizing - and also if people are trying to flee.\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : There's a lot of resilience from LGBTQ persons in Uganda. There's a lot of organizing. There is visibility. Many people have said some of the backlash we are seeing is because of the visibility that we have as queer persons in Uganda. And so, Ugandans are in shock to know that there are actually very many LGBTQ persons in the country. So, the organizing is there. The resilience is there. And we've been here before. Ten years ago, we had a similar legislation that was called the \"kill the gays\" bill. We have civil society partners who are supporting us in the country. We have legal and other academia and experts who are supporting us and supporting our work. So the resilience and organizing in the country is vibrant and there.\n\nThe challenge now is that the anti-gay movements have radicalized Ugandans against any person who is supportive of the LGBTQ community. So now we are losing some of our partners because of fear of homophobia and transphobia. We're also seeing some members of the LGBTQ community getting worried and scared that if this legislation is passed, what will they do? Some are thinking of fleeing the country to neighboring Kenya or to other countries. We are already seeing people asking for that. But right now in Uganda there's an increase on crackdown of civil society organizations that support the LGBTQ community. And some of them are being singled out by the government and being targeted to be closed down or shut down or their permits revoked. So there is a big fear from some of our partners that if they work with us, they risk being shut down or being arrested.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What about receiving political asylum, for example, in the United States? What is the U.S. policy right now?\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : The U.S. policy for LGBTQ asylum seekers - I mean, there are many LGBTQ asylum seekers who have been granted political asylum here. But we are calling on the U.S. government and other governments to make these policies easy for some of the communities, because it is not only Uganda that is having these challenges. There are many other LGBTQ persons around the continent and from the Global South who are having these challenges. So we're asking for these policies to be made easy for many of our colleagues, who need safety in countries that will accept them, to access these services in a much more easy way.\n\nBut also in the United States, when someone arrives here as seeking asylum, there is no support. There is no support for them to access some of the services that the person needs when they have just arrived here - legal services, housing services, food and other basic needs. So I think it's about time for the U.S. to start thinking about providing humanitarian support for persons who are just arriving and seeking support, to be - to support to live in a safe environment, but, generally, for people to be accepted, for those policies to be loosened up for LGBTQ persons, and to work with civil society groups that are trying to provide this support. I know there are very many other groups that are trying to provide support. I know Rainbow Railroad in Canada is one of those groups that is trying to ask the U.S. government to provide more support to help LGBTQ persons who are in dangerous places to come to safety.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Frank Mugisha, in 2011, your friend David Kato, who's really considered the father of Uganda's gay rights movement, was bludgeoned to death. Can you talk about the kind of physical violence people face, and if the situation has improved at all? And even though it is over a decade later, my deepest condolences.\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : Thank you so much. I mean, it was very painful, but also worrying, for many of us, when David, my colleague, David Kato, was murdered. David Kato was murdered at his house. So, that, you know, petrified me. And many people, indeed, were worried and scared for their own personal lives, but also for the safety of the community.\n\nRight after that, a few years later, the situation improved a bit for the LGBTQ community, but, most recently, we've seen the situation get worse. Many LGBTQ persons in Uganda have been violated. Many LGBTQ persons in Uganda are getting arrested. There's an increase in blackmail and extortion. There's an increase of social exclusion. And right now what we're seeing is not only crackdown on LGBTQ persons from law enforcement, but we're seeing harassment from ordinary Ugandans. Ordinary Ugandans. We are worried that if this legislation is signed, we will see mob justice. We are seeing communities, for instance, raiding schools where perceived LGBTQ persons work. We are seeing workshops and events getting raided. We are seeing people getting arrested for simply - and getting undressed. Transgender persons on national television are getting undressed. So the situation has gotten worse in the past year and recent months.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Now, you were arrested in 2016 over your advocacy. How are people, especially the LGBTQ community, treated in jail?\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : When I was arrested in 2016, of course, there was a lot of derogatory and degrading and cruel and inhuman treatment when I was arrested. This happens every time an LGBTQ person is arrested. A lot of verbal abuse, sometimes physical abuse, and also a lot of insults, derogatory and inhuman treatment happens in many of the police stations when LGBTQ persons are arrested, but also sometimes delayed or denial of access by the lawyers who won't support the LGBTQ persons.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You know, you're here in the United States now, lobbying, educating people about what's happening in your country, in Uganda, on your continent, Africa. I wanted to get your impression of what's happening here. According to the ACLU , there have been 419 anti- LGBT laws introduced in the United States, just in this year alone. What message does this send to politicians in Uganda and Africa?\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : That is very good to note, first of all, to see that the issue of homophobia, transphobia, the backlash the LGBT community is facing, is not only an African problem, it's a global problem. So Africa should not be seen as the only, you know, homophobic place. But homophobia and transphobia is happening, and it's increasingly around the world now.\n\nThe signal that these anti-gay legislations that are being introduced in the United States is sending to Africa is not good, because most and some of the text that we are seeing in some of the legislations, for example, in Uganda and other places in Africa, is similar to text of the legislations being introduced here. But for African politicians, this is good. This is good for them. They are using that in saying we can - even in developed countries, homosexuality is not accepted. And I've seen videos of misinformation or disinformation circulating around, quoting some of the political leaders and saying they don't support homosexuality. And, you know, so, the politicians in Africa will use anything homophobic and transphobic to try and justify what they are doing.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Finally, Frank Mugisha, the Ugandan Parliament passed the legislation three weeks ago, March 21st. The Ugandan president has yet to sign it. What is taking him so long to decide? Does it have to do with the level of activism of the LGBTQ and human rights community?\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : A part of that, yes. Part of the reason the president is not signing the legislation, the president of Uganda is known to carefully think about issues before taking a decision. And I believe that is what he's doing now. I believe he may - he may or may not consult the party, his party. Also, I believe he might try to consult - I don't know if he's consulting - maybe try to consult other stakeholders on this before he signs. But I also believe that our advocacy, civil society and local voices from Uganda that have spoken out on this, definitely have - they have encouraged him not to sign the legislation hurriedly, because there are local voices amidst all this that have spoken out against this legislation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And your final global call? We're a U.S.-based show, but we're a global TV/radio/internet broadcast.\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : The United States and the international community needs to pay attention to what is happening in Uganda with this legislation, because the fear is that if this legislation in Uganda is signed by the president, passed into law, it will be replicated around the entire Africa. And it is important for the international community to partner with the local voices on the ground, not only in Uganda but in other countries where queer persons need a lot of support and solidarity. And it is important for the international community to listen to the local voices and take direction from the local voices on how they can support and how they can engage and how they can provide solidarity to the LGBT community, that needs this support urgently. Thank you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I do have one last question as you head home: Are you scared?\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : I'm very public and open, and my activism is known. I am not worried. I'm only worried after this law has been signed.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Frank Mugisha, thank you for joining us, and please be safe.\n\nFRANK MUGISHA : Thank you so much.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "'It's been a total witch-hunt. It takes its toll': the LGBTQ+ families fleeing red states\n\nAnti-trans bills and threats leave adults and children fearing for their safety at home\n\nT his month, Lauren Rodriguez will move out of her home in Texas , a state where she has lived for 20 years, to relocate to New Zealand. \"People think we are dramatic for leaving, but when you look at what's happened to my family, we're not,\" she says, amid packing up her life's belongings. \"It has been a total witch-hunt. It takes its toll.\"\n\nSix years ago, Rodriguez's son Grey told her that he was transgender. That first night, she stayed up Googling \"what to do when your kid tells you they're trans\". From there, she took him to get his \"first boy haircut\" and contacted local LGBTQ+ organizations for advice.\n\nAlthough she describes the climate against trans people then as less hostile than it has become, the news was not well received by some in their neighborhood. At the extreme, neighbors, a teacher, and even family members reported Rodriguez to Child Protection Services (CPS) for helping her son, who was then under 18, access gender-affirming medical care. Rodriguez, a social worker, has been on the receiving end of more than 10 complaints to the CPS. All cases were opened, investigated and closed.\n\nDuring this period, Texas was one of a number of Republican-led states where the political mood was changing. The current legislative session in Texas has seen an unprecedented number of anti-gay and anti-trans bills pass through the senate. Some restrict teaching about gender and sexuality in schools. One bill has a section that would allow anyone to criminally prosecute an individual librarian in a school for distributing \"harmful material\".\n\nOther bills would ban drag, while one, SB14, would ban gender-affirming care for under-18s. If it passes, Texas will follow the 19 US states that ban or restrict access to transgender care, with penalties for doctors who break the law.\n\nThis sudden change in political tone has left many in Republican states feeling unsafe. A survey this year found that 50% of LGBTQ+ Florida parents wish to move, particularly in the wake of HB1557 - otherwise known as the \"don't say gay\" bill - passed in March 2022, which bars teachers from educating children between kindergarten and third grade on sexual orientation or gender identity. Under the law, a Florida teacher was recently investigated for showing students a Disney movie featuring a gay character.\n\nAround the same time as the \"don't say gay\" bill was passed in Florida, Texas's governor, Greg Abbott, published a letter calling on \"licensed professionals\" and \"members of the general public\" to report the parents of trans minors to the state if their children appeared to be receiving gender-affirming medical care.\n\nAfter the letter was published, a new case was opened against Rodriguez, and this time the investigations were more violating and intrusive. By this time she had started doing advocacy work for trans kids, including testifying against an anti-LGBTQ+ bill at the state capitol in 2021 about her decision to support her son's top surgery. In 2022, by which point Grey was 18 and away at college, the CPS showed up at Rodriguez's doorstep and workplace. \"The CPS agent read out my testimony as evidence against me,\" she explains. \"The agent called the top surgery 'genital mutilation'. They kept saying that if I could do these things to my kid, I could do it to a client. But I don't know how you could transition an adult client against their will.\"\n\nRodriguez has spent over $15,000 on legal fees defending herself against these claims. During the latest period of investigation against her, she was also doxxed; her address spread online after she spoke out in the press against the worsening climate of transphobia in Texas. Campaigners showed up at her home picketing with signs accusing her of child abuse and posted flyers through her neighbors' mailboxes picturing her face with a target over it. Strangers carrying guns have followed her to work. The police were unable to intervene due to Texas's constitutional carry laws, until one of her tailgaters was arrested for carrying a weapon as a convicted felon.\n\nRodriguez's story is one of many; swathes of LGBTQ+ Americans are either migrating or want to migrate due to anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment in their states. The Miami Heat basketball player Dwyane Wade, who has a teenage trans daughter, recently made headlines for moving his family to California because he did not feel safe raising a child in south Florida amid mounting hostility and regressive legislation. The bill SB254, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis in May 2023, would not only prohibit gender-affirming care for anyone under the age of 18 in Florida, and restrict adult access to this care, but would allow the state to temporarily remove parental custody of trans children.\n\nThese laws encourage the \"financial and emotional destruction\" of LGBTQ+ people, says Bob McCranie, a Texas real estate agent who runs Flee Red States , an initiative he decided to launch in 2021 after observing intimidation of LGBTQ+ friends and colleagues.\n\nFlee Red States operates almost like a refugee organization - except that the migration is internal. People with the financial capital and flexibility to do so are fleeing political persecution in their own country.\n\nSo far he has facilitated moves to Illinois, Colorado, Connecticut, New York and California, working on behalf of those looking to leave states where legislation is making life unlivable, including Texas, Missouri, Alabama, Florida and Tennessee.\n\nEight years ago, when same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide, research found that LGBTQ+ people were moving to red states as conservative cities became more accepting.\n\nFlorida, in particular, drew LGBTQ+ visitors, families and retirees in large number. Areas like Fort Lauderdale, St Petersburg and south Tampa are home to significant LGBTQ+ communities.\n\nHowever, that is changing. Recent safety advisories from Equality Florida and the NAACP address LGBTQ+ people thinking of traveling to the state.\n\n\"I saw the tide beginning to turn against LGBTQ+ people as far back as President Obama's election in 2008,\" says J. Clapp, former executive director of Durham LGBTQ+ Center, who also performs in drag under the name Vivica C Coxx. In North Carolina , where she lives, \"we were a purple state, but the right's response to Obama was: 'We've given them too much rope if they've elected a Black person.' Our somewhat progressive state went immensely conservative.\"\n\nJ. Clapp began experiencing more racism and transphobia, as well as seeing more Confederate flags in Durham. Now, Republicans in North Carolina are pushing to ban drag shows in public places - a move that would have been unexpected 10 years ago. Each morning, J. Clapp checks the headlines on local drag bans.\n\n\"I have a background check, people trust me with their kids. Yet if North Carolina's drag ban goes through, I could be locked up in prison on a federal charge.\"\n\nWhile legislation plays out in the courts, it is engendering more on-the-ground hostility from extremist rightwing groups. In June 2022, 31 members of Patriot Front were arrested en route to a Pride event in Idaho carrying weapons . In Moore county, J. Clapp's local area, a drag event was recently disrupted by a power outage. Reports later showed that the local power substation had been shot out, leaving 40,000 people without power. One resident died in connection with the outage . Like other local activists, J. Clapp believes members of the far right were behind the attack. (The police are investigating far-right groups, though no arrests have been made .) \"No one is standing up against these groups, and we - LGBTQ+ people - just feel helpless.\"\n\nOf the half a dozen families the Guardian spoke to for this piece, each mentioned gun crime in the context of their fears over rising anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment. \"Permitless gun laws cause a lot of people to be very concerned for their lives,\" says Julio Capó Jr, author of Welcome to Fairyland: Queer Miami before 1940 and a professor of history at Florida University. \"After the Pulse massacre [in Orlando], as a gay Latino man in Florida, I'd be lying if I said that when I go to a gay bar I am not looking for exits. These laws only further my fear and anxiety.\"\n\nMcCranie, meanwhile, recalls a local Pride event last year where he was met with intimidation. \"The event was like a community fair - and there were people dressed in all black with their faces covered and AK47s on their backs, taking pictures of us for their book of people they don't like. Tell me why I would stay in a state that allows this.\n\n\"When we talk about the migration happening, it's a combination of anti-trans and anti-gay laws and the armed wing of the Republican party. I call them the brown shirts. This situation, it's creating a pressure cooker for the community.\"\n\nMcCranie believes that with the climate worsening in Texas with each legislative session, LGBTQ+ families and individuals should consider moving now, before \"the writing is on the wall\", as he puts it. \"I think the urgency is about a four or a five right now and my concern is when it gets to nine, it will be too late. People won't be able to get out.\"\n\nFor many parents of younger trans kids in states like Texas and Florida, the moment to move has already arrived, less of a choice and more of a necessity, given how many bills are specifically seeking to limit or criminalize gender-affirming treatments.\n\nCamille Rey moved from Texas to Maryland in August 2021 after that year's legislative session. When her son, who is trans and now 10 years old, began to use his new legal name, Leon, his pediatrician refused to use his new gender marker and pronouns. He began experiencing physical and mental health problems linked to stress. Like Rodriguez, Rey testified at the capitol against bills that would ban or limit gender-reaffirming care for minors, \"I had taken him to the capitol to testify with me,\" says Rey. \"He wanted to come, but maybe it was a mistake. He heard the opposition testify, people spewing all kinds of bile. Due to the stress of that, he began having chronic stomach pains. At one point, it was so bad we thought he had appendicitis.\"\n\nLeaving Texas meant moving two kids out of their school, spending $20,000 on the move (plus fees to sell their home), and no longer having access to immediate family, but Rey felt it was the right decision for Leon's welfare. She no longer feels safe returning to Texas: \"I feel like a political refugee in my own country.\"\n\nAnother mother of a trans minor, Karen, who wishes to keep her full name private, relocated from Texas to Portland, Oregon, in June 2022. The decisive moment arrived shortly after she learned that her daughter, Jessie, now eleven, would not be able to compete in female sports if they remained in Texas, after a bill banning trans youth from playing on sports teams aligned with their gender went into effect in January 2022. Karen was also conscious that teachers might not be obliged to honor Jessie's pronouns (already the case in one Texas school district ). \"If teachers don't have to honor a person's pronouns, or aren't even allowed to acknowledge someone's gender identity, not only are things bad now, I struggle to see how they are going to get better.\"\n\nWhile Karen had not been put under investigation by the CPS, she feared that if she did not leave Texas, they would soon come for her. \"Even after the move, it took almost a year for my nervous system to recover from the stress of that.\"\n\nHowever, not everybody is afforded the choice to move. Saundra Mitchell, a YA author specializing in LGBTQ+ storytelling, and her wife, Jayne Walters, a trans woman and librarian, have been based in Indiana for 26 years. They have been looking to move their family for 10 months but are struggling to find a new job for Walters. \"This year, we had 27 anti-LGBTQ+ bills in committee here in Indiana. At the beginning of the session, the ACLU suggested that most of them will probably die, but so far, all of them have passed, as Indiana tries to keep up with other red states,\" says Mitchell. \"They're making it a felony to give a kid a book with queer characters, so as a YA author and librarian, we need to get out of here sooner rather than later.\"\n\nRight now, as with many red states, laws are focusing on children. Mitchell believes that as part of the next legislative session, laws will focus more heavily on adults, potentially compromising her wife's access to hormones. \"These laws,\" she adds, referring to local censorship laws and drag bans, \"are encroaching on free speech. It is becoming actively dangerous for us here, and my wife won't necessarily be able to access healthcare. Under censorship laws, we could both be arrested for felonies, and once you have a felony [on your record] you can't vote any more. Why is the response always, you guys can just move ?\" Both Mitchell and her daughter are living with disabilities, and Mitchell says the family would struggle in any state with a higher cost of living than Indiana. \"We do not have a big savings account, and it's not like we're 20 and we can just grab a duffle and go where we want to. We've been married for more than 25 years and we have a family. We can't just pick up and hope it works out.\"\n\n\"Finding jobs, setting up a social network, kids in schools, parents in care ... economically and socially, moving states is not something you do on a whim,\" says McCranie.\n\nJ. Clapp points out that even if you do relocate, you're not necessarily safer. At least 32 trans people were murdered in the US in 2022, most of whom were trans women of color. Two trans people - Daniel Aston and Kelly Loving - were killed during the Club Q shooting in Colorado, a blue state. J. Clapp chooses to stay and fight against anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in North Carolina and continue her drag performances, writing in a recent campaigning newsletter: \"We are not going anywhere.\" But she also doesn't feel like moving would benefit her. \"I don't think anywhere in the US is universally safe for me.\"\n\nIn Maryland, Camille Rey's son's health has improved, while in Oregon, one year on from their move, Karen says her family is much happier. She has noticed a trend, though, among her new blue state neighbors, of talking about anti-LGBTQ+ laws as an \"over there\" problem.\n\nThe reality is that anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment is not limited geographically. Pride parades continue to be attacked. Shootings like that in Colorado Springs show that LGBTQ+ lives are at risk everywhere. Factions of the Republican party are pushing for a national \"don't say gay\" bill . In the wake of Ron DeSantis's 2024 presidential run announcement, campaigners worry that even blue states may not provide safety or shelter for queer people for long.\n\n\"The 14th amendment has been gutted with the overtaking of Roe v Wade. If the 14th amendment goes, our right to marriage and our freedom from sodomy laws, all that could go on a national level,\" says McCranie. \"So if we flee the state, but our rights go on a national level, the question becomes: do we need to flee the United States? I'm asking people I know: do you have a parent or grandparent from another country? You should go get that passport now.\"\n\nMitchell and her wife are aiming to move to Minnesota due to its proximity to Canada, just in case. (Justin Trudeau has shown support for trans communities .) Rodriguez explains that she chose to leave the country, rather than Texas, so that she only has to move once. \"My fear with the safe states is, what if the US passes federal anti-LGBTQ+ laws?\" she says. \"I had one house to sell, I had to do it to fund to go anywhere, so I should go where I don't have to worry about what happens at the next election.\"\n\nAcross the US, the ACLU has filed lawsuits against countless anti-LGBTQ+ laws, several of which the organization has won. If it passes, they are likely to challenge SB14 , the Texas law that would block under-18s from accessing transition-related medical treatments, which is opposed by the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. In the meantime, these laws are severely affecting trans people's lives. A January report from the Trevor Project, a national LGBTQ+ youth suicide prevention organization, found that 71% of LGBTQ+ youth said debates over bills affecting how they live negatively impacted their mental health .\n\nActivists also fear that an exodus of LGBTQ+ people from red states will mean the diminished presence of LGBTQ+ communities and campaigners long term. Jo Ivester, a Texas-based trans rights campaigner and author of the book Never A Girl, Always a Boy, about her experience raising a trans son, explains: \"I have friends who have moved out of state, out of the country, and others who are terrified to speak up, or come to the capitol and testify. Some will no longer come to Pride parades because they're scared that if they do, the government will take their kids away.\" This has left it more important for families like hers, with adult trans children, to advocate, she says.\n\nMcCranie would like to see outrage at the fact that people are being driven from their homes. \"I have friends in [my local town] Carlton - they come to the LGBTQ+ bake sale, participate in Pride, shake our hands. But when I talk about these issues, they think: 'Oh, Bob's going off again!' They say: 'Oh, I hate politics!' Well, this isn't politics. This is our lives.\"\n\nThis article was amended on 7 June 2023 to clarify references to locations where Flee Red States has worked."

      "text": "US religious right at center of anti-LGBTQ+ message pushed around the world\n\nAmerican groups have helped to establish global web who share ideas and funding in bid to restrict gay and trans rights\n\nWhen the US evangelical preacher and anti-LGBTQ+ crusader Scott Lively landed in Uganda in 2009 to warn of the \"gay agenda\", he was arriving after a series of culture-war defeats at home.\n\nMore and more US states were recognizing same-sex marriage, and opinion polls were showing fewer and fewer Americans objected. Lively was there to offer Uganda's lawmakers some advice on how to drum up outrage. \"Emphasize the issue of the homosexual recruitment of children,\" he advised.\n\nFive years later, Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni signed a law that made same-sex relationships punishable by death, asserting that western groups and gay people were \"coming into our schools and recruiting young children into homosexuality\".\n\nAs wave of anti LGBTQ+ legislation sweeps the US, some may hear echoes of Lively's messaging. Fine-tuned in Africa and elsewhere, arguments used to attack rights overseas have been re-imported to the US as the religious right warns again that the left and gay people are \"grooming seven-year-olds\" and \" promoting pedophilia \".\n\nThe spread across the world illustrates how America's evangelical and Catholic right has globalized over the past 15 years by helping establish a vast web of anti-LGBTQ+ zealots who share ideas, messaging and funding.\n\nAfrica, eastern Europe and Latin America often function as petri dishes for strategy as US groups abroad help craft legislation and fight legal battles. The new global front in culture wars is in turn empowering a resurgent domestic religious right that is pushing book bans , Pride flag bans and record 491 state level bills targeting LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nIn late June an argument frequently made by the European religious right - that religion-based objections to same-sex marriage trumped the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals - was used to win a case before the US supreme court that critics say will allow businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people.\n\n\"The policy ideas and solutions that are traveling the globe look rather similar,\" said David Paternotte, a sociologist at Université libre de Bruxelles. \"The US is a key player in that game, but the circulations can go in different directions.\"\n\nThe religious right's play in Africa, where it has successfully lodged itself in many nations' political and elite establishment, is about \"power and money\", said Kapya Kaoma, a Uganda-born pastor who now lives in Boston. How that global success has fueled the religious right \"is something people in the west fail to understand\", he added.\n\nLively is not acting alone: the US Christian right spent at least $280m abroad between 2008 and 2019, an investigation by the British news site openDemocracy found. Lively, however, is among the most infamous, having made his name from his 1995 book The Pink Swastika: Homosexuality in the Nazi Party, which claimed Hitler and Nazi leadership were gay, and gay men were behind the Holocaust.\n\nHis 2009 speech to Uganda's parliament planted the seeds for the 2014 Anti-Homosexuality Act, which was ultimately struck down by the nation's supreme court. But Uganda recently passed a new version with the help of fundamentalist US groups like Family Watch International, whose leader, Sharon Slater, has said LGBTQ+ rights are \"fictitious\", and The Family, a secretive group that reportedly helped author the bill. OpenDemocracy found it spent $20m in Africa between 2008 and 2019.\n\nGhana, Kenya, Tanzania and other nations have introduced anti-LGBTQ+ bills that impose harsher punishments with the assistance of US groups.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Christian right in the European Union largely focuses on legal infrastructure, said Neil Datta, who leads the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights.\n\n\"The added value the Americans bring is the expertise of the legal culture wars in the US,\" he said. \"There's 60 more years of litigation on social issues than what we have in Europe.\"\n\nHungary banned the sharing of LGBTQ+ content to people under 18, and passed a law allowing anonymous reporting of same-sex couples raising children. Its far-right leader Viktor Orbán recently echoed Lively when he defended the legislation, saying in a speech : \"Gender propaganda is not just ... rainbow chatter, but the greatest threat stalking our children.\"\n\nIn Poland, authorities have used new laws to harass LGBTQ+ activists, and around 100 municipalities - nearly a third of the country - in 2019 passed resolutions declaring themselves free of \"LGBT ideology\".\n\nAmong key US groups backing these other efforts are the American Center for Law and Justice and European Centre for Law and Justice (ECLJ), both run by Donald Trump's former personal attorney, Jay Sekulow. In a legal brief, the ECLJ defended the Polish municipalities, arguing there is nothing discriminatory \"in considering that pro-LGBT+ social pressure is the vector of an ideology, and in refusing to promote it among children\". The ECLJ has also provided legal assistance defending Italy's ban on gay marriage, and for other human rights cases at the EU level.\n\nOpenDemocracy identified over $14m that Sekulow's US operation has spent in Europe since 2007, which is part of at least $88m in total spending by the US Christian right during the same period.\n\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), which boasts having won 14 supreme court cases since 2011, has spent $21m in Europe and regularly intervenes or argues in front of the European Court of Human Rights. In 2015, it defended national laws requiring sterilization for transgender people, telling the court \"equal dignity does not mean that every sexual orientation warrants equal respect\".\n\nLeaders from the world's religious right regularly meet at forums hosted by groups across the globe, like the Conservative Political Action Coalition (CPAC) , World Congress of Families and Political Network for Values.\n\n\"Once they're all there together they exchange ideas and they're able to see 'Well, this worked well in this country, so I can take and adopt it, and it should work in my country's context,'\" Datta said.\n\nIn Europe, the religious right's latest messaging has its roots in the 1990s, when social advances that expanded rights for LGBTQ+ people and access to abortion drew the ire of the Vatican and other European conservative groups.\n\n\"They had lost these important moments and went through a process of thinking: why did we lose? Was it our narrative, leaders, strategy?\" Datta said.\n\nOut of that process, the Vatican in the 2000s developed the term \"gender ideology\", Datta said, which is similar to potent transgender messaging the US religious right imported several years later.\n\n\"There can be different versions in different countries, but it means the same thing, and it works very well in other languages,\" Datta said. The term has functioned as a rallying cry in Europe around which the political and legal infrastructure sprouted with the assistance of US expertise and funding.\n\nAt the same time, the European religious right \"modernized\" its messaging, Paternotte said. It is no longer \"trying to be against things, but in favor of things\", he added: instead of being against LGBTQ+ rights, it is \"pro-family\".\n\nThe religious right also now positions itself as a defender of human rights, but that's \"partly a trick\", Paterrnotte said. Though it claims to be for freedom of speech, it is against gay marriage, so the religious right feels it should not have to accept gay marriage, and attempts to limit speech around it.\n\n\"Then that human right [religious freedom] is more important than other human rights,\" Paternotte said. \"They're trying to redefine human rights in a more restrictive sense ... and that's happening nationally and globally.\"\n\nThe ADF effectively made that argument in a recent case before the US supreme court, which ruled on 30 June that a conservative website designer could refuse service to a gay couple despite a Colorado state law that forbids discrimination against LGBTQ+ people.\n\nFollowing the ruling, the ADF general counsel Kristen Waggoner wrote in a statement: \"Disagreement isn't discrimination, and the government can't mislabel speech as discrimination to censor it.\"\n\nJust as it has in the US in recent years, the European religious right has claimed expanded LGBTQ+ rights are a form of \"totalitarianism\". Other variations of that message hold that the European Union is engaged in a form of imperialism.\n\nIn its legal brief to the EU human rights court defending some nations' forced sterilization programs for transgender people, the ADF wrote that protecting those laws \"is a powerful way of ensuring that human rights are properly protected whilst at the same time mitigating the risk of human rights imperialism\".\n\nA similar tactic has been used in Uganda by the religious right and Museveni.\n\n\"There's now an attempt at social imperialism, to impose social values,\" Museveni said after signing the 2014 bill. \"We're sorry to see that you [the west] live the way you live, but we keep quiet about it.\"\n\nIn reality, many western religious leaders have profited from business in Africa and are embedded with countries' leaders, which is a form of colonialism, said Victor Mukasa, a transgender person with Sexual Minorities Uganda who now lives in the US.\n\nLively's 2009 visit in which he addressed Uganda's parliament represented a pivotal moment on several levels. It marked the beginning of the US religious right's close relations with the government, and while Ugandans prior to Lively's campaign generally did not approve of homosexuality, the US pastor's message that LGBTQ+ people were \"preying on\" children generated a dangerous climate.\n\n\"Here was propaganda saying we were sodomizing children while parents were at work, and we were recruiting teenagers in big numbers into homosexuality,\" Mukasa said.\n\nSince then, the religious right and Ugandan government have run an effective propaganda machine that capitalizes on a dearth of information available to many Ugandans, Kaoma said.\n\nWhen a transgender person recently went on a shooting spree in Tennessee, the story was pushed in Uganda as an example of LGBTQ+ violence, just as it was in the US, Kaoma said. But most Africans do not know that the majority of mass shootings in the US are carried out by rightwing straight men, and there is little counter to the messaging.\n\n\"Africans who don't know the context look at this and say, 'This is what transgender people do,'\" Kaoma said.\n\nThough some find Lively's assertion that the Nazi leadership was gay to be absurd, Kaoma said it is common for LGBTQ+ people to be compared by African and US religious right leadership to Nazis or others who carry out genocide, and use that as a call to arms.\n\n\"They say, 'If you don't fight this movement, lose your rights, lose your children,' and that has led to the destruction of human life,\" Kaoma said. \"Unless the world becomes aware of this, Africa will never be the same again.\"\n\nThe solutions are few. Kaoma called on Pope Francis to intervene but the Vatican has long avoided the issue until earlier this year when Francis said being gay is a sin, but not a crime.\n\nFor Mukasa, there is no easy solution, but he and others are working on engaging Ugandans, and \"sensitizing our communities and being present in our communities in safe ways so that they see the humanity in us\".\n\n\"So they see that we too are parents, we too protect our children, we too are professionals, that we love our country, and we will stand to protect our country,\" Mukasa said."

      "text": "Poll shows US public support for LGBTQ+ protections falling for first time since 2015\n\nNew survey suggests decline has strong correlation between Christian nationalism and opposition to inclusive policies\n\nPublic support for same-sex marriage and nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ Americans has fallen, even as the overall share remains high, according to new findings by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute .\n\nBroad majorities of Americans, regardless of political party or faith, continue to support LGBTQ+ rights and protections, the analysis found. But after years of rising public support, the decline is notable, said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the PRRI.\n\nThe survey analyzed Americans' attitudes toward LGBTQ+ rights across three policies: same-sex marriage, nondiscrimination protections and religion-based service refusals. It found support for all three measures had softened for the first time since the PRRI began tracking views of the issues nearly a decade ago.\n\nWhile the \"vast majority of Americans continue to endorse protections for LGBTQ Americans\", Deckman said the results may serve as a \"warning sign\" for those working to safeguard the rights of LGBTQ+ Americans amid a conservative legislative and legal effort to erode them.\n\n\"There was an expectation over the past few years that support for LGBTQ+ rights was gradually growing stronger among all sectors of American society and, in fact, up until last year, our own American Values Atlas found that support was gradually rising if not staying steady across a number of indicators,\" she said. \"This is really the first time we've seen a decline in support.\"\n\nAccording to its findings:\n\nSupport for same-sex marriage slipped from 69% of Americans in 2022 to 67% in 2023.\n\nSupport for policies that protect LGBTQ+ Americans from discrimination in employment, housing and public discrimination fell from 80% in 2022 to 76% in 2023.\n\nOpposition to allowing businesses to refuse services to LGBTQ+ Americans on religious grounds dropped from 65% of Americans in 2022 to 60% in 2023.\n\nThe analysis also identified a strong correlation between those who adhere to Christian nationalism - a once-fringe belief that the US was founded as a Christian nation and its laws should reflect Christian values - and opposition to policies protecting LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nThe changes were largely driven by a shift in conservative attitudes toward LGBTQ+ protections.\n\nSlightly fewer Republicans said they favored laws protecting LGBTQ+ Americans from discrimination in 2023 than did in 2015, despite rising support in the intervening years. The decline was especially notable between 2022, when two in three Republicans backed such protections, and 2023, when the share dropped to roughly six in 10.\n\nAmericans overwhelmingly agree same-sex couples should have the legal right to marry, a majority that has grown notably stronger since 2014, when the PRRI began tracking the issue. But in 2023, support for the constitutional right declined among Republicans, down to 47% from 49% in 2022. There was also a 2% decrease among independent voters, from 73% in 2022 to 71% a year later.\n\nThe findings, based on interviews with more than 22,000 adults conducted by the PRRI throughout 2023 as part of its American Values Atlas, come amid a worrying legal and political landscape for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nPublic support for LGBTQ+ rights soared following the supreme court's 2015 ruling that established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. In response, social conservatives have orchestrated a well-funded backlash to the expansion of rights for LGBTQ+ Americans, waging an aggressive campaign against the trans community as a way to rally the Republican base.\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nThe survey, Deckman said, \"reminds us that you can't necessarily expect [support for] hard-fought rights for some Americans to continue going up in perpetuity. Nor can you expect that even when a strong majority of Americans support your views ... that that's enough to protect the legal rights of LGBTQ+ Americans.\"\n\nThe supreme court last year ruled that a Colorado web designer had the right under the first amendment to refuse to design wedding websites for same-sex couples despite a state law forbidding discrimination against gay people. The dissenting liberal justices warned the conservative-majority's decision was a \"license to discriminate\".\n\nIn the high court's consequential 2022 decision overturning Roe v Wade, conservative justice Clarence Thomas suggested it reconsider Lawrence v Texas, the 2003 case that invalidated sodomy laws across the country and Obergefell v Hodges, the 2015 case that established the right for same-sex couples to marry.\n\nAt the state level, Republican-led legislatures have enacted a sweeping array of new laws banning gender-affirming care for transgender youth and, in some cases, adults as well as placing new controls on gender expression in schools from the pronouns students use to the sports teams they play on, the books they can read and the bathrooms they are allowed to use. Several states have also moved to restrict drag performances .\n\nAs part of its analysis, the PRRI survey also offered a detailed portrait on LGBTQ+ Americans. According to the findings, more than one in 10 Americans identified as part of the LGBTQ+ community in 2023, including 22% of Americans under the age of 30. Among LGBTQ+ Americans, 45% identify as bisexual; 34% as gay or lesbian; 21% \"something else\"; and 2% as transgender or nonbinary.\n\nMore than half of LGBTQ+ Americans are religiously unaffiliated, while more than a third identify with a Christian faith. Nearly six in 10 LGBTQ+ Americans consider themselves politically liberal."

      "text": "US hard-right policy group condemned for 'dehumanising' anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric\n\nProject 2025, which seeks to 'march into office' with conservative 'army', accused of 'far-right desire to turn America back to the 20s'\n\nAn exhaustive manifesto for the next conservative US president produced by Project 2025 , an initiative led by the hard-right Heritage Foundation, uses \"dehumanising language\" about LGBTQ+ Americans too extreme even for candidates currently seeking the Republican presidential nomination, a leading advocate said.\n\n\"The dehumanising language is consistent with the way the right talks about LGBTQ+ people overall,\" said Sasha Buchert, director of the Non-Binary and Transgender Rights Project for Lambda Legal .\n\n\"They're never talking about transgender people or gay and lesbian people, it's always referring to them as an ideology of some kind, or an 'ism'. There's no humanity involved ... Not even the presidential candidates in the Republican debates are embracing this kind of rhetoric.\"\n\nDonald Trump is the clear leader of that Republican race, despite facing 91 criminal charges and multiple civil suits. Primary candidates have eagerly embraced anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric, particularly over state anti-trans laws and the place of LGBTQ+ issues in public education. This summer, however, Trump's closest polling rival, Ron DeSantis, was forced on to the defensive over an online video that used harsh imagery and language to accuse Trump of being too soft on LGBTQ+ issues.\n\nBy its own description , Project 2025 is the work of \"a broad coalition of over 70 conservative organisations\", aiming to shape the presidential transition should a rightwing candidate beat Joe Biden next year.\n\nIn the words of Paul Dans, its director, Project 2025 is \"systematically preparing to march into office and bring a new army, aligned, trained, and essentially weaponised conservatives ready to do battle against the deep state\".\n\nSuch language may echo conspiracy-tinged rants by Trump and his supporters, but that \"army\" has produced something solid: Mandate for Leadership: the Conservative Promise , a 920-page document that sets out policy wishes across the breadth of the federal government.\n\nOn LGBTQ+ rights, Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, sets the tone with his introduction.\n\nComplaining that in Biden's America \"children suffer the toxic normalisation of transgenderism with drag queens and pornography invading their school libraries\", Roberts writes: \"Pornography, manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualisation of children ... is not a political Gordian knot inextricably binding up disparate claims about free speech, property rights, sexual liberation, and child welfare. It has no claim to first amendment protection.\"\n\nHe goes on to suggest wide-ranging criminal penalties.\n\nPurveyors of pornography, Roberts writes, \"are child predators and misogynistic exploiters of women. Their product is as addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime. Pornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered.\"\n\nIn a later chapter, on the Department of Health and Human Services, Roger Severino , Heritage Foundation vice-president of domestic policy, advocates a more focused approach: \"The president should direct agencies to rescind regulations interpreting sex discrimination provisions as prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, sex characteristics, etc.\".\n\nSuch draconian pronouncements have prompted alarm among progressives, over apparent implications including the possible criminalisation of LGBTQ+ issues, expression and people.\n\nIn contrast, legal and presidential transition sources suggested that such extreme implications of the Mandate for Leadership were unlikely to assume concrete form any time soon, given existing guardrails.\n\nNo incoming Republican administration would be required or guaranteed to pick up the Mandate for Leadership, let alone implement all its demands.\n\nFurthermore, as reported by the New York Times and by the Guardian in relation to climate policy, implementation of many Project 2025 recommendations would rely on broad acceptance of unitary executive theory , a contested vision of strong presidential power, from a compliant Congress and supreme court.\n\nImplementation of \" Schedule F \", a plan formulated by extreme Trump allies to purge the federal bureaucracy of officials deemed insufficiently loyal, would also likely be needed, to force government departments to accept a reshaping of US law and life by presidential fiat.\n\nBut as the former Trump White House aides Johnny McEntee and Russell Vought , key drivers of Schedule F , are also involved in Project 2025, so advocates say the Mandate for Leadership should be taken seriously.\n\nOn Monday, Rachel Bitecofer, a progressive political scientist and activist , said : \"Every incoming Republican administration is handed the Manual For Leadership. Two thirds of the 2016 manual was implemented. The Project 2025 manual ... purges the civil service of all (perceived) political 'enemies' [and] advises to ignore checks and balances of the constitution. Pass it on.\"\n\nAsked if Project 2025 could be seen as part of an attempt to move the Overton window (a political science concept describing \"policies that are widely accepted throughout society as legitimate options\"), perhaps in the way years of rightwing invective paid off last year with the removal of abortion rights, Buchert said: \"Absolutely. One hundred percent.\n\n\"Clearly, they're embracing ideology, not what the American public wants or needs. This is being driven by a far-right desire to turn America back to the 1920s, or even further back.\n\n\"It's not just about LGBTQ+ people. It's about women's rights. It's about the right to obtain education that reflects your existence as an African American person in this country. There are so many strands where you can see it clearly being pushed by a small fraction of the country doggedly pursuing their ideology.\"\n\nPointing to victories for Lambda and other advocacy groups over anti-trans and other rightwing laws at the state level , Buchert said: \"These attacks are out of step with the way Americans view and trust LGBTQ+ people, so I'm confident they'll continue to fail.\"\n\nBut, she said, efforts such as Project 2025 \"will add more fuel to the fire and encourage more anti-LGBTQ legislation ... reflect[ing] the worldview that they want, where LGBTQ+ people live lives of quiet desperation and fear\".\n\nThis article was amended on 26 March 2024 to correct a link to a quote by Paul Dans of Heritage.

      "text": "If Trump wins the election, he could launch a 'catastrophic' rollback of LGBTQ+ rights\n\nRepublican state lawmakers are already targeting trans people with discriminatory policies. A second-term Trump is likely to use the US government to launch a 'catastrophic' rollback of LGBTQ+ rights\n\nOne morning in February, 16-year-old Levi Hormuth took off school, his parents called out of work, and the three began a five and a half hour drive.\n\nThe purpose of the 350-mile trip from their home in St Charles county, Missouri, to Chicago, Illinois, was a routine doctor's appointment.\n\nLevi, a transgender boy, now 17 and in his final year of high school, had been a patient at the Washington University (WashU) Transgender Center since he was 13. The center, a short drive from home, had helped Levi in his transition, providing counseling and eventually hormone treatments at age 15. The testosterone had profoundly positive impacts, Levi and his parents said, helping him overcome significant mental distress stemming from his gender dysphoria.\n\nBut in June 2023, Missouri's Republican governor enacted a bill banning gender-affirming healthcare for youth under 18. The law had an exception for youth like Levi who were already accessing the care, but WashU, fearing legal liability, stopped prescribing medications to all trans youth .\n\nThe best alternative for Levi and his family was to cross state lines.\n\n\"The fact that I have to drive five hours both ways for treatment just shows our government in Missouri doesn't care about things that are actually important,\" Levi said one afternoon, sitting on his backyard deck with his parents in St Charles county, which is more conservative than neighboring St Louis county. \"We have potholes galore that should be fixed, we have horrible crime rates. It's enraging that they're not focusing on what matters and listening to our voices.\"\n\nThe stakes of the presidential election are enormous for people like Levi and the broader LGBTQ+ community.\n\nDonald Trump has promised aggressive attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, with a focus on trans youth, who have been a central target of the GOP's culture war. The former president's proposed \"plan to protect children from left-wing gender insanity\" includes ordering federal agencies to end all programs that \"promote ... gender transition at any age\"; revoking funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to youth and subjecting them to US justice department investigations; punishing schools that affirm trans youth; and pushing a federal law stating the government doesn't legally recognize trans people.\n\nTrump has also pledged to rescind federal LGBTQ+ nondiscrimination policies, which could mean a loss of protections in housing, healthcare, employment, education and a range of federal programs. He has promised new credentialing for teachers to \"promote positive education about the nuclear family, the roles of mothers and fathers\". The Republican platform calls for advancing a \"culture that values the sanctity of marriage\".\n\nProject 2025 , the rightwing manifesto authored by Trump allies, is even more explicit, saying Biden-Harris pro-LGBTQ+ policies should be replaced by ones supporting the \"formation of stable, married, nuclear families\" and \"heterosexual, intact marriage\". It says adoption agencies, healthcare workers and businesses should be able to reject LGBTQ+ people, and faith-based government contractors should be allowed to deny services to people who don't fit \"biblically based\" definitions of marriage.\n\nSome legal scholars have warned that marriage equality, already endangered at the supreme court , could be further threatened under Trump, particularly if he gets the opportunity to appoint additional justices.\n\n\"It is terrifying to think about our government actively, strategically and intentionally coming for our community in every aspect of our lives,\" said Cathy Renna, communications director of the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, a national rights group. \"These attempts to erase our community would have just absolutely devastating impacts.\"\n\nIf elected, Trump is expected to weaponize the US government to authorize, encourage and mandate widespread anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination.\n\nIn his first term, Trump banned trans people from the military , and Project 2025 calls for the policy's reinstatement. The Republican presidential nominee is also likely to assert that employers' \"religious beliefs\" provide a lawful justification for firing LGBTQ+ workers, either through an executive order or regulations, the ACLU recently warned .\n\nLGBTQ+ people could also be denied housing under a new Trump term, which could see a return to his efforts to exclude trans people from homeless shelters, said Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO of Glaad: \"Everything is at risk for us in the election - our workplace, our relationships, our families, our marriages, education, our housing.\"\n\nAdvocates fear Trump's anti-LGBTQ+ agenda would undo the Biden administration's foster care regulations meant to ensure queer and trans youth are placed in supportive homes. Brandon Wolf, press secretary of the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ group, said that rollback would endanger kids' lives, noting survey data suggesting half of trans and non-binary youth have considered suicide . He recalled being a teenager in Oregon when the state banned gay marriage and how that emboldened his classmates' homophobia\n\n\"It's not easy to be a young person when your president is demeaning, demoralizing and dehumanizing members of your community,\" Wolf said, \"and Trump would be catastrophic\".\n\nProject 2025 further equates trans-inclusive reading materials to \"pornography\", suggesting teachers and librarians should be imprisoned as sex offenders if they promote \"transgender ideology\". This would probably require a law from Congress, but the push echoes GOP state bills across the country seeking to criminalize drag art and gender nonconformity. And Trump himself has increasingly spread blatant misinformation fearmongering about trans kids' healthcare.\n\nBeyond explicit attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, advocates fear the politicization of federal public health agencies could impede critical research and HIV prevention efforts. \"The support we get from the federal government, while it might not be enough, is what's keeping some people alive,\" said Dwayne Kwaysee Wright, a director of DEI initiatives at George Washington University. \"So the stakes are no more than life or death.\"\n\nAlexander Chen, founding director of Harvard Law's LGBTQ+ advocacy clinic, who previously helped challenge the trans military ban, said a second Trump term could be \"much more dangerous\" than his first. As president, Trump introduced some of his most extreme policies in a chaotic, brash manner - including via tweets , with little thought to legality or implementation - resulting in successful court challenges. With support from conservative groups like Project 2025, Trump 2.0 could be significantly more strategic and effective if he returns to the White House.\n\nKamala Harris has not released detailed LGBTQ+ rights policies, but her platform says she would fight to pass the Equality Act, which would enshrine LGBTQ+ protections into law. As a California prosecutor, she was an early champion of marriage equality, but had a mixed record on trans rights; she has since earned support from some prominent trans advocates and major LGBTQ+ groups.\n\nThe ACLU has urged Harris to build on Biden's legacy and fight to protect LGBTQ+ people from state attacks on their rights and expand access to trans healthcare in federal programs.\n\nA Trump spokesperson declined to comment on specific policies, and said in an email: \"President Trump will implement policies that uplifts ALL Americans, regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation.\" The Harris campaign did not respond to inquiries.\n\nMissouri, a national leader in anti-trans policy , offers a window into the hostile climate Trump and his allies seek to expand. It is one of 26 states that have restricted gender-affirming healthcare, affecting an estimated 118,300 trans kids ages 13 to 17.\n\nStudies have found that care is linked to improved mental health. But in recent years, there's been a growing movement to criminalize those treatments for trans youth, pushed by the same groups promoting anti-abortion laws forcing patients to cross state lines for procedures.\n\nSixteen Democratic-run states and Washington DC have pushed back, adopting \"sanctuary\" laws protecting gender-affirming care, according to Elana Redfield, federal policy director at UCLA's Williams Institute . \"There's evidence it's beneficial for trans people to get this care, so to have it rapidly restricted is likely very distressing,\" she said.\n\nLevi, the St Charles teenager, was isolated and detached before he transitioned, his parents recalled. He didn't want to go out in public. He'd have meltdowns and remain balled up in his closet. He struggled with self harm. Once he expressed his identity and the family met with experts who helped them understand gender dysphoria, \"he came out of his shell and became a totally different person, a joyous person, a really fun kid,\" said Becky Hormuth, his mother, who is a teacher. \"It's unimaginable to think he can be this joyous when the entire world is pretty much attacking his existence.\"\n\nKyle Hormuth, Levi's father, who works in healthcare, said when it became clear gender-affirming treatment could help address his son's suicidality, \"we jumped right on board. I'll support my children no matter what because I'd much rather have my child in my life than not in my life. I want my kids to live and thrive and be what they want to be.\"\n\nAfter Missouri's ban passed, Becky got Levi on a waitlist for a Chicago clinic, but for months it was unclear if he'd be accepted \"That's when I really started to spiral into a panic\", he recalled.\n\nShe started rationing Levi's treatments. It was a relief once they got into Chicago, but the travel was exhausting. Levi had to cross into Illinois again weeks after his first visit to do bloodwork, which was required to be done within the state.\n\nLosing access to testosterone wasn't an option, Levi said, his eyes welling with tears: \"After all of this holding myself together, that would probably be the thing that breaks me.\" He said he recognized some people were uninformed about trans identities:. \"People fear what they cannot understand.\" But he was fed up with those in power unwilling to learn. \"How am I supposed to talk to you if you aren't going to listen?\"\n\nBecky said the constant attacks on their rights had caused great anxiety. \"When I'm at a store, I scan the room and wonder, are you a hateful person? Are you someone who thinks vile things about my family and the community I advocate for?\"\n\nThe Hormuths have considered leaving Missouri, but Levi wanted to stay in his school to support younger LGBTQ+ kids.\n\nYounger trans kids are particularly vulnerable if Trump is re-elected.\n\nWilliam, an 11-year-old trans boy in St Louis, was adamant about his gender from a young age, said his mother, Marie, who asked to use their middle names to protect their privacy. Just before he turned seven, the two heard a radio segment about a trans woman who was killed, prompting her to explain anti-trans discrimination.\n\n\"His takeaway was: 'That is how I feel. I think I'm trans. Does that mean I'm going to get killed, too?'\" Marie recalled. She was glad the conversation gave him language to express himself, but regretted the fear it instilled. Once he spoke openly about being a boy, the depression he'd been suffering dissipated. \"He said, 'I just feel so much better.' He was bouncing off the walls like a balloon, so happy and free.\"\n\nWilliam had a supportive gender-affirming healthcare team, which was on track to prescribe puberty blockers after years of living as a boy - until the GOP criminalized this treatment. \"It's terrifying and extremely stressful,\" said Marie, who eventually got William seen at a clinic in Peoria, Illinois, two and a half hours away. But that facility didn't offer prescriptions he needed, forcing her to seek an appointment in Chicago. \"I keep having to start all over,\" said Marie.\n\nSeated with his mother outside the food business she runs one afternoon, William was cheerful, talking about how popular he was at summer camp, his love of sleepovers, his plans to swim with dolphins, his dreams of being a baseball announcer and how he chose his name based on his first crush. \"It's embarrassing but I was so young and mindless then,\" he admitted.\n\nHe said he didn't mind the drive to Peoira, because his mom got him doughnuts. He knows they may have to go to Chicago next. \"My mom's gonna feel bad, so I'll get to stay in a hotel and get snacks and movie night.\"\n\n\"We'll do our best to make it fun,\" added Marie.\n\nWilliam's message to lawmakers forcing him to go across state lines?\n\n\"Trans people are just other humans,\" he said. \"If they put themselves in my shoes, they'd change their mind.\""

It was a bold look at the heart of Manchester's gay scene that provided something then rare in British television: a joyous exploration of what it meant to be gay.\n\n\"I vividly remember thinking: 'Canal Street, does such a place really exist?'\" says the BBC Radio 2 DJ Owain Wyn Evans. \"It was a far cry from the head count of absolute zero role models or reference points available for me at the time in Ammanford, south Wales.\"\n\nThe show has been celebrated as a pivotal moment of LGBTQ+ representation, but it wasn't the only one. Here, notable LGBTQ+ people, including Joe Lycett , Juno Dawson and Alice Oseman , talk about the television that helped them.\n\nA biography of the life of the raconteur Quentin Crisp, starring John Hurt, this 1975 TV film explored Crisp's ambition to live as a flamboyant and unapologetic gay man in England in the 1930s and 1940s. Hurt's performance received acclaim at a time when empathic portrayals on TV were rare. \"I watched it with people who for the first time saw a portrayal of an openly gay man they found sympathetic,\" says the Rev Richard Coles.\n\nJoe Lycett says: \"John Hurt's film depictions of Quentin Crisp are so wonderfully tender towards the iconic queer oddball. Crisp was fascinating to me - openly experimental with gender norms and sexuality at a time when it was incredibly dangerous to be so. Plus, witty, lyrical and very funny.\" The Naked Civil Servant is on Prime Video\n\nThis US drama, which debuted in 2004, was groundbreaking in the way it chronicled the lives of lesbian and bisexual women living in West Hollywood. Previously, lesbian and bisexual women had usually been single characters in shows full of heterosexual characters.\n\n\"I would guess 90% of millennial lesbians consumed The L Word with the same excited hunger that I did,\" says the comedian Suzi Ruffell . \"It was the first time I saw happy, gay, successful women on telly; the first time I saw us represented where our sexuality wasn't a punchline or a plot point for a straight character. It covered parenting, breakups, affairs, friendship, cancer, death, love, careers, divorce, coming out, homophobia and sex - quite a lot of sex, actually.\" The L Word is on Prime Video\n\nWith Sarah Michelle Gellar in the title role, Buffy was subversive and feminist and, frankly, in a league of its own when it landed in 1997. But it was also radical in showing the romantic relationship between Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and Tara (Amber Benson). If only their storyline didn't have such a sad ending.\n\n\"Their friendship turned romance was the first time I had seen a queer female relationship portrayed on television and it really was beautiful,\" says the comedian Rosie Jones . \"Lesbian witches ... what's not to love? But - spoiler! - I am still not over Tara's death.\" Buffy the Vampire Slayer is on Disney+\n\nThe sitcom, which first aired in 1998, helped familiarise mainstream heterosexual audiences with LGBTQ+ culture. \"Only a year after Ellen DeGeneres came out, and almost torpedoed her career, came a sitcom about not one but two gay men, already out and living their lives,\" says Adam Kay , the writer of This Is Going to Hurt.\n\nWhile the show's name implies it was all about Will (Eric McCormack) and Grace (Debra Messing), it was an ensemble effort, with Jack (Sean Hayes) - and his never-ending array of jobs - and the outspoken millionaire Karen (Megan Mullally) also front and centre.\n\n\"Jack was a huge upgrade on so many camp innuendo machines who came before him. He was a gay man who actually had sex,\" says Kay. \"Plus, he was hilarious to be around - and associating something with a good time is an age-old trick to oil the wheels of acceptance.\" Will & Grace is on Now\n\n\"Around the same time that Queer As Folk was on Channel 4, I was watching Goodness Gracious Me on the BBC,\" says the drag queen Asifa Lahore of the 1998 sketch show. Starring Meera Syal, Sanjeev Bhaskar, Kulvinder Ghir and Nina Wadia, it explored British Asian culture, lampooning stereotypes in the process.\n\n\"My favourite sketch was when a British Indian son comes out as gay to his Indian parents and introduces his white British boyfriend, the gag being that his parents are less concerned about him being gay, rather him not bringing home an Indian boyfriend.\n\n\"The south Asian community still references this sketch as a queer pop culture moment,\" says Lahore. \"True diversity and inclusion long before queer culture entered the mainstream.\" Goodness Gracious Me is on BBC iPlayer\n\nThis Bafta-winning 1990 coming-of-age drama, based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Jeanette Winterson, followed Jess (Charlotte Coleman) as she rejected her Pentecostal upbringing after realising she was a lesbian.\n\n\"It aired when I was at university,\" says the BBC newsreader Jane Hill. \"I'd never seen lesbians portrayed on television before. That alone was seismic.\n\n\"Even though, to my great regret, it took me many more years to accept that I was gay, there's no doubt that seeing on screen a young woman explore who she really was, and challenge the expectations she'd been brought up with, made an impression on me.\n\n\"More than 30 years later, gay and bi women are still under-represented on British TV. Why was Lip Service cancelled after just one series? LGBTQ+ representation has come a long way, but for women there is still much to do.\" Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit is on Prime Video\n\nThe smugness, the entitlement and the fact that Hyacinth Bucket (Patricia Routledge) corrected everyone to pronounce her surname Bouquet: 1990's Keeping Up Appearances was a camp delight.\n\n\"The references to her son and his 'friend' Tarquin were not lost on me as I grew up,\" says William Hanson, the co-host of Help I Sexted My Boss . \"Hyacinth's blind, maybe naive, loving acceptance of Sheridan's life was a comfort.\n\n\"But Hyacinth herself, with her dogmatic insistence on a correct way of doing things, connected with me and gave me hope that my own insistence on elevating the everyday to something more exciting could be channelled into something in later life.\" Keeping Up Appearances is on BBC iPlayer\n\nWhile Russell T Davies's 2021 hit was not the first drama to reflect on the HIV/Aids crisis ( The Normal Heart , An Early Frost and Angels in America had gone before it), this five-parter was masterly in the way it homed in on the lives brutally cut short and the people who stayed to help.\n\n\"It's a Sin's impact was extraordinary - bringing to the mainstream stories that have been a part of the HIV community's history for decades and doing so in a way that felt authentic and meaningful and that connected with viewers,\" says Deborah Gold, the chief executive of the National Aids Trust.\n\nWhy did it connect so well? \"Because Russell T Davies wrote them with compassion and love - two things they were denied at the time,\" says Christopher Sweeney, host of the Homo Sapiens podcast. \"I still think about it on a weekly basis.\" It's a Sin is on Channel 4\n\nColin and Guido's kiss in EastEnders . Todd and Nick's kiss (and Todd and Karl's snog) in Coronation Street. Beth and Margaret's kiss in Brookside . And of course, the will-they-won't-they John Paul and Craig storyline in Hollyoaks (which felt like it lasted for years).\n\nSoaps have pioneered nuanced reflections of LGBTQ+ lives, usually way ahead of comedy and dramas - and they continue to do so. Hollyoaks has featured the trans character Sally St Claire (Annie Wallace) for a number of years, while Emmerdale's Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele) had storylines dedicated to her character exploring her asexuality.\n\n\"Soaps are pre-watershed family viewing and they're also about normal, everyday people, so queer love in that space has real impact,\" says Patrick Walters, an executive producer of the TV series Heartstopper . \"It's normalising and exciting.\"\n\n'Allo, my British chums! The deliberately lowbrow late-night Channel 4, fronted by Jean Paul Gaultier and Antoine de Caunes and narrated by Maria McEarlane, launched in 1993. It was a fast-paced, often rude celebration of European oddness. There was an abundance of nudity, innuendo, obscure animal acts and, of course, the sidekicks Pipi and Popo.\n\n\"Campy, sexual and irreverent, it really pushed the limits of what could be shown on TV,\" says the DJ and drag queen Jodie Harsh. \"The cartoon-coloured set, Lolo Ferrari in a pink bikini surrounded by oiled-up guys ... it awakened something inside me.\" Eurotrash is on Prime Video\n\nSign up to What's On\n\nGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every Monday\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nWe are used to it now, but Netflix launching a show that could be watched around the world was a revolutionary concept in the early 2010s. One of the shows that spearheaded this change was Orange Is the New Black, Jenji Kohan's 2013 comedy drama set in a women's prison.\n\n\"It did a really good job of representing a range of queer women,\" says the LBC broadcaster and mental health campaigner Natasha Devon . \"Watching this was also the first time I remember thinking that women really seemed like they were genuinely attracted to one another and the sex didn't seem like it was being performed for a male gaze.\" Orange Is the New Black is on Netflix\n\nBig Brother has been inclusive since its inception - that is very much part of its appeal. Brian Dowling, a gay man, won series two in 2001; Nadia Almada, a transgender woman, won series five in 2004; and last year's final featured only queer men and women.\n\nEurovision has been close to the LGBTQ+ community for decades, with notable winners including Dana International in 1998, Conchita Wurst in 2014 and Duncan Laurence in 2019.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is Drag Race, a drag queen competition fronted by RuPaul that started in 2009 on a small channel in the US called Logo. It has spawned a global franchise, with iterations in Thailand, Chile, Belgium, Sweden, the UK and elsewhere.\n\n\"RuPaul's Drag Race tapped into the renaissance of drag in grassroots queer clubs and put it on a global stage,\" says Alex Needham, the Guardian's arts editor. \"The UK version is an astonishing and very endearing collision of NYC ballroom culture and British camp. There's been no programme in the past five years that has been so consistently hilarious, joyful and unapologetic.\"\n\nSam Levinson's audacious and provocative HBO series, which began in 2019, makes the British teen series Skins look tame in comparison.\n\nThe author and screenwriter Juno Dawson says that the first time she recognised herself on TV was through the character Jules. \"There's a separate conversation to be had about the slightly clammy-palmed nature of how director Sam Levinson chose to shoot her but, in Jules, I finally had a complicated, messy and flawed trans character.\n\n\"Prior well-meaning portrayals tended to depict trans characters as victims or angels. Pose, for example, had an abundance of trans characters ... but they were almost always mystical beings whom cisgender characters could learn from.\n\n\"In her co-written episode, Hunter Schafer was given an opportunity to explore her inner experience of gender in a way I haven't seen elsewhere.\" Euphoria is on Now\n\nChannel 4's answer to Waterloo Road, Ackley Bridge first aired in 2017. The early-evening Yorkshire-set series looked at the merging of two schools - one mostly white and the other predominately Asian - and explored a raft of serious issues from mental health to race and religion.\n\n\"Nas Paracha was the only queer Asian woman character I'd seen on TV at that time,\" says the Labour MP Nadia Whittome . \"It felt so heartening not only to have that kind of representation, but also to see that they were loved and accepted by their family.\" Ackley Bridge is on Channel 4\n\nA coming-of-age comedy drama with engrossing characters and a shocking (and incredibly bloody) cliffhanger? Of course Netflix canned it after one season! Yet this 2020 drama, based on the Charles Forsman graphic novel starring Sydney (Sophia Lillis), is fondly remembered. The one-series wonder grappled with her realisation that she had telekinetic powers while her life was literally burning around her.\n\n\"I Am Not Okay With This is possibly my favourite teen show ever,\" says Alice Oseman, who created Heartstopper. \"Understated, minimalistic and incredibly precise in its themes and characters, this show is a swift knife to the heart. I will for ever mourn its premature cancellation.\n\n\"Does she have uncontrollable superpowers? Or is it all a metaphor for the feelings of anguish, confusion and shame that can surround realising you're queer? Why not both?\" I Am Not Okay With This is on Netflix\n\nAbbi Jacobson and Ilana Wexler's surreal sitcom, from 2014, followed two close friends living in New York City. It was a show that felt made for the internet, and some scenes have lived on as a meme, from Illana exasperatingly running down a hallway to her sarcastically responding \"How am I?\" when asked about her day.\n\n\"They're both casually queer and exploring it in a way that feels really positive, subtle and non-shameful,\" says Jack Rooke, the writer and creator of Big Boys. \"They're also massive stoners, so really we did need a queer stoner crossover comedy - and I'm glad it came from them.\" Broad City is on Paramount+\n\nPatsy (Joanna Lumley) freaking out when the paper published her real age. Edina (Jennifer Saunders) clinging on to youth culture and her sense of superiority (\"You only work in a shop you know, you can drop the attitude\"). Their dysfunctional friendship at the heart of London's fashion scene, which first graced our screens in 1992, was ridiculous but life-affirming.\n\n\"It was way ahead of its time in its gay references that never felt forced,\" says the BBC Radio 2 DJ Scott Mills . \"And they were often off the cuff and matter-of-fact, as they always should have been, but very rarely were in other shows of the same age.\" Absolutely Fabulous is on ITVX Premium\n\nRyan Murphy's pop-culture-obsessed series about a singing club in Ohio was subversive and constantly upbeat. While the legacy of the show is complicated by the deaths of several actors, it is undeniable that Glee was a huge step forward in queer representation in mainstream TV.\n\n\"It was the first time I felt seen on TV, as well as the first time I felt optimistic about living as an out queer person,\" says Jamie Windust, a contributing editor at Gay Times. \"Stories of unrequited love, bullying, coming out - especially from Chris Colfer's character, Kurt. It was the first time I saw what I was going through as a young queer/non-binary child on TV.\" Glee is on Disney+\n\nThe Canadian comedy, created by Eugene and Dan Levy, about a wealthy family who lost everything, became a mainstream hit after it was added to Netflix in 2017. The relationship between David, who was pansexual, and Patrick was particularly praised.\n\n\"I probably identified with him a little too much,\" says the comedian Daniel Foxx . \"This fussy snob in Helmut Lang hoodies, with an expensive taste in soaps, is so at odds with the backwater town he finds himself in. But as you watch, it dawns on you that several episodes have gone by and no one has criticised or even commented on his sexuality. This is simply a world where people don't question it - it's a total non-issue.\n\n\"The people of Schitt's Creek accept him for exactly who he is. And when their relationship takes off, they're not a 'gay couple' - they're just a couple, which this whole rural community is rooting for. It warmed my cold heart.\" Schitt's Creek is on Netflix\n\nBefore All of Us Strangers , there was Looking. Launched in 2014, the HBO series following three gay friends in San Francisco was cancelled after just 18 episodes (and a feature-length special).\n\nBut it has aged like a fine wine . It feels remarkably human and captures beautifully the little things - such as when Patrick (Jonathan Groff) and Richie (Raúl Castillo) catch each other's eyes on the subway for the first time. Or the heartbreaking way Kevin (Russell Tovey) rubs Patrick's ears when he knows he is seeing him for the last time.\n\nAfter years of being \"othered\" because of my sexuality, Looking was the first time I realised that I could - and should - experience the same highs (and lows) of romantic love as everyone else; that there is a world out there and I should explore it. Looking is on Now"

      "text": "The Secret Public: How LGBTQ Resistance Shaped Popular Culture (1955-1979) by Jon Savage review - pop's coming out period\n\nIn this erudite book with broad appeal, the renowned critic moves deftly from insightful analysis of pivotal artists and songs into the wider social history of the years that advanced gay culture\n\nJ on Savage's mammoth new book skilfully navigates, across more than 700 pages, key moments in music and entertainment history and maps their significance for the advancement and acceptance of queer culture. The Secret Public takes its name from that duality of the public and private self and early chapters describe the brutal dangers and difficulties, before the legalisation of homosexuality, encountered by singers and artists in the UK and US who were not able to fully be themselves. Often, he points out, they had public personas and identities at odds with their private selves, operating as some of them were \"in the claustrophobic sexual and gendered atmosphere of America in the early 1950s\" where \"any perceived deviancy was automatically suspect\". The book tells the story of how we have arrived at our modern moment, with LGBTQ+ artists more fully, if not entirely, accepted, while also serving as a prescient warning about not slipping back.\n\nAs you would expect, Savage can really write about music, its poetry and cadences. Early on, he examines the opening refrain of Little Richard 's Tutti Frutti, digging deep into each syllable of that opening \"first eruption\", describing how the final two syllables of \"Awopbopaloobop alopbamboom\" have the \"force of a fist, a blow, an explosion - a caption in a superhero comic\". And by choosing a condensed period of time, just 24 years, he is able to revel in details, both the seismic and the sidelined. He brings new life to Bowie , Dusty Springfield and... Rock Hudson who, when it was thought his \"natural speaking voice was too high-pitched for his macho image\", was forced to scream when he had a cold in order to permanently alter the tone, making it deeper and supposedly \"more seductive\". With Bowie, Savage gives us not just the better-known story of the evolution of the stage persona, but the backstage and managerial minutiae of his rise as well.\n\nThis is a meticulously researched tome, as evidenced by more than 50 pages of notes and references, but Savage's central achievement is to wear all his knowledge lightly, to tell us these stories as easily and engagingly as if we were stood in line with him, waiting to go into a gig. This is a tricky book to pull off, in that it is both academic and has a broad appeal. Savage is knowledgable and has a wide range of reference, bringing his experience of previous books on the Sex Pistols ( England's Dreaming ) and screenplays for film documentaries such as 2007's Joy Division to the page, so that you alway feels he is in command of his subject.\n\nThe Secret Public is constantly in motion, spinning outwards from its glimpses of individual stars and managers into the collective story of entire nations, not just of LGBTQ+ people. Readers who come for the insights into certain schools of music, or particular singers, will also find a book that is brilliant on shifting ideas of postwar masculinity in the UK and US, and the wider cultural consumption of the era (mainly driven by women, \"who were at the forefront of consumerism in the postwar years\", and whose participation in \"massed fandom\" brought \"public attention to the power of teenage girls...\" ).\n\nSavage writes of the shifting tides of history with the pinpoint distillation of the line of a song; he notes that \"the relationship between gay pop and politics\" was \"complex and vexed\", and it's this book's achievement that it gives us that entanglement in intimate snapshots.\n\nA first cousin, though different in style and focused on the decades directly after The Secret Public , is David France's classic How to Survive a Plague and it's impossible to read the final sentence of Savage's book without shuddering. He leaves us with a glimpse of the cover of Sylvester 's 1979 album Living Proof and its fold-out sleeve, describing the singer at the centre, \"pouring champagne into a glass\", as \"the perfect party host\". \"Around him, on the steps up to a nightclub, framed by the marquee roof, are upwards of 35 celebrants: a mixture of ages, genders and races... Packed tight together, they are all smiling with pleasure and anticipation.\"\n\nThe author ends with a plea to \"leave them there\", while they are \"frozen in their fabulousness, with no thought of what is to come\". Less than 10 years later, Sylvester would die of an Aids-related illness. We can only hope this book might herald a sequel in which Savage can turn his rigorous depth and tenderness to what did happen next.\n\nAndrew McMillan is a poet.

      "text": "'It's difficult to survive': China's LGBTQ+ advocates face jail and forced confession\n\nTrans and queer people and their supporters suffer 'systemic persecution' as country pushes increasingly conservative values\n\nAt the end of last summer, Mei* received a message from her friend telling her she was running away from home.\n\nIt was the first time that Mei, 29, a transgender woman living in a southern Chinese city, had heard from her friend Ying* in nine months.\n\nYing's family - who are not supportive of her trans identity - had been keeping Ying, an adult over 18, under house arrest and cut off from the outside world. In August, they finally allowed her to leave to pursue her studies. She was now at school, but wanted to run away to be with her girlfriend in another city.\n\nTogether, they hatched a plan. Mei would take Ying's phone to prevent her family from tracking her location and try to persuade them not to call the police. But after a month of failed mediation, the family notified the authorities, who traced the phone to Mei's apartment. The police came and arrested her for kidnapping.\n\n\"It was my first time being arrested. They took me to the station and questioned me for 10 hours. They tried to make me confess, but I refused to say anything,\" Mei tells the Guardian over an encrypted app. \"Eventually, they let me go because there was no evidence.\"\n\nIn the end, the police found Ying and took her back to her family. The failed rescue attempt is one of more than 10 similar cases Mei knows of where advocates have been arrested and questioned by police since she joined an informal network providing support to the LGBTQ+ community some years ago.\n\nSuch examples are an indication of the state's systemic failure to protect gender minorities, particularly trans and queer people, say advocates. They say they also highlight the challenges of being LGBTQ+ in a country where the ruling party is increasingly pushing for conformity and traditional values.\n\nIn recent years, China's LGBTQ+ community has been swept up in the Chinese Communist party's broader crackdown on civil society and freedom of expression. In May 2023, a well known LGBTQ+ advocacy group in Beijing announced it was closing due to \"unavoidable\" circumstances . Last February, two university students filed a lawsuit against the education ministry after they were punished for distributing rainbow flags on campus.\n\nIn 2021, the founder of another group, LGBT Rights Advocacy China, was detained and released on condition that he close the organisation, which shuttered shortly after. That year, dozens of social media accounts associated with university campus LGBTQ+ movements were also shut without warning. Shanghai Pride, the country's longest-running celebration for sexual minorities, ended in 2020.\n\nIn China, there are no laws explicitly providing protections against discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. While homosexuality was decriminalised in 1997 and removed from the list of psychiatric disorders in 2001, same-sex couples cannot marry or adopt children. Many are still forced into conversion practices and there have been reports of cases of young trans people being sent to boot-camps for \"re-education\".\n\nWithin the LGBTQ+ community, trans and non-conforming people are the most vulnerable. China sets stringent criteria for accessing gender affirming surgery (you must be aged 18 or over, unmarried, have parental consent and a clean criminal record), which is required to legally change your gender.\n\n\"In China , there is systematic persecution,\" says Fangqing*, 23, a gender-fluid advocate who, before going into exile overseas, was pressed by police to admit to selling harmful drugs after attempting to help a victim of domestic violence. They had legally bought and given the person hormone replacement therapy (HRT) medication - not easily accessible in China.\n\n\"It's difficult in the beginning to identify as queer, then to survive as queer. Even when you're an adult, the system is designed in a way that it's not possible for you to escape or for others to help you.\"\n\nWhile China has a law against domestic violence, it fails to adequately protect victims, especially LGBTQ+ people, say advocates, with crimes often dismissed as family affairs. In a survey of 1,640 trans and gender non-conforming people by the Beijing LGBT Center in 2017, all but six said they had experienced domestic violence.\n\nThose who help victims escape violence can be arrested and made to confess to charges such as illegally selling drugs, kidnapping or even \"group licentiousness\", says Fangqing. This last crime is defined as sex involving three or more participants over the age of 16 and carries a prison sentence of up to five years.\n\nSign up to Global Dispatch\n\nGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nIn June 2023, a trans woman who provided shelter to a trans youth fleeing domestic violence was sentenced to two-and-a-half years for group licentiousness, which she denies, advocates say. According to reports, the judgment was based in part on a confession, which she claims she made under duress while being unlawfully detained for 29 days.\n\nWang*, a gay advocate who worked as an LGBTQ+ legal rights campaigner in China for nearly a decade before moving abroad, says such cases are \"not unheard of\", and that being accused of kidnapping has been a longstanding issue for those who have helped gay and lesbian people escape domestic violence.\n\n\"Police may not know how to deal with some domestic violence cases, and only listen to the parents. Especially if the (victim) is not an adult, it's very difficult to step in,\" Wang says. \"In small towns, families may also have influence over the police.\"\n\nWang says there have been examples of advocates successfully seeking help from authorities. In 2017, a man won a lawsuit against a psychiatric hospital after being forcibly admitted for conversion \"therapy\" by his wife and relatives.\n\nDespite the challenges, many advocates are quietly continuing. In December, Mei helped a trans woman who had transitioned just a few months before access gender affirming surgery. It's the third time Mei has taken on this role.\n\n\"She is resting. It'll be maybe another two weeks until we can go home,\" Mei says in a video call from the hospital waiting room. \"I'll be here until then.\"\n\n* All names have been changed"

      "text": "After years of progress on gay rights, how did the US become so anti-LGBTQ+?\n\nA slew of bills are rolling back recently won freedoms. Is America ready to fight for LGBTQ+ rights all over again?\n\nI n 2019, the Atlantic ran an opinion piece titled \"The struggle for gay rights is over\". Written by the rightwing academic James Kirchick, the piece was obviously meant as a provocation, but its argument that \"for those born into a form of adversity, sometimes the hardest thing to do is admitting that they've won\" was at least considered cogent enough at the time to publish.\n\nIt came towards the end of a slew of political victories for the LGBTQ+ cause. At that time, it seemed as though the US supreme court would hand down a landmark ruling immediately before Pride Weekend every couple of years. The demise of the homophobic Defense of Marriage Act in 2013 was followed by the end of the federal ban on marriage equality in 2015. Widespread acceptance of same-sex marriage rights, gay people serving in the military and the need for protections for LGBTQ+ people followed. As recently as 2020, the court, then with two Trump appointees, ruled that the 1964 Civil Rights Act protected gay, lesbian and transgender workers. For all the terrible crises of our century, LGBTQ+ people's rights were solidly enshrined, and attitudes were shifting in line with legislation. In 1985, 89% of parents said they would be sad if they discovered their child was gay or a lesbian. By 2015, it was down to 39% .\n\nYet in the past few months, those victories have come under threat as the US has witnessed a pronounced acceleration of anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and legislation, fueled chiefly by misinformation about what it means to be trans and hysteria over so-called grooming. A rash of laws concerning the teaching of human sexuality in school curricula, banning trans student athletes and stripping parents of the right to help their gender-variant children obtain appropriate care have popped up in numerous red states this year.\n\nAs same-sex marriage is now part of the fabric of America, conservatives have chosen to exploit Americans' unfamiliarity with trans people and piggyback on parental anger over the perceived overreach of Covid-era school closures, conflating it with an insidious sense of \"wokeness\", in the hopes of finding an electorally viable sluiceway for anti-LGBTQ+ hysteria.\n\nThe most famous of these anti-LGBTQ+ laws is the piece of Florida legislation banning instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in schools between kindergarten and third grade, the so-called \"don't say gay\" law.\n\n\"A state hasn't passed a law like this in more than 20 years,\" said Shannon Minter, the legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) and a trans man. \"Like many other people, I thought there was no way they would, because it's so draconian and obviously unconstitutional.\"\n\nLaying groundwork for a potential 2024 presidential campaign, Florida's Trump-like governor, Ron DeSantis, has positioned the state as the last stronghold of liberty in America. The governor and his supporters have labeled as a \"groomer\" anyone who believes children can learn LGBTQ+ people exist , arguing that simply by talking about gay relationships to a child, you are sexualizing that child. DeSantis' press secretary, Christina Pushaw, for example tweeted : \"If you're against the Anti-Grooming bill, you are probably a groomer or at least you don't denounce the grooming of 4-8 year old children.\"\n\nTo be gay, in their view, is to be inherently sexualized, a threat to innocence in a way that straight Americans are not.\n\nSuch vehemence has caught even veteran LGBTQ+ advocates by surprise. \"At first, it was like 2015 again, with the bathroom bills, and I thought, 'There'll be a little pressure from national orgs and it'll stop,' but it didn't,\" says Ada-Rhodes Short, a roboticist and trans rights activist. \"It started escalating and escalating.\"\n\nFor her, the catalyst was when Texas Republicans such as Greg Abbott and Ken Paxton, the governor and attorney general, not only banned gender-affirming medical care for trans youth but reframed their parents as child abusers , Paxton signing a 13-page legal opinion that parents or doctors who helped children transition were abusers who should be investigated by law enforcement. He was followed by Arizona's governor, Doug Ducey, who, after barring minors from gender-affirmation treatment, wouldn't even state for the record that trans people were real.\n\nPoliticians are supported in the media by commentators like Tucker Carlson, who claimed \"no one had heard of this trans thing four years ago\", or Charlie Kirk, channeling 1980s fears in saying \"gays want to corrupt your children\".\n\nNewly rejuvenated, the right wing is poised to make transphobia and homophobia cornerstones of the midterms and 2024 elections, with promises to deliver \"don't say gay\" legislation in states including Michigan and New York.\n\nTony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, a conservative lobbying group, inveighed against the governors of Indiana and Utah for vetoing legislation banning trans women from participating in sports, calling the bills \"timely, mainstream protections\". The Republican US representative Marjorie Taylor Greene vowed to introduce a federal \"don't say gay\" bill if Republicans win the House this November, only to one-up herself days later by tweeting that for people to be pro-trans is to be pro-pedophilia. The dynamic is one of perpetual ratcheting-up.\n\nWhat began in Florida could spread nearly everywhere.\n\nConvinced that \"there's a culture shift happening and we need to be focused on survival\", Rhodes-Short and a dozen others co-founded Tear It Up. Modeled on Act Up, the organization that staged die-ins and other aggressive tactics to draw attention to the lack of funding for HIV/Aids, it is simultaneously confrontational and focused on mutual aid.\n\n\"While we are under a huge attack, we can see what's coming in November and the spring and we need to prepare for the next fight. People are running on insane nonsense, like trans people should face a firing squad,\" says Rhodes-Short, referring to to Robert Foster, a former Mississippi lawmaker and gubernatorial candidate who said that anyone \"advocating to put men pretending to be women in locker rooms and bathrooms with young women should receive the death penalty by firing squad\".\n\nRepublican-dominated state legislatures have even begun bringing back North Carolina-style \"bathroom bills\" mandating that people use the facilities that correspond with the sex they were assigned at birth.\n\n\"That started to supercharge this issue,\" says Alejandra Caraballo, an attorney and instructor at Harvard University's Cyberlaw Clinic. \"That's what DeSantis ran with. It's the new tactic du jour. You saw Tucker Carlson saying that Disney supports the chemical castration and sexual grooming of children - stuff you would have heard two years ago and thought it was off the wall. Now it's going to an audience of 4 million.\"\n\nThe business-friendly wing of the GOP that would quietly team up with Democrats to scuttle rabidly homophobic bills is now outnumbered, and legislators in a dozen or more states that lean even farther to the right than DeSantis are taking note.\n\nMinter, the National Center for Lesbian Rights legal director, believes Florida is the test case for a renewed push for an aggressive, Christian-nationalist program.\n\n\"That's why it's important that Disney has dramatically stepped up,\" Minter says, referring to its initially uneven but increasingly vocal opposition to Florida's new law. \"The GOP is in an internal battle between the moderate, center-right legislators who have historically controlled the party and a very extreme Trumpian right wing that poses a threat not just to the Republican party but to our democracy,\" he says. \"We're seeing that play out in real life. LGBTQ+ people and women and people of color are the primary targets.\"\n\nThe \"don't say gay\" bill, Minter notes, is very similar to what's been passed in Russia, tethering American conservatives to their authoritarian counterparts who have successfully rolled back democratic norms across eastern Europe.\n\n\"There is a worldwide authoritarian resurgence and our country is not immune from that,\" Minter says.\n\n\"I've seen this movie before over the last 30 years: The right wing decided to target the LGBTQ community, whether it's around marriage or adoption or trans kids playing sports or bathrooms,\" says the California state senator Scott Wiener, who is gay. \"One state does something, and then they all start proposing it.\"\n\nWiener introduced legislation to explicitly make California a refuge for families who may no longer feel that they can raise a queer or trans child in states such as Texas.\n\n\"I thought it was really important to push back on the policy level, and to send a clear signal that California and other states really care about these kids,\" he says.\n\nHe believes that \"don't say gay\" is \"patently unconstitutional\" but also contends that relying on the judicial system to protect human rights may no longer be a sound option.\n\n\"Once the court lawlessly allowed that Texas abortion law to stay in place, that sent a powerful signal that we can't rely on the courts,\" Wiener said. \"We have to rely on the political process.\"\n\nBut even that process has limits. Bella Blue, a burlesque dancer in New Orleans who is a pansexual, queer cis woman, homeschools a teenager whose stepfather is a trans man. Her child is \"very aware\" of the full spectrum of human sexuality, she says, but \"he himself has not kind of landed\" on a firm identity.\n\n\"I guarantee you when they're writing these bills, they're not asking how the kids feel,\" she says. \"The only thing you can do is remember they're going to turn out to be whoever they are.\"\n\nThe urge to legislate the diversity of human experience so it conforms with the Christian-nationalist project Minter points to seems certain to intensify. Although the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson didn't change the ideological balance of the supreme court, Republican senators' opposition to her consisted mainly of conjuring up a nonexistent sympathy for child abuse images, tying her to the QAnon-led tropes about satanic child trafficking that seem ever closer to Republican orthodoxy.\n\nIndeed, conservatives' messaging heading into 2024 feels like a hypercharged version of the eternal paranoia that America's very existence is forever on the cusp of annihilation at the hands of liberals, immigrants, and LGBTQ+ people. The far-right One America Network recently called Joe Biden the \"groomer-in-chief\", alleging that Democrats are now the party of perversion, gender \"mutilation\" and an end to human reproduction itself.\n\nThis renewed movement, channeling itself through overheated rhetoric about \"parents' rights\" that first gained traction during discussions of students masking up, now threatens to undo much of the progress America has made on LGBTQ+ rights over the last 15 years."

We're not anti the World Bank, but it can do a lot more to improve the inclusion of its projects.\"\n\nShe said the Ghanian parliament's vote to pass the bill in February despite the threat of losing World Bank funding suggested \"the desire to harm LGBTQ+ people trumps the desire to develop the economy\".\n\nGhana's finance ministry has warned that if the law comes into effect it could lead to the country losing $3.8bn in World Bank financing over the next five to six years.\n\nLosing that funding, the ministry said, could \"derail\" a $3bn bailout programme from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and its efforts to restructure its $20bn debt pile. \"This will in turn trigger a market reaction which will affect the stability of the exchange rate,\" the ministry said in a leaked memo.\n\nThe World Bank last year halted some funding to Uganda due to the country's newly passed anti-LGBTQ legislation , which includes the death penalty or life imprisonment for some same-sex acts, saying \"fundamentally contradicts the World Bank group's values\".\n\n\"We believe our vision to eradicate poverty on a livable planet can only succeed if it includes everyone irrespective of race, gender, or sexuality,\" the bank said . \"This law undermines those efforts.\"\n\nWinnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAids, said evidence showed that punitive laws such as Ghana's were \"a barrier to ending Aids, and ultimately undermine everyone's health\".\n\nShe added: \"Approaches rooted in inclusion of all people have been crucial to Ghana's progress in the HIV response ... if this bill becomes law, it will obstruct access to life-saving services, undercut social protection, and jeopardise Ghana's development success.\"\n\nGenevieve Partington, Amnesty International's Ghana country director, said: \"The bill is one of the most draconian in Africa and seeks to further criminalise lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nGet set for the working day - we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\n\"It also seeks to punish anyone who supports or advocates for LGBT people, including human rights defenders, medical professionals, journalists, teachers, and landlords in violation of the right to freedom of expression and association, with a prison term.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the World Bank said: \"The bill has not yet been signed into law, and we generally do not comment on draft legislation. We have a longstanding and productive relationship with Ghana.\"\n\nAn IMF spokesperson said: \"We have learned from extensive experience that more inclusive development is more successful development. In this case, we recognise that this bill is being challenged in the courts; it is important to let that process play out.\"\n\nDuring a visit to Ghana earlier this year, Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF's managing director, said: \"At this point, what we know is that citizens in Ghana have challenged the constitutionality [of the law]. I will not comment on the details of the bill. Let's see what the court have to say.\"\n\nThe supreme court adjourned its hearing on the proposed law to 17 May."

      "text": "Many LGBTQ+ Americans Are Planning To Leave The Country. What Will Happen If I Stay?\n\nWhen I was four years old, my dad's job transferred him north, so he and my mom moved our family to Canada for six years. While living there, they decided that we should all become Canadian citizens. I don't know what compelled my parents to go through the process of gaining citizenship for all of us in a country we didn't plan to live in very long, but I'm glad they did. Through the years, it's always felt like a safety net for me, especially as anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment here in the United States has increased.\n\nLast summer, as the presidential election loomed, my wife and I talked frequently about what it would look like if we decided to take our two kids and leave the country. We understood, and still do, that we're \"protected\" here in New York, but when you're an LGBTQ+ family, it doesn't matter where you live, or how safe you feel: You must always have a plan.\n\nAfter Nov. 5, my plan was to cry. All the time. But I had to make dinner for my kids and do the laundry. I also had a deadline for an article I was writing, and I needed to get in touch with my sources.\n\nI have a professional acquaintance in the Midwest who, like me, is queer, married, and raising two kids. I had an unusually difficult time getting her on the phone for our early November interview. \"I know this is a challenging time,\" I texted, \"just let me know when you're free.\" When I finally did get to speak with her, she confessed why she'd been so busy. It wasn't simply the exhausting aftermath of an election that devastated much of the queer community; she and her trans husband were moving their family abroad.\n\nI was impressed. I don't know a single person in my queer community who hadn't considered their own exit strategy in the wake of a Trump administration. I also didn't know anyone who was actually going through with it. Gina, who requested to withhold her last name for her family's safety, told me, \"I don't want to live here feeling angry and hurt. It's not good for my mental well-being, feeling betrayed by people everywhere I go.\"\n\nGina and her husband put their house on the market immediately following the election, and it sold right away. Then, they had to face the harsh logistics of moving their family abroad. She told me that the planning was difficult, but that staying would be worse.\n\n\"It's hard just to be in public. I look around and I think, half of the people in this room voted to hurt us, and did that because they are either ignorant, or they hate us,\" she said.\n\nLeaving the place they call home is emotional for Gina and her family, but she wants to keep them safe. \"If we live somewhere where our rights are protected at a federal level, that might feel like a relief,\" she added.\n\nGina introduced me to Jess Drucker, founder of Rainbow Relocation , a nationwide organization founded to \"empower queer folks and their families to move, live, and thrive aboard.\" Drucker told me that previously, she worked with individuals and families who were looking for an adventure abroad. In November, she was inundated with requests for help.\n\n\"The increase is definitely threat-based and fear-based,\" she said.\n\nDrucker is also working more than ever with trans people, she told me. \"That's the group that feels the most under threat and has the most rush on their paperwork for gender markers, gender identity and passports. That's much more complex,\" she said.\n\nI inquired about which countries people were looking into, and Drucker confessed, \"I'm a bit of a dream-killer.\"\n\n\"People are looking at the world as a buffet of country options,\" she told me, but what they actually need to consider is their own value. If you're wealthy, you might consider a European Golden Visa, which offers foreign investors a temporary residence permit if they maintain an investment - usually real estate - within the country. Some nations offer temporary residence to highly skilled migrants, which are foreigners with advanced degrees or specialized professions who will bring their skills to the nation's workforce.\n\n\"If you don't offer professional value, you can still offer something to economically insecure countries,\" Drucker explained. There are volunteer opportunities in countries that are queer and trans friendly, like Nicaragua or Bolivia.\n\nShe was also clear that it is extremely difficult for LGBTQ+ Americans to seek asylum.\n\n\"Going [abroad] and hoping to get asylum status comes at great financial peril should that claim get rejected and you have to move back to the US,\" she said. \"If you are going to move your life - a costly endeavor, of course - you might as well become as informed as possible how to do that with intention, on visas that you can qualify for, in countries that are safe.\"\n\nMike Garda, a New York-based therapist who specializes in LGBTQ+ issues, told me that initially, he had many conversations with his patients about moving. \"I've observed a pretty steep decline in discussions about leaving the country, as folks have had more time to process, receive community care, and at times confront the reality of how difficult it would be to move abroad,\" he said.\n\nOnce the initial shock had worn off, Garda was able to shift conversations to what was within his clients' control. \"I helped many of my clients identify things they felt were possible to complete promptly and preemptively, such as name changes, gender marker designations and renewing passports,\" he said. \"I don't think these conversations are over, and I expect that as we see new legislation roll out, folks will continue to mourn and look for a way to escape the pain of being marginalized and systematically oppressed.\"\n\nEven Garda admitted that he had considered leaving, but ultimately he didn't feel it would be right. \"I think it would be incredibly privileged to move to Europe and continue to work virtually with clients who are unable to exert the same mobility. I think this is a time for queer resistance whether that is through activism, coalition-building [or] simply existing as we are,\" he said.\n\nFor many in the queer community, we will simply have to wait and see what happens. \"I would love to be wrong,\" Gina told me. \"I would love to end up looking foolish for going abroad with our children for a couple of months or years. Wouldn't that be the best-case scenario?\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "14 Microaggressions LGBTQ People Deal With All The Time\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost Life\n\nWhen you're an LGBTQ person living in a heteronormative, cisnormative world, encounters of subtle discrimination, known as microaggressions, are a frustrating yet often unavoidable part of daily life.\n\nMicroaggressions are the everyday \"slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory or negative messages\" to members of a marginalized group, according to Teachers College, Columbia University psychology professor Derald Wing Sue , who has written several books on the subject.\n\nThe term microaggression was first coined in the 1970s by Chester M. Pierce - a Black Harvard psychiatrist - in relation to the more insidious forms of racism that Black people face. In the years since, the concept has been applied to other folks of color, women, people with disabilities, the LGBTQ community and other groups.\n\nIn many cases, the offender is well-meaning and unaware they've said or done something rude or hurtful.\n\n\"LGBTQ people are often pathologized in overt and covert ways,\" Kevin Nadal - a professor of psychology at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and author of \"That's So Gay! Microaggressions and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Community\" - told HuffPost. \"For example, asking a woman if she has a husband or a boyfriend - hence, presuming her heterosexuality - or telling a bisexual that they'd probably be happier if they they chose a heterosexual relationship.\"\n\n\"It hurts whether they meant to do it or not.\"\n\nOn their face, microaggressions may appear harmless or trivial. People, especially those with privilege, might think these seemingly innocuous comments should be easy to ignore. But over time, these kinds of interactions can do considerable damage. Research has found a link between people who experience microaggressions and mental health issues such as depression , anxiety and trauma, as well as physical health issues like high blood pressure .\n\nSebastian Lopez Calvo , a therapist at Kip Therapy in New York City, likened the cumulative effect of microaggressions to a bruise that someone keeps bumping into over and over again.\n\n\"It hurts whether they meant to do it or not,\" he said. \"Over time, that bruise may get bigger from being bumped so much and it won't end up healing. In the same way, what would otherwise be singular slights become overwhelming when compounded with each recurrence.\"\n\nShould you ignore it? Roll your eyes? Confront it now while it's fresh? Or say something later on after you've had time to process what happened? That's really your call and depends on the circumstances. First, take your physical safety into account. If that's not an issue, consider, too, your relationship to the offender, the setting (you might choose to handle a microaggression in the workplace differently than you would at a backyard barbecue with friends) and whether you have the emotional bandwidth to have the conversation.\n\nIf you do want to say something in the moment, one simple strategy is to ask, \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Sometimes when people make microaggressive comments, they may not even be aware that what they said was problematic,\" Nadal said. \"But asking them to clarify gives them an opportunity to hear or reflect on what they just said, perhaps correct themselves or even apologize.\"\n\n\"If we all have been socialized to have certain biases and prejudices, then we are capable of enacting those biases in our words and actions.\"\n\nAnd what about if you're the one who committed the microaggression? First, recognize that it doesn't make you a bad person. Many people with good intentions inadvertently say hurtful or offensive things from time to time. We all have blind spots.\n\n\"If we all have been socialized to have certain biases and prejudices, then we are capable of enacting those biases in our words and actions,\" Nadal said. \"What's most important is that when you are called out, try to manage any defensiveness, which is a human reaction. You may even try to validate what the person is saying and how it affected them, and even to apologize if you hurt them.\"\n\nWe asked LGBTQ folks to share some of the microaggressions they've had to deal with in their everyday lives. Below they share their stories.\n\n\"I'm in a butch-femme relationship with my fiancé. When it comes to doing any activity where we have to interact with heterosexuals, my butch fiancé is often deferred to as the stand-in man, while I am sidelined as the woman. A great example of this is our recent visit to an RV dealership. I was buying an RV in my name and with my money, and my fiancé was there with me, as my decision would affect the both of us. Both the dealer and finance officer directed all financial, mechanical and logistical questions at my fiancé, rather than myself.\n\n\"This is the frustrating 'double bind' many lesbians face: We are unintelligible to a cis heterosexual society so outdated that patriarchal dynamics are forced onto our relationships during everyday, minute interactions. Masculine queer women are often seen as quasi-men without the respect or rights granted to cis men, while femme queer women are treated as lesser than due to their femininity.\" - Sara Youngblood Gregory , writer covering sex, disability and health care for queer and trans folks\n\n\"This microaggression is so deeply rooted that people who do this have no awareness why it's problematic. It hurts to the core that it could even be perceived, even subconsciously, to be a choice. I'm proud to be gay and this is not something I chose. It negates the lived experience and adversity that comes from having had this identity.\" - Patrick Tully , psychotherapist\n\n\"Questions like these harm our community on so many levels. Not only is this a personal question that is an invasion of our privacy but it also suggests that to you, knowing someone's sex is an important part of understanding their gender identity. In fact, that's not true at all.\n\n\"Sex and gender are two separate things: sex is what we are assigned at birth and gender refers to a person's 'deep held sense of their gender.' It's not necessary to know someones sex in order to understand them. By asking, 'What parts do you have?' you are invalidating our experiences of gender expression and identity. I think it's important to ask yourself instead why you feel you need to know this.\" - Az Franco , trans non-binary activist and writer\n\n\"There's no single way to look non-binary, as the term covers a wide range of gender identities and expressions. Rather than, at best, seeking to understand and come with humble curiosity, this imposes one's gendered assumptions on another person's body and urges them to explain deeply personal identities and choices - often in contexts that are completely inappropriate, like a grocery store line or a work meeting.\" - Aida Manduley , trauma-focused therapist and sexuality educator\n\n\"On several occasions, I have had girls get excited finding out that I was gay and immediately proposing that I could go shopping with them or they expected every comment to be followed by, 'yass, queen!' They were disappointed when I wasn't that 'type' of gay man that they saw on television shows and movies over and over again. This hurt because they didn't see me as a person who was fighting on a daily basis to live and love but as an accessory. While on their end they saw me as a 'best friend,' I use the term 'accessory' because it was clear that when it came to voting for gay rights, they were not supportive.\" - Jan-Kristòf Louis-Mansano , school counselor\n\n\"This question makes me feel as though I'm not enough as who I am. It not only implies that as trans people we must have surgeries in order to be valid, whole people, but also that there is 'one universal surgery' that trans people must have in order to be 'successfully' trans in the world. This simply is not the case. Many trans people choose never to have surgeries, many cannot afford to have them. It is an oversimplification and generalization to ask, 'When are you having the surgery,' not to mention that it's factually incorrect.\"- Franco\n\n\"They were disappointed when I wasn't that 'type' of gay man that they saw on television shows and movies over and over again.\"\n\n\"As a sex educator, I've heard this dozens of times: 'How can you give relationship advice to straight people, if you're not straight?' I've even been asked at a job interview, 'Most people you'll be working with are straight, do you think you'll really be able to connect with them?' This lens is reductive, to say the very least. Widen that aperture, people! Assuming that my contributions, or years of work and life experience in my field, should be discounted because I'm queer is frustrating with a capital 'F.'\" - Francisco Ramirez , sex educator, speaker and consultant\n\n\"It's usually strangers I meet or relatives alike! It's like the first question that pops into their head. You can see the mental gymnastics in their head, trying to figure out sex. I just feel bad for them at the end of the day because if thats the first question they just have to ask, they're likely having some pretty boring sex. It's so invasive and personal, and it's rooted in misogyny. People, mostly men, automatically think I owe them an answer or the time to stop and listen to this trash. Those people also tend to think sex isn't sex without penetration or a penis involved.\" - Tevy Khou, illustrator\n\n\"Anytime we prioritize alleviating someone's temporary discomfort or learning edge over respecting someone's identifiers - particularly for people of continuously, structurally marginalized identities - we're doing something harmful! Furthermore, 'they' has been widely used and accepted as referring to both single and plural for years (both in explicitly gender-affirming ways as well as casual situations where gender is unknown, e.g., 'someone left their water bottle here!'). And it's been more formally and loudly recognized by various linguistic authorities such as the Oxford English Dictionary and Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Plus, language evolves - get with it!\" - Manduley\n\n\"In these instances, it becomes apparent that the person speaking sees heterosexuality as the only option for femmes. The queer community is not a monolith and the way we look, dress, exist, experience relationships and take up space in the world is not a one-size-fits-all box. Each of us are unique, valuable, and beautiful and our individuality is everything. Our identities are limitless and not up for anyone to tell us who they think we are.\" - Tamara, teacher behind the @ifpencilscouldtalk Instagram account\n\n\"One friend I used to have, a straight man, used the Kinsey scale as a reason why he thought lesbians and gay men aren't 100% homosexual. To be fair, he said the same of himself, but this was misuse of the Kinsey scale, and harmful to people who face conversion therapy, and everyday I encounter dummies who think lesbians or bisexual women are faking it, or just need to find the right guy. It feeds into rape culture. With more gender expressions and sexual orientations becoming accepted, ideas based on misogyny can co-opt those communities under the guise of 'sexual liberation.' In short, I'm not this guy's friend anymore and I'm a lot happier about it.\" - Khou\n\n\"As a white Latina - and as a femme presenting (read: straight-passing) cis woman - the microaggressions I experience are often more subtle than those of my other queer BIPOC kin. They do happen though, and they can be hurtful.\n\n\"Just recently, a family member sent a 'Happy Easter' message to me, my sisters and my two brothers-in-law - but not including my partner, Richael, with whom I'd been married for months. It was one of many reminders that as my family elders look at the relationships in our family, 'one of these is not like the others.'\" - Adiel Suarez-Murias , human rights communications professional\n\n\"Trans people deserve to have a voice and especially in rooms that are discussing how to best support trans people. An example of this is in a workplace, school or institution wanting to have inclusivity training and discuss how best to support their transgender students, employees or clients. It is very harmful if trans people are not in these rooms to facilitate and guide those conversations, so that they can share what would be the most supportive for them. As much as I appreciate cisgender voices using their privilege to make a difference, they're inadvertently silencing me. As close as you may be to someone who's transgender you can never fully understand what it is like to be transgender.\" - Nicole Talbot , singer, actress and advocate for transgender youth\n\n\"Often when I meet someone new ― and this usually happens with men of all ages ― I'm asked about how I 'knew' I liked girls, if I've been with men to 'make sure,' or what my coming out story is. Straight entitlement to queer people's origin stories, bodies, sexuality, gender identity and privacy is extremely invasive and inappropriate. I do not owe anyone my coming out story or sexual history in order to provide insight, entertainment or a sob story for a straight audience. I think this impulse is part entitlement and part confusion. For most straight people, the only digestible narrative available is that queer folks come out to their parents. What if we stopped authenticating queer lives by our relationship to the closet? What if we met queer folks where they're at?\" - Youngblood Gregory\n\nResponses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "The Anti-LGBTQ Hysteria Is Showing America's True Identity\n\nA couple of months ago, I attended a rousing concert of the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles at a theater in downtown Glendale. Glendale is a close suburb of Los Angeles that's historically lacking in people of color, which made it deeply satisfying to see a chorus as wonderfully diverse as GMCLA.\n\nThere was something else. The concert's celebration of spirited, dance-oriented R&B music as a guiding light of gay culture was musically thrilling, but it was also politically resonant in a way that felt new. Amid the applause and amens, there was almost palpable awareness in the theater that Black and LBGTQ people, because they are being similarly reviled by the right, are aligning not just politically but spiritually. Racism has found its equal.\n\nWhich isn't to say that racism and LBGTQ-phobia are equally made. Racism is the bedrock inequality in America, the institution of slavery providing the stem cells for all other forms of systemic and legalized oppression that came after. By the time slavery was abolished, American tradition was set - the practice of separate-and-unequal picked right up where slavery had left off. The justice movements that emerged fully during the '60s - a hundred years after slavery - gay rights, women's rights, environmental justice - all used the Black civil rights struggle as a template, with good reason. No group had been as deliberately disenfranchised as Black folk had been, and no group had been fighting as intensely against that disenfranchisement for as long.\n\nIt's a truth I feel sworn to protect, because America has always been so willing, often eager, to diminish or outright dismiss core truths about itself, especially the core truth about race. Generally, whenever I hear people trying to equate racism with other kinds of oppression, I interject. It's not that immigrant-bashing or sexism aren't deplorable or don't share traits with racism. But the significance of anti-Blackness as a force in shaping our history and culture is enormous, and it needs to be made clear.\n\nAnd yet, the swiftly escalating campaign against LGBTQ people, notably trans people, feels like racism in that a whole group of people is being openly degraded simply for being who they are. For those who are both Black and LGBTQ, this is hardly a new crisis. But for white LGBTQ people, it must come as an unpleasant shock.\n\nWhile the gay rights movement was inspired by the civil rights movement, it comprised a whole lot of white, otherwise privileged people, who for a long time had little in common with average Black people and their freedom fight. A fight that wasn't just economic or political or even cultural, but spiritual; it was total. Accepting Black folks as equals involved nothing less than looking into the depths of America's soul and fearlessly confronting what was there, and then making a change. That multilayered, frankly demanding process is why attitudes about race are always a reliable Rorschach test of who we really are as a people, and especially of who white people are as a people.\n\nAttitudes about the LBGTQ community are now posing a similar kind of existential test, as the longstanding antipathy toward gay and queer people morphs before our eyes into new laws and restrictions, mainly in but not limited to the South - well over 500 bills this year introduced in statehouses across the country ― that perfectly mirror the energy of Jim Crow.\n\n\"Like Blackness, gayness and 'trans-ness' are now seen by the right, especially the Christian right, as a fundamental threat to the American way of life.\"\n\nThe legal movement has been dizzying, especially in Florida, where governor and presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis has made a battle cry of \"Don't Say Gay\" and engaged in a protracted fight with Disney for its support of its LGBTQ consumers. There are also book bans, the public bathroom panic, the generalized yet very specific MAGA ire toward \"groomers\" and ongoing obsessions with \"saving the children\" from sexual degenerates (i.e., anyone who isn't straight).\n\nLike Blackness, gayness and \"trans-ness\" are now seen by the right, especially the Christian right, as a fundamental threat to the American way of life. That threat is the deepest reason why, for most of our history, the color line has been so fiercely policed, just as the gender line is being fiercely policed now. And like the segregation of the past, the policing is being carried out without apology; to the contrary, it's viewed by the right as virtuous, inevitable. This is what we must do to save ourselves. Holding the line is nothing less than a spiritual endeavor - for the hard right, a freedom fight of the modern age.\n\nBut all this is not spiritual so much as mundanely psychological. Like Black people, trans people as a group disassemble a mythical American identity, a picture of itself that it holds dear - in this case, a straight (and white) couple, preferably churchgoing, with two kids and a house in the suburbs, or in a small town, or maybe a farm in the Midwest. Trans people upend this picture.\n\nGay people have always done that, of course, but they remain familiar as cisgender men and women - put another way, whatever you think about gayness, everybody has gay relatives, friends, acquaintances. Trans people throw that familiarity out of the window. Besides disturbing an American myth, their very existence argues that gender identity, which is supposed to be so anchoring, is just a social construction, nothing more.\n\nIt's the same argument Black people have long made about race. At the same time, they acknowledge that racism is very real, and as long as people have different skin color and phenotypes, racial oppression remains easy to maintain. The fear on the right is that trans people, as long as they appear male or female, can disappear into \"normal\" society. The line will dissolve, and legitimately normal society will be infected, undermined.\n\nThe fear is similar to the ancient fear of \"passing\" - the phenomenon of light-skinned Black people posing as fully white and joining a club they have no right to join. Trans people joining that club - god forbid, integrating, becoming equal ― without wider consent violates a social hierarchy, built on anti-Blackness, that is part of our national origins. Another longstanding, ugly truth that's becoming abundantly clear is that ultimately, the line of separation is not just between Black and white, straight and gay, cisgender and gender nonconforming. It's between \"real Americans\" and everybody else.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

The fire on the fuel may be that many of these stories are also Black ― think the Oscar-winning \"Moonlight,\" the TV series \"Pose,\" even the recent real-life saga of Brittney Griner, the queer basketball star whom many Americans were loath to see as an American (even though she's that most rarefied American, a celebrity) worth saving from legal captivity in Russia.\n\nBlack presence in media has always been outsized relative to the Black population - currently about 12% of the country - which is why Blackness has always loomed very large in white Americans' fears of change. The same is true with gay and trans people; trans folks are an even smaller (but growing) numerical minority in the country that, for the right wing, suddenly seems to be everyone, everywhere at once.\n\nThe point is that for the right wing, Black, and now LGBTQ, people are not simply a demographic, they (and I mean \"they\" in the most woke sense of the word) are an incursion that good Americans need to guard against, now more than ever. Making music together was never, ever the goal."

      "text": "It's Now Undeniable That LGBTQ Rights Are In Danger Of Being Rolled Back\n\nEditor-at-large, HuffPost\n\nI've many times discussed \" victory blindness ,\" brought on by the seduction of big wins for civil rights and which has had many gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people believing they've \"arrived\" ― that LGBTQ rights are secured ― while not seeing the perils ahead.\n\nFrom as far back as 2014, watching the way that anti-LGBTQ forces were organizing for the future, I was worried about how the LGBTQ community would get too caught up in the anticipated win at the Supreme Court on marriage equality that was coming down the pike in 2015.\n\nThe onset of the Trump administration has certainly been a clarion call to snap out of it. And so many queer people have seen the threat and joined the Resistance.\n\nBut some recent exchanges and interactions I've had lead me to believe that many people, queer and straight, still believe that LGBTQ rights are secure and advancing. They point to public opinion polls , to cultural changes and to progress even in the most conservative corners of the country.\n\nOne person, educated in the history of the LGBTQ movement, told me that he couldn't believe that the Supreme Court would undo something that the majority of Americans now supported ― marriage equality ― and implied a lot of the sounding of the alarm was for the conspiracy-minded.\n\nI find this thinking to be naive and enormously dangerous.\n\nIt often doesn't matter what the majority of Americans believe ― over 90 percent support universal background checks on gun purchases, after all, but we can't get the legislation passed. The Supreme Court has handed down ruling after ruling that reversed precedents and defied the majority of Americans' beliefs on voting rights, corporate money in politics, immigration and so many other issues. What is happening in our country right now is clear: a powerful minority is in control and is trying to get the fix in so that it can rule from the minority for a long time to come.\n\nLet's look at the facts:\n\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch wrote a dissenting opinion two weeks ago regarding Arkansas and birth certificates for children of same-sex couples , defining himself as the new hardline leader on the court for religious conservatives and inviting lower courts to view the Obergefell marriage equality decision not as settled law, but as open to interpretation, possibly allowing for religious or other exemptions for those opposed to marriage equality.\n\nDays later the Texas Supreme Court refused to see Obergefell as settled, sending a case back to a trial court. Slate legal writer Mark Joseph Stern, in a piece headlined, \" Marriage Equality Could be in Peril ,\" laid out the case last week for the how marriage equality, with Gorsuch in the lead and Justice Kennedy perhaps retiring at any time and replaced by another anti-LGBTQ conservative, could be overturned.\n\nMississippi last year passed the most far-reaching anti-LGBTQ law we have seen and just a few weeks ago a federal appeals court ruled that the law should be allowed to take effect . The law allows for businesses and government employees to decline service to LGBTQ people, and that includes bakers, florists, county clerks and and other government employees, based on religious beliefs. It allows for discrimination in housing and employment against same-sex couples or any individual within a same-sex couple. Businesses and government, under the law, can regulate where transgender people go to the bathroom. The law allows mental health professionals and doctors, nurses and clinics to turn away LGBTQ individuals. It also allows state-funded adoption agencies to turn away LGBTQ couples. With several of the Supreme Court's conservatives seeming to welcome these exemptions, expect other states to move in the same direction and, again, with Gorsuch on the court and Kennedy perhaps retiring at any time soon, it's frightening to think what the court might decide about such exemptions.\n\nTexas joined Michigan, South Dakota and Mississippi in allowing bans on adoption to same-sex couples by state-funded adoption agencies. In the cases of both Texas and South Dakota, the laws were passed this year and seemed to fly under the radar of all the attention on Donald Trump . But they, too, get at that same issue of allowing exemptions to same sex-marriage, turning same-sex marriage into second-class marriage . Again, look for more states to follow this lead.\n\nOpposition to North Carolina's odious HB2, which banned local anti-discrimination ordinances statewide that protected LGBT people and regulated what rest rooms transgender people use, helped to narrowly defeat GOP governor Pat McCrory in 2016. But the new Democratic governor Roy Cooper, rather than holding out for stopping this kind of law entirely, worked with GOP lawmakers on a \"compromise\" that does nothing of the kind : The new law still bans local LGBT rights ordinances statewide and regulates transgender people until some time in the future ― when it will surely be extended. But it was enough to get important collegiate sports programs and companies to come back to the state after previously boycotting.\n\nThe Trump administration has thrown transgender students overboard, withdrawing guidelines on protecting trans students that were put in place by the Obama administration for schools nationwide. And the Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, sees no problem with giving federal dollars to schools that discriminate against gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender students.\n\nTrump's cabinet and undersecretaries include some of the most ardent foes of LGBT rights, from Housing Secretary Ben Carson and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Tom Price and his director of the Office of Civil Rights at HHS, Roger Severino, an anti-LGBTQ advocate who last year accused the Obama administration of attempting to \"coerce everyone, including children, into pledging allegiance to a radical new gender ideology.\" Already, we're seeing important programs that affect LGBT people in jeopardy. Six members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS resigned in recent weeks, calling Trump a \"president who simply does not care.\"\n\nTrump has essentially made LGBTQ people invisible. There was no presidential Pride proclamation in June, let alone a White House reception. Two surveys by HHS about older Americans and disabled people have removed questions about sexual orientation, refusing to collect vital data. And the Census Bureau dumped plans to finally include information about sexual orientation and gender identity in the 2020 census.\n\nSome Democratic strategists are advising that the party move away from \"identity politics,\" and that means steering clear of LGBTQ rights. Since the election, we've seen this stupid idea promoted over and over again, most recently by former Clinton pollster Mark Penn, co-writing an op-ed in the New York Times, where he worried that voters saw the Democrats as \"mired\" in \"transgender bathroom issues,\" among other things. This is always bad advice for the party, as the base ― which includes every group under the umbrella of \"identity politics\" ― must be energized to vote, not demoralized or angered while the party seeks votes it will never get. And it's terrible advice on LGBTQ rights, which, if followed, leads to \"compromise\" on civil rights― as we saw in North Carolina.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "14 Microaggressions LGBTQ People Deal With All The Time\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost Life\n\nWhen you're an LGBTQ person living in a heteronormative, cisnormative world, encounters of subtle discrimination, known as microaggressions, are a frustrating yet often unavoidable part of daily life.\n\nMicroaggressions are the everyday \"slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory or negative messages\" to members of a marginalized group, according to Teachers College, Columbia University psychology professor Derald Wing Sue , who has written several books on the subject.\n\nThe term microaggression was first coined in the 1970s by Chester M. Pierce - a Black Harvard psychiatrist - in relation to the more insidious forms of racism that Black people face. In the years since, the concept has been applied to other folks of color, women, people with disabilities, the LGBTQ community and other groups.\n\nIn many cases, the offender is well-meaning and unaware they've said or done something rude or hurtful.\n\n\"LGBTQ people are often pathologized in overt and covert ways,\" Kevin Nadal - a professor of psychology at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and author of \"That's So Gay! Microaggressions and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Community\" - told HuffPost. \"For example, asking a woman if she has a husband or a boyfriend - hence, presuming her heterosexuality - or telling a bisexual that they'd probably be happier if they they chose a heterosexual relationship.\"\n\n\"It hurts whether they meant to do it or not.\"\n\nOn their face, microaggressions may appear harmless or trivial. People, especially those with privilege, might think these seemingly innocuous comments should be easy to ignore. But over time, these kinds of interactions can do considerable damage. Research has found a link between people who experience microaggressions and mental health issues such as depression , anxiety and trauma, as well as physical health issues like high blood pressure .\n\nSebastian Lopez Calvo , a therapist at Kip Therapy in New York City, likened the cumulative effect of microaggressions to a bruise that someone keeps bumping into over and over again.\n\n\"It hurts whether they meant to do it or not,\" he said. \"Over time, that bruise may get bigger from being bumped so much and it won't end up healing. In the same way, what would otherwise be singular slights become overwhelming when compounded with each recurrence.\"\n\nShould you ignore it? Roll your eyes? Confront it now while it's fresh? Or say something later on after you've had time to process what happened? That's really your call and depends on the circumstances. First, take your physical safety into account. If that's not an issue, consider, too, your relationship to the offender, the setting (you might choose to handle a microaggression in the workplace differently than you would at a backyard barbecue with friends) and whether you have the emotional bandwidth to have the conversation.\n\nIf you do want to say something in the moment, one simple strategy is to ask, \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Sometimes when people make microaggressive comments, they may not even be aware that what they said was problematic,\" Nadal said. \"But asking them to clarify gives them an opportunity to hear or reflect on what they just said, perhaps correct themselves or even apologize.\"\n\n\"If we all have been socialized to have certain biases and prejudices, then we are capable of enacting those biases in our words and actions.\"\n\nAnd what about if you're the one who committed the microaggression? First, recognize that it doesn't make you a bad person. Many people with good intentions inadvertently say hurtful or offensive things from time to time. We all have blind spots.\n\n\"If we all have been socialized to have certain biases and prejudices, then we are capable of enacting those biases in our words and actions,\" Nadal said. \"What's most important is that when you are called out, try to manage any defensiveness, which is a human reaction. You may even try to validate what the person is saying and how it affected them, and even to apologize if you hurt them.\"\n\nWe asked LGBTQ folks to share some of the microaggressions they've had to deal with in their everyday lives. Below they share their stories.\n\n\"I'm in a butch-femme relationship with my fiancé. When it comes to doing any activity where we have to interact with heterosexuals, my butch fiancé is often deferred to as the stand-in man, while I am sidelined as the woman. A great example of this is our recent visit to an RV dealership. I was buying an RV in my name and with my money, and my fiancé was there with me, as my decision would affect the both of us. Both the dealer and finance officer directed all financial, mechanical and logistical questions at my fiancé, rather than myself.\n\n\"This is the frustrating 'double bind' many lesbians face: We are unintelligible to a cis heterosexual society so outdated that patriarchal dynamics are forced onto our relationships during everyday, minute interactions. Masculine queer women are often seen as quasi-men without the respect or rights granted to cis men, while femme queer women are treated as lesser than due to their femininity.\" - Sara Youngblood Gregory , writer covering sex, disability and health care for queer and trans folks\n\n\"This microaggression is so deeply rooted that people who do this have no awareness why it's problematic. It hurts to the core that it could even be perceived, even subconsciously, to be a choice. I'm proud to be gay and this is not something I chose. It negates the lived experience and adversity that comes from having had this identity.\" - Patrick Tully , psychotherapist\n\n\"Questions like these harm our community on so many levels. Not only is this a personal question that is an invasion of our privacy but it also suggests that to you, knowing someone's sex is an important part of understanding their gender identity. In fact, that's not true at all.\n\n\"Sex and gender are two separate things: sex is what we are assigned at birth and gender refers to a person's 'deep held sense of their gender.' It's not necessary to know someones sex in order to understand them. By asking, 'What parts do you have?' you are invalidating our experiences of gender expression and identity. I think it's important to ask yourself instead why you feel you need to know this.\" - Az Franco , trans non-binary activist and writer\n\n\"There's no single way to look non-binary, as the term covers a wide range of gender identities and expressions. Rather than, at best, seeking to understand and come with humble curiosity, this imposes one's gendered assumptions on another person's body and urges them to explain deeply personal identities and choices - often in contexts that are completely inappropriate, like a grocery store line or a work meeting.\" - Aida Manduley , trauma-focused therapist and sexuality educator\n\n\"On several occasions, I have had girls get excited finding out that I was gay and immediately proposing that I could go shopping with them or they expected every comment to be followed by, 'yass, queen!' They were disappointed when I wasn't that 'type' of gay man that they saw on television shows and movies over and over again. This hurt because they didn't see me as a person who was fighting on a daily basis to live and love but as an accessory. While on their end they saw me as a 'best friend,' I use the term 'accessory' because it was clear that when it came to voting for gay rights, they were not supportive.\" - Jan-Kristòf Louis-Mansano , school counselor\n\n\"This question makes me feel as though I'm not enough as who I am. It not only implies that as trans people we must have surgeries in order to be valid, whole people, but also that there is 'one universal surgery' that trans people must have in order to be 'successfully' trans in the world. This simply is not the case. Many trans people choose never to have surgeries, many cannot afford to have them. It is an oversimplification and generalization to ask, 'When are you having the surgery,' not to mention that it's factually incorrect.\"- Franco\n\n\"They were disappointed when I wasn't that 'type' of gay man that they saw on television shows and movies over and over again.\"\n\n\"As a sex educator, I've heard this dozens of times: 'How can you give relationship advice to straight people, if you're not straight?' I've even been asked at a job interview, 'Most people you'll be working with are straight, do you think you'll really be able to connect with them?' This lens is reductive, to say the very least. Widen that aperture, people! Assuming that my contributions, or years of work and life experience in my field, should be discounted because I'm queer is frustrating with a capital 'F.'\" - Francisco Ramirez , sex educator, speaker and consultant\n\n\"It's usually strangers I meet or relatives alike! It's like the first question that pops into their head. You can see the mental gymnastics in their head, trying to figure out sex. I just feel bad for them at the end of the day because if thats the first question they just have to ask, they're likely having some pretty boring sex. It's so invasive and personal, and it's rooted in misogyny. People, mostly men, automatically think I owe them an answer or the time to stop and listen to this trash. Those people also tend to think sex isn't sex without penetration or a penis involved.\" - Tevy Khou, illustrator\n\n\"Anytime we prioritize alleviating someone's temporary discomfort or learning edge over respecting someone's identifiers - particularly for people of continuously, structurally marginalized identities - we're doing something harmful! Furthermore, 'they' has been widely used and accepted as referring to both single and plural for years (both in explicitly gender-affirming ways as well as casual situations where gender is unknown, e.g., 'someone left their water bottle here!'). And it's been more formally and loudly recognized by various linguistic authorities such as the Oxford English Dictionary and Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Plus, language evolves - get with it!\" - Manduley\n\n\"In these instances, it becomes apparent that the person speaking sees heterosexuality as the only option for femmes. The queer community is not a monolith and the way we look, dress, exist, experience relationships and take up space in the world is not a one-size-fits-all box. Each of us are unique, valuable, and beautiful and our individuality is everything. Our identities are limitless and not up for anyone to tell us who they think we are.\" - Tamara, teacher behind the @ifpencilscouldtalk Instagram account\n\n\"One friend I used to have, a straight man, used the Kinsey scale as a reason why he thought lesbians and gay men aren't 100% homosexual. To be fair, he said the same of himself, but this was misuse of the Kinsey scale, and harmful to people who face conversion therapy, and everyday I encounter dummies who think lesbians or bisexual women are faking it, or just need to find the right guy. It feeds into rape culture. With more gender expressions and sexual orientations becoming accepted, ideas based on misogyny can co-opt those communities under the guise of 'sexual liberation.' In short, I'm not this guy's friend anymore and I'm a lot happier about it.\" - Khou\n\n\"As a white Latina - and as a femme presenting (read: straight-passing) cis woman - the microaggressions I experience are often more subtle than those of my other queer BIPOC kin. They do happen though, and they can be hurtful.\n\n\"Just recently, a family member sent a 'Happy Easter' message to me, my sisters and my two brothers-in-law - but not including my partner, Richael, with whom I'd been married for months. It was one of many reminders that as my family elders look at the relationships in our family, 'one of these is not like the others.'\" - Adiel Suarez-Murias , human rights communications professional\n\n\"Trans people deserve to have a voice and especially in rooms that are discussing how to best support trans people. An example of this is in a workplace, school or institution wanting to have inclusivity training and discuss how best to support their transgender students, employees or clients. It is very harmful if trans people are not in these rooms to facilitate and guide those conversations, so that they can share what would be the most supportive for them. As much as I appreciate cisgender voices using their privilege to make a difference, they're inadvertently silencing me. As close as you may be to someone who's transgender you can never fully understand what it is like to be transgender.\" - Nicole Talbot , singer, actress and advocate for transgender youth\n\n\"Often when I meet someone new ― and this usually happens with men of all ages ― I'm asked about how I 'knew' I liked girls, if I've been with men to 'make sure,' or what my coming out story is. Straight entitlement to queer people's origin stories, bodies, sexuality, gender identity and privacy is extremely invasive and inappropriate. I do not owe anyone my coming out story or sexual history in order to provide insight, entertainment or a sob story for a straight audience. I think this impulse is part entitlement and part confusion. For most straight people, the only digestible narrative available is that queer folks come out to their parents. What if we stopped authenticating queer lives by our relationship to the closet? What if we met queer folks where they're at?\" - Youngblood Gregory\n\nResponses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "I Wish I Had Learned LGBTQ History In School\n\nGuest Writer\n\nGrowing up, I was fortunate to learn about the rich history of men and women who made a difference in the world throughout the centuries. My school made sure to teach us about extraordinary women like Sally Ride, Florence Nightingale and Eleanor Roosevelt. I lived in Prince George's County, a predominantly black area of Maryland, so I was lucky to learn about inspiring figures like Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Sojourner Truth and more in my formative years.\n\nUnfortunately in the 1990s, when I grew up, American society was just starting to get the message that being gay was OK, so none of my teachers acknowledged LGBTQ history. It wasn't until I was 16 years old, working part time at a public library and doing my own research that I found out writers like Langston Hughes, Walt Whitman and James Baldwin were gay. I had learned much about them in my English classes, but I guess my teachers decided to skip that detail.\n\nLGBTQ people have existed throughout history and made tremendous contributions to American culture, yet no one talked about them in school, and there were hardly any books available highlighting the brave queer and trans people who paved the way for the rest of us. If I had known about them, I might not have suffered through years of alienation, confusion and self-hatred. I would have learned to love and embrace my true self sooner.\n\n\"LGBTQ people have existed throughout history and made tremendous contributions to American culture, yet no one talked about them in school.\"\n\nEven the public library where I worked at had a very limited selection of LGBTQ-related books, and what few books it carried about the subject were essentially unclear about how to describe homosexuality: Is it a sin? Is it a choice? Do gay men want to be women? While I'm glad my library had these books at all, they didn't really help me, because I wasn't gay; I was a bisexual nonbinary transgender kid, and we didn't exist in the general LGBTQ discourse at the time.\n\nNothing in the books I was able to get my hands on suggested that sexuality and gender could be fluid and that there was a place for people like me. Sure, some of those early LGBTQ 101 books briefly mentioned the B and the T, but bisexuality was portrayed as only half-gay, and transgender meant only binary trans women and didn't mention trans men at all. As a result, I spent the next 13 years believing I was just a really confused straight man. All I needed to do was find a good conservative Christian woman to marry, and then I'd be fine.\n\nAfter a six-year relationship with one such good conservative Christian woman - three good years and three bad years - I finally decided to research bisexuality on the Internet and realized I was queer enough to come out. I still struggled with validating my identity, though, so I started a Tumblr account and introduced myself to a wonderful community of bisexuals who shared the frustrations I had. Not only did I find bisexual validation through Tumblr, but I also both discovered that nonbinary was a thing and found the LGBTQ historical heroes I desperately needed when I was younger.\n\nFor starters, it was only a few years ago that I learned about a bisexual polyamorous kinky feminist known as Brenda Howard, the \" Mother of Pride ,\" a primary organizer of the Christopher Street Liberation Day March in New York City in 1970 - one of the first LGBTQ pride parades - and she came up with idea of a weeklong celebration around Pride Day, which has evolved into the Pride Month we're currently celebrating. So for gays and lesbians who think bisexuals aren't part of the LGBTQ community, they have a bisexual to thank for Pride.\n\nAnother LGBTQ hero I wish I knew about earlier was Leslie Feinberg , who in an interview expanded the definition of the word \"transgender\" to mean \"people who have crossed the boundaries of sex or gender assumptions that you're assigned at birth, whether that be transsexual women and men or masculine women or feminine men ... It can mean everyone who doesn't fit that ' Ozzie and Harriet ' paradigm of sex and gender.\" Feinberg defied the gender binary, identifying as transgender and a butch lesbian, and used \"ze\"/\"hir\" pronouns as well as the standard \"she\"/\"her\" pronouns. If countless nonbinary kids like me had known about Feinberg, it would have given us the language we desperately needed to define ourselves.\n\nFortunately, things are starting to change. In May the Illinois Senate passed a bill that would require lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender history to be taught in public schools. According to the Columbia Chronicle , Senate Bill 3249 would require school curriculums to include classes that \"would teach historical contributions of LGBT people in the U.S. and Illinois and require textbooks that accurately portray diversity in society.\" The bill now awaits the House's vote.\n\n\"Learning LGBTQ history would help destigmatize queer and trans people for cisgender straight kids.\"\n\nNaturally, the idea of teaching LGBTQ history to children doesn't sit well with right-wing Christians. For example, Ralph Rivera of the conservative group the Illinois Family Institute told the Chicago Tribune , \"Where's the protection for students and parents who have a religious belief?\" To which the Chicago Sun-Times responded in an editorial, \"Acknowledging that a person of historical significance was gay, lesbian, transgender or bisexual makes no value judgment except to say the person existed and made contributions. These are historical facts. Teachers have an obligation to tell history accurately. That's what schools are supposed to do.\"\n\nI don't live in Illinois, so my two cents about the bill don't mean much to the state's legislators. However, I hope the bill passes the House so young LGBTQ kids won't have as difficult of a time learning about their culture and coming out as I did. They would be able to see themselves in the people like Sylvia Rivera, Harvey Milk, Marsha P. Johnson, Feinberg, Howard and countless others who stood up for their rights to exist and define themselves.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Just as learning about Sojourner Truth and Frederick Douglass helped shaped my views on feminism and racial justice as a white person, being taught LGBTQ history could help prepare today's cis straight youths to fight future injustices against queer and trans people. In the end, LGBTQ history lessons benefit everyone, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nAccording to the Public Religion Research Institute, 7 percent of young people surveyed said they identify on the LGBTQ spectrum, and the number of LGBTQ-identified youths is expected to grow. We owe it to these young people to teach them about one of the fastest-growing cultures and all that they have to offer society. While I'm glad I finally found a rich history of LGBTQ heroes who weren't white, cis or gay men and women, I still wish I had discovered them when I was younger and needed to know about them the most. Hopefully, more initiatives like Illinois' Senate Bill 3249 will follow and will allow young queer and trans kids to see themselves represented as important historical figures, and they'll feel pride early on in their lives.\n\nTrav Mamone is a bisexual genderqueer (\"they\"/\"them\") writer based in Maryland who focuses on the intersections of social justice and secular humanism.

      "text": "Why I Study LGBTQ and Disability in Social Work\n\nSocial worker, writer, and educator\n\nDuring this past summer, I was asked to give a talk at Yeshiva University's School of Social Work, for their Common Day, on matters related to LGBTQ issues and social work practice. Instead of delivering a dry speech, I narrated a personal story of my journey to studying LGBTQ and Disability -- two identities that intersect and create multiple oppressions in an individual's life. Here is a snippet of it:\n\nI have been involved with the LGBTQ population since the age of 16. I was tired of feeling like the outsider among my peers and community in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. I decided to find a way to meet other LGBTQ people in the City. A friend of mine, who was also gay, said why don't we contact one of the gay hotlines listed in the Village Voice . So, we found one, and an older gay gentlemen from the hotline said to visit the Gay and Lesbian Center in Greenwich Village. It was a scary endeavor to travel on the train all the way to the city, but worth the opportunity of finally finding people who identified proudly with being gay. When we discovered the location of the Center, my friend and I asked about groups and counselors available to gay youth. We were directed to Youth Enrichment Services, who embraced us immediately, and provided a safe space for us weekly to attend groups with other gay youth. I felt at home, finally. That was 17 years ago.\n\nSince that time, I have made it a point to be an advocate for the LGBTQ population through my work experience and personal activities. I integrate LGBTQ and Disability literature, film and social media, in the classes that I teach. I write about the experiences, issues and concerns that surround both of these populations. And most importantly, I am mainly interested in how LGBTQ and Disability intersect as identities, and how both policy and practice should address institutional oppression.\n\nYou may ask why I chose to focus on disability; it was coincidence that a fellow social work student introduced it to me while I was graduate student in social work at NYU. I realized people who remain on the fringes of our society -- I being one of those people since I am a gay and working-class -- need the support, political power and financial backing of those who can challenge normativity. Normativity has been equated with the values of the dominant culture, which is usually described as wealthy men, who are able-bodied and heterosexual. That is not political. That is a reality!\n\nAs social workers, I believe our role should be to challenge the master narratives through the collection of our clients/students personal stories and to find ways to put those personal stories to use through your work. It could be utilized in the papers you write, discussed at your internships and jobs, brought to your community board, employed in qualitative research, published in books, channeled through art, expressed in social media and spread through spoken word/or other types of communication to family, friends and colleagues.\n\nIn the end, you will be happy that you maintained your integrity and commitment to your professional role. Through your efforts, those people's voices will be heard.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "LGBTQ Advocates Urge The United Nations To Intervene In Texas\n\nFive human rights groups issued a letter to the United Nations on Monday, arguing that Texas legislation has violated the rights of queer and trans people in the state.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, Equality Texas, GLAAD, the Human Rights Campaign and the Human Rights Clinic at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law signed a joint letter urging the United Nations' human rights experts to call on the federal and Texas state governments to protect LGBTQ+ people.\n\nIn the letter, the advocacy groups argue that Texas has violated the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights treaty, which recognizes the rights of all humans to enjoy \"civil and political freedom and freedom from fear.\"\n\nThe ICCPR, which was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1976 and enforced 10 years later, was ratified by the U.S. in 1992. As a result, it became \"the 'supreme law of the land' under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which gives ratified treaties the status of federal law,\" according to the ACLU .\n\n\"Thus, the United States-including its federal and state entities-is obligated to act in accordance with this treaty,\" the letter says.\n\nAs curtailing access to gender-affirming care and trans people's participation in sports has become a political crusade among the Republican Party in the past few years, Texas' GOP government has engaged in some of the country's harshest attacks on LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n\"We are now in crisis mode in Texas,\" Johnathan Gooch, the communications director at Equality Texas, told HuffPost. \"Hopefully this petition to the U.N. will start to remind people about the rights that they have under international law and hopefully we can begin to hold state lawmakers accountable for the harm they're doing to our community.\"\n\nLast year, Texas passed seven anti-LGBTQ+ laws, including banning trans athletes from participating in sports at the college level and barring trans youth from receiving gender-affirming care.\n\nIn 2022, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) instructed the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate families of transgender minors on the grounds that affirming a child's gender identity amounted to \"child abuse.\"\n\nState Attorney General Ken Paxton has similarly initiated investigations into pharmaceutical companies that sell puberty blockers, according to The Texas Tribune . He has also demanded medical records from Texas patients who sought gender-affirming care at a children's hospital in Washington state .\n\nThese laws and investigations have created a culture of fear, the letter says, and have trickled down into all parts of Texas life. An instance of this occurred last year, when a trans boy in Texas was kicked out of his school play after securing a leading male role.\n\nGooch said he has seen families make the heartbreaking decision to split up, with one family member staying and working in Texas and the other moving out of state in order to obtain gender-affirming care for their trans child.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education has made efforts to clarify rules to protect queer and trans students in schools, but Gooch said the Biden administration needs to have a more robust response to keep the rights of LGBTQ+ people safe.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Supreme Court Says LGBTQ Employees Are Protected By Civil Rights Employment Statutes\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects LGBTQ employees from being discriminated against on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThe court on Monday issued opinions on two major decisions with far-reaching implications for the civil rights of transgender and LGBTQ individuals.\n\nIt was a 6-3 ruling, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch joining the four liberal justices in the majority.\n\nWriting for the majority, Gorsuch argued that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity is fundamentally no different than discrimination based on sex.\n\n\"An individual's homosexuality or transgender status is not relevant to employment decisions,\" Gorsuch wrote. \"That's because it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.\"\n\n\"We agree that homosexuality and transgender status are distinct concepts from sex,\" he added later. \"But, as we've seen, discrimination based on homosexuality or transgender status necessarily entails discrimination based on sex; the first cannot happen without the second.\"\n\nThe rulings rest on a pair of arguments the court heard in October in which justices considered whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal law that prohibits workplace discrimination, applies to LGBTQ and transgender workers.\n\n\"Discrimination based on homosexuality or transgender status necessarily entails discrimination based on sex; the first cannot happen without the second.\"\n\nWhile Title VII bars discrimination on the basis of \"race, color, national origin, sex, and religion,\" the original bill didn't define \"sex\" as a term. The Trump administration used that ambiguity to argue that lawmakers' original intent focused solely on protecting women's rights and, therefore, shouldn't be extended to include sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\n\"The issue is not whether Congress can or should prohibit employment discrimination because of sexual orientation,\" Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco, who represented the Trump administration, argued. \"The issue, rather, is whether it did so when it prohibited discrimination because of sex.\"\n\nQuestions posed by members of the court's conservative majority in October suggested they largely agreed and believed the remedy should be legislative, not judicial.\n\n\"If the court takes this up and interprets this 1964 statute to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation,\" Justice Samuel Alito said, \"we will be acting exactly like a legislature.\"\n\nJustice Alito returned to that theme in a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\n\"There is only one word for what the Court has done today: legislation,\" Alito wrote. \"The document that the Court releases is in the form of a judicial opinion interpreting a statute, but that is deceptive.\"\n\nNear the end of arguments in October, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a member of the court's liberal bloc, appeared to argue that Title VII should indeed be used to protect groups that historically have faced discrimination.\n\n\"We can't deny that homosexuals are being fired merely for being who they are and not because of religious reasons, not because they are performing their jobs poorly, not because they can't do whatever is required of a position,\" she said, \"but merely because they're a suspect class to some people.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court reached the decision after considering a trio of cases all filed in 2018.\n\nIn Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda , a Long Island skydiving instructor named Don Zarda was fired after telling a client he was gay. While the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit ruled Zarda's firing was discriminatory, the 11th Circuit ruled the opposite way in a similar case, Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia , in which plaintiff Gerald Bostock said he was fired after joining a gay recreational softball team.\n\n\"There are truly no words to describe just how elated I am,\" Bostock said in a statement Monday. \"When I was fired seven years ago, I was devastated. But this fight became about so much more than me. I am sincerely grateful to the Supreme Court, my attorneys, advocacy organizations like GLAAD, and every person who supported me on this journey.\n\n\"Today, we can go to work without the fear of being fired for who we are and who we love. Yet, there is more work to be done. Discrimination has no place in this world, and I will not rest until we have equal rights for all.\"\n\nAnd in a third lawsuit, R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , a transgender woman named Aimee Stephens was fired from her job of six years after she announced plans to transition.\n\nStephens' lawyers argued her firing was a clear example of discrimination because of her sex, and the 6th Circuit agreed.\n\n\"The unrefuted facts show that the Funeral Home fired Stephens because she refused to abide by her employer's stereotypical conception of her sex,\" the court wrote in a 49-page decision .\n\n\"Discrimination against employees, either because of their failure to conform to sex stereotypes or their transgender and transitioning status, is illegal under Title VII,\" the court said. \"It is analytically impossible to fire an employee based on that employee's status as a transgender person without being motivated, at least in part, by the employee's sex.\"\n\nStephens told Vox last year she hoped her lawsuit would encourage others to \"always strive to be who you are\" regardless of the case's outcome.\n\n\"Deep down you know who you are and don't let anyone else tell you any different,\" she said. \"Hold your head high and keep marching forward. It will get better.\"\n\nStephens died on May 12 at the age of 59, after which her wife, Donna, stepped in as the respondent in the case.\n\n\"My wife Aimee was my soulmate,\" Donna said in a statement Monday. \"We were married for 20 years. For the last seven years of Aimee's life, she rose as a leader who fought against discrimination against transgender people, starting when she was fired for coming out as a woman, despite her recent promotion at the time.\n\n\"I am grateful for this victory to honor the legacy of Aimee, and to ensure people are treated fairly regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\"\n\nMarina Fang contributed to this report.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "The Trump Administration Is Fighting at the Supreme Court to Let Employers Fire Queer and Trans Workers\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThree cases before the Supreme Court threaten to gut sex discrimination laws. Already imperiled transgender and queer workers could be the hardest hit.\n\nDemonstrators rally for LGBTQ rights outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 8, 2019, as the Court holds oral arguments in three cases dealing with workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nThree historic cases concerning the protection of LGBTQ workers went before the Supreme Court for oral arguments on Tuesday. In each, the government is attempting to fundamentally roll back sex discrimination law as it applies to gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer, trans, and nonbinary people - but potentially to all workers who might pose a challenge to traditional gender conformity. Yet, as these cases progress, it should be impossible to think of them apart from the threats of harm already facing trans people in this country.\n\nTransgender individuals currently experience unemployment at a rate three times higher than that of the cisgender population; for trans people of color, the rate is four times higher. According to a 2015 survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality, 30 percent of transgender people reported being fired, denied a promotion, or experiencing mistreatment in the workplace due to their gender identity in the previous 12 months alone. Thirty percent of transgender people reported being homeless at some point in their lives.\n\nThe Supreme Court cases, for which oral arguments began Tuesday morning, all concern whether Title VII, a key provision in the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination in the workplace because of \"sex,\" covers LGBTQ individuals. One case involves 58-year-old Aimee Stephens, who was fired from her job at a suburban Detroit funeral home after coming out as a trans woman to her employer. In another landmark case, justices heard appeals in separate lawsuits filed by gay men who were fired after their sexual orientation became known to their employers.\n\nDuring Tuesday's oral arguments, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch and Chief Justice John Roberts already vocalized the sort of reactionary sentiments that are likely to inform their thinking in these cases, which will likely not be decided until next summer. Gorsuch, while noting that there are strong arguments favoring the LGBT workers, wondered whether the justices should take into account \"the massive social upheaval\" that might follow a ruling in their favor. Meanwhile, Roberts raised concerns about employers with religious objections. The court's makeup in these cases, as in so many others, bodes ill for justice - despite decades-old legal precedents standing in favor of the plaintiffs.\n\nThe Title VII statute does not explicitly name discrimination over gender identity and sexual orientation - a legislative issue unlikely to change under the Republican-controlled Senate. Yet LBGTQ individuals have been able to rely on Title VII protections in the courts for over two decades. \"Going back to 2000, federal appeals courts have ruled that anti-trans discrimination is a form of sex discrimination that violates federal law, providing a remedy for trans workers fired for who they are,\" wrote James Esseks, director of the ACLU Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender & HIV Project, in a statement. \"These cases will affect more people than the Supreme Court's decision about the freedom to marry, and they potentially implicate a broader range of contexts in which LGBTQ people may face harm, if the Court green-lights discrimination.\"\n\nBy any reasonable measure, LGBTQ discrimination is discrimination based on sex. \"It's hard to see how firing someone for being LGBTQ doesn't involve the person's sex. You can't even describe being trans or gay without talking about the individuals' sex,\" wrote Esseks. His colleague, ACLU attorney Chase Strangio, who is on the legal team representing Stephens, echoed this point on Chris Hayes's podcast. \"It's so intuitive,\" he said, to situate trans protections in the legal framework of sex discrimination because \"you can't actually describe a trans-ness without thinking about sex as a category.\"\n\nWhether one understands the categorizations of \"sex\" as entrenched social constructs or conservatively believes they are essential, biologically determined differences, it is undeniable that firing someone because they are trans or queer is a decision made based on the basis of sex and assumptions made about the way individuals belonging to a presumed given sex are expected to live and behave.\n\nThis idea of discrimination based on \"sex stereotypes\" falling under Title VII is hardly new and forms a considerable basis of the plaintiffs' arguments in the Supreme Court this week. In 1989, the court agreed , as a plurality, that Title VII also protected a cisgender woman who had been fired from her job as an accountant at Price Waterhouse because she didn't dress and act as women were expected to. The justices jointly wrote that the point of Title VII law was \"to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women resulting from sex stereotypes.\" The ways these individuals whose sexual orientation does not align with \"sex stereotypes\" - that is, straightness - is immediately obvious. To be trans is to definitionally challenge the ur-\"sex stereotype\" - namely, that we are and must remain the sex that we are assigned at birth.\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

Which is why the tack the government is taking in the current Supreme Court cases seeks to dismantle the precedent against sex stereotyping discrimination altogether. As the ACLU's Strangio explained it, the Justice Department's \"argument in the lower court and what their brief suggest to me is that they're advocating for a world in which employers can fire a woman for being gender-nonconforming as long as they fire a man for being gender-nonconforming as well.\" That is, the government's response to claims of specific discrimination is to make discrimination itself more expansive.\n\nIf the court rules that discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes is legal, anyone who doesn't conform to an employer's view of stereotypical femininity or masculinity could be at risk. But it should not be a condition for caring about LGBTQ workers that cisgender and straight workers could also face discrimination. To understand that the government is fighting for employers to erase and decimate the means of survival for queer, trans, and nonbinary people is enough for us to support the plaintiffs in these cases, and the communities they represent who are already imperiled.\n\nWAIT!

Anyone attempting to have same-sex relations could be sentenced to 10 years in prison. Advocates for the rights of LGBTQ+ people, including human rights campaigners or those funding advocacy organizations, could face up to 20 years' imprisonment for the \" promotion of homosexuality .\"\n\n\"The enactment of Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Act is a tragic violation of universal human rights - one that is not worthy of the Ugandan people,\" President Joe Biden announced last month . \"This shameful Act is the latest development in an alarming trend of human rights abuses and corruption in Uganda.\"\n\nNonetheless, the United States is slated to give Uganda close to $20 million in security assistance this year, according to Donovan Satchell, a spokesperson with the State Department's Bureau of African Affairs.\n\n\"The situation for LGBTQI+ people in Uganda is a matter of life or death. As attacks against the LGBTQI+ community continue to spread around the world, it's clear we have an obligation to stand up against the targeted violence toward the Ugandan LGBTQI+ community,\" Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., told The Intercept. \"The United States cannot continue to support countries that actively persecute and criminalize LGBTQI+ people.\" Balint is currently working on an amendment to next year's defense authorization bill that would restrict or cut off security assistance to Uganda due to the anti-gay law.\n\nOriginal reporting.

James P. McGovern of Massachusetts , the senior Democrat on the House Rules Committee, told The Intercept. \"He believes that the United States government should respond not only by imposing individual sanctions on those responsible for this violation of human rights, but also by suspending military and security assistance until this law is repealed and the rights of innocent LGTBQI+ Ugandans are restored.\"\n\nThe Defense Department has spent more than $280 million on equipment and training for Uganda since 2011, according to the Congressional Research Service. That does not include about $18 million in funds for international military education and training and peacekeeping operations scheduled to be doled out this year. Uganda has also been the largest recipient of U.S. funding for the African Union Mission in Somalia, or AMISOM, which has cost the U.S. roughly $2.5 billion overall. That includes \"train and equip\" funding, of which Uganda has been among the largest recipients on the African continent.\n\nA Ugandan gay man packs his bags to vacate the city in Kampala, Uganda, on May 30, 2023.\n\n\"Uganda's horrific new law targeting LGBTQ people is just the latest reminder of how unchecked funneling of weapons and training to brutal regimes abroad can inadvertently enable crimes against humanity,\" Erik Sperling of Just Foreign Policy, an advocacy group critical of mainstream Washington foreign policy, told The Intercept. \"The law has been widely condemned in the U.S. press, but few have noted the critical role the U.S. has played in bolstering this regime's military capacity. It's too late to rescind the hundreds of millions in weapons and training already provided to Ugandan forces, but any future aid should be suspended indefinitely.\"\n\nU.S. Africa Command provided boilerplate responses that did not address the substance of The Intercept's questions. \"U.S. Africa Command focuses on building African partner nation capabilities primarily through security force assistance programs, exercises, military-to-military and key leader engagements, and operations,\" AFRICOM spokesperson Kelly Cahalan told The Intercept by email.\n\nResearch by The Intercept turned up copious evidence of significant and enduring assistance to the East African nation.\n\nThe United States has employed Ugandan commandos as U.S. proxies - dispatched on U.S.-directed missions, targeting U.S. enemies to achieve U.S. aims - in Somalia under the shadowy 127e authority as part of a counterterrorism program code-named Ultimate Hunter .\n\nU.S. Special Operations forces have also repeatedly traveled to Uganda to train alongside members of the Uganda People's Defense Force, or UPDF, and other security forces as part of the Joint Combined Exchange Training program. As recently as April , U.S. troops conducted a JCET there.\n\nThe United States also has a long-standing base in Entebbe, Uganda . Over many years, it has served as a staging area for \" essential \" airlift and evacuation missions; a sometime home away from home for Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force, Crisis Response , or SPMAGTF-CR; and the headquarters for a Special Operations unit that spearheaded the failed mission to capture or kill warlord Joseph Kony .\n\nIn 2017, according to exclusive documents obtained by The Intercept via the Freedom of Information Act, AFRICOM launched an investigation into \"allegations of rape, sexual assault, and abuse ... allegedly committed by Ugandan military forces\" in the Central African Republic during the hunt for Kony. The results of the inquiry have never been made public.\n\nU.S. training exercises are regularly held in Uganda and Ugandan forces also travel overseas for U.S. schooling and other activities. Since 2007, according to data from the State Department and the Security Assistance Monitor , a program of the nonprofit Center for International Policy, the U.S. has provided more than 62,000 trainings for Uganda's security forces. That includes more than 5,000 in 2020 , the last year for which we have comprehensive figures.\n\nIn 2019 , for example, U.S. Marines and sailors with SPMAGTF-CR advised local forces at the Uganda Rapid Deployment Capability Center in Jinja, Uganda, and Peace Operations Training Center in Singo, Uganda. \"We started training alongside the UPDF members by covering weapons handling and safety rules, land navigation, and reaction of enemy contact, to lead us to the main focus of this iteration which is patrolling tactics,\" explained U.S. Marine Lance Cpl. Matthew Wade, a team leader with SPMAGTF-CR at the time.\n\nIn 2020, U.S. soldiers conducted a training course on leadership skills with Uganda Wildlife Authority rangers. In 2022, Bob Paciesky Ogiki , the chief of staff of the Ugandan military's land forces, traveled to the U.S.-run African Land Forces Colloquium in Grafenwöhr, Germany, where top leaders discussed security challenges and, according to U.S. military press releases, \"ways to 'Train to Fight.'\" Earlier this year, portions of AFRICOM's Justified Accord 23 , a long-running multinational exercise involving more than 20 countries, were held in Uganda.\n\nUganda has been an especially important U.S. partner, according to a 2020 inspector general's report , because it is the only one of five troop-contributing countries to the AMISOM mission to have \"engaged in joint combat operations with [Somali] troops.\" The largest African Union contingent in Somalia force for many years, Uganda has suffered grave losses there. Last month, fighters from the terror group al-Shabab attacked Ugandan troops at a base for the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia. Uganda put its death toll at 54 ; al-Shabab said the coordinated assault killed 137 .\n\nAccording to the 2020 inspector general's report , \"Uganda sent two UH-1 'Huey' helicopters, purchased by the U.S. Government, and two Bell-412 helicopters to ... [Somalia's] Baledogle Military Airfield to provide airlift and reconnaissance capabilities to AMISOM operations.\" That year, the State Department also awarded a $14.7 million grant to Bancroft Global Development, a private military contractor, \"to mentor and train both [Somalia's] Danab Brigade and Ugandan forces.\" In addition to all the military support, the United States also provides significant humanitarian and economic assistance to Uganda, with the total amount approaching $1 billion per year .\n\n\"This draconian new legislation deprives LGBTQ+ Ugandans of their basic human rights. It is shocking and shameful,\" Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., told The Intercept by email. \"I hope that the Ugandan courts will act to protect the basic human rights of all Ugandans, regardless of their sexual identity.\"\n\nAFRICOM did not respond to questions about whether cutting military aid to Uganda would affect its mission or if its reluctance to answer questions about Uganda was linked to its anti-LGBTQ+ law.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Anti-Trans Campaigns Set the Stage for Far-Right Attacks on Pride Festivities\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThreats against pride events and reports of suicide attempts by trans kids are only the first violent consequences of the far right's campaign.\n\nA demonstrator holds photos of trans people killed in 2022 at the annual Pride Parade on June 12, 2022, in Los Angeles.\n\nThis Pride month, the violent consequences of the Republicans' all-out assault on the lives of LGBTQ+ people, and particularly trans people, has been laid frighteningly bare. From government officials to paranoid media commentators to far-right militias, attacks on the rights and freedoms of adults and children are taking place nationwide and striking at all aspects of public life.\n\nThis weekend, as kids danced and adults socialized and enjoyed drag performances and picnics at a Pride event in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, over 30 masked, uniformed white nationalists from around the country crammed in the back of a U-Haul. They brought shields, metal poles, and a smoke grenade - preparations for attacking the Pride in the Park festivities. Thanks to a tipoff from a concerned citizen who noticed the small army of \"Patriot Front\" members, local police intercepted the truck and arrested 31 men for conspiracy to riot.\n\nIn San Lorenzo, California, on Saturday, a group of men believed to be Proud Boys disrupted a drag queen storytelling hour, screaming anti-trans, anti-gay slurs in what is being investigated as a hate crime.\n\nEarlier this month, self-described \"Christian fascists\" attempted to force their way into an LGBTQ+ bar in Dallas, Texas, which was hosting a family-friendly drag queen brunch for Pride. The fascists threatened attendees , chanting that the adults were \"groomers\" - a dangerous, dated trope once again gaining furious traction in right-wing media.\n\nRelated Grassroots or Astroturf? Inside the Republicans' Rebranding as the \"Parents Party\"\n\nMeanwhile, a lawsuit filed in Texas against Gov. Greg Abbott's most vicious anti-trans order to date revealed that a teenage trans boy attempted suicide earlier this year, on the same day the governor ordered that parents of trans kids be investigated as potential child abusers. The 16-year-old was referred to a psychiatric facility, where hospital staff learned that he had been prescribed gender-affirming hormones; they reported the family for potential \"child abuse\" - as required by the very rule over which the boy attempted to take his own life. (It should not need repeating at this point that every major medical association has recognized the medical necessity of gender-affirming care for trans adults and children.)\n\nParticipants in LGBTQ+ liberation struggles have long stressed that the all-out legislative and rhetorical assault on trans people would inevitably lead to violent attacks, suicide, and subhuman treatment. This is not a concern for the future: It is happening now.\n\nIt is no accident that anti-LGBTQ+ laws have taken priority alongside the decimation of reproductive rights and the enforcement of racist national myths in schools. The Christian fascist insurgency informing all these moves, constituted by state and vigilante forces, is unabashed in its authoritarian aim to codify white, patriarchal standing.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nFor more than a year, Republican-led state legislatures have made the eradication of trans children and adults from public life a top priority. They proposed and swiftly passed a mountain of legislation to remove health care, harass trans-affirming families, and physically assault gender-nonconforming children who want to play sports with their peers.\n\nThe goal is eliminationist in scope. As one of the Christian fascist protesters was reportedly overheard telling the Pride brunch attendees in Dallas, \"It's going to be so fun when we take away all of your rights.\"\n\nLGBTQ+ people, their families, and their advocates are fighting back. The Texas lawsuit that revealed the trans teenager's suicide attempt was able to obtain a temporary restraining order from a judge this week. The ruling blocked child protective services from investigating PFLAG families who allow their trans children to receive gender-affirming health care. The mother of the teen boy who attempted suicide is among the plaintiffs.\n\nTemporary legal victories, though, can only be welcomed as short-term reprieves. They are likely to face appeals to higher courts, those bastions of the far right.\n\nMoreover, the staggering speed of the anti-trans legislative push is its own daunting challenge. In recent years, over 100 bills have been introduced across the country targeting trans people, mostly children. Even when the bills fail, state executives and prosecutors have taken action to enforce a violently anti-trans legal status quo, as was the case with Abbott's order in Texas. It's especially important to note that, while the police may have intercepted the Patriot Front attack in Idaho, law enforcement has a more established record of aiding, or at least overlooking, the far right. Indeed, cops have their own rich legacy harassing trans individuals, particularly trans women of color. Neither the police nor the courts will serve as a source of protection for LGBTQ+ communities.\n\nAs a lawyer on the front lines against the anti-trans onslaught in the courts, Chase Strangio of the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in a powerful essay this month, \"Our ability to meaningfully build resistance movements in the coming years demands that we better understand the limits of law as an instrument of justice.\" He added, \"Ultimately, we cannot trust the Supreme Court, or any court, to honor the capaciousness and complexity of our bodies and lives.\"\n\nIt should be enough that trans children's lives are at risk for liberals and leftists, in general, to take up this fight. We should not need a \"First they came for\" narrative to activate widespread resistance, yet it should be clear by now that there are connections to struggles like the fight for reproductive rights. Legislative attacks on trans lives are also methods by state governments to expand the authoritarian ability to remove health care provisions, legitimize vigilante violence, and assert control over who does and does not have access to the public space.\n\nAll too many liberals and even some leftists have dismissed this anti-trans assault as a cynical culture-war distraction or, worse, have legitimated putrid \"debates\" over trans lives. They, too, bear responsibility for far-right, eugenicist violence that has been permitted to take hold.\n\nThere can be zero patience for contrarian media figures who give credence to far-right talking points. Consider the fight over the purported failure on the part of trans-supportive medical professionals, activists, and theorists that they cannot give a simple, one-line definition in answer to the question of \"What is a woman?\" As any first-year philosophy student can tell you, we also can't give a one-line, all-encompassing definition in response to the same question about other basic nouns and concepts - What, after all, is a game? - and yet these terms are widely used completely and correctly. The only meaningful thing the kerfuffle over \"What is a woman?\" gives us is a demonstration of the anti-trans media's intellectual impoverishment.\n\nThe goal, of course, cannot be to reveal the idiocy of reactionary commentators through debate. Too much is at stake. These figures have already made clear that they align themselves with fascists. Nor, as is abundantly clear, can we cling to liberal myths of progress and constitutionally protected rights to ensure the protection of trans individuals, and LGBTQ+ rights more broadly.\n\nThe necessary response to this fearsome moment of white backlash must, as the attorney Strangio argued, focus on \"collective organizing, care and action.\" He, more than most, can speak to the necessity and profound insufficiency of winning battles in court. Resource redistribution, on-the-ground defense of trans-inclusionary public spaces, and an insistence that trans children are not only to be tolerated but also celebrated: This is the shape resistance must take.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have?

      "text": "Supreme Court Upholds Trans People's Workplace Protections - but Trans Lives Remain Under Constant Threat\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe ruling was a necessary victory, but anti-transgender discrimination and violence remain firmly embedded in American life.\n\nJoseph Fons holding a Pride flag, walks back and forth in front of the U.S. Supreme Court building after the court ruled that LGBTQ people can not be disciplined or fired based on their sexual orientation on June 15, 2020, in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"An employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender defies the law,\" wrote Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch in his majority opinion on Monday. \"It is so ordered.\" And with that, during Pride Month, the nation's highest court delivered a surprising but necessary blow to the Trump administration's efforts to erase basic workplace protections afforded to lesbian, bisexual, gay, queer, transgender, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming individuals under law.\n\nIn a six to three vote, the conservative court's ruling affirms that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 - which bars employment discrimination based on race, religion, national origin, and sex - applies to LGBTQ workers. The government, under President Donald Trump and on behalf of the religious right, has waged consistent war against already imperiled trans lives, often with the aid of Supreme Court's conservative justices. Monday's rightful landmark decision was thus far from expected. Its significance cannot be overstated.\n\n\"We won because so many people changed the world by existing,\" wrote American Civil Liberties Union attorney Chase Strangio, on Twitter, soon after learning of the court's decision. Strangio worked on one of the cases covered in the ruling, representing Aimee Stephens, who was fired from her job at a suburban Detroit funeral home after coming out as a trans woman to her employer. Stephens died just last month, at the age of 59, from complications of kidney failure.\n\nThe court's decision applies to two historic cases concerning the protections of LGBTQ workers. In each case, the government was aiming, with a most cynical and twisted application of legal logic, to decimate the standards of sex discrimination law. The fact that even the right-wing Gorsuch ruled against the Trump administration speaks to the infirmity of the government's arguments.\n\nThe first case concerned Stephens's firing; the second related to two suits filed by gay men who were fired after their sexual orientation became known to their employers. In both instances, the issue before the court was statutory, rather than constitutional: a question of interpreting the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Or, more accurately, the cases were about how far the government was willing to go to misconstrue and twist the meaning of Title VII protections, by arguing that discrimination \"because of sex\" does not include discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThe administration's line here flew in the face of decades of case law, which recognized anti-LGBTQ discrimination as a form of sex discrimination. As Strangio said last year, at the time the cases' oral arguments went before the court, it is \"intuitive\" to situate trans protections in the legal framework of sex discrimination because \"you can't actually describe a trans-ness without thinking about sex as a category.\" It is undeniable that firing someone because they are LGBTQ is a decision made on assumptions about the way individuals belonging to a presumed, given sex are expected to live and behave.\n\nThe government's response was to argue for more discrimination. That is, they posited that an employer does not violate Title VII protections so long as they discriminate across the board - for example, firing a gender-nonconforming woman as readily as they would fire a gender-nonconforming man. With regards to homophobic discrimination, the Justice Department stated, \"An employer who discriminates against employees in same-sex relationships thus does not violate Title VII as long as it treats men in same-sex relationships the same as women in same-sex relationships.\"\n\nMonday's ruling makes clear: This crass logic holds no legal weight. If it had gone the other way, advocates were readying for a fight to get specific LGBTQ protections passed on Capitol Hill. But Congress does not need to pass another federal law to affirm protections for LGBTQ workers: They are covered by Title VII as it stands.\n\nThe court's decision, however, does not mean that LGBTQ and, more specifically, trans rights are assured. We have seen this just in the past week, amid other attempts by the administration to roll back trans rights.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling came on the heels of new regulations put forward by the Trump administration that aim to roll back Obama-era health care protections for trans people. Using the same logic that the Supreme Court just obviated, the Department of Health and Human Services said that it would only recognize \"sex discrimination according to the plain meaning of the word 'sex' as male or female and as determined by biology.\" Announced on the anniversary of the 2016 Pulse nightclub massacre, the new rules served as yet another chilling threat to trans lives.\n\nYet, in terms of legality, Strangio said that Monday's Supreme Court decision essentially voids the administration's efforts to discriminate using these sorts of regulations. He noted on Twitter that the new rules are \"based on an interpretation of sex under federal law,\" and that \"the courts decide not Trump. Today the highest court just decided.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThere should be no doubt, however, that anti-trans discrimination and violence remain firmly embedded in American life. Transgender individuals experience unemployment at a rate three times higher than that of the cisgender population; for trans people of color, the rate is four times higher. Trans women of color face no less than an epidemic of deadly brutality. The court's decision to uphold civil rights law Monday - crucial as it is - does not end that.\n\nLast week alone, two black trans women were murdered: Riah Milton in Liberty Township, Ohio, and Dominique \"Rem'mie\" Fells in Philadelphia. They are believed to be the 13th and 14th transgender or gender-nonconforming murder victims in the U.S. this year, although that is certainly an undercount. Federal law enforcement has recorded a spike in hate crimes relating to gender identity in the Trump era.\n\nAs protesters continue to fill the streets of cities and towns with righteous anti-racist, anti-policing marches and rallies, it cannot be forgotten that trans people are seven times more likely to experience physical violence when interacting with the police than non-trans people. According to a 2011 report from the National Center for Transgender Equality, nearly half of all Black transgender people have been incarcerated.\n\nThe state commits and sanctions an obscene degree of violence against trans and gender-nonconforming communities of color. New video released last week, on the anniversary of Layleen Polanco's death on Rikers Island, revealed that the trans woman, who was held in solitary confinement on minor charges because she could not afford $500 bail, was left to die by prison staff. Polanco died of an epileptic seizure; Rikers staffers, who waited over an hour and a half before calling for medical help, were not found to be criminally responsible.\n\nOn Sunday, over 15,000 people filled the expansive plaza and roadway in front of the Brooklyn Museum for New York's Black Trans Lives Matter rally. Participants wore white; the crowd dazzled in the bright afternoon sun. Polanco's smiling face was held high on numerous homemade posters. Her sister, Melanie Brown, spoke to the rally. \"Black trans lives matter,\" she said. \"My sister's life mattered. All of the loved ones we have lost, all of these beautiful girls that we have lost. Their lives matter. We have to protect them.\"\n\nAs Strangio said of Monday's Supreme Court victory, \"We won because Black and Brown trans people fought and died for us to live and fight.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "As Egypt Arrests and Tortures Gay People, It Enlists the Help of Pro-LGBTQ P.R. Firm in Washington\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAPCO, a Washington P.R. powerhouse, works to burnish the Egyptian government's image while ignoring its abuses of LGBTQ citizens.\n\nTo commemorate Gay Pride month this past summer, Howard Pulchin, an executive at the giant public relations and lobbying firm APCO, published a somber essay on the company's website. Pride \"feels awfully different\" this year, he wrote , alluding to a rising tide of anti-gay sentiment. News had broken of anti-gay pogroms in Chechnya. In Washington, President Donald Trump's administration was rolling back protections for transgender students. \"It feels more urgent and a bit less celebratory,\" Pulchin wrote.\n\nAPCO Chief Executive Brad Staples weighed in, too: \"The corporate world is taking a stand,\" he wrote . \"The next generation of young global citizens will ask a simple but difficult question: 'Why did it take so long?'\" To accompany these essays, APCO created a video and hashtag, #WhyPrideMatters, celebrating its queer employees.\n\nLess than a month later, APCO took on a $1.2 million annual contract to work with Egypt's notorious spy services, the General Intelligence Directorate, to promote the Egyptian government's interests in D.C.\n\nThe contract with Egypt was an especially awkward fit for APCO, given the firm's public association with gay rights causes. Egypt has a long record of persecuting its LGBTQ citizens. Going back to the 1970s, Egyptian courts have interpreted anti-sodomy laws to target those deemed sexually subversive. Soon after APCO signed its deal with Cairo, police in Egypt launched an especially brutal crackdown, rounding up dozens of suspected gay people and subjecting some to forced anal probes.\n\nMeanwhile, APCO quickly assembled an intercontinental 12-person team spanning the U.S., Europe, and Israel to work on behalf of the Egyptian government - including some who had appeared in the #WhyPrideMatters campaign, a former Republican operative, and a former Obama administration official. (Pulchin, Staples, and other APCO employees in the #WhyPrideMatters video are not registered on the Egypt account.)\n\nWhile Egyptian police rounded up LGBTQ citizens, APCO got to work. The group ignored the crackdown and instead wrote and distributed flattering pamphlets praising the Egyptian government, reached out to influential American think tanks on Egypt's behalf, tried to persuade American news outlets to write upbeat items about Egypt's trajectory, and circulated positive news articles about Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi - whose public prosecutor, Nabil Sadek, spearheaded the attacks on gay Egyptians.\n\nAn APCO spokesperson insisted that the firm had \"not been asked to, nor have we done any work involving LGBTQ issues\" on the account. \"The APCO global community does not condone, nor would we try to justify, specific policies or actions like those directed at the LGBTQ community,\" Margery Kraus, APCO's chair, told The Intercept in a statement.\n\nEgypt's gay rights activists, meanwhile, fought back best they could - they meticulously documented the abuse and tried to arrange legal defenses for those arrested. Karim, a coordinator with the Alliance of Egyptian Queer Organizations, found APCO's professed commitment to gay rights deeply ironic - and its work on behalf of Egypt profoundly disturbing. Neither Karim, whose name is being withheld, nor the constituent members of the alliance, which sprung up in response to the crackdown, wanted their names used in this article, as Egyptian police are known to target any group that supports gay rights.\n\nKarim had a simple message for groups like APCO: \"You are helping them to abuse us.\"\n\nAPCO took on the Egypt account in July, according to filings the firm made with the federal government. Egypt's primary lobbying and PR firm, Weber Shandwick, had just dropped the account amid scrutiny over its role in obfuscating Egypt's human rights record. Within weeks, APCO took advantage of the opportunity. Cassidy & Associates, a smaller lobbying shop, spun out of Weber Shandwick, stayed on the account as well.\n\nAPCO works for all sorts of clients - from massive corporations like Ikea, Sony, and eBay, to charitable campaigns like Empowering Africa Through Youth Leadership. The firm does work for governments with questionable human rights records as well, including a recent deal with the Turkish government and a controversial contract with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist accused of encouraging religious violence against Muslims. Nonetheless, APCO has branded itself as a righteous firm; just last week, the group boasted on Twitter about having won an award for its work on the #BetterThanThat campaign, a British government-backed effort to marshal opposition to hate crimes.\n\nAlthough Cassidy & Associates has not taken overt public position in favor of gay rights, one of its vice presidents, Jesse Barba - a registered Egypt agent - has. In January 2016, Barba campaigned for Hillary Clinton, traveling to North Carolina to knock on doors ahead of the election. \"I'm in a state with strong voter suppression laws, racially gerrymandered districts, and discriminatory LGBTQ laws,\" he wrote on Facebook. \"My candidate and my party need me.\"\n\nThis year, Cassidy & Associates has worked on behalf of those enforcing discriminatory LGBTQ laws. Cassidy & Associates reached out to U.S. lawmakers nearly 100 times on behalf of Egypt over the past year, making contact with staffers for powerful senators, such as Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Corker, R-Tenn., Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, according to filings with the Department of Justice in accordance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a law that requires the disclosure of lobbying activities on behalf of foreign governments. Egypt paid Cassidy & Associates $50,000 a month for the service.\n\nAPCO handled the media side for Egypt. The group contacted major outlets to push positive stories, including the AP, Foreign Policy, NBC, and CNN. At the height of the gay rights crackdown in October, for example, APCO contacted the Wall Street Journal to emphasize, among other things, Egypt's \"shared values with the United States,\" according to Justice Department filings .\n\nEgypt is a major U.S. strategic ally and the second-largest recipient of U.S. military aid after Israel. Like many foreign governments, the Egyptians hire American public relations and lobbying firms to help ensure aid keeps flowing and burnish their global reputation. But APCO and Cassidy & Associates entered the scene at a particularly tense moment: In August, the Trump administration cut Egypt's military assistance and delayed the delivery of some aid on human rights grounds. Meanwhile, at the United Nations, human rights officials have begun to express serious concern about Egypt's treatment of gay citizens.\n\nMargery Kraus, founder and chief executive officer of APCO Worldwide Inc., in Beverly Hills, Calif. on April 29, 2013.\n\nAPCO denies anything untoward in its Egypt work. Instead, APCO focuses its messaging on threats to Egypt's security and the country's economic potential. \"Enabling Egypt to be better understood in the context of the geo-political and terrorism threats it faces,\" Kraus, the APCO's chair, explained, \"is the first step to providing the security needed to foster change in a very complex environment. We believe our work on behalf of the government and the people of Egypt does just that.\"\n\n\"Our work with Egypt is about promoting the country and its broad potential in an inclusive way,\" Kraus told The Intercept. \"We believe that healthy discussion, dialogue, and inclusion in the global community is a better longer term path to change than isolation.\"\n\nLongtime Egypt watchers see a familiar pattern at work. \"Egypt and its lobbyists go to huge lengths to put forth the narrative that the country deserves special treatment because of its terrorism threat and its alleged irreplaceable regional role,\" said Amy Hawthorne, deputy director of the Project on Middle East Democracy and a former Egypt expert with the State Department. \"But no amount of PR can change the reality inside Egypt, which is that this regime focuses on arresting and abusing gays and lesbians, peaceful dissidents, and others who have nothing to do with terrorism while the real terrorists killing Egyptians grow stronger.\"\n\nThere's solid evidence to back up Hawthorne's analysis. Just three months after APCO took on the Egypt account, the human rights advocacy group Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights produced an exhaustive study demonstrating that, under Sisi, the rate at which gay citizens are being arrested has increased nearly fivefold compared to the years before he took power.\n\nScott Long, an activist who launched Human Rights Watch's first program on LGBT rights in 2004, said that abuse is part of Sisi's own cynical public relations strategy. The police round up homosexuals and then contact friendly journalists to place a positive story in the press. \"The police got a great deal of favorable publicity by leaking the information, at a point when Sisi was trying to revive the presence and popularity of the police,\" Long explained. \"The regime has consistently been exploiting the arrests.\"\n\nOther human rights advocates said APCO has a responsibility to press Egypt on its record of brutality. \"It's despicable that Margery Kraus tries to distract from Sisi's brazen persecution of the country's vulnerable LGBT community by randomly blathering nonsense about 'terrorism' and 'geopolitical context,'\" said Human Rights Watch's Middle East Director Sarah Leah Whitson. \"Rather than trying to persuade her client to show a basic modicum of tolerance and humanity for Egypt's citizens, she's accepting payment to paper over their cruel mistreatment.\"\n\nRainbow flag waving for the first time in #Egypt today at #MashrouLeila 's concert. That was such a brave act. #MusicParkFestival pic.twitter.com/ovCkpP4y1n\n\n- Hitham Alkashif (@HithamAlkashif) September 23, 2017\n\nSince APCO and Cassidy & Associates signed contracts with Egypt, the police have engaged in what can fairly be described as a pogrom. In September, at a Cairo concert for the Lebanese band Mashrou' Leila, a group of Egyptians were photographed waving a rainbow flag. Within hours, Egyptian public prosecutor Nabil Sadek ordered the roundup of a half-dozen concert-goers suspected of participating in the flag-waving.\n\nOver the next month, dozens of Egyptians suspected of being gay were arrested. Many were subjected to forced anal examinations that officials in Cairo said could prove they were gay. Amnesty International has described those \"exams\" as torture .\n\nDuring the crackdown on LGBTQ Egyptians, APCO has been in charge of \"media relations, stakeholder engagement, [and] social media services\" for the Egyptian government in Washington, according to its filings with the Department of Justice. Cassidy & Associates, for its part, provides what the firm calls \"government affairs services.\" APCO's team also helps with \"strategic communications.\"\n\nAs part of that work, APCO firm operates the Twitter account and webpage associated with the brand #EgyptFwd, both clearinghouses for positive news about the Egyptian government. The day Egypt's public prosecutor launched the recent round of arrests, APCO's operatives blasted out a story about Egypt's impressively low inflation rate. In the following days, while its client was rounding up gay people in Cairo, APCO shared a story about the first Egyptian player in the NBA and promoted American actor Forest Whitaker's trip to the pyramids.\n\nAt the same time, APCO was busy putting Egyptian officials in touch with influential D.C. think tanks. The list of think tanks focused on pro-Israel outfits with a neoconservative bent, including the Heritage Foundation, the American Enterprise Institute, and the Center for Security Policy - which has deep ties to the Trump administration and was labeled \"conspiracy oriented\" by the Southern Poverty Law Center. None of the think tanks responded to request for comment about what was discussed. APCO declined to elaborate as well.\n\nAs APCO connected Egyptian officials with America's foreign policy elites, LGBTQ citizens in Cairo were being stalked online. Police used gay dating applications like Grindr to track down suspects. \"They're doing undercover jobs on the apps,\" said Tarek, a 24-year-old gay man in Cairo, who asked that his real name be withheld out of concern for his safety. When the police raid a suspected gay hangout, \"they would search their phones and if they find any app on their phone they would be arrested.\" Officials with the Egyptian public prosecutor's offices would then sometimes order the Forensic Medical Authority to conduct anal exams.\n\nOver the last few years, the U.S. State Department, through its Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, or INL, has helped train Egypt's public prosecutors and FMA officials. The State Department would not produce a list of the nearly 500 prosecutors - or FMA officials - who participated in the program and could not provide assurance that taxpayers hadn't provided support for Egyptian law enforcement officials now involved in the alleged torture. \"We have seen recent reports stating that in the past [Egyptian officials] performed anal exams on individuals accused of homosexual conduct,\" an INL spokesperson acknowledged to The Intercept. \"These reports are deeply troubling.\" (The spokesperson said human rights vetting is not required for \"non-security actors\" but that the bureau takes available information into account when deciding who gets U.S.-funded training.)\n\n\"They hunted people from their homes,\" said Tarek. Recently, he said, a gay friend killed himself out of fear that the police would out him to his family. Some gay Egyptians are fleeing Cairo to lay low in the countryside, he said, and others are afraid to go outside at all. \"People are terrified and panicking.\"\n\nAPCO has long touted its support for gay rights causes in the U.S. In 2014, for example, the firm became a corporate sponsor of Live Out Loud , a New York-based group that \"inspires, nurtures and empowers LGBTQ youth to build a successful future by connecting them to positive role models.\" Now the Egypt contract could exact a cost on APCO's work from gay rights advocacy groups. \"It's a little contradictory,\" said Leo Preziosi, president of Live Out Loud, when asked about APCO's deal with Egypt. APCO no longer sponsors his organization, and if the company were to try to renew ties, Preziosi said he would have to have \"a really serious conversation\" about APCO's Egypt work with his board of directors and legal team.\n\nGay rights advocates who have worked abroad don't hesitating to criticize APCO in harsh terms. \"This is sheer, utter hypocrisy,\" Long, the veteran LGBTQ rights activist, said of APCO's work for Egypt. \"They are working for a regime that tortures trans and gay people, and trying to cleanse its image.\"\n\nAn APCO employee on the Egypt account, who asked to speak anonymously because they were not authorized to speak on the company's behalf, emphasized that the firm had not asked its employees to explicitly address Egypt's human rights record. The firm's work, the employee said, was about strengthening the U.S.-Egypt relationship and drumming up foreign investment. \"There's no whitewashing,\" the employee said. \"I never heard anyone on the account say anything about gay rights.\"\n\nEgypt experts dismissed that tack as evasive. \"One can just choose to ignore the elephant in the room - a massive human rights crackdown - and say, 'We're not going to talk about that,'\" said Michele Dunne, a former State Department official and director of Carnegie's Middle East Program. \"But anyone discussing the situation in Egypt while willfully ignoring or eliminating from the picture the massive political repression and human rights abuse ... they are participating in deliberately creating a distorted picture.\"\n\nEight people sentenced to three years in jail after joining an illegal gay wedding ceremony are behind bars in Cairo on Nov. 1, 2014. The men were found guilty of spreading \"indecent images\" and \"inciting debauchery\" over a video that appeared to show them celebrating a gay marriage in Cairo.\n\nAs APCO and Cassidy & Associates remain narrowly focused on improving the U.S.-Egypt relationship, the Egyptian government is taking a multi-lateral approach to its crackdown on LGBTQ people. Not content with persecuting gay people at home, Egypt has recently tried to expand its reach outside its borders, said Jeremy Kadden, a senior international policy advocate at Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group.\n\nThis year, for example, Egypt has been trying to rally other African nations to undermine the mandate of the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity investigators at the United Nations. \"At the U.N., they try to marginalize LGBTQ people. It's a major focus of their work there in an almost bizarre fashion,\" Kadden said. \"They oppose resolutions on random topics, that happen to mention sexual orientation.\" In October, Egyptian diplomats joined with Russia in a failed effort to strip pro-LGBTQ rights language from a U.N. resolution concerning the Olympic games.\n\nAPCO, meanwhile, was busy drumming up positive coverage of Egypt's diplomacy. Sisi had recently spoken at the U.N. General Assembly and APCO created a pamphlet to promote the speech titled: \"Sisi at UNGA - Fighting Terrorism and Keeping The Peace.\" The document included a link to a cloying Fox News interview with the Egyptian leader. In it, news personality Sean Hannity repeatedly called Sisi \"courageous,\" both men praised Trump, and Hannity studiously steered clear of any human rights questions.\n\nAPCO didn't limit itself to promoting Egyptians' appearances on American television. Its Egypt team was also reaching out to sympathetic experts at D.C. think tanks in order to book them on Egyptian television shows aligned with Sisi's government. APCO arranged for Jonathan Schanzer, a vice president at the neoconservative Foundation for Defense of Democracies, to be interviewed by Egyptian TV host Amr Adeeb. At the time, Adeeb had temporarily relocated his show to New York to promote Sisi's U.N. visit. The TV personality has also echoed the government's rhetoric during the anti-LGBTQ crackdown, calling queer people \"extremists\" and comparing them to rapists. The network that carries his show, OnTV, has been accused of firing journalists who don't toe the government line.\n\nA gay Egyptian lights his cigarette in Cairo in 2014. Egypt's gay population was forced deeper underground following the arrest of dozens of men at a Cairo bathhouse in a raid that was then featured on a lurid TV tabloid program stirring up public panic over \"debauchery.\"\n\nBuilding a firewall between APCO's work and Egypt's human rights abuses is easier said than done, since the anti-LGBTQ crackdown involves multiple branches of the Egyptian government.\n\nIn October, Egypt's Free Egyptians Party, which is the largest in Parliament and closely aligned with Sisi, introduced a law that would further criminalize homosexuality, as well as make it a crime to \"encourage\" homosexual activity or sell rainbow flags and other items associated with gay rights. Sixty-seven parliamentarians immediately endorsed the bill, causing human rights groups to sound the alarm. Shortly after the law was introduced, a delegation of Egyptian lawmakers - including Tarek Radwan, head of the foreign relations committee and a leading member of the Free Egyptians Party - traveled to Washington to hold meetings with American officials.\n\nThe delegation included the speaker of the Egyptian Parliament, Ali Abdel Aal, who was scheduled to meet with his counterparts, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Gay rights groups in Washington lobbied sympathetic lawmakers to raise the gay rights issue in the meeting and press Abdel Aal, who hadn't taken a position on the new law, to come out against it. A Democratic aide with knowledge of the sit-down, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the details of the private meeting, said Pelosi directly raised the persecution of gay people in the meeting. She asked him to do what he could to reign the attacks in, the aide said, and handed him a letter directly criticizing Egypt's LGBTQ crackdown.\n\nAbdel Aal, the aide said, told Pelosi that Egypt's police were only going after aggressive public displays of homosexual behavior. Pelosi pushed back by citing news reports about police using gay dating apps to target gay people - contradicting what the Egyptian parliamentarian had just told her. The foreign delegation responded to Pelosi by claiming Egypt is a \"fledgling democracy,\" the aide recalled, \"that they need time to make adjustments.\"\n\nAPCO washed its hands of the whole affair. A spokesperson told The Intercept that it had no involvement in setting up the meeting or in briefing Abdel Aal beforehand. Cassidy & Associates did not respond to request for comment.\n\nIt wouldn't be out of the ordinary for APCO or Cassidy to take an active role in such a meeting. When a parliamentary delegation visited earlier in the year, the last Washington firm to hold the primary account to lobby for Egypt, Weber Shandwick, briefed the Egyptian delegation before meetings with U.S. lawmakers. And APCO staff, for their part, have longstanding relationships on Capitol Hill. APCO Senior Director Dan Scandling, a registered Egypt agent, is currently \"advising\" and \"representing\" the Egyptian government, according to his registration form. Before joining APCO, he spent 25 years working as a Republican staffer in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe day after the Abdel Aal sparred with Pelosi about the treatment of LGBTQ Egyptians, APCO's operatives tweeted out an account of that sit-down from the Egyptian state-run newspaper Al-Ahram. The article doesn't mention LGBTQ rights at all.\n\nAfter the meeting in Washington, APCO's social media accounts moved on to new topics their clients wanted to highlight. The Twitter accounts promoted a meeting in Cairo between Sisi and American evangelical Christian leaders - including Tony Perkins, head of the Family Research Council, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has called an \"anti-LGBTQ\" organization. The accounts also publicized Egypt's Youth Forum, a public relations stunt that brought Westerners, including actor Helen Hunt, to Egypt for a pro-government conference promoting Sisi's economic vision. One U.K.-based blogger, Jazza John, told The Intercept his invitation to the conference was abruptly rescinded, and he suspects he was uninvited because he is gay.\n\nBy the end of November, Egypt had spent the better part of a month issuing formal prison sentences to a number of arrested gay men. On November 27, one Cairo court sentenced 17 people to three years behind bars for \"inciting debauchery\" and \"abnormal sexual relations.\"\n\nAs Egypt's courts followed through on the crackdown, APCO's involvement with the Egyptian government continued to grow. The day after the verdict, according to Justice Department filings, the firm added two new members to its Egypt team.\n\nCorrection: Dec. 19, 2017 This story initially included a photograph of 700 12th St. N.W. in Washington, D.C., that, due to an editing error, identified the building as APCO Worldwide's headquarters. Since the photograph was taken, APCO moved its headquarters to 1299 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W. in Washington, D.C.\n\nTop photo: Eight people sentenced to three years in jail after joining an illegal gay wedding ceremony are behind bars in Cairo, Egypt, on Nov. 1, 2014.

      "text": "Republicans Sneak Anti-Trans Health Care Provision Into Defense Bill\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe proposal would codify explicitly anti-LGBTQ+ policy into federal law for the first time in decades.\n\nIn a party-line vote on Tuesday, the House advanced a provision targeting health care for transgender youth on military health insurance in the annual defense spending bill. The proposal, which was tacked onto the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, at the eleventh hour, would codify explicitly anti-LGBTQ+ policy into federal law for the first time in decades.\n\nThe controversial language, which was pushed by Republican leadership and adopted into a bipartisan compromise bill , would prohibit \"medical interventions for the treatment of gender dysphoria that could result in sterilization,\" effectively prohibiting access to gender-affirming care for minors with active-duty family members in the military.\n\nA procedural vote on Tuesday afternoon centered on whether the NDAA would come to the House floor for a vote with the provision in place or whether lawmakers would be forced to renegotiate and potentially remove the anti-transgender language from the bill. Although Democrats uniformly voted against the measure, the GOP uniformly supported it. It passed 211-207, with four Democrats and nine Republicans not voting.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., left no ambiguity about the legislation's intent, saying it would work by \"permanently banning transgender medical treatment for minors\" on military insurance.\n\nCivil liberties groups predicted that the Tuesday vote would be tight and urged House Democrats to vote \"no\" on moving the current version of the bill forward. Advocates are raising the alarm about the bill's potential deadly consequences for trans youth on military insurance and warning that its passage would represent a serious rollback in rights for LGBTQ+ people in the United States.\n\n\"Not only would this be devastating for the lives, health and well being of these children and military families, this would be the first time in almost three decades that we have seen the adoption of explicit anti-LGBTQ policy in federal statute,\" said Ian Thompson, senior legislative advocate at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThompson noted that the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited same-sex marriages and was signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996, was the most recent example of explicitly anti-LGBTQ+ policies being codified into federal law. \"So that is incredibly significant,\" he said. \"And we have been really trying to elevate that point with key allies on Capitol Hill and in the administration, to really just kind of hammer home the gravity of this attack on human rights and the freedom of transgender people.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWhile it's unclear how many transgender youth get their health care through the military's insurer, TRICARE, a 2022 analysis published in the American Journal of Public Health found that roughly 2,500 minors sought care for experiencing gender dysphoria that year through the insurance program.\n\nRep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., chastised her Republican colleagues for \"targeting trans people\" instead of doing the work of legislating. \"It is not only an unprecedented discriminatory rider, but it will cause real, irreversible harm,\" said Ramirez in a statement to The Intercept. \"Young trans people deserve the care they need to flourish. And we all deserve to have the opportunity to debate and shape significant pieces of legislation that impact our communities.\"\n\nRanking Member of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., called on Republicans to remove the anti-trans provision on Sunday. \"Blanketly denying health care to people who clearly need it, just because of a biased notion against transgender people, is wrong,\" said Smith in a statement . \"Speaker Johnson is pandering to the most extreme elements of his party to ensure that he retains his speakership. In doing so, he has upended what had been a bipartisan process.\"\n\nIn a written statement after the vote, Smith said he would vote against the final version of the bill when it makes it to the floor. \"The inclusion of this harmful provision puts the lives of children at risk and may force thousands of service members to make the choice of continuing,\" he wrote in a statement provided to The Intercept.\n\nGroups opposed to the provision are hoping that the Biden administration will weigh in to support trans youth. The Human Rights Campaign pointed out over the weekend that President Joe Biden \"has promised repeatedly to veto any legislation that would enshrine discrimination against transgender people into law.\"\n\nThompson of the ACLU noted that while the White House generally releases a statement of administrative policy on important legislation like the NDAA, which is considered a \"must pass\" bill, it has not yet done so. The White House previously was under fire from trans rights groups after stating that it opposed gender-affirming surgeries for transgender youth. The administration later changed its position, saying it opposed limits on health care for transgender individuals.\n\nAhead of the vote, Thompson said that even if the rule passes, the fight will not be over.\"Our hope is that the rule will fail and they will only be able to move forward a version of this legislation that does not include this health care ban as a part of it,\" he said. \"But should the rule be adopted and they actually have to take a vote on the underlying bill itself - it is, once again, our hope that pro-equality members of Congress will oppose the defense bill because of the inclusion of this health care ban.\"\n\nUpdate: December 10, 2024, 4:09 p.m. ET This article was updated to include the results of the vote and a statement from Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash.\n\nWAIT!

A would-be showdown that never was at a Roanoke, Texas, restaurant's family-friendly drag brunch. An armed far-right group, including Proud Boys and self-identifying \"Christian fascists,\" turned up to harass brunch-goers - a sadly commonplace form of fascistic intimidation that's hardly news.\n\nInstead, what concerned the Times about this event was that the armed fascists were met and obstructed by armed antifascists, who had been asked by members of the local community to provide security for the brunch.\n\nIn the end, no one was hurt in this alleged portent of political violence and the restaurant owner's son, a performer at the drag brunch, thanked the antifascists of the Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club for \"keeping us safe.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nJust a week had passed since the Club Q massacre, which left five attendees of an LGBTQ club dead, when the Times decided to draw an equivalence between the fascists who threaten LGBTQ-friendly spaces with guns and the antifascists with guns who volunteer to defend those spaces - a new low in bothsidesism.\n\nFor as long as marginalized and minority communities have been threatened and imperiled by armed white supremacists and fascists - a violence foundational to this country - they have been condemned for taking up arms in self-defense.\n\nIt is a profound mischaracterization of the history and principles of armed community defense to suggest that armed antifascists and anti-racists are engaged in escalatory political violence that is worthy of the same condemnation as the fascists they confront.\n\nOppressed groups and their allies have time and again seen guns as necessary defensive tools. This has been true at key points in the history of Black struggle in the U.S. - formerly enslaved marronage communities, Black civilians in the late 19th century who blocked jails to stop lynchings, and the Black Panthers, who were originally named the Black Panther Party for Self Defense - but also among the queer militants of Bash Back! in the late 2000s. Yet the decision to take up arms in community defense has consistently been decried as escalatory and extremist. Mourners visit a makeshift memorial outside of Club Q on Nov. 23, 2022, in Colorado Springs, Co. Photo: Chet Strange/Getty Images\n\nMourners visit a makeshift memorial outside of Club Q on Nov. 23, 2022, in Colorado Springs, Co.\n\nDebates about violent and nonviolent protest, and what constitutes violence at all, are well worn . It's important to note, though, that the presumption that armed community defense serves to escalate violence is simply not borne out in U.S. history.\n\nThe late political scientist Cedric Robinson highlighted in his epic \" Black Marxism \" that even in slave rebellions and marronage communities, there was no doubt a reliance on armed physical violence to ensure escape and sustain freedom, but there was a remarkably small number of retributive killings of white enslavers.\n\nIn the past century, too, white supremacist, far-right deadly violence in this country has so dwarfed the number deaths caused by Black, Indigenous, and queer armed struggle that talk of mutual escalation is obscene. In the last 30 years alone, over 85 percent of extremist killings are attributable to far-right actors. A separate New York Times report last weekend found that at 700 armed demonstrations since January 2020, 77 percent of those openly carrying guns were right-wing.\n\nThese numbers aren't incidental but reflect something inherent about how white supremacist, anti-LGBTQ ideology operates: The goals are eliminationist. This is what makes the \"bothsidesing\" so horrifically off base: The far right has made clear their commitment to eradicate trans people, either through violent law or extralegal violence.\n\nIt is amid this larger picture that the Times wondered about a \"chilling future.\" With queer communities quite aware that police are more likely to harass them than help them, would it truly be less chilling to imagine a future in which armed right-wingers are met with no serious opposition?\n\nGroups like Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club - which is one chapter among many antifascist John Brown Gun Clubs - will not end the anti-trans, white supremacist violence of the far right. By showing up, though, they can at least give pause to the would-be assailants of these embattled communities.\n\nTo say that armed community defense is necessary and justified is not to say that there are not difficult questions around the issue.\n\nIt's an understandable impulse to fear that the more guns on a scene, the more likely one is to be used, resulting in deadly violence. It's a tragedy at the heart of all too many domestic violence murders , that women who keep guns in the house to defend themselves against abusive partners are killed with those very weapons.\n\nThen there is the notion that teachers should be armed to defend against school shootings, which is belied by the facts: The more guns brought into schools, by teachers or cops, the more dangerous gun-related accidents there have been.\n\nThe proliferation of guns in the U.S. is intolerable, exceptional in its deadly consequences, and has always been organized around white supremacy - from various historical moves to bar Indigenous or Black people from owning guns, to the first federal \"gun control\" law in 1968, which was part of a massive crime bill that endowed police forces with military-grade weapons.\n\nThere's every reason to be wary of the misuse of \"self-defense\" as a pretext for violent action - it has, after all, been the legally accepted justification for centuries of racist killings. Yet it is not the armed antifascists who are initiating the potential for gun violence in these instances; they go where the armed fascists go. And the fascists with guns, political support, and consistent police allegiance are turning up at restaurants, libraries, night clubs, school board meetings, and polling stations because they want to expunge whole marginalized communities from public life - by threatening them with a gun's barrel, if not killing them with a spray of bullets.\n\nSo-called moderates can rely on tired tropes about violence begetting more violence. But such a stance, usually held from a comfortable distance, refuses to see that the fascist violence targeted at LGBTQ existence - and the lives of Black people - seeks to be annihilating and total. Thankfully, there are braver antifascist forces willing to stand in the way.\n\nWAIT!

Media attention focused on a measure that would ban trans people from carrying accurate driver's licenses by requiring state IDs to list only the gender assigned to a person at birth. The proposal has been dubbed the \"trans erasure bill.\"\n\nThat same piece of legislation, House Bill 1639 , would also mandate a series of pernicious measures relating to private health insurance coverage. These aspects of the proposed law have garnered fewer headlines, but the impact could be far-reaching: They risk raising the cost of health insurance for everyone in the state.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nCisgender people are not the key concern here. The anti-trans legislation is most vile, of course, for its explicit intent to render public life and necessary health care ever more inaccessible for trans people.\n\nYet the fact that a Republican agenda for trans erasure means doing damage to the wider health care system is a reminder that control over gender-nonconforming people requires control over everyone.\n\nThe trans erasure bill mandates that all private health insurance plans, for every Floridian, cover what is commonly described as \"conversion therapy\" - a dangerous pseudoscientific approach to changing someone's sexual preferences or gender identity. The bill doesn't call it that, of course, but with a little translation of the obfuscating language and poor grammar, it's easy to show what Florida Republicans are trying to do.\n\nThe bill \"forbids health insurers and HMOs from prohibiting coverage of mental health and therapeutic services to treat a person's perception that his or her sex is inconsistent with sex at birth by affirming the person's sex at birth.\" That is, health insurers must cover therapy that insists that a gender assigned at birth is correct, and that a person suffering from gender dysphoria should be made to accept this.\n\nConversion therapy is a debunked practice, banned in 20 states and rejected by the American Medical Association. Yet, should the trans erasure bill become law, Florida residents under private health insurance plans will have to pay for it to be covered.\n\nFlorida has been ground zero for introducing a spate of anti-trans legislation aiming at health insurance and medical liability as a means to bring about de facto health care bans for trans adults, alongside explicit bans on care for trans youth.\n\n\"It's so important we stop these bills in Florida,\" Carlos Guillermo Smith, a senior policy adviser for Equality Florida who is running for state Senate, told me. \"For every anti-LGBTQ bill we see pass in Florida, we'll see it taken up elsewhere.\"\n\nIt's not clear, and has not been calculated , what the exact cost of the \"conversion therapy\" mandate would be for privately insured Floridians. No research was carried out by Republicans on the financial consequences of the measure, despite such analysis being required by state law before any mandate on health insurance is enacted. Florida Republicans, though, might not know that: They're usually fighting tooth and nail against enacting these mandates, which in most cases have been proposed to expand access to health care, not restrict it.\n\nThis grim irony - that the Florida GOP usually opposes government mandates on health care coverage provisions but is in this case seeking to impose its own in the name of conversion therapy - is not lost on LGBTQ+ and health care advocates in the state.\n\n\"They've taken their culture-war attacks against trans people so far that it's costing everyone,\" said Smith. \"If the human price wasn't bad enough - and it should be - it's hitting all our pockets,\" he told me, noting that Florida is one of \"a handful of remaining states\" that has refused to expand Medicaid, in turn denying coverage to 800,000 uninsured Floridians.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Smith cited Florida's own law, which states that the legislature \"recognizes that most mandated benefits contribute to the increasing cost of health insurance premiums.\" Nonetheless, he noted, \"HB 1639 mandates anti-trans 'conversion therapy' on all health care plans no matter what the cost on Floridians.\"\n\nThere's no real contradiction here. Republicans have long combined costly totalitarian bureaucracy and law enforcement with vicious austerity measures in service of their ultimate goals: white supremacy, Christo-nationalism, and property protection.\n\nThe answer to the conversion therapy mandate is not to call upon Republicans to remain consistent in their austerity logics and resist all government mandated health care. Rather, it's to fight for a robust system of free health care for all, less vulnerable to the compulsions of conservative minority rule.\n\nOther measures in the trans erasure bill take specific aim at insurance plans that cover gender-affirming care and require that coverage for \"de-transition\" medical treatment be offered for any such plan.\n\n\"De-transition\" care should already be covered as gender affirming health care - to transition again is still to transition - but the legislation is an invitation for private insurers to treat trans people as a site of risk and raise premiums accordingly or drop gender-affirming care coverage altogether.\n\nThe bill explicitly states that plans that cover trans health care can charge \"an appropriate additional premium,\" singling out trans people for higher premiums to cover the care they need. Meanwhile, all Floridians would have to pay more for the inclusion of conversion therapy in their coverage.\n\nHaving passed the House last week, the Florida Senate now has until the end of the week - the close of the legislative session - to take up the trans erasure bill and other anti-trans legislation passed by the House. If the Senate responds to rightful public concern about the legislation and does not pick it up in the coming days, the bill dies.\n\nIt would be a small but necessary victory against the Republican war on trans existence.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Andrew Cuomo Outright Lied to LGBTQ Democratic Caucus - but Got Its Endorsement Anyway\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nCuomo falsely claimed that he has never endorsed members of the Republican-aligned Independent Democratic Conference or an anti-LGBTQ candidate.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo blatantly lied twice on the questionnaire of an LGBTQ Democratic club, whose endorsement he was seeking. In the application Cuomo filled out for the Stonewall Democratic Club of NYC, he wrongly claimed to have never endorsed members of the recently dissolved Independent Democratic Conference - a group of breakaway Democratic state senators who caucused with the Republican minority - or any candidate with a track record of working against LGBTQ equality.\n\nOn Thursday, the Stonewall Democrats endorsed him anyway.\n\nHis claim that he has never and would never endorse any member of the IDC or any candidate affiliated with the coalition is particularly absurd, given his role in the creation of the IDC. Cuomo, who is currently facing a heated primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, formally endorsed then-IDC leader Jeff Klein in his state Senate race in 2014. (The questionnaire asks, \"Have you or would you in the future ...\" to which Cuomo answered \"no\" for both IDC and elected officials with a track record of opposing LGBT equality.)\n\nHe also lied about not backing a candidate with an anti-LGBT rights track record. In March, Cuomo opened his remarks at a gala with praise for the chair of the Bronx Democratic Party, Assemblyman Marcos Crespo, who voted against same-sex marriage the year it became law.\n\n\"How about that Marcos Crespo? What a beautiful talent, what a great legislator, what a great representative for this State of New York,\" Cuomo said at the 2018 SOMOS Gala. \"We talk about young talent. You watch this man, because he's a shooting star. Let's give Marcos Crespo a big round of applause.\"\n\nWhen asked why Cuomo lied about his past support of IDC and anti-LGBTQ candidates, Abbey Fashouer, a spokesperson for Cuomo's campaign, said that he supports all Democratic members and pointed to his record on marriage equality. \"As we have said, the governor stands alongside Andrea Stewart-Cousins in supporting all members of the Senate Democratic Conference,\" Fashouer said in an email. \"If anyone threatens to defect from the Democratic Conference, he will be first in line to oppose them. The Governor is a national leader for LGBTQ rights and his record of leadership making New York the first big state to pass marriage equality speaks for itself.\"\n\nOriginal reporting.

And Williams has previously said that he holds personal views against LGBT marriage and abortion, but supports both as legal rights for all when it comes down to policy.\n\nBut why would Cuomo lie on a questionnaire about his support of IDC candidates, an alliance that can be fact-checked with the click of a button? Here's how HuffPost wrote about President Donald Trump's dishonesty in 2017:\n\nIt's a lie that is told, not just to achieve an objective, but to demonstrate the power of the person telling the lie relative to those affected by it. Fuckery creates a wall between the person or group telling the lie and the people hearing it. Fuckery throws down a gauntlet: It is too big to ignore, yet so absurd that it promises to debase anybody who grapples with it. It makes a mockery of the very idea of truth.\n\nUpdate: July 26, 2018 This story has been updated to include that the Stonewall Democrats have endorsed Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\nTop photo: New York Gov.

      "text": "Liberals Rose to Fight the Assault on Abortion - but Not Trans Rights\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\n2022 has seen right-wing attacks on trans rights increasingly aided by the tacit, if sometimes unwitting, transphobia of liberal institutions.\n\nDemocratic Party representatives march toward the Supreme Court during a protest of the court overturning Roe v. Wade in Washington, D.C., on July 19, 2022.\n\nWhen 2022 is tallied in the annals of history, it will no doubt be remembered as the year the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to an abortion. Yet, while the decadeslong right-wing assault on reproductive liberties reached new heights this year, it also met a broad wave of long overdue resistance, even in crimson red states. The midterm election results were in many ways a popular rebuke to the Republican pro-natalist agenda - cold comfort as that might be in a country of minority rule.\n\nThe crucial struggle for abortion access is, however, a response to only one front in the far right's all-out war on bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom. In statehouses nationwide, Republicans consistently put forward extreme anti-abortion bills at the very same time that they have proposed bills to attack, immiserate, and eliminate trans people, particularly trans children.\n\nThe GOP has made clear that its anti-abortion efforts go hand in hand with an anti-trans eliminationist project; they are two sides of the same coin. The mass efforts to defend abortion access, however, have not been echoed in the fight for trans lives.\n\nRather, 2022 has seen right-wing attacks on trans rights increasingly aided by the tacit, if sometimes unwitting, transphobia of liberal political and media institutions - consider the numerous New York Times reports and columns, for example, that have this year put trans lives up for debate. This has been no less than a victory for fascism.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIn previous years, liberal transphobia seemed largely the preserve of Britain's media ecosystem. Looking across the Atlantic, to my birth country, I had felt a certain relief that in the mainstream U.S. discourse, anti-trans rhetoric was, for the most part, understood to be a mark of the far right.\n\nThis year anti-trans liberal feminism - the sort championed by author J.K. Rowling - has been mainstreamed in the very same opinion pages that once treated the position as an unpleasant British curiosity.\n\nThe far right has, meanwhile, only escalated its anti-trans onslaught, grimly secure in the knowledge that, unlike with abortion, no significant political pushback will come. This is in part thanks to U.S. transphobes who falsely consider themselves in opposition to the far right - like some New York Times columnists - as well as fangless Democrats who treat trans people as an afterthought. Even the anti-fascist left has not done enough to take up the fight for trans rights.\n\nPride flags and candles wave during the Transgender Day of Remembrance in Wilkes-Barre, Penn., on Nov. 20, 2022.\n\nIn 2022 , state lawmakers filed a record number of anti-LGBTQ bills - nearly 300 - with many targeting trans kids in schools. Ten states barred trans students from playing sports , two states barred trans children from accessing the correct bathrooms , and two states banned discussions of sexual orientation or gender identity in schools (which, of course, only means the discussion of non-cisgender identities and non-heteronormative sexual orientations).\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott directed state agencies to investigate parents of trans kids as child abusers, an effort Republicans in other states are looking to advance . In Congress, far-right extremist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., introduced the first piece of federal legislation, co-sponsored by a whopping 40-plus House Republicans, to outlaw gender-affirming care for minors nationwide. That law would make providing such care a felony punishable by up to 25 years in prison.\n\nThe only thing holding many of these barbaric laws and policies at bay are lawsuits filed by trans children and their families, represented by attorneys like Chase Strangio of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThe outlook for 2023 remains dark: Republicans will control the U.S. House and state lawmakers - with scant reason to limit their anti-trans eliminationist efforts - will continue apace. Immediately after the midterms, lawmakers in Tennessee filed bills to ban gender-affirming health care for children in next year's state legislative session.\n\nMeanwhile, outside statehouses and courtrooms, the far right has declared open season on LBGTQ spaces. It is now common practice for armed, self-identifying Christian nationalist militia members to harass family-friendly drag brunches and drag queen story hours. When a mass shooting last month at Club Q, an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs, left five people dead, the national response was one of shock but not surprise. Anti-LGBTQ violence felt all but inevitable.\n\nThe response from the usual liberal bastions wasn't surprising either: There was handwringing about physically defending queer people. A week after the massacre, the New York Times editorial board chose to dedicate column inches to condemning armed anti-fascist groups who have been protecting queer spaces in response to this ongoing wave of armed fascist harassment.\n\nFascist propagandists like the Manhattan Institute's Christopher Rufo - who cynically transformed \"critical race theory\" from a term of scholarly inquiry into a racist foghorn - have spoken publicly about stoking their conservative base with anti-LGBTQ myths of \"groomers\" and pedophiles.\n\nIt's not a secret that the anti-trans panic has been manufactured by think tanks or that anti-trans legislation is drafted from model bills, circulated from the top down, and spewed from Tucker Carlson's furiously contorting mouth into millions of living rooms every evening. There is nothing organic nor grassroots about this anti-trans moral panic, yet it is accorded the status of a legitimate public concern.\n\n\"Rufo is so confident in his disdain\" for liberal establishment media, noted writer Max Fox in a recent essay for Parapraxis, \"that he can be seen telling credulous liberal journalists precisely how he has manipulated them into carrying out his campaign.\"\n\nIt's working: Liberals might not be echoing QAnon \"groomer\" conspiracies, but anti-trans panic abounds, reliably articulated as fear for the fates of children - notional children , who are presumed cis, that is. Time and again, I've heard ostensibly well-meaning liberals regurgitate the same sentences that were used in previous eras to treat gay identity, or interracial couples, as sites of potential peril. The refrain is the same: I support it, but won't children suffer? And the answer should be the same too: Only if we maintain a world wherein such identities and relationships are deemed unnatural and unwanted.\n\nThis is not a question of showing liberal deference to personal identity. It's about who is and is not permitted to produce and reproduce the world as they see fit. When it comes to queer and trans liberation, especially of queer trans people of color, we have this year seen the consequences of treating the recognition of identity as merely an issue of visibility or representation. Without a commitment to our shared liberation, without active solidarity, increased visibility for trans people can just mean greater exposure to risk.\n\nWe will carry the struggle for reproductive freedom into the new year. We must: Republican efforts to decimate reproductive health care have been horrifyingly successful, and they will not stop. Avoiding a red wave in the midterms did not restore abortion rights, let alone the free and accessible abortion and reproductive care we so need.\n\nYet we can't win this fight unless we understand the right's anti-abortion politics for what they are. That means seeing why the struggle for trans rights and reproductive justice must go together. For the most part, beyond a highly religious minority, those who are anti-abortion are not driven by a true belief in the inviolable value of all fetal life; Republicans would have and pay for fewer abortions themselves if that were true, and they would arguably care more about the lives of poor, Black pregnant women.\n\nInstead, when Republicans invoke the child who needs saving from abortion, they refer to a political construction, a figuration: the \"innocent\" white, cis child at the heart of the Republican political imaginary, reproduced within the confines of the private nuclear family. It's this organization of white standing and property that anti-abortion politics aim to uphold.\n\nIt's not an accident, then, that Republicans call upon the same myth of imperiled children to warn of trans indoctrination, grooming, or \"social contagion\" - with the very same notions of \"purity\" and traditionalist family reproduction at play.\n\nFascism holds this imaginary \"innocent\" child at its rhetorical center - and when it comes to abortion politics, liberals and leftists have rejected its invocation, insisting instead on prioritizing the health and well-being of actually living adults and children and their rights to bodily autonomy.\n\nIn the struggle for trans rights, all too many liberals - and some leftists - have interpellated notions about pure and innocent children who must be somehow protected from transness. That is, they have let fascism's child win the day. Vanquishing the right's pro-natalist fascism requires standing with trans children.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

(Guillermo Arias / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOver the past several decades, almost a fifth of countries across the world have legalized same-sex marriage, and less than a third now have laws explicitly criminalizing homosexuality. This is undeniably a sign both that there has been real progress in the struggle against homophobia and that large bastions of bigotry remain unchallenged across much of the globe.\n\nIn the 1970s and '80s, struggles for gay liberation often took radical forms, aligning themselves with the antiwar and socialist movements. This connection between gay politics and political radicalism has almost completely broken down today. In an interview with Jacobin , Roger Lancaster , anthropologist and author of the new book The Struggle to Be Gay - in Mexico, for Example (University of California, 2024), argues that one of the foundational problems with the way that gay life is discussed in the academy and activist circles is its inattention to class.\n\nIn The Struggle to Be Gay - in Mexico, for Example , Lancaster provides a sociology of working-class gay life, focusing on dark-skinned and indigenous Mexicans. What he finds is that American discussions of gay life often ignore how class determines the spaces that people can afford to have access to. This has prevented many on the Left from seeing how economic insecurity excludes many working-class people from participating in gay life.\n\nTo begin with, I wanted to ask what led you to write this book. Was there a specific dissatisfaction over how the question of gay life under capitalism has been told over the last decades?\n\nThere's a lot to be dissatisfied with if one thinks that material conditions, especially class dynamics, ought to be within the frame of reference. But engagement with political economy has mostly gone missing from LGBTQ studies, and from the origins of queer theory onward, class disappears as a sustained subject of interest on the American scene. Indeed, in the introduction to Fear of a Queer Planet (1993), Michael Warner expressly expelled class perspectives from the field. \"Class,\" he writes, \"is conspicuously useless . . . unintelligible\" for queer theorizations of the social. This remarkable statement encapsulated the emerging consensus.\n\nYou won't find attention to the grubby realities of class existence in Judith Butler's theories of performativity, which reshaped the field around abstractions in the 1990s. In consequence, even works that ostentatiously announce their \"materialism\" keep to theoretical flyover views and don't seem to have much to say about class conditions on the ground. Some American scholars on the cultural-studies left do write the word \"class\" from time to time, typically embedded as an afterthought in a string of references to other forms of social inequality - \"race, gender, sexuality, class.\"\n\nWhen these theorists refer to class, its often unclear what they mean, and I'm frequently left wondering whether they know themselves. Generally, they see class basically as an effect of discrimination (\"classism,\" a term introduced by Audre Lorde early on in the development of identity politics) and not as the form that social relations inevitably take under the inexorable dynamics of capitalist production and circulation. Or else, in typical American style, they conflate class with one of its manifestations, poverty, conceptually aligning the bulk of ordinary working-class people with elites in the moral drama of rich versus poor.\n\nThe result is a body of work that is increasingly distant from, and is sometimes quite hostile to, the everyday struggles of ordinary people. By contrast, The Struggle to Be Gay is a book about social class and how it shapes gay people's lives, but also how it constrains their social imagination of sexuality, freedom, and identity. It starts up close and personal, chronicling the experiences of mostly working-class gay men, their encounters with rejection and acceptance, violence and love, their plans and frustrations. The book then pans out to take in wider views: how identities crystallize within changing political-economic crosscurrents, and how these historical developments affect subjects' placement in the social world today. The setting is Mexico, but the class dynamics I describe play out in other countries, including those of the North Atlantic.\n\nYou say that there isn't such thing as a politics of gay life. What do you mean by that?\n\nThinking in the field has been buttressed by the assumption that gayness - then later queerness, then later some variant of intersectional identity - has necessary political implications, usually by dint of how either identity or conduct transgresses norms and conventions. But is this so? Can we examine the premise more closely?\n\nIt is true that everyone subject to modern conventions who is strongly attracted to members of the same sex has to come to some sort of reckoning: \"Am I that name, flung in commonplace invective and casual insults?\" But it strains matters to say that this personal reckoning has clear political implications.\n\nOne strand of the early homophile movement (Magnus Hirschfeld's Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, Edward Carpenter's activism) allied with socialism, but not all gays threw their lot in with workers and the oppressed. Another strand essentially took up an old aristocratic view, under which homosexuality was one of the privileges of male power (Adolf Brand's early twentieth-century homosexual advocacy group, Community of the Special, for example) or aligned with the anti-modernist Wandervogel youth movement.\n\nMore recently, issue positions have run the gamut. In the heady days of the American New Left, gay militants called for abolition of the family; later, gay rights activists mobilized for marriage equality. It's hard to deduce an implicit politics in social movements' changing orientations, goals, and strategies. And if one looks at nightlife subcultures, as distinct from social movements, necessary political implications become even more difficult to tease out. To be sure, any subculture that functioned like a never-ending political forum would quickly become a dreadfully tedious affair.\n\nSo I start from a different premise, one based in the very real social scenes I write about. When we gather, socialize, and revel, we are not rebelling, or accumulating political forces, nor are we staging various kinds of transgressivity, calculated to shock conservative mores. We are not engaged in a collective struggle over power and its distribution, which is the operative definition of politics. Foremost, we are out to have a good time, to snatch such moments of pleasure as we can from a humdrum and oppressive existence.\n\nI hasten to add that, of course, subcultures can become springboards for certain kinds of resistant political action. We don't want the cops to hassle us, and sometimes we find ourselves and our scenes in the crosshairs of the culture wars. HIV still defines the horizons of gay men's experiences, and collective struggles for health care have certainly been political struggles, although these have taken a very wide range of forms. But the default condition of gay life is not to be immersed in politics. It does no dishonor to the institutions created by gay men and women - the bar scenes, cafés, and club settings, where we make friends, find lovers, and pass time over a good portion of our lives - to call them \"social\" as distinct from political.\n\nBut a great deal of work in the field does present itself as political.\n\nThe temptation to substitute \"ought\" for \"is\" is very strong, and a series of intellectual moves over the years has attempted to sustain the implausible illusion that gay life, or some version thereof, is transgressive (which is or certainly was true), and by dint of transgression, intrinsically political in some particular fashion (which does not follow). Thus, twenty years after the birth of modern gay liberation, when university students and activists elaborated a lexicon to distinguish properly politicized, right-thinking gays from the rest, North American activists and academics began using the word \"queer\" to distinguish social subjects they understood to be unassimilable from those (gays) they considered to have become hopelessly conformist.\n\nTwenty years after that, the word \"queer\" had mostly lost its edgy connotation - but by then, we had already embarked on a series of fresh hunts for the exemplary transgressive subject. This was a subject that could never be assimilated into white ableist cisheteropatriarchy and whose resistance to norms and conventions would be viewed as instructive. We have chased this idea across shifting populations and subpopulations, producing as our exhibits a succession of multiply intersectional groups and ever-smaller subgroups, as first one and then another demographic eventually fails the standards of whatever we might plausibly mean by \"transgressive\" and \"political.\"\n\nThis transgressive conceit - crystallized in the word \"queer,\" which, unlike \"gay,\" signals a refusal to imagine an end to stigma and rejection once and for all - bars the way to the perspectives we need. Increasingly, it stands as an accusation against a growing majority of LGBTQ people who can never be deemed sufficiently queer to pass constantly changing litmus tests. We end up staging endless morality plays, the point of which is to establish ever more finely delineated pecking orders in the chain of oppressions. This sort of moralizing is the enemy of both robust analysis and genuine solidarity. It has taken us to a series of dead ends. Today these habits of thought have put down political-economic roots: they are now subsidized by a far-flung network of well-heeled private foundations, queer theory clergy at universities, and the DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) sections of major corporations.\n\nI say, let's retire this conceptual apparatus and start again from a different foundation, one grounded in the social as distinct from the political, and, as a basic condition of empirical veracity, one that brackets off whatever the theorist or activist might want from whatever it is that real people on the social ground want. Let's get out of the familiar ruts, and let's stop seeing the world the way successive generations of academics and activists have been trained to see it. A renewed field then might open up new paths to inquiries about the political - inquiries less beholden to the foundation apparatus and the sensibilities of university politics, all of which, after all, inculcate forms of contempt for the working class. Anyway, that is what I attempt to do.\n\nBut if, as you argue, there is no class politics inherent to gay life, there is a class base to being able to claim a modern, destigmatized sexual identity. You seem to argue that while society as a whole is more tolerant and liberal than it was fifty years ago, such effects don't exactly easily translate across class lines.\n\nYes, this is the crux of the ethnographic parts of the book. The mostly working-class gay men I write about, some of them indigenous or from indigenous backgrounds, show scant signs of wanting to be political subjects in any of the senses advanced by academics and internationally connected social movement activists. But they do long for freedom, adventure, plenty, a happy life - prospects opened up over the past fifty years - although they lack the resources to make any of those things happen. That is to say that they perpetually come up against the limitations of their class position. It is worth noting that, as a consequence of their placement in the social world, they also tend to aspire to personal goals that academics and activists might at first glance dismiss as \"conformist,\" \"normative,\" or \"middle class.\"\n\nWhat, then, does it mean concretely to be gay and working-class today in a country like Mexico?\n\nAs the title suggests, it is about struggle, and this is a kind of class struggle: the conflict between gayness, as a cosmopolitan modern identity, and the class position of gay men who basically can't afford to be gay. Class might be a dirty secret in the United States, but this uneasy relationship between sexual identity and class position is no secret in Mexico, nor is how this relationship fits with a wider storyline about tradition and modernity.\n\nPeople tell a cruel joke that succinctly captures the logic of these relationships. \"Father,\" begins an earnest young man from a working-class barrio, \"I have something to tell you . . . I'm gay.\" The father expresses support, then asks a series of questions: \"But do you live in a fashionable part of town? Do you shop at trendy stores? Can you even get into clubs that charge one hundred pesos at the door?\" The boy's answer to all three questions in succession is something like \"Why, no, papá, you know I can't afford such things.\" Then comes the father's flatfooted response, a harsh punchline: \"Well, I love you very much, son, and I hate to tell you this, but you're confused, you're mistaken. No eres gay, eres solo un pinche puto [You're not gay, you're just a fucking fag].\"\n\nThe first time I heard this joke, I flinched. But a lot of what I was observing on the gay social scene in Puebla began to make more sense to me. And the way tellers, gay or straight, relished the cruelty of the punch line provided a clue to wider frustrations. The joke tells us that in Mexico, gayness is understood to be a middle-class identity, associated with the accoutrements of a cosmopolitan lifestyle. As the father's line of questioning suggests, this involves a certain style of life, a manner of dress, a fun night out at the clubs, followed perhaps by a leisurely Sunday brunch and savvy banter with friends. But in a country where the minimum wage is US$14.50 per day (and this much only after six consecutive hikes by the current center-left government), the price of admission to the fashionable clubs alone exceeds the reach of many.\n\nFor working-class men, then, being gay is not a given; it is a struggle, an aspirational identity. The joke encapsulates it all: how limited resources restrict working-class men's options and steer their lives along certain tracks, leaving them in the role of frustrated aspirants to a free and unstigmatized identity, but also how class structures people's aspirational and symbolic worlds. The cruelty of this jest is typically self-reflexive: the teller is invariably in the same position as the young protagonist, locked out of what both perceive to be the good life.\n\nSo class dynamics divide the gay world?\n\nYes, exactly. And to risk repeating: when working-class men strive for gayness, an unstigmatized identity, cultural capital, modernity, they are effectively striving for a middle-class existence. And how could it be otherwise? Anyone can see that men of means have more freedom than men of want; anyone can see that it is better to be perceived as \"gay\" than as a \" puto .\" But different forms of mimicry or simulation - fake name brands, for instance - can't change a working-class person into a middle-class person, can't change a \" puto \" into a gay man. And therein lies aspirants' unhappy predicament: they lack the material wherewithal to get what they want. Like a mirage in the desert, gayness constantly evades them.\n\nThe temptation might be to dismiss these longings as errors, false lures, or misguided optimism. Queer theory and its offshoots have abundant templates for just this sort of dismissal; I think especially of the late Lauren Berlant's Cruel Optimism . And perhaps I am on treacherous grounds, because socialist criticism also has something to say here. Socialists might be tempted to argue that these ways of longing amount to consumerism and reinforce bourgeois ideology or serve as substitutes for a genuine working-class perspective. Perhaps there is some merit to this. But people struggle with such resources as they have at their disposal, not with those we might wish for them. I don't think it's helpful to unfurl, yet again, theories of false consciousness here. People actually know a great deal about their labor, its exploitation, and their real position in the world.\n\nI hope I'm not understood to be pushing a faux-populist countercritique of the sort associated with the banal middle years of cultural studies. The men I write about aren't only aspiring to buy the latest iPhone or name brand attire, although there is some of that. They're neither witless dupes of the culture industries nor are they subversively reinscribing and reencoding advertisers' messages and media objects. Their problem is not having, not not understanding.\n\nMore profoundly, they want forms of freedom that they can't always explain clearly. This wanting involves money, but it isn't just about the money: aspirants strive to participate in a three-dimensional modern cosmopolitan world of enlightened understanding, personal freedom, and material comfort. Who doesn't?\n\nSo I start there, and I strive for sympathetic understanding of how people inhabit a drab workaday world and with what materials they aspire to something else. I try to track how these longings emerge out of their particular predicaments. It pays to keep the historicity of these developments in view. If gayness is a liberal bourgeois subject position, heir to the traditions of the Enlightenment, it is also a vehicle for universalist ideals and strivings. The personal and collective struggles I document are ongoing and open-ended. No one can say in advance where they might take aspirants, either individually or collectively.\n\nYou describe what Mexicans call the \" ambiente ,\" which is an environment rather than an identity. Could we say that the dynamic at work over the last thirty years has precisely been about expanding more explicit notions based on identity like \"gay\" rather than less prescriptive spaces like \"the ambiente \"?\n\nYes, but with some important asterisks.\n\nMost people translate \" ambiente \" as \"gay\" or, alternatively, use the term to indicate the kinds of underground scenes that existed before the arrival of the international concept of \"gay\" sometime in the late 1970s or early 1980s. These uses obscure important points, which I try to unfold.\n\nToday Mexican speakers have two ways of posing the question to you. If they ask you, \" ¿Eres gay? \" they are asking for clarity about your identity. It is a question that presupposes a globalized classificatory apparatus, and you don't have to be gay to understand what is being asked. However, if they ask you, \" ¿Eres de ambiente? \" they have asked something different. Such phrasing of the question is rather like the dated English query \"Are you in the life?\"\n\nIn my book, I stress something that is not always understood. The second question makes fewer presuppositions about identity than the former: it is not asking you for your identification papers. It asks instead whether you have fellowship with an amorphous \"us.\" Born under repressive conditions, the term \" ambiente \" works off ambiguity, not clarity, and takes this ambiguity as its enabling condition. It also continues, even now, to function as a secret key to a hidden door: if you are not of the ambiente , you probably will not understand the question, and the questioner will not have revealed himself to you.\n\nI try to capture something of the resulting social landscapes and the kinds of people one might encounter there. This demimonde, the ambiente , where no one has to explain himself and no one checks ID papers at the door, is a floating world with no fixed address. It might be this park on Wednesday, this cantina on Thursday evening, this traditional bathhouse on Friday afternoon. It is associated with the popular classes, to be sure, but it is also one of those spaces where the classes scandalously socialize and mix.\n\nSo what is the relationship between the one thing and the other? The cosmopolitan gay scene was planted in the ambiente , which continues to exist all around it. The gay scene thus did not displace or supplant the ambiente ; rather, we might say that it established hegemony over the wider geography. At the risk of being reductive, we might also say that \"gay\" is a prominent class formation in the world in the evening. Or, to better frame it, we might say that it is a way of dreaming, of trying to align oneself with the kind of economic clout that might underwrite a dignified life, a sort of \" imagined cosmopolitanism ,\" to finally use the anthropologist Louisa Schein's unavoidable term.\n\nOne sometimes gets the sense that you are enthusiastic about the ambiente , as a model for postqueer forms of life.\n\nIt does provide an alternative to taxonomic reification, which today elaborates classificatory schemes in order to produce ever more finely delineated subjects fit for identity politics. But instead of giving unqualified praise for one term or the other, I try to lay out the different implications of \"gay\" and \" de ambiente ,\" as my subjects move back and forth between conceptual worlds.\n\nThe popular understanding of working-class views on sexuality is that they are generally conservative. You seem to disagree that we should spontaneously think about workers in such a way.\n\nSocial theorists since Max Weber have thought that class conditions inevitably cultivate socially conservative dispositions in the working and popular classes. It's not irrational to think this, especially if we understand a feeling for tradition to be embedded in the sorts of class dynamics that Karl Polanyi and others have traced, where the popular classes have an interest in traditional, time-honored ways of doing things because these establish barriers against economic innovations that quicken the pace of exploitation.\n\nModern observers, including students of Pierre Bourdieu, have variously extended this idea to suggest that workers have a natural affinity for sexual conservatism, especially homophobia. This is to say nothing of the ambient wisdom of the educated middle classes, who invariably view the working classes as \"backward,\" certainly on the question of sexual tolerance, certainly in the age of Donald Trump and other right-wing demagogues.\n\nBut there is simply too much historical and geographical variation for us to say that the working class, or, if you will, the popular classes broadly understood, are homophobic by dint of something intrinsic to the class structure. Historically, you have long periods when the lower classes appear to have been indifferent to the prohibition on same-sex activity: they looked the other way; they practiced same-sex activities in ways that were not very discreet or hidden.\n\nCarlos Monsiváis notes that in nineteenth-century Mexico, tales about men (especially working-class men) bedding down together could be related without raising an eyebrow. And today ideas about sexuality vary greatly from one working-class sector to another, from one region to another, and, in Mexico, from one village to another. Here you find relative acceptance, there violent rejection; here public celebration of sexual and gender diversity, there condemnation and shunning.\n\nOrganized religion is often a strong driver of homophobia, but in practice, religious tradition means different things to different people. Whatever the priests might assert, there's no obvious connection between, say, veneration of the Virgin of Guadalupe and homophobia. Many deny a connection. (Even gay bars and bathhouses sometimes have popular saints' shrines or altars near the entrance.)\n\nStill, in the aggregate today, working- and popular-class youth in Mexico (and other places) do seem to be especially vulnerable to the worst forms of homophobia, including heart-stopping family rejection and acts of horrific violence. I suggest that, rather than naturalizing this vulnerability or writing it into a static view of class culture, we think about it at the convergence of political-economic and social trends.\n\nFirst, four decades of neoliberalism have made life in working-class barrios and low-income pueblos more precarious and unstable. Things got much worse when Felipe Calderón attempted to buttress his presidency after a questionable election in 2006 by declaring war on narco-traffickers, unleashing waves of violence that still have not abated. Newer forms of religious enthusiasm - evangelical Protestantism, millenarian sects like Jehovah's Witnesses, charismatic movements, family-values Catholicism - have stepped into the social breach, bringing a semblance of stability to destabilized lives, but they've also brought amped-up homophobia and intolerance.\n\nFurthermore, higher education is associated with socially liberal worldviews, and these provide some protection against the worst forms of homophobia, but working-class people from the barrios and pueblos have at best constrained access to universities. In trying to piece these factors together, I lean on things that other scholars, perhaps especially Vivek Chibber , have suggested: with the destruction of strong working-class institutions such as militant labor unions and an overarching social democratic-populist compact, which buffered the working class from the worst storms of capitalist development, workers tend to fall back on conservative, stabilizing institutions such as family, kinship, religion. This is not mysterious, but it's also not inevitable.\n\nFor all the reasons I've laid out, we should think of working-class intolerance as a tendency, not a rule, a problem that appears under some circumstances and disappears under others.\n\nIn a sense, your book is an attempt to bring back class into the picture. But not from an intersectional perspective. Why? Aren't you just adding class into the mix as one among many other identity categories?\n\nIt's true that I try to think about overlapping dimensions of inequality. The people about whom I write are gay, male, dark-skinned, indigenous or recently so, of mixed ancestry; some are from rural or small-town settings. They are also mostly working-class. I try to attend to the specificity of these factors, taking them all into account and describing their effects on subjects' experiences. I also analyze some of the ways sexual prohibition, race/ethnicity, and so on, interdigitate in wider social systems. All of this might seem tailor-made for identitarian, especially intersectional, treatment.\n\nBut the elements in play here are not equally weighted, with each contributing the same force in a calculable summation of each person's position in a system of social inequality, nor are they all of the same substance. Most importantly, one is not like the others. Class is not an identity: it doesn't depend in the least on \"ascription,\" to borrow a term from Adolph Reed Jr . It is not a civic status or an ideological product but a relation of production, an objective situation ineluctably structured by productive forces. Unlike the other forms of inequality in play, then, class is a necessary, not contingent, feature of the capitalist system, which cleaves the world into owners and workers.\n\nNotions like racial capitalism invariably (mis)read ascription into the unchanging dynamics of the capitalist system, finding there what they've already posited. This misdiagnosis compels the conclusion that capitalism necessarily requires racism and racial inequality. Queer theorists, when they have touched upon such matters, make a similar move, conflating the mode of production (laws of economic production under capitalism) with the mode of social reproduction (changing institutions of marriage, family, kinship) in order to argue that capitalism requires homophobia.\n\nThis, too, turns out to be a flawed premise - obviously so at a time when \"diversity\" represents the human face of neoliberalism, as both Nancy Fraser and Walter Benn Michaels have shown. Intersectionality and queer-of-color critique build on these shaky theoretical foundations. I haven't found much within the literature that has given rise to these concepts to help me understand the predicaments of my subjects, as they struggle with various forms of inequality within class constraints, much less the architectonics of inequality in changing social formations.\n\nI've thus tried to bring a stronger sense of historicity to this material than what gets modeled in most intersectional approaches, which too often seem like mechanistic tabulations, the tallying up of one pre-given identity with another in essentially static frameworks. The better approach, as I understand it, is to be very fluid in our analyses, to try to understand how identities flicker into being or out of existence within changing political-economic horizons.\n\nI thus write about how modern homosexuality came into being in Mexico at the beginning of the twentieth century under conditions of class warfare and nervousness about the stability of the social order, and how subsequent gay identities were shaped and reshaped under changing political-economic conditions, from the decline of the center-left dictatorship to the rise of neoliberal democracy.\n\nYou mentioned the notion of racial capitalism, and you write a lot about skin color, indigeneity, and implicit indigeneity. Are these questions more closely aligned with capitalist logics than questions about sexuality?\n\nPerhaps the stakes come through best when I examine the race/ethnic question in Mexico. A scrupulous examination of the social terrain prioritizes the logic of class in explaining present-day inequalities, even while acknowledging the continued placement of an indigenous minority in the nation and internalized racisms in mestizo culture. To crib the logic of a passage from the historian Cedric Johnson's discussion of race and class in the United States: indigeneity is still derogated, and the mestizo-ized descendants of pre-Columbian civilization are still lumped near the bottom of the economic heap, but anti-indigenous racism and forms of oppression based on the hacienda system, which bound indebted people to the land and reproduced ethnic identities, are no longer the primary determinants of material conditions and social mobility for most dark-skinned Mexicans.\n\nGiven how much racism one hears in everyday conversations, one might think that, notwithstanding legal equality, racial animus and discrimination continue to actively structure economic inequalities today. It's not irrational to think so, but it's doubtful that these are major contributors. After disaggregating class, ethnicity, and color, a careful sociological study found surprisingly little in the way of evidence that active discrimination steers Mexican labor markets and keeps phenotypic hierarchies in place.\n\nInstead, we are driven to conclude that contemporary forms of class oppression steer the fates of a growing mass of Mexicans who disproportionately (but not exclusively) have indigenous roots. Their labor has been degraded by \"hyper-industrialization, the large-scale introduction of automation and cybernetic command, just-in-time production, and other strategies of flexible accumulation\" in Mexican farms and factories. (I paraphrase again from Cedric Johnson's instructive arguments.) They were born into poverty and remain there because the conditions for upward economic mobility among less skilled and less connected workers have stagnated. (These conditions may be beginning to change. Nearly six years in power, AMLO's center-left government hasn't flipped an on/off switch to stop neoliberalism dead in its tracks - such a switch does not exist - but has instead pushed reset buttons across a very wide spectrum of government practices. The net effect has been to reduce inequalities and deliver more power to working-class people.)\n\nThis approach is very different from intersectionality. The last thing I want to do is to propose a new intersectional identity, one that fast-freezes disproportionalities into fixities: working-class, dark-skinned, gay. Sexual repression and intolerance traverse society, as do prejudices based on skin tone or implicit indigeneity. These look different when viewed in light of the class condition of society, which provides a sort of gravitational field for these changing elements, rather than as autonomous forces that intersect and interlock.\n\nBut how should we approach sexual politics from a socialist perspective?\n\nI try to keep in mind Eric Hobsbawm 's riff in his 1996 essay on socialism and identity politics: socialism isn't for black people, or gay people, or Latinos, or any other specific sector or group. Socialism is for everybody. It's not even only for workers. Although socialist parties and movements historically have been based in the working class, the appeal of socialism, at its most successful, was wider. Working-class demands took broad forms that also drew support from the unemployed and economically marginal people, small vendors, middle-class professionals, and other social sectors.\n\nBy contrast to this universalist approach, we've now had fifty years of trying to build socialist politics as an ad hoc coalition of minority movements that make identity the foundation of struggle. The results have not been impressive. Particularist demands never sum up to universalist principles; they never take the form of demands that might stem the tide of waxing inequalities. They thus seldom even address the real needs of a majority of the people the social movements claim to represent.\n\nIn any event, activist liberalism - which many now confuse with socialism - is indisputably better at interest-group politics. Let's acknowledge that this approach has achieved some real gains, especially in dismantling legally sanctioned forms of discrimination. But beyond these important reforms, piecemeal rights granted in the name of identity have had mixed results.\n\nThe right to marry, for instance, is universal in principle, but in practice gay people's enjoyment of this right has been skewed to the middle and upper classes - because the material circumstances of working-class people impede their enjoyment of this right. This is part of an old story about formal equality, liberal rights - in a sense, the backdrop of the whole book.\n\nAgain, I think it's important to break out of the acquired thinking habits of academics and NGO activists, which have aligned with liberal, not socialist, principles. If socialism's \"everybody\" is universal and inclusive, then the approach to sexuality - and race, ethnicity, and other questions identified with identity politics - ought to be to look for shared interests and common needs across all the sectors of the working and popular classes. We should pursue, as much as possible, a vision of the common good.\n\nSo, for example, if darker-skinned people are heaped near the bottom of the economic pile, the solution is to scale up unskilled wages, raise the social floor, provide unhindered access to health care, education, and so on. Similarly, if gay men today can't build decent lives because of the same class conditions of powerlessness and artificial scarcity that affect the working and popular classes broadly, then the path forward isn't to roll out new particularist demands but to expand universal rights to health care, shelter, livable wages, education, and benefits, and to give workers more power in their workplaces and in society at large.\n\nSome will wonder whether this approach really addresses the specificity of gay experiences. I will answer this way: I believe in human creativity, so I'm optimistic that, if given these conditions, we would build better, happier, more integrated, and gayer lives for ourselves and for each other. We could then decide, without presupposition or compulsion, whether marriage or some other institutional arrangement best meets our needs and desires. We would also struggle against residual forms of prejudice (racism and homophobia) with more effective weapons.\n\nNo doubt what I am saying here will be controversial. No approach will answer precisely to every conceivable problem or demand. A universalist socialist approach, however, will prove more inclusive - and ultimately more effective - than liberal particularist rights based on identity.\n\nRoger Lancaster is a professor of anthropology and cultural studies at George Mason University and author of Sex Panic and the Punitive State .\n\nDaniel Zamora is a postdoctoral sociologist at the Université Libre de Bruxelles and Cambridge University.

The event, organized by the Starbucks union, was one of many pickets held nationwide after the coffee giant and the union clashed over claims that the company was not allowing Pride month decorations in Starbucks coffee shops.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThis article was first published in the Spring 2024 issue of New Labor Forum , a journal from the Murphy Institute at the City University of New York's School of Labor and Urban Studies .\n\nIn the early months of 2020, queer Starbucks baristas brewed a plan to challenge their low wages and workplace discrimination. I first learned about the campaign while attending a national LGBTQ advocacy meeting where a group of these workers previewed their organizing agenda. Sitting in a dim hotel conference room, I listened to the baristas share their experiences, which mixed episodes of humiliation and financial hardship - a trans worker's \"dead name\" (pretransition name) that reappeared on each week's work calendar; a work calendar that never listed one worker's name (dead or chosen) enough times to keep their name on an apartment lease. Many of the workers shared their disillusionment with a company that had portrayed itself as corporate America's trans rights vanguardist. In fact, Starbucks had just released its \" #whatsyourname \" advertising campaign, which featured trans and gender-diverse customers asking to have their chosen names scribbled onto coffee cups. Challenging the company's rosy narrative, UNITE HERE issued press releases in February 2020 documenting Starbucks baristas' complaints of discrimination, low wages, and too few hours.\n\nLGBTQ advocacy and leadership appear central to a new generation of labor militants. Take for example the Starbucks workers who have voted to unionize over 350 cafes. Reflecting on these efforts, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organization's (AFL-CIO) Pride at Work executive director Jerame Davis remarked that the union drive was \"one of the queerest union campaigns I've ever seen.\" In June of that year, over three thousand Starbucks Workers United members struck against the company's decision to prohibit in-store Pride decorations, a policy that some perceived as capitulating to rising anti-LGBTQ sentiment. Beyond Starbucks, Pride at Work has received an influx of requests from labor leaders seeking advice on queer-inclusive contract provisions. Among international unions, the United Auto Workers (UAW) recently created an LGBTQ caucus, and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) have agitated for trans teachers' and students' rights.\n\nNow is an appropriate time to assess why queer advocacy seems commonsense to many of today's unionized workers. One answer is that unions promoting LGBTQ issues can deliver - through negotiations - often more readily than civil rights law or supposedly progressive corporations can. However, inspiring as an unabashedly queer working-class politics might be - that is, an approach to labor struggle that centers specific LGBTQ reforms such as antidiscrimination contract provisions and trans-inclusive health care plans - organized labor's ability to improve queer workers' lives stems ultimately from its power to raise standards for all workers. This is in no small part because the basic union contract gains that positively impact LGBTQ workers are essentially the same ones that address the health, income, and housing needs of all workers.\n\nIn what follows, I document historic and contemporary instances where labor unions have embraced LGBTQ equality reforms while highlighting the power that across-the-board economic issues have for all workers - queer or not. Although the former are essential to creating equality within the working class, the latter hold the most potential for improving LGBTQ workers' lives and for creating bonds of solidarity among workers in an age where economic fears are so regularly redirected toward antiqueer scapegoating ends.\n\nQueer workers' organizations and the broader trade union movement frequently provide protections and benefits that legislators, courts, and corporations are often unable or unwilling to deliver. A look at demographics is instructive here. LGBTQ Americans experience higher rates of poverty than their straight cisgender peers in a country where high rates of debt, inadequate health insurance, and at-will employment are already widespread. According to a 2021 report published by the Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy, 17 percent of LGBTQ people experienced poverty compared to a 12 percent rate among straight cisgender people. Trans people exhibit even higher rates of poverty than most other cross-sections of the queer population. What might account for these disparities? A 2017 report issued by the Human Rights Campaign and the Trans People of Color Coalition observed that the \"risk factors and causes\" of antitrans violence were likely rooted in \"some of society's most challenging issues.\" Among these were unaffordable health care, workplace discrimination, reduced employment opportunities, and safe, inclusive schools. In other words, the life chances of many poor and working-class trans people - like all poor and working-class people - are diminished primarily because they lack the basic material needs and comforts that unions routinely provide to their members.\n\nIndeed, queer-inclusive unions offer advantages over the paltry protections offered by federal civil rights law and enforcement mechanisms. Title VII's prohibition on sex-based employment discrimination - which until a few years ago excluded LGBTQ workers from such protections - has historically been interpreted as guaranteeing a narrow formal legal equality . Although this rendering of equality was far from preordained - in contrast to mere legal protection from discrimination, labor feminists have long advocated for a robust set of public-goods-based reforms including worker protections, living wages, and care work programs - it has come to characterize the federal civil rights regime. Furthermore, federal courts have interpreted Title VII narrowly to cases in which an employee can demonstrate evidence that an employer had engaged in discriminatory \"animus\" because of that employee's protected class status (e.g., race, religion, or sex).\n\nBy conceiving of discrimination as arising less from structural economic factors and more from prejudice-based discrimination, Title VII's impact was sharply curtailed long before the Supreme Court decided in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020) to apply its protections to LGBTQ employees. Moreover, Bostock came on the heels of the court's anti-union decision in Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (2018), which forced right-to-work constraints upon the country's public-sector unions. In other words, LGBTQ employees have gained some limited rights against discrimination while losing their rights as workers. Still more, the Supreme Court appears willing to limit the impact of recent LGBTQ rights victories. This is clear given the court's 2021 decision allowing a publicly funded Catholic social service agency to deny married gay couples seeking to foster and adopt, as well as its 2023 ruling allowing a Christian website designer to refuse service to a queer couple planning their wedding. Whichever path the court takes on future LGBTQ rights issues - either a narrow formal equality route or an overtly anti-LGBTQ one - its decisions stand to do more harm than good to working-class people, queer or otherwise.\n\nUnions often have the power and will to deliver what civil rights law cannot. In recent years , many locals have added \"gender identity and expression\" and \"sexual orientation\" to existing antidiscrimination contract language. Union members within the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees Union (AFSCME), for example, have negotiated over one thousand contracts with such protections. Rather than relying on the courts where the deck has been stacked against antidiscrimination claims, queer union members benefit from grievance procedures and the power of their membership, which can pressure employers to rectify abuse. Such provisions for trans workers actually predate national civil rights protections by several decades . In the 1980s, the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) in New Jersey negotiated antidiscrimination contract language on \"change of sex\" after a trans worker experienced harassment after gender-affirmation surgery. Even earlier, in 1975, a trans worker in Lordstown, Ohio, successfully sued General Motors for mistreatment, using a new UAW attorney services benefit. Today's unions also furnish LGBTQ workers with additional benefits. Recently, the United Steel Workers (USW) eliminated restrictions on gender-affirming care from its health insurance plan, giving union members and their families access to potentially life-saving - and, in some cases, expensive - treatment.\n\nAlthough the labor movement's attention to LGBTQ issues may seem like a contemporary phenomenon, such integration extends back to the early twentieth century. The late historian Allan Bérubé traversed North America, teaching activists about the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union , which by the early 1930s was an increasingly racially desegregated union with both communist ties and a gay-friendly culture. As the gay and lesbian rights movement gradually garnered national attention throughout the mid-century , independent queer labor organizations and caucuses within existing union locals were formed - but not without a struggle. The independent New York-based Gay Teachers Association, for example, spent several years pressuring the United Federation of Teachers to simply advertise their existence to the membership. By the 1980s, workers in publishing - among them employees at the Village Voice - as well as workers in government, food services, retail, and education were organizing caucuses within their locals and fighting successfully for antidiscrimination protections, HIV/AIDS education trainings, and domestic partner benefits. Recognizing the growing importance of queer workers' needs within the labor movement, the AFL-CIO created Pride at Work in 1998, which now functions alongside other AFL-CIO constituency groups, including the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists.\n\nFor decades, queer-sympathetic workers' organizations have thwarted the religious right's dual assault on minority rights and labor power. Throughout the 1970s, the nascent religious right was orchestrated by those like Christian political strategist Paul Weyrich and industrial leaders in oil, alcohol, and aluminum manufacturing. This coalition aimed to convince Christian blue-collar voters that the Democratic Party's New Deal and Great Society social and economic reforms had undermined so-called traditional conceptions of morality and liberty. Searching for a scapegoat, the religious right settled on the gay and lesbian movement, decrying its early civil rights victories as a sign of the country's cultural decay (other targets included desegregation policies and abortion rights ). In 1977, the ominously named \"Save Our Children Inc.\" succeeded in overturning a Miami-Dade County antidiscrimination ordinance, thus inaugurating the religious right's antiqueer crusade.\n\nInspired by this victory, California state senator John Briggs - an infamously anti-labor lawmaker - introduced Proposition 6 , a 1978 ballot initiative that would have banned queer people from teaching in public schools. The Briggs Initiative spurred gay and lesbian workers to action, forming groups like the Workers Conference to Defeat the Briggs Initiative, which brought together rank-and-file members of the AFT in California as well as the UAW, the USW, the Teamsters, the Culinary Workers Union, and the American Postal Workers Union. Eventually, regional labor groups, including California's AFL-CIO council, the San Francisco Labor Council, and the California Teachers Association joined the fight. This coalition of queer union members, trade union leaders, and advocacy groups defeated the Briggs Initiative, which they perceived as an attack not just on queer workers but also on public sector workers more broadly.\n\nUnions made a similar difference in defeating conservative groups in the 1990s. Clashes over queer rights erupted in once-prosperous Pacific Northwestern towns, devastated by the decline of lumber and other major industries. Conflicts over antidiscrimination laws were catalyzed when cosmopolitan middle- and upper-class families emigrated to these towns from cities like Seattle and San Francisco. The liberal cultural values of these wealthier transplants were easily conflated with the adverse effect that their homeownership had on the property taxes and rents of poorer longtime residents. Opportunistic conservative politicians made quick use of metastasizing resentments, sparking outrage over multicultural school curriculums and antidiscrimination ordinances. In what has been erroneously termed a \"culture war\" by some, attention was deflected from the economic roots of class conflict, particularly declining union job prospects in the lumber industry. When state ballot initiatives preempting local antidiscrimination ordinances began to pop up around the region, union density played a significant role in voter outcomes. In right-to-work Colorado, progressive groups did not prevail. But in Oregon, workers led by Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 503 contributed to the defeat of a 1992 antigay initiative.\n\nOrganized labor continues to play a crucial role in combatting state-level assaults on LGBTQ rights. Just as John Briggs forged an anti-labor agenda with a ban on queer public-school teachers, Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis has demonized queer and queer-friendly public-school teachers while undermining the state's public sector unions. The DeSantis agenda has been characterized by its aggressive policing of public-school curriculums and library holdings, particularly materials dealing with sex education and LGBTQ and civil rights history. While Florida's Parental Rights in Education Act (popularly known as \"Don't Say Gay\") immediately became national news, less coverage has been devoted to the governor's support for a \"paycheck protection act.\" The latter prohibits employers from taking union dues directly out of members' paychecks and outright eliminates public sector unions that fall below 60 percent membership. Notably, unions representing police officers, firefighters, and correctional and probation officers - that is, unions that tend to endorse Republican Party officials - are exempt from the law .\n\nDeSantis ally Christopher Rufo has spelled out the overall strategy quite clearly. In Rufo's words, the goal of anti-LGBTQ legislation and the foreboding rhetoric of \"grooming\" schoolteachers is designed to create \"universal public school distrust.\" If voters can be convinced that unionized teachers and public schools threaten childhood innocence, public education and progressive unions alike can be more effectively dismantled . Recognizing the existential threat posed by the DeSantis administration, Florida's unions have pushed back against both anti-LGBTQ curriculum policies and laws that weaken public sector unions. At its 2023 annual gathering, National Education Association delegates devised a plan to address anti-LGBTQ bills and to protect queer teachers and students in states like Florida.\n\nIt is true that many US corporations have offered inclusive benefits and protections to queer white-collar workers for decades, long before many unions extended similar benefits. Businesses have also pressured governments to expand civil rights laws. For example, 125 major US companies organized as the Business Coalition for Workplace Fairness advocated for national civil rights legislation over two decades ago. Occasionally, those corporations have even threatened to withhold investments from cities and states that oppose LGBTQ rights.\n\nHowever, the limits of corporate benevolence for LGBTQ workers further underscore the advantages of a labor-backed progressive response. Not long ago, there remained some hope for the power of corporate-induced boycotts. North Carolina's Republican governor Pat McCrory lost his 2016 reelection bid just months after signing an antitrans bathroom bill, which had led several large employers to cancel business expansions in the state. Fearing economic backlash from activist CEOs and chambers of commerce, governors became cautious about signing legislation that excluded trans athletes from competition or banned gender-affirming care. Pointing to the bottom line, companies stressed the business advantages of LGBTQ diversity, noting queer employees' alleged aptitude for pursuing untapped consumer markets. Suddenly, none of that seems to matter. Hundreds of antitrans bills have been filed since 2021 and dozens have been passed.\n\nIt appears that , once antitrans policies spread beyond a few conservative states, the threat of corporate-led boycotts receded. After all, corporations tend to seek out favorable \" business climates ,\" which are plentiful among right-wing states that have weaker unions and lower taxes. Defending its decision to move operations to Tennessee despite the state's recently enacted anti-LGBTQ legislation, Oracle Software executives reasoned that the company itself would create an inclusive environment for state residents. While the company's policies might benefit a tiny portion of the state's workforce covered by Oracle's in-house diversity, inclusion, and equity policies, the vast majority of Tennesseans stand to gain nothing.\n\nOverall, the pursuit of profits has stalled corporate America's capacity and motivation to thwart anti-LGBTQ policies. Again, Starbucks offers an example. As baristas have challenged corporate leadership, the supposedly trans-inclusive coffee chain has ominously suggested that unionized workers jeopardize the company's much-lauded gender-affirming health care coverage. In this sense, trans issues today are used by some nominally progressive corporations against worker solidarity much in the way bosses have historically stoked racial animosity among workers.\n\nWhether one looks at history, demographics, or legal developments, it is clear that the fates of most queer people in this country are entwined with those of working and poor people more generally. Two points are worth reemphasizing here: this entwined fate stems from the fact that most queer people are working class or poor, and queer people have historically made excellent scapegoats for those seeking to raze social welfare and organized labor. On the other hand, the category \"LGBTQ\" is heterogenous in the manner that all identity-based population categories are. LGBTQ people run the gamut, meaning that a fraction of queer people are corporate executives, small-business owners, or defined by some other variant of capitalist, managerial, or petit-bourgeois status. In addition, national queer advocacy organizations are dependent on donations from businesses and wealthy queer people and their allies, which usually delimits those organizations' agendas to a narrow support for civil rights. While these truths are perhaps easily comprehended on their own, together they can create enormous contradictions for those who would pursue a queer working-class politics.\n\nAlthough often celebrated as an early moment of queer-worker solidarity, the Coors boycott offers a cautionary tale. In 1974, Teamsters leader Allan Baird led Northern Californian unionized beer distributors in struggle against a recalcitrant Coors management that refused to expand contract benefits. Sensing a possible collaboration, Baird brought Bay Area gay activists into the union's boycott activities by highlighting Coors's right-wing political advocacy - Joseph Coors provided seed money to the anti-LGBTQ Heritage Foundation - and discriminatory workplace practices. This collaboration proved to be symbiotic: the boycott created relationships that spurred unions to implement antidiscrimination contract protections and persuaded gay rights activists to organize against antilabor ballot measures.\n\nA few years into Baird's alliance-building project, it became apparent that queer advocates could be wooed just as easily by corporate \"allies.\" Realizing the threat that displeased gay consumers posed to the company's bottom line, Coors quickly pivoted, adding sexual orientation protections to its companywide antidiscrimination policy in 1978 and donating to AIDS charities throughout the 1980s. By the end of the 1990s, Coors had implemented domestic partner benefits, contributed large donations to queer nonprofits , and hired gay liaisons, including future vice president Dick Cheney's daughter, Mary Cheney, to launder its image. To the Teamsters' dismay, Coors once again flows from queer bars' beer taps. Ironically, what made the Coors boycott so successful - that is, the fact that a company's policies toward queer people could mobilize consumers to action - is what broke it apart.\n\nInstead of conceiving of LGBTQ issues as those particular to a small fraction of workers, we might think creatively about organized labor's capacities for promoting both equal treatment and general welfare. In some instances, union advocacy for public-goods spending could benefit many trans people even more than trans-specific reforms do. Take the example of public transit and sex markers in Philadelphia. From 1981 through 2013, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority's (SEPTA) monthly transit passes were marked with a male or female sticker, which caused problems for trans women like Philadelphia-based trans rights advocate Charlene Arcila. Whether Arcila presented an M-stamped or F-stamped pass, she was turned away by bus drivers who were tasked with interpreting her sex. Importantly, SEPTA's motivation for implementing sex markers had nothing to do with trans-identified riders. The sex designations were an anti-fraud measure, designed to prevent revenue loss by stopping married (cis) men and women from sharing passes. For decades , SEPTA workers organized in the Transport Workers Union have rallied for increased transit spending and against efforts to privatize transit lines. Additional funding could reduce the pressure to squeeze every last cent out of riders.\n\nInstead of additional funding, however, a trans-specific reform was implemented that did less for many trans Philadelphians than a public-goods approach might have. SEPTA's 2013 move to scrap its sex markers was fundamentally disconnected from any investment in its infrastructure as evidenced by the system's current financial crisis . So, trans riders are no longer subject to humiliating onboarding experiences, but all riders - trans and cis alike - now suffer under the collapse of the poorest big city in America 's public transit system.\n\nThe current state of Starbucks unionization offers a concluding perspective on queer working-class politics. The thrill of watching unionized coffee shops rapidly dot a map of the United States has been replaced by the pain of witnessing the setbacks and stalemates Starbucks workers have endured. According to journalist Steven Greenhouse , Starbucks executives have overwhelmed the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) by violating so many labor laws that the board simply cannot keep up with its caseload (penalties for breaking labor law are often puny). This all comes at a time when the board itself is headed by a progressive general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo , whose pro-worker agenda has been impeded by the NLRB's budgetary crisis. That crisis has sapped the agency's ability to run union elections effectively and to protect unionizing workers who have been unlawfully terminated. Workers could soon meet an even greater challenge as the Supreme Court hears cases concerning the constitutionality of the NLRB.\n\nIn this daunting moment, it is no wonder that many labor advocates find hope in young, diverse workers organizing behemoths from Starbucks to Amazon. However, those who are inspired by today's queer working-class politics would benefit from thinking structurally and historically about the opportunities and pitfalls that such a politics entails. The slogan \"an injury to one is an injury to all\" directs one's attention not just to the particulars of one group of workers' hardships but also to the fundamental class interests shared by LGBTQ and all other workers.\n\nJoanna Wuest is an assistant professor of politics at Mount Holyoke College and an incoming assistant professor of women's, gender, and sexuality studies at Stony Brook University (SUNY).

Now activists are organizing radical Pride marches to show that Pride is a protest, not just a party.\n\nThe Long Beach Police Department participates in the Long Beach 40th Annual Parade event on August 6, 2023 in Long Beach, California.

For the first time, Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, would attend alongside the thousands in the parade, with Black Lives Matter (BLM) as guests of honor. But BLM was angry, after years of seeing Blockorama - the only Pride month event for black queers - moved further from the march, even as police were welcomed at the parade. Objecting to their presence, BLM blocked the march for thirty minutes.\n\nThis cop involvement especially mattered because Toronto Pride had first begun in 1981 as a protest against a police raid on four bathhouses in the city. That February, officers armed with crowbars and sledgehammers had arrested over two hundred fifty gay men in \"Operation Soap.\" Black activists who participated in that first Pride were back in 2016 and were joined by both younger protesters and indigenous drummers in bringing the march to a halt. Faced with the protests, Toronto Pride's executive director, Mathieu Chantelois, signed off on BLM's demand not to allow the police to return in future - but then backtracked, claiming he had only done so to get the march moving again. After widespread criticism, Chantelois resigned; next time around, the police float was noticeably absent.\n\nToronto is hardly the only city where police have joined Pride. In a similar action in Britain last year, activists from Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants (LGSM) broke through the barriers at London's Pride march to stage a die-in. Holding funeral bouquets and draped in pink veils, they held up the march for twenty-three minutes - one minute for each person that had died in police custody since 2020 - to protest metropolitan police officers joining the parade.\n\nOne participant in the protest, Ink, explains, \"I watched friends cheer on the police at London Pride, despite understanding their role in oppressing queer people. In the wake of Black Lives Matter, the presence of police at pride became especially unconscionable and we felt it was important to reclaim Pride as a space hostile to the presence of the state and its violence.\"\n\nCriticisms of mainstream Pride, made by queer participants like Ink who would prefer to see it returned to its roots in protest, have been bubbling under the surface for years. In 2001 , Sylvia Rivera, a transgender activist who cofounded Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries alongside fellow Stonewall riots veteran Marsha P. Johnson, called modern Pride \"a big smokescreen.\" Baulking at how corporations use Pride to present themselves as virtuous - what we now call pinkwashing - she mourned a modern Pride that only believes in the \"almighty dollar,\" stating \"this is no longer my Pride.\"\n\nGay rights have progressed, but activists still debate assimilation versus liberation - whether queer people should adapt to the norms and values of wider society or else change society to one that doesn't privilege certain queer identities. Indeed, as Pride events have become mainstream, so too have certain versions of fitting in. Equality for some LGBTQ people means the freedom to marry, adopt kids, or even to get a well-paying job at an arms company with the same rights and protections as a straight colleague. That is lauded as progress whilst queers who can't - or don't want to - obey such norms continue to be marginalized.\n\nCorporations and the state use diversity and inclusivity in this way to wash themselves clean. At this year's Pride in Washington DC, arms industry giant Lockheed Martin drove a sponsored float through the city, much to the disgust of socialists and queer activists. This year in London, big oil was the target of protests as activists picketed the annual LGBTQ awards sponsored by BP, Shell, BNP Paribas, HSBC, Santander, Amazon, and Nestlé. Days later, this July 1, five activists from Just Stop Oil were arrested after jumping in front of BP's float and halting London's Pride parade, reminding onlookers that there will be no pride on a dead planet.\n\nIn recent years, Reclaim Pride groups sharing these criticisms of contemporary Pride celebrations have sprung up from Thessaloniki, Greece, to Oslo, Norway, and New York City. Some groups have tried to reclaim Pride by protesting, as BLM and LGSM have. Others have chosen opt out and create their own celebrations that stay true to Pride's roots in a riot against police violence.\n\nIn 2019, as preparations were underway for the fiftieth anniversary of the Stonewall riots, activists in New York City organized an opposing Queer Liberation March instead. The official parade ran for twelve hours because there were so many corporate floats, notes Paul Nocera from New York's Reclaim Pride Coalition. He told Jacobin how activists had become disillusioned with Pride - and the way acceptable queerness was policed by letting in some people and shutting out others: \"The barricades don't just contain people, they set up an entertainment dynamic where the people on one side are the audience and the people on the inside are the entertainment. This is a march, we're not the entertainment,\" he explains. \"It really gives so much control over the message, the method, the anger. All the aspects of what we're trying to do in our march get squashed . . . the cops want to have a march that doesn't mean anything, that doesn't make any complaints.\"\n\nFor activists in New York, it was important to have a protest with radical politics to mark the anniversary. Each year since, they have held one on the same day as New York's official Pride parade. Sometimes - Nocera told me - he gets disillusioned and exhausted, \"It's really tough because we do this every year and I don't see anything changing - so what the hell are we marching for? But I was reminded that this is the moment when the community gathers together and link arms. Whether were faced outward and yelling and screaming or faced inward and having a teary eye, it's still the gathering of the community, and that's hugely important,\" says Nocera. \"To not have a march, to not have any radical gathering of people and spirits, that would be a huge loss.\"\n\nOver in England, Sheffield Radical Pride (SRP) took things a step further and organized the city's only Pride march this year, scheduled for July 22 to coincide with Tramlines music festival when tens of thousands descended on the city. In 2018, the previous organizers declared the event was a march of \"celebration, not protest.\" They banned political groups from taking part and demanded banners and placards be inspected for approval to avoid causing offense. This sparked outrage from many in the queer community, who criticized Pride Sheffield for conveniently forgetting the previous fifty years of history. Since the pandemic, Sheffield has struggled to organize a Pride and 2023 marks the third year the council has not funded one.\n\nOver winter, a group of young, largely transgender activists started conversations about how their organizing could reach the wider city and decided they should step in and organize this year's event. They want to turn Pride back into a street movement they hope those at the Stonewall Inn in 1969 could be proud of. A month before the march, SRP announced cops and corporations were banned. \"It's exciting and it's fun . . . I'm glad that we have the opportunity to make Sheffield's only Pride one that is genuinely radical and one that is free of corporations and cops,\" says Alex, one of the organizers.\n\nThis year, the theme for the Queer Liberation March in New York was \"Trans + Queer; Forever Here!\" Nocera says trans people have been at the forefront of organizing the march for years, but they felt in 2023 trans liberation needed special attention. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is currently tracking 491 anti-LGBTQ bills in the United States, and a large number of those attack trans people in various ways such as limiting their access to health care and preventing social transition or education about trans people in schools. Some have already passed laws attempting to limit drag performances and prevent cross-dressing. In New York, where trans people led the Stonewall riots, Nocera says the focus of this year's march has given a sense of \"continuing the legacy of Stonewall which is protest, resistance and resilience as a community.\"\n\nOrganizers of Sheffield's trans-led march have also seen the recent attacks on the trans and queer community from both far-right street mobilization and the UK government. One of the  recent attacks from the British state came from the Tories' so-called equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch. In April, she announced plans to change the legal definition of \"sex,\" which could see the trans community lose vital rights and protections.\n\nFor the trans community, pride has to be a protest - because pretending they can safely celebrate their identity simply isn't an option. Across the UK, grassroots Trans Pride marches have appeared, with the largest held annually in London. Another of their organizers, Matt, tells me that the vitriol targeted at trans people is the first step to revoking everyone's rights: \"This pushback and backlash against trans rights is a gateway to repealing more equalities and targeting more minorities. It's being done by some people in the name of feminism and women's rights but really, these people are partnering with fascists.\" He adds, \"Rights aren't this permanent thing once you've achieved them - they can also go away.\"\n\nIn making Sheffield Pride a protest, Matt and Alex hope honest conversations can be had about queer liberation and the challenges it faces: \"We're not putting on this façade about how everyone's super-accepting and how some company is going to sell you products and hire you and therefore homophobia is over,\" says Matt. \"We're not going to radicalize everyone who comes. But we can tell people how it is for queer people now and we can't be silenced through threats over funding or permissions.\"\n\nAs groups like Sheffield Radical Pride and the Reclaim Pride Coalition continue organizing marches, we can hope Pride is slowly returning to something Sylvia Rivera might recognize - and be proud of.\n\nZac Larkham is a politics and sociology student and activist at Sheffield Hallam University.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

The world we envision won't be achieved with more LGBTQ police officers.\n\nPolice officers at the 2015 Pride parade in San Francisco, CA. (Thomas Hawk / Flickr)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe participation of cops at Pride events has always been controversial. Now, in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the uprising that followed, more local Pride march planning boards are reexamining how they involve police. This year parade planners have chosen to ban police officers from marching in uniform in cities across the United States, including Philadelphia , New York City , and San Francisco - decisions that have led to heated debates within LGBTQ communities as well as pushback from politicians.\n\nIn San Francisco, police officers were initially told they could march in the city's Pride parades dressed in civilian clothing representing their department, just like any other work-based group, but that they had to ditch their official uniforms (and guns). Unsatisfied with the prospect of marching out of uniform, the police department announced that it would boycott the parade, and Mayor London Breed joined them. Breed's statement argued that Pride parade organizers were hypocrites: \"We can't say, 'We want more Black officers,' or 'We want more LGBTQ officers,' and then treat those officers with disrespect when they actually step up and serve.\" Within a couple weeks, San Francisco Pride buckled to the pressure and reversed their decision.\n\nPride events are often corporate-sponsored and watered down to begin with, which leads many on the queer left to write them off as lost causes. But the co-optation of Pride isn't inevitable and doesn't have to be accepted. The queer left should loudly and proudly reject the participation of armed and uniformed cops marching at Pride. The world we envision won't be achieved with more LGBTQ officers. We want to rethink the role of police in our society - and our own history and experiences teach us why.\n\nThe American LGBTQ rights movement has its origins in the struggle against criminalization and police violence. While well-off queer people tended to socialize and cruise in private homes and exclusive clubs in the twentieth century, working-class queers typically only had access to public places like bars and parks, leaving them much more vulnerable to police harassment. If harassment, brutality, and humiliation weren't punishment enough, LGBTQ people who were arrested could find their name printed in the local newspaper, a practice that often constituted a direct threat to their employment.\n\nPride celebrations mark the anniversary of the Stonewall Rebellion in New York, which is often credited with ushering in the era of LGBTQ liberation. On June 28, 1969, queer and trans people (drag queens and sex workers among them) fought back against arrests during an NYPD raid at Greenwich Village's Stonewall Inn, a Mafia-run gay bar where dancing was uniquely permitted. According to historian Martin Duberman in his definitive history Stonewall , the police were paid off $2,000 a week to allow its operation, but this raid was a surprise led by a different division. Police were routed in the riot, and word soon spread, and thousands of people demonstrated outside Stonewall for a second night. The first-ever Pride march took place a year later in New York City.\n\nThe Stonewall Rebellion is not the only example of LGBTQ people collectively resisting aggressive policing. A few years before, in 1966, trans women in San Francisco also rioted against police officers who were raiding Gene Compton's Cafeteria, a restaurant that served as a popular queer gathering spot. Also in San Francisco, after Dan White (a former cop himself) assassinated the city's gay supervisor, Harvey Milk, and Mayor George Moscone in 1978, it was the San Francisco Police Department who fundraised for White's \" Twinkie defense \" during the trial. White got off with the light conviction of manslaughter, igniting what became known as the White Night riots after protesters confronted police officers on the steps of city hall. Rioters burned cop cars, and in retaliation, officers invaded the Castro's gay bars and beat people on the street.\n\nThese were pivotal moments in the fight for LGBTQ civil rights. But for all our advances in the decades since, LGBTQ people remain the targets of pervasive overpolicing and mass incarceration. Queer people are six times more likely than our straight counterparts to be stopped by the police in public spaces. In 2013, a survey revealed that half of respondents who had been victims of anti-LGBTQ violence reported experiencing police misconduct, including unjustified arrest, use of excessive force, and entrapment.\n\nTransgender people endure especially harsh treatment: they're seven times more likely than cisgender people to be physically assaulted by the police, are frequently assumed to be sex workers, and are routinely mistreated by police, from verbal harassment to persistent misgendering. An anti-loitering law in New York has been so overexploited as a pretext to profile transgender people that it has been nicknamed the \" walking while trans \" ban. And we must remember that LGBTQ lives have been lost at the hands of police violence. It was only days after George Floyd's murder that Tony McDade, a black trans man with a history of mental illness, was shot by an officer who had turned off his body camera.\n\nPrison is a miserable place for anyone, and LGBTQ people are extra likely to end up behind bars and face high rates of abuse in prison. Nearly half of black transgender people are incarcerated during their lifetimes, and roughly one in five youth in juvenile facilities identify as LGBTQ. According to the National Center for Transgender Equality, \"Being LGBTQ in a U.S. jail or prison often means daily humiliation, physical and sexual abuse, and the fear that it will get worse if you complain.\"\n\nIn 2019, San Francisco's Pride parade was itself a site of police violence. Peaceful demonstrators who blocked the parade in protest of police participation were descended upon by officers who shoved, dragged, and arrested demonstrators. There were zero consequences for the officers involved. It wasn't until Chesa Boudin was elected as district attorney a year later that the charges against demonstrators were dropped .\n\nWe can all agree that there are queer cops, and well-meaning cops, who want to use their position to actually make our communities safer. But the institution of policing encourages so much widespread abuse that it overshadows those good intentions. As Alex Vitale writes in his book The End of Policing :\n\nModern policing is largely a war on the poor that does little to make people safer or communities stronger, and even when it does, this is accomplished through the most coercive forms of state power that destroy the lives of millions.\n\nThe overpolicing of LGBTQ communities is in part due to personal homophobia but also due to the fact that most queer and trans people are poor and/or working class - whether that is defined by income, job status, or education. More than a third of LGBTQ adults are struggling just to pay their bills. Young LGBTQ people, often facing rejection from their families, represent a shocking 40 percent of homeless youth. This pushes them toward \"criminalized behaviors such as drug sales, theft, or survival sex, which increase their risk of arrest and detainment.\"\n\nOf course, LGBTQ people suffer the consequences of crime too. But aggressive policing is a failed strategy to resolve the social problems that drive crime in the first place - and as the recent mass shooting in Uvalde grimly illustrates, neither can police be counted on to provide the safety we expect from them. A real war on crime would be, as John Clegg and Adaner Usmani write , \"equivalent to the task of building a large, redistributive welfare state that takes from the rich to give to the poor.\" This means building a fighting labor movement in this country, which would necessarily be arranged against police officers who break strikes (as seen on the recent Hunts Point Teamsters picket line) and suppress union organizing drives (as seen in the arrest of Amazon organizer Chris Smalls).\n\nThe fight over whether or not to allow uniformed police into Pride parades may seem to some like a purely symbolic one. But challenging the identitarian notion that queer cops represent progress is an important part of reclaiming the radical , transformative politics of queer liberation from what too often amounts to a single-issue movement devoted to winning inclusion into the very institutions that stand in the way of real justice. We don't need more queer cops. We need to build a whole new infrastructure of public safety that isn't rooted in punishment and violence.\n\nLuke Thibault is an organizer with Democratic Socialists of America's Medicare for All campaign.

Jacobin talked to two Grindr workers about their demands.\n\nThe LGBTQ social networking platform Grindr displays its banner outside of the New York Stock Exchange on November 18, 2022.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn Thursday, July 20, workers at Grindr, the popular and long-running LGBTQ dating app, announced that they were unionizing with the Communications Workers of America (CWA). A supermajority of Grindr workers has signed union cards, and they are asking the company to voluntarily recognize the new union, Grindr United.\n\nWorkers are seeking greater job security amid volatility in the tech industry, guarantees against being forced to return to the office, and representation on Grindr's board of directors, among other demands; worker-organizers also say that their union drive was in part motivated by revelations that their new CEO, George Arison, has expressed support for and donated to anti-LGBTQ politicians . Earlier this week, Jacobin 's Sara Wexler sat down with two Grindr United workers to discuss the unionization effort.\n\nWhat led to the decision to form a union?\n\nWe and so many of our colleagues really like our jobs and our user base and our company, and we want to make sure it's a sustainable workplace with sensible priorities. We've seen many good colleagues get fired or pushed out or leave due to various shenanigans; it doesn't have to be that way. We can form a union and talk about the issues and find sensible ways to get the work done and support each other.\n\nI love working at Grindr. It has a wonderful, vibrant queer culture that has built the workplace and the company to allow queer joy. We want to ensure that the things that we love about Grindr are enshrined in a contract that can't be unilaterally changed, and that allows us to strengthen the company as a whole and retain people who care about the mission.\n\nFor example, even before unionizing, we have access to some excellent benefits. We have access to trans-inclusive, gender-affirming funds that have been a lifeline for me and many of my colleagues. We have generous paid time off and a vibrant work culture. We want to make sure that stays for the long haul and isn't jettisoned in order to make a few more cents for the next quarterly report.\n\nWere there specific events or catalysts that inspired all of you, despite the positive things you've just discussed, to think that you need a union?\n\nWe have seen a lot of warning signs of impending danger, and we don't think it needs to be that way. At the same time, across the industry we're seeing lots of very antiworker trends, including rounds of layoffs and bad policies like return to office. Twitter had a hard-core pledge that employees had to recommit to a certain degree of loyalty and intensity, which we think does not respect workers as professional adults.\n\nWe're here because we love this community and these users and this product, and we want to keep building it. For example, if we did choose to only hire for in-office work in certain locations, then I don't want to be made into a second-class employee for not living in a top-ten US city. There are many reasons why workers live in different places - for family, for benefits, for lifestyle, if they want to enjoy the great outdoors more, all sorts of good reasons. I don't think anyone should be forcing employees into an office just to have butts in seats. I think that's very silly.\n\nWith these warning signs and things like loyalty pledges going on at places like Twitter, I don't want a culture of fear. I want a workplace where we're all respected as adults, we bring our A game, we have good days, and we have bad days. Sometimes I need to work a little less and let the team know, and other times I'm energized and can take on more tasks. That's something that you can do when you communicate, and when you're respected as a person by your bosses.\n\nThe last year was a big year for Grindr, especially with a lot of changes in the second half of the year. The company went public and brought in an entirely new C-suite. The people who had shepherded the company from what it was before to what it was at the end of last year were all gone.\n\nThere's a lot of overlap between the LGBTQ community and believing in the power of unions; we, the people who work at Grindr, are members of this community and allies who want to center the queer experience. Coming from disadvantaged communities that are systemically underrepresented means that we've had to find power in togetherness. It's not a surprise that we are all invested in doing this for one another, but also that our users seem really stoked about us doing it.\n\nWe want to do this because the protections that our new C-suite got in their contracts seem like things that we should all have. Our C-suite has contracts that guarantee them not having to go into an office, that guarantee severance, that guarantee remediation for problems. That's great for them - we should all have that.\n\nThe at-will employment standard that we have here, at least in New York and in many places, relies so much on building a culture of fear rather than a culture of trust. I work in trust and safety, and I really believe in what I do. I think that one of the best ways to build trust and safety within the workplace is to earn the trust of employees and to commit to the safety of the people that you work with. The union is a way we can do that for one another that will allow us to avoid a slide down into a culture of fear that sometimes happens at public companies.\n\nSo much of what we're asking for is stuff that we already have or that our bosses already have. I think it's a right and righteous fight.\n\nTo be queer is to question a heteronormative society and ask: Are there ways that we can do this better? Are there people who are being pushed down, the downtrodden, who need a hand up? We see this as a way to help center the queer experience. Part of that as well is found family and explicitly looking out for each other, because we recognize - in an individualist, consumerist society - how fragile individuals and families are, and how fragile our support networks are. Those are things we have to build and implement to protect each other.\n\nIt sounds like the push to go back into the office and a disconnect between new corporate leadership and the workers were major factors in deciding to unionize.\n\nThere is a big disconnect on our interests. We haven't heard any explicit return-to-office orders, but we don't want to be surprised with bad news. We see warning signs. We don't want to be caught flat-footed with a change that harms us and our colleagues.\n\nUnionizing is the right thing to do in the best of circumstances. It's the way that we can make sure that we have safety and security and guarantees. It should be in the best interest of all sides, because unionizing means the company only has to do one contract instead of figuring it out individually with everybody.\n\nI'm certainly not naive enough to think that we are in the best of circumstances. We're in a volatile time for our industry. We're in a volatile time for the globe. We're in a really volatile time for queer people - not just around the world, but in the United States, with so many anti-trans bills in particular being brought in state legislatures around the country.\n\nI am lucky enough to live in New York, but I am a trans person and would very much like to not live in a transphobic hellscape that so many people in power seem to be pushing us toward. I can't change laws, but I can help the people that I work with, especially the more vulnerable people among us, to find a sense of security and safety at work. Sometimes it feels like not enough, but it is what we can do for one another at the moment.\n\nWhat are some demands you hope to win with the union?\n\nSo much of what we're asking for are things we already have that we just want in a contract. We want it guaranteed that we can work from anywhere. Most of us, especially anyone who was hired after 2020, were hired as remote employees. Remote work is humane: it lets us take care of our families and our pets and saves us hours of travel each day. We want that in a contract. Our CEO has that in his contract; he has in his contract that he can't be made to go into an office. That's great - love that for him. We would also like that.\n\nWe want guaranteed severance, if we are let go for whatever reason. Our CEO has that in his contract - love that for him. We would also like that.\n\nWe have excellent health care at the moment. That includes gender-affirmation benefits. That's something that keeps Grindr the wonderful queer place that it is and supports our employees in ways that are far too rare in the corporate workforce. We would like that in a contract so that it can't be taken away.\n\nProbably the biggest swing we're asking for is that - as members of this community, as the workers who build this app - we would like to elect an employee to sit on the board of directors. We are in the muck of Grindr day after day. We believe that our point of view should be represented at the highest level of this company, which is the board. I am hopeful that the board would welcome an employee of Grindr. So much of what they're deciding has to do with the day-to-day lives of employees, and I'm very hopeful that they would want our perspective in the room.\n\nSo much of what we're asking for is, as Quinn said, what we already have - and basic respect as professional adults. We'd like to keep the great company culture we have now, which is a little silly; we have a queer sense of humor.\n\nWe're also fiercely protective of our users and community. We'd love to have more equity and intersectionality, reflecting the world of our users. We have so many users who speak Spanish. We want to reflect users who have disabilities and make sure it's not only a legal requirement to make the app accessible for them. More importantly, it's the moral and just requirement to make it accessible for them.\n\nWhen did the union organizing start, and what has the process been like since?\n\nThe organizing started in late December. Phone calls started on December 29, just before the New Year - by calling the people who I had come to lean on at work as friends, colleagues, and allies one by one, to start feeling out whether people would be interested in the union. There was a network effect where those people had other people who they knew and relied on as colleagues and friends, and those people had other people they relied on as colleagues and friends.\n\nWe had talked about unionizing before; it had come up earlier in small groups in 2022 as something that we should maybe look into, and as these things tend to do, it fizzled. It's been a wild few months. We found that we had supermajority support among our workers. An overwhelming supermajority of people want this - they want a contract with our bosses.\n\nOver the spring and summer, we've seen various events happen, and different people have left for different reasons. All of these warning signs have added up and culminated in this supermajority. A lot of people realized, my job is more at risk without a union, and the viability and the sustainability of my workplace will be much more assured with a union. And then they came on board.\n\nCould you say more about these warning signs you mentioned?\n\nI think the biggest warning sign is a disregard for the community and for the workers. There was public reporting of our incoming CEO's political donations. It told us that the selection process for the new management might not have been aligned with our workforce.\n\nThere was reporting about our current CEO, George Arison - about politicians he supported verbally and financially who are really at odds with what most of the Grindr workforce cares deeply about. I think one thing that we're all thrilled about is that this is our chance to maintain and build a platform that is safe for the whole queer community, and that is trans-inclusive both as a workplace and as a platform.\n\nWhat George chooses to do with his money is his right. I don't believe that I would've made the same decisions with what to do with my money or vocal support. What we can do now as people at this company who are working with him is to build each other up - to strengthen each other and to make sure that we're all in this together - so that we can focus more on building a great place for all people under the LGBTQ umbrella, and focus less on worrying about what George did with his money.\n\nSo the new CEO was donating to homophobic politicians, and that played a role in organizing and motivating people?\n\nYes.\n\nI would be very surprised if it didn't.\n\nHow many people have signed union cards so far, and how many people will the union represent?\n\nThere are about a hundred of us in the bargaining unit. Significantly more than two-thirds of the bargaining unit have signed on to support, including people who haven't actually started yet. We wanted to make sure to have a supermajority that covered where the bargaining unit would be.\n\nWe went past the support that we needed; we don't want this to be a 50-percent-plus-one victory. We'll take that over the alternative, but we want to show that this is something that the vast majority of people at Grindr want - to sit down with management as equals and make a contract that cannot be unilaterally changed based on the whims of the stock market. One of the very silly things about the current situation is that so much of this wonderful community that's been built to celebrate queer joy could be wiped out because of the whims of people making trades on Wall Street.\n\nI'm going to be kind and say it's a very silly system, but the way that we can most protect one another is to have a contract that is locked in regardless of what people on Wall Street do, that keeps us safe and secure in our roles.\n\nAnother thing that a contract would do is allow people to always speak up for what's right and not just what's expedient. So much of what can be asked of workers at companies that are striving only to serve the bottom line is that they do what's expedient and not what's right. That's not what people who work at Grindr are interested in doing. If we wanted to work on what's expedient and not what's right, we probably wouldn't work here. So many of us want to be able to keep fighting for what's right and not just what's easiest.\n\nHow has Grindr responded so far?\n\nIt hasn't. It has been absolute radio silence from management since we announced. That's not just about the union; that's about literally everything. We have not heard from management since July 20.\n\nWhen was the card signing?\n\nCard signing began on Sunday, July 16; we crossed the supermajority threshold that we were aiming for on Thursday, July 20. The organizing committee sent a letter to management on Thursday afternoon requesting voluntary recognition, given that we have an overwhelming majority of workers at Grindr who want this. It's Tuesday evening [July 25], and we have not heard a peep, and not just about the union - about literally anything.\n\nHow do you feel about the union effort so far? What are the energy levels among workers?\n\nI feel more secure in my job and more able to focus on work now that I'm not afraid of getting disappeared suddenly. That's been fantastic. It's wonderful to see so many colleagues supporting this and raising their voices to say, this is what we want. We would like to have a bargaining unit. It's so joyous to see the public response of regular users, famous users, and other unions and organizations who support us as well.\n\nIt would be so much easier to not do this; to each be independent, to each be individual, to worry about ourselves. Forming a union is a radical act of kindness and love for yourself and your colleagues. It is potentially putting yourself slightly more at risk to better the conditions for everyone. I am so moved that so many of my colleagues have found it within themselves to do that for themselves and one another. It's everything I love about Grindr, because we're doing it with a sense of humor, with queer joy, and with candor. It's not only the best thing I've ever done at work - this is the best thing I've ever done in my life.\n\nHow do you imagine a union changing your workplace once you win it?\n\nWe're hopeful that there will be less fear - with all the layoffs in our industry, and with changes that have happened within our own workforce - of people just disappearing and us not being told about what happened to them or why. There has been a culture of fear built at Grindr; I think it's probably not an accident.\n\nWe want guaranteed performance-improvement plans before we're just summarily let go - we have to be told whether we're meeting our goals, which means that there have to be goals set. If we can get this in a contract, where we are able to know if we're not meeting expectations and correct those before we're just suddenly kicked off one day, then there will be so much less fear. Nobody does their best work when they're afraid.\n\nHave you learned anything from this organizing experience?\n\nI've learned you don't need to hate your job to want a union. You can love your job, and that's a fantastic reason to organize.\n\nMassively cosigned.\n\nI've also learned that the American workforce, and especially the tech industry, is a little misinformed about what unions are and how they work, for the most part.\n\nIt's almost like that's been done on purpose. [Laugh.] Right?\n\nSo many others have led the way and provided the torch light for us - such as employees at Sega and Activision and Trevor Project and Alphabet and Citizen and Apple - and we're hopeful that we can help break stigma, provide education, and showcase the benefits.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nWe remain hopeful that Grindr management is going to voluntarily recognize our union . A clear supermajority of workers want this. The faster we get to the bargaining table, the faster we can get to work.\n\nJack Alto is a staff software engineer at Grindr.\n\nQuinn McGee is a trust and safety product manager at Grindr.\n\nSara Wexler is a member of UAW Local 2710 and a PhD student at Columbia University.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But whether it does or doesn't, those workers need unions and stronger labor laws to fight discrimination.\n\nProtesters block the street in front of the Supreme Court as it hears arguments on gender identity and workplace discrimination on October 8, 2019 in Washington, DC.\nTasos Katopodis / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe Supreme Court is hearing argument to rule on whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employers from discriminating against workers on the basis of sex, ought to extend to sexual orientation and gender identity as well.\n\nThe swing vote looks to be Neil Gorsuch, nominated to the court by Donald Trump. Gorsuch's comments illustrate that he's receptive to the plaintiffs' arguments: when a person is discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, \"Isn't sex also in play here, and isn't that enough?\" he asked .\n\nQuite right. The basis of discrimination against, for example, a lesbian worker is precisely that she is a woman who dates women. Sex is at the heart of the objection; the idea that women ought to date men instead is the entire rationale. If it's already unconstitutional for an employer to discriminate against a worker because she doesn't conform to the behavior expected of her based on her sex - for example, that she dress a certain way - then the law ought to extend to other instances of sex-related nonconformity as well.\n\nBut Gorsuch's vote hangs in the balance. He has also said the court should \"take into consideration the massive social upheaval that would be entailed\" if it were to rule in favor of the plaintiffs. His political commitments may eclipse his otherwise sound interpretation of the law. If he votes with his politics and not his logic, then the plaintiffs will likely lose the case. Since many lower courts have already ruled that sex discrimination statutes apply to sexual orientation and gender identity as well, the Supreme Court ruling could form a basis for undoing many of the legal gains won by LGBTQ people in recent years.\n\nAll of that said, the fate of gay and transgender workers does not actually hinge on the Supreme Court's ruling. While strong legal protections against discrimination are a necessary backstop, they aren't foolproof solutions to the problem.\n\nThink about it: the original Title VII was passed in 1964, applying not just to sex but to race, religion, and national origin. Countless women, people of color, religious minorities, and immigrants have faced discrimination in their workplaces in the fifty-five years since.\n\nThe fight against discrimination in the workplace will not be won through the courts alone. In order for workers to really stand up to discrimination en masse , they need more rights at work in general.\n\nA union is the most powerful tool at a worker's disposal. Employees who lack unions face discrimination all the time , and even when it's demonstrably against the law, companies know that nonunionized workers are unlikely to muster the time, courage, or money to file a lawsuit. Companies can afford expensive lawyers, and have the power to make life hell for anyone who complains.\n\nAdd to this the fact that more and more companies are adding mandatory arbitration clauses into their employee contracts, which means that workers can't actually sue their employers in a courtroom at all. All told, it's tremendously difficult for an individual worker to take a powerful corporation to task for discrimination.\n\nBut union contracts are themselves legally binding. Most union contracts contain strong nondiscrimination provisions, and when an employer violates the contract in any way, the union has the ability to push back. This is true even in cases where the law hasn't yet caught up: for example, in thirty-three states there are currently no legal protections against anti-transgender discrimination. In those states, strong union contracts are the only line of defense that transgender workers have against the whims and prejudices of bosses.\n\nIn order to protect LGBTQ workers, we therefore need to seriously expand collective bargaining rights. This will require an overhaul of labor law of the kind proposed by Democratic Party presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, whose Workplace Democracy Plan aims to clear the obstacles in labor's path and double union membership in four years. The reforms themselves don't immediately appear tailor-made to address anti-LGBTQ discrimination on the page, but they'll go a long way toward helping workers both enforce the law and secure protection where the law fails them.\n\nOne of the strongest features of Sanders's Workplace Democracy Plan - and something it contains that no other contender has proposed, including progressive opponent Elizabeth Warren - is ending at-will employment and instituting \"just cause\" instead. At-will employment refers to the system where a boss can fire a worker for any reason they wish.\n\nIt's a convenient workaround for prejudiced bosses, even in states where nondiscrimination laws are on the books. They can simply declare a worker \"not a good cultural fit\" or some other vague justification and fire them on the spot. It's up to the worker, then, to prove discrimination - but who has time for that when you're scrambling for another job?\n\nThe opposite of at-will is just cause , which means employers need to demonstrate that they have a reason for firing someone that's related to job performance. It's a crucial step in protecting all workers from discrimination; the fact that the at-will employment regime has persisted for decades is one of the main reasons why so many people are still fired in a discriminatory fashion - even though Title VII forbids it. The just cause proposal floated by Sanders therefore must be part of any serious fight for LGBTQ rights in the workplace.\n\nWhatever happens in the Supreme Court , the fight is far from over - for LGBTQ people, but also for women, people of color, immigrants, religious minorities, and every worker. Right now, the bosses hold almost all the cards. Nobody will truly be free from the threat of discrimination until workers hold them instead.\n\nMeagan Day is a staff writer at Jacobin .

He's a bad thinker and a bad Christian.\n\nMatt Walsh speaking during a rally against gender-affirming care in Nashville, Tennessee, in October 2022. (Seth Herald / AFP via  Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nReview of Church of Cowards: A Wake-Up Call to Complacent Christians (Regnery Gateway, 2020) and What is a Woman? (DW Books, 2020) by Matt Walsh\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche once wrote, \"Mystical explanations are considered deep. The truth is they are not even superficial.\" By that logic the work of Matt Walsh is so superficial it barely registers as two-dimensional.\n\nA media commentator for the Daily Wire , Walsh tackles big questions like the scientificity of a black mermaid and the fertility of sixteen-year-old girls. But Walsh has become most well-known for the relentless bile he directs at the LGBTQ movement, particularly in his widely cited documentary What is a Woman? and its sister book .\n\nWhile the competition has become stiff, Walsh's truly obsessive fixation on what people do with their genitals has made him the US right's homophobe and transphobe in chief. And he pairs this bizarre preoccupation with a crusading right-wing Christianity, on full display in Church of Cowards: A Wake-Up Call to Complacent Christians .\n\nWalsh is an equal opportunity offender. When he isn't spending a curious amount of time talking about Disney movies , Walsh likes to chastise other conservative Christians for spending too much time on love and compassion. As he puts it in Church of Cowards, Walsh thinks the lamb of God would be better served by a little more hatred:\n\nI'd like to say a word about hatred. While our world proclaims easy virtues, it also condemns easy vices. Even the most limp-wristed and cowardly of pastors, the kind who will not denounce sin in any form, will still have no problem wagging his finger over the alleged evils of hatred. But hatred in and of itself is not evil. Hatred can in fact be a good thing, even a beautiful thing. We should bear in mind that indifference, not hatred, is love's opposite. Hatred is a part of love and a sign of its vitality.\n\nErgo vindicating Dante's wisdom that above the entrance to hell will be written: \"I too was created by the Might divine, the highest Wisdom and the primal Love.\" True to his word, Walsh devotes many pages to liturgizing on what he hates, which often seems to be most things and people in God's creation. A non-exhaustive list: any and all broad-minded forms of Christianity, excessive positivity, subpar evangelical films like the God's Not Dead series (no argument there), and \"cheap repentance.\" In Walsh's hands, Christianity becomes less the \"good news\" than pharisaical fire and brimstone.\n\nMuch of Walsh's animus appears motivated by his disdain for the perceived sentimentalism of liberal Christianity, which he derides as a capitulation to the secular world. His response to liberal Christian kitsch is near-Manichean Christian bloviation, where darkness and doom are omnipresent and only maximalist and masculinist discipline can deliver redemption. In one amusing chapter, Walsh chastises twenty-first-century Christians for ceasing to believe in the literal Devil, dropping in passages like:\n\nReligious leaders will attract special attention from Satan. If they are weak, he will topple them with ease. The higher on the ladder they have climbed, the farther they will fall. It takes an angel to make a demon, after all. That is another Christian doctrine that seems to be verified by experience.\n\nThis is the same guy, mind you, who excoriates leftists for not believing enough in empirical science and advancing irrational, ideologically driven views of the world.\n\nThe funniest thing about Walsh's Christianity is that I'm not convinced he takes it that intellectually seriously. For all the preening hectoring in Church of Cowards , so much of it operates at a theologically and historically surface level. Early in the book, he appeals to the nineteenth-century thinker Søren Kierkegaard to argue that \"there is no use telling a godless person to enjoy life\" because \"if there is nothing beyond this life, and no greater purpose behind it, then he is right.\"\n\nThis badly misconstrues the great Christian existentialist's account of \"spheres of life,\" which Kierkegaard divided into the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious. Kierkegaard recognized that all have their charms, and even their qualities - the title of his early Either/Or implies that we must choose which sphere to enter. At points Kierkegaard even stresses the superior intellectuality and grandeur of the aesthetic over the ethical sphere.\n\nKierkegaard would have also found bizarre Walsh's belief that a religious person should behave ethically according to socially conservative \"common sense.\" The whole point of his early masterpiece Fear and Trembling was that God's demands often appear as not only punishing, but profoundly contrary to common-sense ethical requirements. So much so that a person of faith will often feel compelled to \"teleologically suspend\" the ethical. Kierkegaard's position grew so radical near the end of his life that he took the notably anti-Walsh position of wanting a reduction in the number of Christians to save \"authentic\" Christianity from the polluting ties to \"Christendom\" - which deflated the highly individualistic demands of faith to the banalities of moralism.\n\nAnother, even lazier example of Walsh's historical fatuousness comes when he appeals to Charles Taylor's A Secular Age. Walsh whines about how \"Christ has been ripped from the center of human existence and sent out to the hinterlands.\" He refers to Taylor's notion of \"buffered selves\" by saying that secularization created a world where \"between ourselves and God lies a giant buffer that obscures the mystical light of divinity.\"\n\nIn fact, Taylor's argument about \"buffered selves\" refers to a process that was carried out in part through the spread of Christianity. Whereas premodern pagan societies made no strict demarcation between the human self and enchanted nature, Reformist and individualistic forms of Christianity turned the moral focus of people inward - creating a deeper sense of self at the cost of an increasing disenchantment with nature and one another. Secularization, far from being a process external to Christianity, emerged from tendencies within the Christian tradition itself.\n\nWalsh's pseudotheological scribblings are important to keep in mind when dissecting the pseudoscientific transphobia of What is a Woman?\n\nThere, in head-spinning fashion, he veers from insisting on the existence of demons and implying the literal truth of the Genesis myth to posturing as a disciple of scientific rationalism. Of course, since overwhelming majorities in the \"medical establishment, professional organizations, and psychiatrists\" don't support Walsh's regressive view of so-called \"gender confused people,\" he must dismiss them as \"ideologues\" and \"in it for the money.\" By contrast, anti-trans figures like Dr Miriam Grossman who are willing to give Walsh the time of day get to be \"certified child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist(s).\"\n\nThis vacillating respect for scientific and academic authority continues in his interpersonal evaluations. Walsh switches between posing as a calm rationalist, just asking questions to irrational \"trans ideologues,\" and calling his enemies \"poison\" and \"predators\" and \"pathetic little gutless cowards.\"\n\nThe reason for these about-faces is that Walsh's appeals to scientific rationalism are nothing more than rank opportunism. Walsh makes his underlying views very clear at the end of the book version of What is a Woman? :\n\nThe question 'what is a woman' is certainly about sex, gender, biology, social roles, and the like. Yet more profoundly, it is a question about identity. Where do we find our identity? How do we define ourselves? Is identity something we fulfill within the grand and ornate structure of nature, community, duties and responsibilities - rooted in words like father, mother, son, daughter, friend, or child of God? Or is identity something we define from within ourselves. Maybe happiness comes not from making the world affirm 'who we are,' but by becoming who we were created to be.\n\nTo Walsh, trans individuals and LGBTQ people broadly embody the decadent worship of personalized \"identity\" in modern society. Allowing individuals to express their inner sense of self through various \"experiments in living\" challenges his sense that there's a stable cosmic order where each thing has its ordained natural place and essential characteristics.\n\nThe political takeaway is that figures like Walsh think their imagined natural order is one to which we must subordinate ourselves, since the \"Promethean\" yearning to overcome it generates anarchic chaos. Walsh's entreaties map very cleanly onto a hierarchical and authoritarian worldview, where trans and queer individuals are to remain shut away so Walsh and his brethren have a safe space from fears of existential disintegration.\n\nMeanwhile, his rhetorical bombast papers over the contradictions cutting straight through his worldview. It's why surgery to remove cancer - as scientifically natural a phenomenon as one can imagine - is fine, but gender-affirming surgeries are some kind of metaphysical crime. The former doesn't trouble Walsh's metaphysical sensitivities through its (often-profound) reconfigurations of the human body to alleviate natural conditions like disease or harm, but gender-affirming surgery that often alleviates harm to trans individuals does.\n\nThe key question Walsh should have been asking isn't \"what is a woman?\" Given how frequently he admits to not understanding the science around trans identity or gender, those kinds of metaphysical questions aren't up his alley. Instead, the key question is whether individuals should be legally allowed to transition and have their choices respected. For adults the answer has to be yes. Adults should be given wide latitude to do as they wish with their body to the extent that it doesn't harm another person.\n\nAdding to this, we can ask whether it should be an ethical norm to not misgender people. Some, like Walsh, insist that they will refuse to call anyone by their identified gender since it deviates from (crudely conceived) biology. But as Ben Burgis points out , this is an absurd claim that doesn't even conform to already-existing social expectations. For instance, when someone describes their adopted child as \"my daughter,\" no one except Matt Walsh would take issue with it by saying \"she wasn't born that way and I'll never call her your daughter!\"\n\nFor youth, the question is more complicated, but also more pressing. Walsh often makes light of claims that trans youth will take their own lives without gender-affirming care or acceptance from their families, while ignoring the reams of evidence that suggest his opponents are right. His condescension is all the more disturbing since the transphobic rhetoric he peddles makes suicides more likely.\n\nThe best form of care for trans youth is a complex question that will continue to be debated. But Walsh and those like him only make it harder to investigate dispassionately with their shrill invective , straight out of the 1950s, about \"trans violence\" and pedophilic grooming.\n\nIn the end, Walsh's worldview is deeply contrary to the \"Christian\" philosophy it espouses. In fact, for all Walsh's anxieties about secularization, he perfectly embodies Nietzsche's observation about the worst tendencies of moralistic Christianity to provide a license to demand hatred through a perversion of the language of love. Believer or nonbeliever, I can think of nothing that would make Christianity less appealing.\n\nMatt McManus is a lecturer at the University of Michigan and the author of The Emergence of Postmodernity and the forthcoming The Political Right and Inequality .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Supreme Court to Decide Whether States Can Ban Anti-LGBTQ Conversion Therapy on Kids\n\nSupreme Court Police watch competing demonstrations over gender-affirming care for children last December. Allison Bailey/NurPhoto/AP\n\nIn what could foreshadow a major new onslaught against queer and trans children, the US Supreme Court announced on Monday that it will hear a case challenging a 2019 Colorado law forbidding licensed therapists from trying to turn LGBTQ kids straight and cisgender.\n\nThe court's decision to hear the case next fall is a major victory for practitioners of \"conversion therapy ,\" a term used colloquially to describe attempts to shift a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. Before the 1970s, when being gay was still considered a mental illness, conversion therapy was the standard treatment-sometimes involving \"aversion\" techniques like electric shocks or chemically induced nausea paired with images of gay porn. Today, conversion therapy mostly involves talk therapy, often between conservative religious clients and practitioners.\n\nStill, talk-based conversion therapy can cause immense harm to LGBTQ people's mental health, according to leading experts. The American Psychological Association has concluded that efforts to change peoples' sexual orientation lack \" sufficient bases in scientific principles \" and that people who have undergone such therapies are \"significantly more likely to experience suicidality and depression.\"\n\nThe same goes for therapies aimed at making trans people identify with the gender they were assigned at birth. In 2015, the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, part of the US Department of Health and Human Services, published a report concluding that \"none of the existing research supports the premise that mental or behavioral health interventions can alter gender identity or sexual orientation.\" Interventions aimed at a fixed outcome, such as gender conformity or heterosexual orientation \"are coercive, can be harmful, and should not be part of behavioral health treatment,\" the authors concluded. (Since President Donald Trump took office and ordered government websites stripped of information related to so-called \"gender ideology,\" the SAMHSA report has been taken down .)\n\n\"None of the existing research supports the premise that mental or behavioral health interventions can alter gender identity or sexual orientation,\" federal experts wrote in a now-deleted report.\n\nStates started banning conversion therapy on minors in 2012, as gay rights was achieving widespread acceptance and the scientific community increasingly recognized that efforts to change sexual orientation both didn't work and could cause harm. Today, according to the Movement Advancement Project , 23 states have passed laws to revoke licenses from mental health professionals practicing conversion therapy on queer and trans people under the age of 18, and more states have executive orders restricting the practice.\n\nBut as soon as those laws began to pass, conversion therapists began fighting back, filing at least 11 lawsuits in eight states from 2012 through 2023. Typically, those cases have argued that the restrictions on therapists' conversations with minors infringes on the therapists' First Amendment right to free speech.\n\nFederal appeals courts mostly haven't bought that argument, ruling that that states have the power to regulate medical treatment, even when that treatment consists entirely of spoken words. But in 2020, the 11th Circuit went the other way , overturning a local conversion therapy ban in Florida in response to a lawsuit by the former president of the Alliance for Therapeutic Choice and Scientific Integrity , the leading US advocacy group for licensed conversion therapists.\n\nDuring an ATCSI conference I attended in late 2023, presenters showed a video illustrating what their therapy technique, which they called \"mindfulness,\" looked like:\n\nA young adult client, played by an actor, sits nervously across from [counselor Joseph] Nicolosi Jr. in a room filled with books. Nicolosi Jr. asks him to describe his ideal sexually attractive man. The client responds that the man would be strong, confident, informal. \"I would definitely say a guy who's like, um, on the taller side,\" he says.\n\nThen, Nicolosi Jr. asks the client what he would change about himself: Shorter or taller? Stronger or weaker arms? More or less confident? He urges the client to compare himself to the imagined man, and the client says he feels inadequate. \"How do you feel about the fact that you feel that inferiority, weakness?\" Nicolosi Jr. asks.\n\n\"Sadness,\" the client says.\n\n\"Feel your sadness as you continue looking at that guy,\" Nicolosi Jr. urges. \"And as you hold them together right now, zero to 10, how strong is your sexual attraction toward him?\"\n\nAs my colleague Henry Carnell and I reported in that investigation last year, conversion therapists have seized on disputes over the treatment of trans youth-a controversy fomented by religious-right organizations and anti-LGBTQ fringe groups and exploited by Republican politicians -to argue that they should be allowed to encourage kids to not be trans. Accordingly, in recent years, conversion therapists' lawsuits have increasingly focused on trans people and gender identity, rather than gay people and sexual orientation.\n\nThat's the argument made by Kaley Chiles, the licensed counselor in Colorado who filed Chiles v. Salazar , the case the US Supreme Court has now agreed to hear. Conversion therapy bans \"silence counselors' ability to express views their clients seek on a topic of 'fierce public debate'-'how best to help minors with gender dysphoria,\"' Chiles' petition to the court argues.\n\nChiles is represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, the powerful religious-right law firm behind the most significant anti-LBGTQ Supreme Court cases of recent years. Targeting Colorado in particular, ADF has found great success using the First Amendment to chip away at the state's strong anti-discrimination protections for queer and trans people in the name of \"religious freedom.\" The court's conservative supermajority has repeatedly sided with ADF, deciding that First Amendment allows Christian cake-bakers and wedding - website designers to refuse service to LGBTQ people planning same-sex weddings.\n\nADF's argument on behalf of Chiles likewise centers on her religious beliefs-in this instance, her feelings about trans people. \"A practicing Christian, Chiles believes that people flourish when they live consistently with God's design, including their biological sex,\" her petition argues. \"Many of her clients seek her counsel precisely because they believe that their faith and their relationship with God establishes the foundation upon which to understand their identity and desires. But Colorado bans these consensual conversations based on the viewpoints [Chiles and her clients] express.\"\n\nLike all other conversion therapy bans, Colorado's ban applies only to licensed therapists, not to religious advisers like priests and pastors. (Of course, church-based conversion therapy can also cause immense harm, as Carnell reported .)\n\nAt least two Supreme Court justices are known to be friendly to the argument that conversion therapy for minors is protected by the First Amendment. Last year, when the court declined to take up a nearly identical case challenging a conversion therapy ban in Washington state, Justice Clarence Thomas issued a dissent , joined by Justice Samuel Alito, that described bans on conversion therapy for minors as \"viewpoint-based and content-based discrimination in its purest form.\"\n\n\"Although the Court declines to take this particular case, I have no doubt that the issue it presents will come before the Court again,\" Thomas wrote at the time. \"When it does, the Court should do what it should have done here . . . consider what the First Amendment requires.\" With arguments in Chiles v. Salazar expected to be scheduled for next fall, Thomas will soon get the chance he's been waiting for.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "What the \"Most Anti-LGBTQ\" Election in Decades Means for Trans People\n\nDaniel Knighton/Getty\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election, GOP consultants were fighting over strategy : Would going all-in on anti-trans messaging deliver then-President Donald Trump the suburbs in his race against former Vice President Joe Biden? Or should his campaign stay away from the issue, given widespread support among the electorate for LGBTQ rights like same-sex marriage? \"This might become a hot cultural issue, but it's not a thing yet,\" one Republican consultant told Politico in the summer of 2020. \"Right now, it's just an easy issue for the other side to attack us on. They will call us bigots.\"\n\nSo much has changed, as a network of conservative and religious-right groups coordinated to push hundreds of bills to wipe out trans youth health care, bar them from sports teams that match their gender identity, and censor discussion of LGBTQ issues in schools. With more than 129 anti-LGBTQ laws passed across the country in the last two years , GOP candidates now are betting that they've seeded enough anti-trans sentiment among voters to use transphobia as a motivating issue. It doesn't seem to matter to Republicans that trans issues still tend to rank last among voters' priorities: From August through early October, GOP candidates dropped $65 million on anti-trans advertising, according to a New York Times analysis. The hateful rhetoric has been deployed all the way down the ballot, in Senate races , statehouse contests , and state constitutional amendment campaigns.\n\nNow, as the presidential race draws to a close, Trump's campaign has made anti-trans ads the biggest focal point of its spending. The TV spots and social media posts spread falsehoods about medical care for trans youth, cast trans athletes as predators, and link support for trans people with support for ( nonexistent ) \"partial-birth abortions.\" Sports fans will recognize the constant refrain -\"Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\"-from game-day commercial breaks.\n\nNone of this bodes well for trans rights under either Trump or Harris, no matter what happens on Election Day, or in the weeks afterward. \"I've been calling this the most anti-LGBTQ election since 2004,\" says Sean Meloy, vice president of political programs at the LGBTQ+ Victory Fund, which works to elect queer and trans candidates. In 2004, George W. Bush used same-sex marriage as a wedge issue in his reelection campaign, betting it would drive conservatives to the polls. (As it turns out, right-wing voters were motivated by other priorities .) \"They're doing exactly the same thing now,\" Meloy says. \"Gay and lesbian people are understood and represented, and now they're trying to dehumanize and use trans people and their experiences to get votes.\"\n\nTrump has pledged to defund gender-affirming care-and to ban it for minors.\n\nJust being exposed to hateful political rhetoric can harm trans youth. Last year, in a Trevor Project survey, 86 percent of trans and nonbinary youth said debates about anti-trans bills negatively affected their mental health; half said they experienced cyberbullying; and a third didn't feel safe going to the doctor. And when states pass anti-trans laws, the consequences for mental health are devastating: A study published in Nature Human Behavior in June found suicide attempts by trans youth ages 13 to 17 rose by as much as 72 percent a year after anti-trans laws were enacted.\n\nSuch laws are now the norm in Republican-dominated states. \"In either scenario in November, we're still facing that reality, where transgender people's and also LGBTQ people's rights more broadly depend almost entirely on what state they happen to live in,\" says Logan Casey, director of policy research for the Movement Advancement Project . Already, trans people and their families are facing a \"really difficult choice,\" he says . \"Stay in the place that they call home, seek healthcare somewhere else, or move out of state for potentially safer environments.\"\n\nIf Trump wins the presidency, Casey says, the attacks succeeding now on the state level can be expected to graduate to the federal government. In his first term, Trump already provided a model for targeting transgender people. He banned them from the military ; permitted anti-trans discrimination in health care ; rolled back protections for trans students; and created a broad license for businesses to discriminate based on \"religious objections\"-often against LGBTQ people. More clues for a second term come from Project 2025, much of which was written by former Trump administration members, which equates \"transgender ideology\" with pornography and declares that it should be banned. The blueprint for a second Trump administration proposes wiping the terms \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity\" completely out of all federal policy.\n\nAnd if the GOP wins both Congress and the White House, Trump has pledged to go further than before-cutting off federal funding for gender-affirming medical care and making it illegal nationwide for doctors to provide such care to minors.\n\nBut even without Congress, Trump would still have immense power to target transgender people through executive agencies. First on the list: reinterpreting federal laws in ways that eliminate protections for transgender people. That includes the Affordable Care Act, as well as Title IX, which forbids sex discrimination in education. Are schools and doctors expected to treat people according to their gender identity? The Obama and Biden administrations said yes. But in the years between, Trump appointees reversed those rules. \"What they mean in terms of bathrooms, what they mean in terms of sports, what those regulations look like is very dependent on, is [ Betsy] DeVos in charge or not?\" says Jess Braverman, legal director at Gender Justice.\n\nLegal and policy experts who specialize in LGBTQ rights also warn that Trump appointees could create broad religious exemptions to federal nondiscrimination rules. One potential consequence: Government contracts going to organizations that exclude queer and trans people or insist on misgendering them. For example, during the first Trump administration, Catholic Charities was the only organization in Texas contracted to provide foster care placements for refugee children. The organization disqualified a lesbian couple, allegedly because they did not \" mirror the Holy Family .\" (Lambda Legal sued, and won .) Jennifer Pizer, Lambda Legal's chief legal officer, says she's particularly concerned about federal agencies giving contractors free rein, because the people they serve are often in dire need. \"Whether it's providing shelter or food or disaster relief, when they discriminate, then the people who are entitled to receive services, they don't necessarily stay,\" she explains.\n\nThe Project 2025-obsessed loyalists and ideologues who will staff a second Trump administration will not only set a tone for the massive federal workforce-one likely to be hostile to LGBTQ employees-but they'll also be in charge of deciding how federal program money is distributed. \"That money can go to responsible, community-based organizations and professional institutions that provide services consistent with professional standards, in a nondiscriminatory way,\" Pizer says, \"or to expand the religious infrastructure that we have in this country.\"\n\n\"No matter which way the regulations go, no matter what they say, there's always going to be litigation.\"\n\nPretty much any agency moves are guaranteed to wind up in the courts, where lawsuits are already raging over trans-inclusive interpretations of Title IX and the ACA . Even when the Supreme Court weighs in-as it did in 2020 when it ruled that Title VII, the federal law banning sex discrimination in employment, protected transgender workers-the underlying issues aren't put to rest. \"No matter which way the regulations go, no matter what they say, there's always going to be litigation,\" Braverman says.\n\nSo it matters immensely who's on the bench-another presidential power. During Trump's first term, he appointed nearly 200 judges, reshaping the federal judiciary all the way up to the Supreme Court. As a result, those justices didn't just overturn Roe v. Wade , they widened religious exemptions to civil rights law in ways that let more business owners refuse to serve LGBTQ clients. And, with all the recent state laws targeting transgender youth, a profusion of litigation over trans issues is making its way through the federal court system. In the most prominent case, United States v. Skrmetti , the DOJ has teamed up with trans families and has asked the court to decide if states can ban puberty blockers and hormone therapy for trans youth while permitting the same treatments for cisgender patients.\n\nOral argument for Skrmetti is scheduled for December-meaning the case should be submitted before the next president takes office. Pizer notes that it remains to be seen whether a Trump White House would try to reverse the DOJ's current position on the case, and whether the justices would allow it.\n\nIn some ways, the backsliding in support for trans people is bipartisan. Democratic candidates this cycle have often appeared tentative or afraid of how conservative messaging about trans issues has already shaped public opinion.\n\nSome Democrats have adopted anti-trans rhetoric defensively, referring to trans people not by their gender identity but by the sex they were assigned at birth. \"Let me be clear, I don't want boys playing girls' sports,\" said Democratic Senate candidate Texas Rep. Colin Allred, running against Ted Cruz in Texas, in his response to a right-wing attack ad . Some LGBTQ-rights advocates chalked Allred's response up to \" messy \" allyship; others called it a \" dog whistle .\" Either way, anti-trans activists were thrilled: \"Beautiful Ted gets a major W here,\" American Principles Project president Terry Schilling posted .\n\nEven Kamala Harris, who dedicated an entire interview to describing her support for trans people during her first run for president in 2019, and who otherwise has a strong record advocating for the queer community, has stopped short of giving a robust defense of trans rights in her campaign. When attacked for allowing incarcerated people to access gender-affirming care, she shot back that such care was offered in federal prisons under the Trump administration. Gender-affirming care \"is a decision that doctors will make in terms of what is medically necessary,\" Harris elaborated under further questioning by NBC anchor Hallie Jackson.\n\n\"It feels like that's a long way from 'we see you and we love you,' which was your message to trans Americans in May,\" Jackson pushed back. \"What do you want the LGBTQ+ community to know as they're looking for a full-throated backing from you for trans Americans?\"\n\n\"I believe that all people should be treated with dignity and respect, period, and should not be vilified for who they are, and should not be bullied for who they are,\" Harris replied.\n\nTo some queer and trans observers, Harris' general rebuttal about a need for inclusion is a disappointment , failing to meet the intensity of the anti-trans backlash. Others see it as an appropriate calculation for a dangerous political moment. \"There are attacks against multiple groups of people, and so a counter-message that says, 'Targeting people is not good, we need to come together as a country, we need to be inclusive as a country'-that is an apt message for these times,\" Pizer says.\n\nThe stakes of the rhetoric are extremely high. While the average American's opinions about transgender policies-from bathroom bans to gender-affirming care restrictions-are largely unformed and in flux, according to research from the University of Minnesota, politicians' anti-trans messages have broadened support for restrictive policies. \"As public opinion continues to evolve in this area,\" the researchers concluded, \"much will depend on the behavior and framing offered by elites.\"\n\nAnd the anti-trans rhetoric from Trump and his allies has already had a profound impact on queer people-none more so than the trans women and drag queens featured in the ads without their consent. \"I haven't been able to sleep,\" Gabrielle Ludwig, a trans woman whose college basketball career was exploited in multiple ads, told The Hill . \"I don't want my family affected. I have granddaughters, daughters who are in college. I only did this because I love to play basketball. That's all it ever was.\"\n\nWith so much ultimately being up to the courts-and political battles sure to continue in the states, if not the federal government-Braverman believes a Harris win could be a chance to change the narrative. \"The demonization and the discussion and the 'let's just debate people's humanity'-that is the thing that is really making life hard for people,\" they say.\n\nHarris cannot unilaterally reverse the tide of anti-trans legislation in states; beyond her ability to affect policy areas like health and education, her greatest power lies in her words. \"Laws and regulations are really important,\" Braverman says, but \"there needs to be more. There needs to be education, there needs to be understanding. There needs to be support from people in power.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "LGBTQ Federal Workers Brace for a McCarthyist Purge\n\nMadison Pauly February 24, 2025\n\nMother Jones illustration; Getty\n\nMother Jones illustration; Getty\n\nWhen Michael first started working in the Department of the Interior over a decade ago, he hid the fact that he was gay from his co-workers. \"It can be an old boys' club,\" explains Michael, who still works in the department and requested to use a pseudonym to protect himself from retaliation. \"People who were queer kept it to themselves so as not to rock the boat.\" But his agency grew more diverse over the years, and eventually he came out to a small group of co-workers after learning that one was a lesbian. It was important to know he would be accepted and safe, he says, and \"to have a few people that I could be myself with.\"\n\nThen, during Donald Trump's first term, Michael remembers a meeting when a seasonal worker came out as transgender and asked the staff to use he/him pronouns. \"His voice was cracking, his hands were shaking,\" Michael still recalls. It reminded him of his own early days on the job. \"I thought, There needs to be a group for community and support. I need to do this .\"\n\nSo Michael started working with other queer people in his agency to form a monthly group for LGBTQ employees and anyone else who wanted to join. They organized Pride Month events, surveyed members on barriers they were facing in their jobs, and problem-solved with management, like helping get an employee's official nametag changed when they came out as transgender.\n\nHundreds of organizations like Michael's exist throughout the federal government-not just for LGBTQ workers, but also for veterans, Black and Hispanic workers, people with disabilities, and others who share a connection around a fundamental part of their identity. Known as \"employee resource groups,\" they've long been officially recognized and approved by federal agencies; the first federal Pride employee resource group, at the Smithsonian, was founded in 1988, at the height of the AIDS epidemic. During Trump's first term, leadership urged employees to join them. \"Employee Organizations can serve as sounding boards around strategic diversity and inclusion matters,\" reads an April 2017 Interior Department bulletin , \"and provide a support system that offers employees a sense of community, camaraderie, and connection to the organization.\"\n\nBut since returning to power, Trump and his allies have cast these same groups as subversive and even illegal, an example of \"radical\" and \"discriminatory\" programs promoting diversity, equality, and inclusiveness. On February 5, the Office of Personnel Management-essentially the executive branch's HR department- issued a memorandum telling agencies to \"prohibit\" employee resource groups that promote \"unlawful DEIA initiatives\" or \"employee retention agendas based on protected characteristics.\"\n\nThe OPM memo is just one of many Trump actions generating fear of a new \"Lavender Scare\"-a purge that could roll back decades of LGBTQ gains and send those who remain in the government back into the closet. While Trump has appointed a couple of token gay officials-Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and special missions envoy Ric Grenell-he's simultaneously declared war on transgender people , issuing edicts against so-called \"gender ideology\" and an onslaught of executive orders attempting to impose widespread discrimination against trans people in schools , hospitals , sports , homeless shelters , and prisons .\n\n\"People came to us because they needed community, needed connection. We were trying to keep each other safe. Now, we're all just this big target.\"\n\nThe new administration's anti-LGBTQ hostility doesn't stop at the transgender community. On his second day in office, Trump rescinded a nearly 60-year-old order prohibiting discrimination by federal contractors. His appointees at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have halted that agency's investigations of anti-LGBTQ discrimination. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security said it will now allow its agents to conduct surveillance based solely on a target's gender identity or sexual orientation. And OPM opened a tipline for federal workers to report colleagues who have worked on DEI-a callback to an earlier era when employees were encouraged to report and out their gay coworkers.\n\nIn the US Department of Agriculture, multiple people have been asked to report the names of LGBTQ employee resource group leaders to higher-ranking officials, according to interviews with workers and a document reviewed by Mother Jones . In the Interior Department, too, Michael says that an official has informed him that they've been asked to produce the names of at least some participants in employee resource groups.\n\n\"I never thought my involvement in an after-work group would land me here,\" a board member of a USDA queer employee resource group says.\n\n\"They're not coming out and saying, 'We want to fire the queers,'\" Michael says. \"They're not asking people, 'Are you gay? Are you lesbian?' They're asking, 'Who is participating in DEI?' But in the end it's going to have the same effect.\"\n\nIn interviews with Mother Jones , queer and trans workers who hold wide-ranging roles in the federal government, some with more than a decade of public service, say they have been living and working in fear since Trump regained office-afraid of being targeted or even fired for their gender identity, sexual orientation, or past efforts to support other LGBTQ employees. All eight federal workers interviewed for this story requested anonymity to protect themselves or their colleagues from workplace retaliation.\n\nTransgender workers, in particular, tell Mother Jones they're afraid of being fired every day simply for being who they are. \"I don't feel safe in my job,\" says a trans woman who has spent more than a decade working as a civilian in the Department of Defense. Trump has already issued an executive order declaring her trans counterparts in the military unfit to serve, claiming that being trans \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle.\" Another new Trump order proclaims that the government will no longer recognize people's gender identity, only their sex, as defined as their reproductive biology.\n\n\"It's a persecution,\" the DOD employee says. \"The government no longer recognizes my medical condition or acknowledges my existence as a transgender woman.\"\n\nSeventy years ago, at the height of the McCarthy era-when federal employees with left-wing views were routinely interrogated and fired for being suspected communists-a related purge of queer workers was underway. In 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed an executive order listing \"sexual perversion\" as a basis for terminating federal civil service employees, on the theory that gay men and lesbians were susceptible to blackmail by the country's enemies. In what became known as the Lavender Scare, at least 5,000 federal workers were fired for suspected homosexuality over the next two decades.\n\n\"More people were targeted during that period for being gay or for engaging in same-sex intimacy than were targeted for being communist,\" says San Francisco State University professor Marc Stein. The firings rippled out to state and local governments and the private sector, he adds, \"accompanied by notions that the gay people were weak, were divisive in workplaces, were not strong representatives of a moral United States.\" It's taken decades since then for LGBTQ people to gain acceptance in public life, including in the federal workforce. Not until the Obama administration was Eisenhower's executive order formally rescinded. Today, an estimated 314,000 federal employees, USPS workers, and federal contractors are LGBTQ, according to the Williams Institute . Meanwhile, the number Americans who identify as LGBTQ is growing. A new Gallup report found that 9.3 percent of U.S. adults identified as LGBTQ+ in 2024, up from 7.6 percent the previous year.\n\n\"I went through and deleted a bunch of emails and contacts, because I have lists of queer employees, and I am afraid if someone in the Trump administration gets their hands on it.\"\n\nNow, the very programs and support groups that have helped queer folks integrate could create risks for their participants. Employee resource groups like Michael's have been shutting down operations and wiping their websites, afraid of putting their members at risk in the openly hostile Trump administration.\n\n\"We've gone dark,\" a former LGBTQ resource group leader in the Department of Agriculture tells Mother Jones . \"We have pulled our contact lists off of government systems. Personally, as someone who has been very involved in queer spaces, I went through and deleted a bunch of emails and contacts, because I have lists of queer employees, and I am afraid if someone in the Trump administration gets their hands on it.\"\n\n\"I'm scared for the people I've been trying to help,\" says a trans worker for the Interior Department who is involved in employee resource groups. \"People came to us because they needed community, needed connection. We were trying to keep each other safe. Now, we're all just this big target.\"\n\nThe requests for names of LGBTQ resource group leaders are taking place against a backdrop of mass firings across the government. Over the last few weeks, the Trump administration, with help from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency , have set about terminating vast swaths of the federal workforce -some because their jobs were centered on DEI, and others simply because they were were new on the job and on probationary status, with fewer protections from being fired.\n\nThese efforts have swept up queer and trans employees like Anna, a military veteran working at a national security agency who had recently changed from being a contractor to a full-time employee. When Trump won reelection in November, Anna decided it was time to accelerate her gender transition. She'd started medically transitioning in 2023, but hadn't yet legally changed her name or the gender marker on her identity and personnel documents. \"When the results of the election came in, I realized I had to step on the gas, make a lot of those changes,\" Anna says, \"before the chance to be myself was taken away.\"\n\nShe applied to a court to change her name in her home state and worked with her agency's HR department to eliminate references to her as male from her personnel records. But she was too late. Her legal name change-a prerequisite for other document changes-wasn't granted until shortly before Trump's inauguration. As a result, her HR documents were only partially updated before Trump declared, on his first day in office, that the federal government would only recognize sex based on reproductive biology .\n\nAnna continued reporting to the office, sure she would be fired any day. \"It feels, for lack of a better term, like the sword of Damocles is over the top of me,\" Anna told me in early February.\n\n\"Someone like me? I'm just waiting for them to find me,\" says a queer civil engineer. \"It's only a matter of time.\"\n\nBut ultimately, Anna-who was still on probationary status, despite her years as a contractor-was caught up in a different purge. One recent afternoon, a director pulled her into a conference room with other workers and informed her she and other probationary employees were being terminated. She returned to her office, shell shocked, to pack a cardboard box and share a final goodbye with stunned colleagues. \"It feels like I just got punched in the back of the head,\" she told me that evening.\n\nDespite the name change, when she received her termination notice late that night, it addressed her by her dead name.\n\nWhen the new administration terminated federal DEI positions and programs on Inauguration Day, employees on DEI teams, or who had previously held those jobs, were swiftly placed on administrative leave and their access cut off to federal computers and systems. Some of those workers have since received notices that they have been officially fired. \"They got disappeared,\" says a nonbinary USDA worker I'll call Ryan, who regularly worked with the agency's DEI team as part of their job responsibilities. \"I can't look up their name in the system. All chats with them have been deleted.\"\n\nLate last week, a federal judge in Maryland issued a preliminary injunction blocking the parts of Trumps anti-DEI orders that threatened to cut off \"equity-related\" federal grants and funding for contractors. Yet the federal employees remain vulnerable-and it has become clear that the Trump administration's DEI purge is far from over. Documents uncovered by the Washington Post show that DOGE plans to identify and fire workers who do not hold DEI-related jobs but could be \"tied to diversity initiatives through unspecified other means,\" as the Post put it. Dozens of employees in the Education Department have already been put on administrative leave for attending a DEI training during the first Trump administration, even though participation had, back then, been encouraged.\n\n\"Someone like me? I'm just waiting for them to find me,\" says a queer civil engineer, who was previously assigned to work part-time on a program to mitigate anti-LGBTQ discrimination. \"It's only a matter of time. Those of us like me who have done trainings and are out, we're afraid. It makes it incredibly hard to concentrate and focus at work.\"\n\n\"The Lavender Scare was done under the guise of loyalty to the government, to protect the government from security breaches,\" the engineer adds. \"Now, it's about loyalty to the president .\"\n\n\"I don't know how to stop being who I am anymore. I am devastated and barely holding it together most of the time.\"\n\nEven those who never worked on DEI, or participated in employee resource groups, worry about other ways they could be targeted-for example, through new rules like the January 29 OPM directive requiring that \"intimate spaces\" be \"designated by biological sex and not gender identity.\" The trans woman working in the Department of Defense, for instance, says she is determined to continue using the women's restroom after going through the painstaking process of medical transition-including diagnosis, therapy, testing, and surgery. \"I have been dehumanized so much,\" she says. \"I'm not going to stop using women's facilities.\" But she knows she could be reported and subject to discipline as a result. \"That that exposes me to anyone who has a grudge against me or doesn't support me,\" she worries.\n\nEven amid this terror campaign, support continues to exist for queer and trans federal workers-much of it quiet and behind the scenes. Several employees say their managers have privately expressed a desire to protect them; co-workers have been sending sympathetic messages.\n\nAnd just because employee resource groups are taking down their websites and cancelling meetings doesn't mean their networks have disappeared. Some groups are organized as nonprofits funded by member dues, which means they exist as separate entities from the government. In private messages and non-work email groups, queer federal employees are continuing to offer solidarity and advice on how to protect themselves. One former resource group leader says she's been urging employees to download their entire electronic personnel files, track down copies of their degrees and professional licenses, and gather information about the complaint process at their agencies, before their access to computer systems is cut off.\n\n\"The other advice is to find people that you can be safe with and build community,\" she adds. \"As scared as I am to lose my job, I also have a network around me that is feeding me information, and that is helping me be prepared.\"\n\n\"The Lavender Scare was done under the guise of loyalty to the government, to protect the government from security breaches. Now, it's about loyalty to the president.\"\n\nThankfully, there is no easy way for the federal government to identify gay and trans workers, according to a federally employed scientist with knowledge of the matter. A few agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau-have, in the past, piloted small surveys with questions about LGBTQ status. But by and large, the scientist says, agencies do not keep data on the sexual orientation or transgender status of civil service employees.\n\nDesigning systems to collect such data was once the goal of a project, initiated in 2021 under the Biden administration, to analyze barriers faced by LGBTQ workers. But the Office of Personnel Management never finalized guidelines on how agencies should collect the data. To the scientist, that failure, once a source of frustration, is now reason for relief. \"Had we been able to successfully have self-disclosed sexual orientation and gender identity in personnel documents,\" she adds, \"it [still] would take years before LGBTQ populations would willingly self-identify.\"\n\nThat was the case for Ryan, the nonbinary employee in the USDA. Though they'd been sure of their identity for over a decade, they didn't share it at work until two years ago, when they moved into a new role with new coworkers and finally decided to add \"they/them\" to the bottom of their emails. \"That was my big 'ripping the band-aid off,'\" they say. \"It was scary, but exhilarating.\"\n\nThen, at a recent staff meeting, employees were instructed to use a standard email signature that required them to remove their pronouns. Ryan broke down crying in front of their team. \"I don't know how to stop being who I am anymore,\" they tell Mother Jones . \"I am devastated and barely holding it together most of the time.\"\n\nBut, Ryan adds, \"I'm not quitting. I'm going to make them fire me if they want me to go away.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Government Commission Halts Investigations of LGBTQ+ Workplace Discrimination\n\nMother Jones illustration; Bill Pugliano/Getty\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has temporarily halted investigations into the complaints of workers who say they were targeted based on their gender identity or sexual orientation, three current and former EEOC staffers tell Mother Jones .\n\nEEOC managers communicated this instruction to senior employees in recent days, according to these sources, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid retaliation. Industry publication HR Dive reported the pause in claim processing last week; Mother Jones can confirm the moratorium prevents staff from making telephone calls, conducting research, or otherwise investigating both new and existing complaints. \"There is what they are calling a pause on investigations of both transgender rights and sexual orientation charges,\" an EEOC employee says .\n\nNeither the White House nor the EEOC communications team responded to requests for comment about the stoppage, but the EEOC sources say the pause is in response to President Donald Trump's executive order on \"gender ideology extremism.\"\n\n\"People are afraid of being on the wrong side of this administration, which is very punitive and and takes retribution against people that are not seen as sufficiently loyal.\"\n\nThat executive order calls for every agency and all federal employees to \"enforce laws governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes.\" It does not explicitly instruct agencies to end protections based on sexual orientation, but current and former staffers say the commission lacks clarity on Trump's guidance and fears crossing him.\n\n\"People are afraid of being on the wrong side of this administration, which is very punitive and takes retribution against people that are not seen as sufficiently loyal,\" a former EEOC employee says. \"In a climate like that, it's not surprising people are perhaps even going above and beyond the guidance that's coming from the White House in an effort to show their loyalty-or just not understanding what the guidance is.\"\n\nAndrea Lucas, the Trump-designated acting chair of the EEOC, said in a January 21 press release that she intends to prioritize \"defending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights\" and \"rooting out unlawful DEI-motivated race and sex discrimination.\"\n\nExperts find the standstill concerning, especially considering how the Supreme Court previously ruled in Bostock v. Clayton County , a 2020 case related to workplace discrimination based on a person's LGBTQ+ status.\n\nThe majority of EEOC cases cite Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which stipulates that employers cannot discriminate against a person's race, religion, sex, or national origin. In Bostock , the Supreme Court held in a 6-3 opinion -authored by Trump-appointee Neil Gorsuch-that the term \"sex\" in Title VII protected LGBTQ+ employees from being fired as a result of their sexual orientation or whether they are trans.\n\n\"Discrimination against somebody on the basis of their being gay, for instance, or their being someone who is a transgender individual, is illegal employment discrimination, because the Supreme Court held that it is sex discrimination in Bostock ,\" says Brian Wolfman, a Georgetown law professor who won a sex-based employment discrimination case in front of the Supreme Court last year.\n\nThe pause on investigations is just one of many changes at the EEOC since Lucas took over. There have also been several changes to the system where people can lodge employment complaints. On the public-facing side of the portal, the EEOC removed the \"Mx\" salutation, the \"X\" gender identifier, and the option to fill in pronouns.\n\nWhen an EEOC employee looked at the backend of the system this week, the status of all Title VII cases involving sexual orientation or gender identity (SOGI) had a new tag: \"SOGI PAUSED\"\n\n\"People depend on the EEOC to process cases,\" says Wolfman. \"The idea that they're just pausing certain categories of cases that the Supreme Court has held fit within the statutory definition of discrimination is really troubling.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Supreme Court Allows Discrimination Against LGBTQ People\n\nMother Jones; Patsy Lynch/IPX/AP\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday allowed certain businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ people, creating a large loophole in federal and state civil rights laws that have protected Americans for decades. Justice Neil Gorsuch authored the opinion for the court's conservative justices, who made up the 6 vote majority. The court's three Democratic-appointed justices dissented.\n\nThe case, 303 Creative v. Elenis , was brought by a web designer who wants to create wedding websites for opposite-sex couples but not for same-sex couples-a form of economic discrimination that harkens back to the era before the civil rights movement. But under Colorado's public accommodations law, services offered to some people must be offered to all. Today, the Republican-appointed justices rolled back the clock and once again opened the marketplace to discrimination.\n\nThe court ruled that the web designer's work is a form of artistic expression and that forcing her to create a website for a same-sex wedding is compelling speech in violation of her First Amendment rights. The ruling thus draws a huge loophole in civil rights law for businesses who claim that their product is a form of speech. It creates a new reality for LGBTQ people, who can now face discrimination from businesses that refuse to serve them because of who they are. In some areas of the country, this might make it difficult to procure certain goods and services. But throughout the nation, it creates the impression that LGBTQ people are second-class citizens who do not have the same freedoms as everyone else. The decision green lights signs-either in brick and mortar stores or on websites-that announce businesses will not serve LGBTQ people the same way they once told Black people and Jews not to enter, in what amounts to a form of public shaming.\n\nMoreover, the ruling comes, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in dissent, at a time when around \"the country, there has been a backlash to the movement for liberty and equality for gender and sexual minorities.\" This includes bans of drag show and violence directed toward them, another way in which the economic activity of transgender people is being shunned. \"Today, the Court, for the first time in its history, grants a business open to the public a constitutional right to refuse to serve members of a protected class,\" she added.\n\nThe ruling doesn't necessarily stop at LGBTQ discrimination. It opens the door for discrimination against people based on their race, religion, sex, national origin, and disability. Drawing a line between free speech for people with anti-LGBTQ views and for those who oppose interracial marriage, interfaith marriage, or simply any activity by people of a disfavored group is likely to be impossible. This came up repeatedly during oral arguments, during which Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked whether a photographer offering nostalgic photoshoots with Santa could restrict his service to white children to preserve a vintage vibe the photographer might aim to capture. The lawyer for the web designer, Kristen Waggoner, conceded not only that his discrimination might be allowed, but also that Supreme Court itself would be forced to draw such lines. During the hearing, Justice Sonia Sotomayor similarly wondered whether a web designer with eugenicist views could refuse to make a disabled couple's a wedding website.\n\nWaggoner is president of the Christian conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing the designer and other similar business owners around the country as part of a nationwide litigation strategy to allow anti-LGBTQ discrimination.\n\nFor two decades, the Supreme Court had repeatedly sided with LGBTQ people against laws that persecute them or restrict their freedoms. In 2003, the court struck down a criminal ban on sexual intimacy between people of the same sex in the landmark case Lawrence v. Texas. In 2015, the court established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. And in 2020, the justices extended the employee protections in the 1964 Civil Rights Act to LGBTQ people. Now, the court's Trump-stocked conservative bloc enjoys a 6-3 majority, and their decision today represents a stark reversal of that trend.\n\nSome Americans may think of the era of open economic discrimination as a relic of the past. Black people traveling before and during the civil rights movement relied on the so-called Green Book to find accommodations in the Jim Crow south. The era, and that practice, is considered so bygone that Hollywood recently turned it into a feel-good movie .\n\nOnly the justices can say how far back they intend to go with today's decision. But the majority's opinion has opened the door to a kind of economic discrimination the country hasn't seen in more than half a century, where people seeking goods and services have no recourse for being turned away because of who they are.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Uganda Cited Dobbs in an Anti-LGBTQ Crackdown. Americans Should Worry Too.\n\nHuman rights activists stand outside the constitutional court in Kampala, Uganda. Hajarah Nalwadda/AP\n\nThe ripple effects of Dobbs continue to emerge in unexpected places-and to threaten other civil liberties.\n\nYesterday, Uganda's constitutional court, the country's second-highest judicial body, cited the US Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade in its ruling to uphold the majority of a sweeping anti-gay law that criminalizes homosexuality and same-sex marriage, and allows for convictions of up to life in prison and the death penalty in some cases.\n\nThe court wrote that Dobbs constitutes a recent development \"in human rights jurisprudence...where the Court considered the nation's history and traditions, as well as the dictates of democracy and rule of law, to over-rule the broader right to individual autonomy.\"\n\nIn the ruling, which came after the challenges to the \" Anti-Homosexuality Act \" passed by President Yoweri Museveni last year, the court repealed certain sections of the law, including those that criminalized renting property to LGBTQ people and mandated reporting \"acts of homosexuality\" to police.\n\nBut the fact that the court upheld most of the law obviously amounts to a massive setback for LGBTQ Ugandans-and offers a striking look at how Dobbs might be marshaled to restrict other rights both in the US and around the world.\n\n\"We have been saying in the United States that the decision in Dobbs could easily be extended to the context of personal liberties, like the choice to engage in sex with a person of the same sex, to marry a person of the same sex, to use contraception,\" Melissa Murray, a professor at New York University's School of Law and a leading legal expert on reproductive rights and justice, told me. \"The fact that a high court in another country used it in that way suggests how easily it might be deployed in our country for the same thing.\"\n\n\"Folks in this country ought to take a page out of it-this is really alarming,\" she added.\n\nThe UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, condemned the high court's ruling in a statement yesterday, noting that nearly 600 people \"have been subjected to human rights violations and abuses\" based on gender identity or sexual orientation since the law took effect last year. The law, Türk said, \"must be repealed in its entirety or unfortunately this number will only rise,\" adding that it was also contrary to \"Uganda's own constitution and international human rights treaty obligations.\" Amnesty International also notes that, since the law passed, there have also been more than 250 evictions of people suspected to be LGBTQ or to associate with LGBTQ people, and more than 200 \"other cases of actual or threatened violence.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch called the law \"abusive\" and \"radical,\" alleging that it \"further entrenches discrimination against [LGBTQ] people, and makes them prone to more violence.\" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said it's \"deeply disappointing, imperils human rights, and jeopardizes economic prosperity for all Ugandans.\" And Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the country's \"international reputation and ability to increase foreign investment depend on equality under the law.\" (Homosexuality is criminalized in more than 30 of Africa's 54 countries, the Associated Press reports .)\n\nThis is, of course, not the first time that Dobbs has been used to restrict rights beyond abortion access-including here at home. Dobbs was cited throughout the Alabama Supreme Court decision last month that effectively banned IVF procedures. (The Alabama Legislature subsequently passed a bill , which the governor signed, to protect IVF access, but it didn't address the legal status of frozen embryos.) And Justice Clarence Thomas used the Dobbs decision to call for the court to revoke the rights to marriage equality, intimate sexual relationships, and contraception, all of which he called \"demonstrably erroneous.\"\n\nDobbs has also been cited by anti-abortion activists seeking to roll back legal rights in Kenya, Nigeria, and India, according to research compiled by the advocacy organization Fòs Feminista. Globally, though, most countries have actually liberalized their abortion laws over the past few decades, with only four-the U.S., Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Poland-restricting them, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. And last month, France became the only country to explicitly guarantee a right to abortion in its constitution, which President Emmanuel Macron and other French lawmakers promised to prioritize just hours after the Dobbs ruling dropped in June 2022.\n\nThe fact that the US rollback of abortion rights could give rise to both France's protection of them and Uganda's elimination of LGBTQ rights, Murray said, shows that Dobbs \"is viewed as authoritarian\": Its power, in other words, lies in the hands of whoever gets to interpret-or resist-it.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Irony of Jewish Activists Facing Anti-LGBTQ Backlash for Supporting Palestinians\n\nProtesters from Jewish Voice for Peace demand a ceasefire in Grand Central Station on October 27th, inspired by the ACT UP demonstration against the Gulf War. Michaal Nigro/AP\n\n\"Mr. President, you care about Jewish people. As a rabbi, I need you to call for a cease-fire right now,\" called Rabbi Jessica Rosenberg last week, interrupting Biden at a campaign reception in Minneapolis.\n\nBiden responded with \"I think we need a pause.\" It was the first time Biden had wavered from his unconditional support for Israel, though he clarified that \"a pause means give time to get the prisoners out. Give time.\"\n\nRosenberg , a Reconstructionist rabbi, author, and organizer, is a member of the rabbinical council of Jewish Voice for Peace, a large coalition of anti-zionist Jewish Americans calling for a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Organizers say that JVP protestors' mass arrests in recent weeks are the largest scale arrests of Jews for civil disobedience in US history.\n\nThe internet quickly caught on to Rosenberg's comments. While many voiced support, hate against Rosenberg, an LGBTQ+ woman, also exploded on social media. Some was from the expected sources, like conservative talk show host Megyn Kelly, who said she \"was a man pretending to be a woman\" who may be \"pretending to be a rabbi too.\" Kelly emphasized that Rosenberg has a beard ( 5-10 percent of cisgender women in the United State naturally grow beards).\n\n\"I'm so proud to be a queer and visibly gender non conforming femme woman who could take that action,\" Rosenberg says about her appearance and her confrontation with Biden. \"Let all, especially SWANA and Jewish bearded femmes see ourselves in power and unafraid.\" (SWANA refers to Southwest Asia and North Africa, the region commonly referred to as the Middle East.)\n\nSuch transphobic, nasty comments are not surprising from Kelly. But she wasn't the only one: Stella Inger, a Jewish news anchor from the One America News Network, tweeted a video of Rosenberg's comments, calling her a \"biological man.\" Local Brooklyn politician Yaakov Kaplan , highlight headshots of Rosenberg to question her legitimacy as a woman, Jew, and Rabbi. In a different incident, a feud unfolded online between two queer, Jewish content creators. One of them, Michael Valdes , supports Israel, and made a halloween costume meme of Matt Bernstein , who he described as a \"Self-hating Jew\" and \"Queer for Palestine\" with a \"lack knowledge of Jewish history\" and \"desires to be wanted by the 'wokes'.\"\n\nThis vocal transphobia from supporters of Israel is telling, considering how so many defend the country as a bastion of safety for LGBTQ+ people in the Middle East. On October 29th, Israel's official Twitter account posted: \"Looking forward to seeing Hamas raise the rainbow flag across Gaza.\" After the October 7 attacks, David Kilmnick, founder of the LGBT Network, wondered why more LGBTQ+ people hadn't come out in support of Israel considering it is the \"only country [that] protects LGBT people from discrimination and violence.\" Mark Segal, a Jewish LGBTQ+ activist and journalist who participated in Stonewall, wrote an op-ed \"Hamas hates you as well,\" directed at the Pro-Palestine queer community.\n\nIn reality, things in Israel are more complicated, and critics of the country have long accused it of \" pinkwashing, \" a term created by Palestinian activists. For example, Israel doesn't allow same sex marriage or adoption.\n\nFor Rosenberg,  support of justice in Palestine is directly related to her queer and Jewish identity. \"Supporters of Israel say, 'This is being done for your safety,'\" explains Rosenberg. \"As a queer person and as a Jew, my bodily autonomy and safety is very visceral. The idea that somehow LGBTQ identity can be safeguarded by a military occupation and displacement of people is just absurd. What kind of freedom is that?\"\n\nJay Saper, a lead organizer for Jewish Voice for Peace, explains that the dynamic of receiving anti-LGBTQ+ hate from supporters of Israel is not new. \"The most deeply homophobic and transphobic remarks that I personally have received are from Zionists,\" says Saper, \"but we're going to continue to speak up and to take action like never before, to work to bring about a ceasefire and justice for Palestinians.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "LGBTQ students reflect on first school year under North Carolina's 'Don't Say Gay' law\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. - Last August, shortly before Milo started his high school junior year, North Carolina enacted a law that would restrict how gender identity and sexual orientation are taught and addressed in public schools.\n\nFor the transgender teen, who recently turned 17, that meant that in this past school year, his Latin teacher no longer asked students for their preferred names and pronouns.\n\n\"It would have been more dangerous to do that than to not,\" said Milo, who asked that his last name not be published because of safety concerns.\n\nConservative lawmakers who pushed for the law - the first section of which is titled the \"Parents Bill of Rights\" - argued that it is necessary to bolster parental control over the education and mental health of their children. Critics have compared the measure to Florida's so-called \"Don't Say Gay\" law , contending that it unfairly targets the LGBTQ community and, specifically, queer kids.\n\nA provision in the North Carolina legislation, Senate Bill 49, goes further than the Florida law, requiring educators to notify parents when students ask to be referred to by different names or pronouns. Some opponents to the measure have argued that the provision forces educators to effectively \"out\" gay and trans children to their parents.\n\nNow, at the end of a full school year with the law in place, some LGBTQ students, parents and activists in the state say SB 49 has prevented teachers from offering queer kids support, prompted further bullying and created a hostile learning environment.\n\nWhen asked for comment, Blair Rhoades, a spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction,  referred NBC News to the law's sponsors. She also noted that the legislation advises educators against alerting parents about a student's desire to change their pronouns or name if \"a reasonably prudent believe that disclosure would result in the child becoming an abused juvenile or neglected juvenile.\"\n\nThe group of state senators who sponsored the law -  state Sens. Lisa Barnes, Michael Lee and Amy Galey -  did not return requests for comment.\n\n\"Teaching about gender identity, sexual activity, or sexuality has no place in the K-4  curriculum,\" Galey said at a news conference before the state's education committee voted on the bill in February. \"Teachers must not determine when it is appropriate to discuss these topics with our youngest, most impressionable children.\"\n\nNoah, 13, a transgender middle schooler in Asheville, who asked that his last name not be published because of safety concerns, wanted to try going by he/him pronouns and a new name two years ago. He said that although he believed his parents would support him, he wanted to transition at school first because he \"just wanted to see if it worked for me.\"\n\n\"I actually told my teacher 'Can you use my deadname, and she/her pronouns in front of my parents, just until I'm ready,'\" Noah recalled, referring to his name prior to transitioning . \"And looking back on that, if that law had been in place, like I probably would have gotten outed.\"\n\nMilo and Noah, who say they have supportive parents, are worried about LGBTQ students in the state who don't.\n\n\"I have multiple friends who, if their parents found out that they were trans in any way, whether it was like forcibly outing them or if they came out to their parents, they would probably get kicked out of their house,\" Milo said, adding that in those cases schools previously would have been one of the few safe spaces available to them.\n\nThe teenagers and another LGBTQ student who spoke with NBC News said they were shocked to see their state lawmakers follow in the footsteps of Florida, which enacted its version of the law in 2022.\n\n\"My first thought was like 'That's horrible. I'm glad that's not happening here,''' Isaac, 17, who also goes to high school in Asheville and asked that his last name not be published because of safety concerns. \"I just thought it was too outlandish to ever make it. It felt so crazy.\"\n\nNow that the law is in place in his own state, Isaac is concerned about the trickle-down effect.\n\n\"Kids can be cruel. Teenagers love to use 'gay' as an insult and everything,\" Isaac said. \"And I think legislation like this is like, the state is in on it, too. Now, this opens the door for queer students to be looked down upon.\"\n\nCraig White, the supportive schools director for the Campaign for Southern Equality, a North Carolina-based LGBTQ advocacy group, said he believed the influx of measures in states across the country was part of a wider strategy among conservatives.\n\nHe contrasted the introduction of the education bills with the implementation of the state's trans \" bathroom bill ,\" HB 2, in 2016. The law - which, at the time, was an outlier - caused a national uproar, with famous musicians, corporations and elite sporting associations boycotting the state. It was repealed in 2017 .\n\n\"What the right learned from that is, you don't roll out these laws in one state at a time,\" White said. \"And that's why we're seeing these laws happen in a dozen states, or 20 states, at once because half the country can't be boycotted.\"\n\nDespite the lack of a national backlash against SB 49, White suggested that the law and others like it have spurred pushback at the local level.\n\n\"People are really fighting hard to keep culture wars out of their kids' classrooms and we're seeing parents get a lot more politically engaged,\" he said.\n\nThe Campaign for Southern Equality filed a federal complaint against North Carolina in January, arguing that public schools are \"systematically marginalizing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer students in violation of Title IX.\" The case is currently under review, according to White. Isaac was one of dozens of students, parents and educators who gave testimony in the 113-page complaint.\n\nDespite their frustration with the changes within the last school year, the three teens who spoke with NBC News said the legislation has made them and other LGBTQ students more engaged in their communities and in local politics.\n\n\"It's really hard at times and it feels like there's a lot of people who really would just rather you not exist, rather you just not be there,\" Milo said. \"And like the biggest middle finger you can give them is just to keep being there, to keep existing.\"\n\nCORRECTION (June 20, 2024, 8:33 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated a student's age.

Tim Walz, and now Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, was a high school teacher and football coach in rural Minnesota nearly two decades ago. He also devoted time and energy to help his students create the school's first Gay-Straight Alliance in 1999, and several students who were part of it remember \"Mr. Walz\" as goofy and accepting of everyone.\n\nJacob Reitan, now an LGBTQ activist and lawyer, was a founding member of the GSA at Mankato West High School in Mankato, Minnesota, about 80 miles southwest of Minneapolis. He said Walz and his wife, also a teacher at the school, provided vital support during Reitan's formative years.\n\n\"Both Tim and Gwen were incredibly supportive of their gay students, and they modeled values of inclusivity and respect,\" Reitan, 42, told MSNBC this week. \"I was bullied in high school. [Their values] helped not just me, but it also, I think, helped the bully. It showed the bully a better path forward, and I can think of no one better than Tim Walz to show that better path forward for America.\"\n\nFellow GSA member Seth Elliot Meyer attended Mankato West from 2000-2004 and had Walz for 11th grade history. Meyer, 38, said he initially expected to hate Walz, because he was a football coach and a hunter.\n\n\"I was a leftist punk rock, anti-everything kind of kid,\" Meyer said. \"In the year that I had him, what I learned is that he really cared about everyone and wanted everyone to be seen.\"\n\nMeyer, who was out as bisexual in high school, started attending GSA meetings his freshman year. He said he and the four other members of the club were scared to be seen together because they feared bullying.\n\n\"I had a really hard time in high school, and I felt like a lot of teachers wanted me to be someone else,\" Meyer said. Walz, however, \"was in a minority of teachers who wanted me to be OK with who I was and speak my mind, and whether it was with GSA stuff or anything else, was happy to be questioned and challenged, because he wanted to question and challenge things.\"\n\nMeyer now teaches German and a senior philosophy class at Woodward Academy, a private K-12 school in Atlanta, and he is the adviser for that school's GSA, where some meetings are attended by about 100 of the school's 1,000 students.\n\nEmily Scott, 41, said she attended GSA meetings at Mankato West from 2000-2001, during her junior year, because she had a crush on one of the founding members. But she knew Walz best through a biannual trip to China in the summer of 2001 that he organized for students. That trip, and something Walz said to her on it, changed her life, said Scott, who now lives in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\n\"We were on a river boat cruise in Guilin, and I turned to Mr. Walz, and I said, 'I love this. I love China. I want to do this for the rest of my life,'\" Scott recalled. \"And then he set up the next 10 years of my life. He said, 'Emily, here's what you're going to do. You're going to go to University of Wisconsin at Madison and major in Chinese, and then you're going to go to China and get a job,' and that is exactly what I did for the next 10 years of my life.\"\n\nScott lived in China for a decade, learned to speak Chinese fluently and worked in garment manufacturing.\n\nScott said that during the school trip they took two overnight trains, which \"were not fancy.\" The bathrooms were just a hole that opened onto the track.\n\n\"That was his goal for us, to push us just a little bit further out of our comfort zone,\" she said of Walz. \"I think that's what Mr. Walz wants for the United States. He wants to push the United States slightly out of its comfort zone and make it just slightly better.\"\n\nLarissa Beck, 38, attended the GSA meetings as an ally during her time at Mankato West until 2004, and she had Walz as a history teacher for 10th grade.\n\nBeck now works in disability services and advocacy, and she said that when she ran into Walz at the state Capitol in March, he remembered her.\n\n\"We're talking 20-something years ago, and to have your 10th-grade geography teacher remember you after all of that time, it means something,\" she said. \"I couldn't call him Gov. Walz, because he will forever be Mr. Walz. He's genuinely the teacher that was in the hallway greeting every kid every morning, giving high fives and fist bumps. He knew what was going on and what was happening within the school. He was ingrained in the fabric of it.\"\n\nWalz, who served in the National Guard from 1981-2005, told Minneapolis' Star Tribune in 2018 that he believed it was important for him to be the adviser to the GSA because, \"It really needed to be the football coach, who was the soldier and was straight and was married.\"\n\nHis support for LGBTQ Minnesotans didn't end when he left Mankato West High School; his track record shows consistent support for the queer community as he turned from teaching to politics.\n\nReitan said that before Walz announced his run for Congress in 2006, he spoke to Reitan's mother, Randi , about running on a platform that included support for same-sex marriage.\n\n\"My mom actually said to him, 'Tim, you don't have to be for gay marriage for our family,'\" Reitan recalled. \"But he said, 'Randi, I got to look my gay students in the eye and say I'm for gay marriage.'\"\n\nWalz defeated a Republican incumbent at a time when only one state, Massachusetts, had legalized same-sex marriage, and Vermont allowed civil unions. Minnesota didn't pass a bill codifying same-sex marriage until 2013, and gay marriage wouldn't be legal across the U.S. until 2015.\n\nWalz also advocated against \"Don't ask, don't tell\" in 2009. The policy, which prevented gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military, was in effect from 1994 until 2011.\n\nWhen Walz became governor in 2019, his support for LGBTQ rights continued.\n\nLast year he signed a \"trans refuge\" bill into law, making Minnesota one of 14 states that prohibits outside authorities to enforce other states' laws banning gender-affirming care, by, for example, attempting to subpoena health information or issue warrants under such out-of-state laws.\n\nAlso last year, Walz signed an executive order that protects access to health care for trans people in the state and signed a bill that prohibits so-called conversion therapy, a discredited practice that attempts to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nSome Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have already tried to use Walz's support for the LGBTQ community to their advantage.\n\n\"There's never been a ticket like this,\" Trump said Wednesday morning on Fox News' \"Fox and Friends\" program. \"This is a ticket that would want this country to go communist immediately, if not sooner. We want no security. We want no anything. He's very heavy into transgender. Anything transgender he thinks is great, and he's not where the country is on anything.\"\n\nAs for his former students, Walz's ascent to vice presidential candidate has inspired them to reconnect with each other and share their memories of \"Mr. Walz.\"\n\n\"I've talked to hundreds of people from high school that I haven't talked to in 20 years because of this,\" Meyer said. \"Even people who don't agree with him, they think this is a good guy, and it's time for American politics to have a good guy.\"\n\nFor more from NBC Out, sign up for our weekly newsletter.\n\nI am an award-nominated journalist covering the LGBTQ community for NBC News.

They kill us, they discriminate us, they rape us,\" Carranza said, speaking to NBC News and MSNBC against the backdrop of the Statue of Liberty.\n\nA year and a half ago, she fled Honduras with Gretta Mazariegos, 29, and Gretta's younger brother, Isaac, 20, two friends who are also part of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n\"To live in Honduras and be part of the LGBT community is all about survival,\" Gretta Mazariegos said. \"We were persecuted multiple times because we are part of the LGBTQ community.\"\n\n\"We had to leave our country because of discrimination, beatings,\" Isaac Mazariegos said.\n\nCarranza said they were first harassed by members of street gangs known as Maras, after they refused to work for them. One time, the Maras broke into her apartment, destroyed her furniture and left her threatening messages with homophobic language, she said.\n\nThey say they were almost killed in a park in Honduras when they were chased by men with machetes who were yelling homophobic slurs.\n\n\"That's when I told Gretta, 'The best thing is for me to leave Honduras because I feel that here I will eventually be killed,'\" Carranza said.\n\nGretta Mazariegos left Honduras to save themselves and their brother. When Isaac was 14 years old, their parents kicked them out of their house because they are LGBTQ+.\n\n\"I had to become a very resilient person for my brother,\" Gretta Mazariegos said. \"I could bear the yelling, the beatings, the tortures, but when I saw that my brother was also experiencing that, my role went from being his brother to being his father or mother.\"\n\nOn Feb. 7, 2023, they left for Guatemala, eventually making their way to Chiapas, Mexico, and later to Tijuana, near the U.S. border.\n\n\"When leaving my country, I never imagined the number of dangers that I was going to face,\" Carranza said as she dried her tears.\n\nIn Tijuana, a meeting with a man who had befriended Carranza turned violent.\n\n\"He said, 'You're going to die today. You're not going to see the sunlight again. You will be dead in this hotel today,'\" Carranza said. \"And he then grabbed me by the hair and threw me on the bed ... He almost killed me. That man raped me,\" Carranza said.\n\nSome time later, health officials arrived to administer HIV tests where Carranza was staying at the Garden of Butterflies shelter .\n\n\"I got tested regularly, but the man who raped me, he raped me without protection,\" Carranza said. \"I go outside with the nurse, and he said, 'Your test came back positive.'\" Later a doctor confirmed Carranza had contracted HIV.\n\nThese three friends survived, but many in the LGBTQ+ community do not.\n\nThe Organization of American States reports that the average life expectancy of trans women in Latin America is no more than 35 years of age.\n\nIn Mexico, activists have recorded at least 231 murders of LGBTQ+ people in the last three years.\n\nAround the world, at least 67 countries have national laws criminalizing same-sex relations between consenting adults, and, in 12 countries, consensual and private same-sex sexual acts may even carry the death penalty, according to Human Rights Watch .\n\nIn Tijuana, the three migrants waited for seven months for an appointment through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's CBP One app, which is used to schedule migrants and asylum-seekers to present themselves at a U.S. port of entry.\n\nTheir appointment was on June 8, 2024, just four days after President Joe Biden announced new border restrictions.\n\nThey entered the border legally in Calexico, California, where border officials documented their entry and released them with a preliminary court date for October 2024.\n\nCarranza and her friends want to request asylum but cannot afford a lawyer, so they are now looking for free legal services. For now, they are trying to collect all the evidence they have of the abuse they faced.\n\nUnder U.S. law, persecution due to sexual orientation, gender identity or HIV status are grounds for asylum, explained Bridget Crawford, director of law and policy at Immigration Equality , which represents LGBTQ+ migrants and asylum-seekers. The organization is currently reviewing their cases.\n\n\"An asylum-seeker must prove that they have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a 'protected ground.' The protected grounds are your race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. LGBTQ status is widely recognized as meeting the definition of 'particular social group,'\" Crawford said.\n\n\"Typical evidence that might help an LGBTQ refugee prove their claim are things like police and medical reports detailing attacks or injuries, letters or declarations from partners or others who can credibly attest to the applicant's LGBTQ status and the facts of their claim, membership in LGBTQ organizations, pictures and dating profiles, a psychologist's evaluation, articles and reports about conditions for LGBTQ people in a person's home country,\" Crawford said.\n\nCrawford said it is common for LGBTQ asylum-seekers to face barriers when collecting evidence and documentation, such as police reports and medical records.\n\n\"This might be because they couldn't go to the police. It might be because police officers perpetrated the abuse. It might be that they had to flee so quickly, they couldn't gather that type of evidence,\" Crawford said.\n\nCarranza said that after they were chased by men with machetes in Honduras, they went to the police.\n\n\"The police told us that if we didn't have evidence, like video, photos or someone who could testify as a witness, then our word wasn't worthy,\" Carranza said. \"In Honduras, the police and the narcotrafficking are all in collusion.\"\n\nThe only official document they have is a complaint that a lawyer helped them file with the municipality of Villanueva in Honduras. They say they may have other conversations, images and videos saved on their phones that could help them prove their case.\n\nCrawford said that Carranza and her friends would probably have to explain in their case that they were unable to get police reports because they were dismissed by the officers. \"They would have to get affidavits from witnesses, ideally who would also be available to testify, corroborating what happened,\" Crawford said.\n\n\"In theory, detailed, consistent and credible testimony alone is sufficient to prove a claim provided an applicant can explain to the judge why corroborating documentary evidence was unavailable, but this is often very hard to do, especially if an applicant is not represented by an attorney and trying to navigate the complicated immigration process in a language they don't understand,\" Crawford said.\n\nMichelle, Gretta and Isaac now live in Trenton, New Jersey, with friends. They have new hope now that they are safe in the U.S. as they await their first court date.\n\nCrawford said generally the first court appearance is a short hearing before a judge, in which the asylum-seeker tells the judge if they intend to apply for any relief, such as asylum. \"This is not where an asylum-seeker will present evidence on their asylum case. That happens later at what is called an 'individual hearing,'\" Crawford said.\n\nGretta Mazariegos said there are \"so many things I want to do,\" so many plans. \"I want to continue my studies - I want to collaborate with this country by working.\"\n\nIsaac Mazariegos said, \"I feel protected to be here, because in my country I couldn't be myself because of so much discrimination.\"\n\nAs for Carranza, \"we now feel liberated,\" she said. \"We are happy and emotional about being in this country.\"\n\nFor more from NBC Latino, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\nAndrés González is a senior producer with MSNBC.

The other LGBTQ-themed titles on the list include George M. Johnson's \"All Boys Aren't Blue,\" Juno Dawson's \"This Book Is Gay\" and Mike Curato's \"Flamer.\"\n\nIn recent years, school districts and state legislatures across the U.S. have been roiled by fierce debates over what reading materials are appropriate for kids and teenagers. The moves to restrict or withdraw books have been driven in part by conservative activist groups such as Moms for Liberty as well as Republican elected officials.\n\nMeanwhile, the American conservative movement has increasingly coalesced around initiatives to curb lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer visibility, including Florida's restrictions on LGBTQ education in public schools and wider efforts to prevent trans athletes from competing in school sports.\n\n\"In looking at the titles of the most challenged books from last year, it's obvious that the pressure groups are targeting books about LGBTQIA+ people and people of color,\" American Library Association President Emily Drabinski said in a statement accompanying the list.\n\n\"We are fighting for the freedom to choose what you want to read,\" Drabinski added. \"Shining a light on the harmful workings of these pressure groups is one of the actions we must take to protect our right to read.\"\n\nThe American Library Association announced last month that the number of books challenged in libraries across the U.S. in 2023 spiked 65% over the previous year, reaching the highest level ever documented by the nonprofit organization.\n\nIn a report released March 14, the association said that 4,240 individual book titles were targeted for removal from schools and public libraries - a dramatic uptick from the previous high of 2,571 in 2022.\n\nThe most challenged books of 2023 - the top five of which all had LGBTQ themes - also included Stephen Chbosky's \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower,\" Toni Morrison's \"The Bluest Eye,\" Ellen Hopkins' \"Tricks,\" Jesse Andrews' \"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,\" Erika Moen and Matthew Nolan's \"Let's Talk About It,\" and Patricia McCormick's \"Sold.\"Three of the titles on the list were not specifically flagged for LGBTQ themes. \"The Bluest Eye,\" widely considered a literary classic, drew complaints because it features depictions of rape and incest, according to the library association. It was also \"claimed to be sexually explicit\" and flagged for \"EDI content,\" an acronym that refers to equity, diversity and inclusion.\n\nThe list of challenged books was released Monday to kick off National Library Week, an observance co-sponsored by the library association, which was founded in 1876.\n\nThe library association, which has monitored attempted book bans since 1990, compiles data on challenges from two sources: reports from library professionals and news stories. The association said the 2023 data \"represents only a snapshot of book censorship,\" partly because many attempts to challenge books are not formally flagged or covered by the news media.\n\n\"Each challenge, each demand to censor these books is an attack on our freedom to read, our right to live the life we choose, and an attack on libraries as community institutions that reflect the rich diversity of our nation,\" said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the association's Office for Intellectual Freedom.\n\n\"When we tolerate censorship,\" she added, \"we risk losing all of this.\"\n\nFor more from NBC Out, sign up for our weekly newsletter.\n\nI am a national reporter focused on the biggest stories of the day, including high-profile trials, natural disasters, and the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.

Out elected officials, including Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., and Reps. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., Mark Takano, D-Calif., and Becca Balint, D-Vt., also signed, alongside notable figures such as Jim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015, and Judy Shepard, the mother of Matthew Shepard, who was murdered in Wyoming in 1998.\n\nHarris has a two-decade track record of supporting gay rights, which is part of the reason LGBTQ advocacy groups, lawmakers and celebrities have been vocal in backing the presidential hopeful. Some LGBTQ people, however, have taken issue with her record on trans rights and criminal justice issues.\n\nDuring her time as a district attorney in San Francisco, Harris helped make California the first state in the country to ban the so-called gay/trans panic defense, which has allowed those accused of homicide to receive lesser sentences by saying they panicked after having found out a victim's sexual orientation or gender identity, the letter says.\n\nShe was also an early supporter of marriage equality. She officiated some of the nation's first same-sex marriages in 2004. Then, in 2008, when she was California's attorney general, she refused to defend Proposition 8, a state constitutional amendment that banned same-sex marriage. In 2013, after a court allowed an injunction against Proposition 8 to stand, Harris officiated the first same-sex wedding in the state.\n\nThe letter notes that the Biden-Harris administration has been \"the most pro-LGBTQ+ administration in history\" and appointed a record number of LGBTQ people to federal positions, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the first gay Cabinet secretary, and Rachel Levine, assistant secretary for health, the first Senate-confirmed trans appointee and the highest ranking trans official in the federal government.\n\n\"With these strong LGBTQ+ policies in jeopardy because of Donald Trump, JD Vance, and the anti-LGBTQ+ Project 2025, electing Kamala Harris and defeating Donald Trump again is critical for the cause of equality,\" the letter states, adding that the next president will have lasting impact on the country by filling any vacancies on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe letter was put together by LGBTQ advocacy groups Advocates for Transgender Equality, Alice B Toklas LGBTQ Democratic Club, Equality California, the Human Rights Campaign, LGBTQ Victory Fund, LPAC and the National LGBTQ Task Force.\n\nNonetheless, some LGBTQ people have criticized Harris' record on trans rights and other social issues.\n\nAs attorney general, she worked to block a trans woman from receiving gender-affirming surgery in prison in 2015. At an LGBTQ presidential forum in Cedar Rapids Iowa in 2019, Harris said she worked behind the scenes to get the California Department of Corrections to change its policy denying trans inmates such care, The Advocate reported .\n\n\"I commit to you that always in these systems there are going to be these things that these agencies do. And I will commit myself, as I always have, to dealing with it,\" Harris said at the forum.\n\nHarris has also faced criticism for supporting FOSTA-SESTA , a 2018 bill package intended to hold websites accountable if they knowingly assist, support or facilitate sex trafficking. The laws led Craigslist to close its personal classified ads section and resulted in a number of other websites cracking down on sex workers who use their platforms to find clients.\n\nLGBTQ people, and transgender people in particular, are more likely than the general population to participate in sex work for a variety of reasons. As a result, LGBTQ sex workers have been disproportionately affected by laws like FOSTA-SESTA, which is short for the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act and the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act.\n\nIn 2019, when Harris was a senator and running for president, she told The Root that she supported decriminalizing sex work but did not regret supporting FOSTA-SESTA.\n\nSince she announced her candidacy Sunday, Harris has also faced backlash for supporting the Biden administration's policies on the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"Kamala, you will have our votes when you end U.S. support of genocide in Gaza. Simple as that,\" drag performer and activist Pattie Gonia wrote Monday on Instagram .\n\nI am an award-nominated journalist covering the LGBTQ community for NBC News.

No violence was reported.\n\nBulgaria's parliament on Wednesday approved the amendment to the country's education legislation, introduced by the pro-Russian Vazrazhdane party and surprisingly, backed by some pro-European Union parties. The lawmakers in the 240-seat parliament voted 159 in favor of the change.\n\nThe amendment bans the \"promotion, popularization and support of ideas and opinions related to non-traditional sexual orientation or sexual identification other than biological\" in schools.\n\nIn a separate vote Wednesday, lawmakers also approved a law defining \"non-traditional sexual orientation\" as one that is \"different from the generally accepted and established notions in Bulgarian legal tradition of emotional, romantic, sexual or sensual attraction between persons of the opposite sex.\"\n\nEuropean Union member Bulgaria has been criticized for violating the rights of the LGBTQ community and has been urged to guarantee its recognition and protection. Bulgaria has also declined to ratify the Istanbul Convention on preventing violence against women, because of widespread belief it means to promote LGBTQ rights.\n\nEuropean rights groups, like the Belgium-based Forbidden Colors, condemned the legislation as an assault on the fundamental rights of LGBTQ individuals, particularly children.\n\n\"It is deeply troubling to see Bulgaria adopting tactics from Russia's anti-human rights playbook. Such actions are not only regressive but are also in direct contradiction to the values of equality and non-discrimination that the European Union stands for,\" Forbidden Colors said in a statement on its website.\n\nSimilar anti-LGBTQ legislation has been passed in other countries in the region, including Hungary , Bosnia, Moldova and Turkey.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Outsports co-founder Cyd Zeigler said equestrian, an Olympic sport with eight LGBTQ men participating, has \"long been a leader in this space of out men.\"\n\nThe vast majority of athletes on the list of queer Olympians, approximately 170, are women. Lesbians and other queer women represent more than half of at least two teams: the U.S. women's basketball team, where seven of the 12 players are out, and the Australian women's soccer team, where at least 12 of the 18 players are out.\n\n\"Given how many lesbians are in women's elite level sports, it's just been a more welcoming place than men's sports for a long time, just because of the huge percentage of elite level athletes, particularly in Western culture, who are LGBTQ in women's sports,\" Zeigler said.\n\nHowever, Zeigler said that in the world of men's sports, where LGBTQ athletes in the past might have been uncomfortable coming out, more male athletes are realizing that their teammates are more accepting than they may have assumed.\n\n\"That's the biggest thing that people are finally starting to see, that despite the nonsense that goes on in some men's locker rooms, it doesn't reflect an actual level of acceptance. The level of acceptance is higher than what they think,\" he said.\n\nSome of the highest profile queer athletes at this year's Olympic Games include British diver Tom Daley, track star Sha'Carri Richardson and trans nonbinary runner Nikki Hiltz.\n\nAt the U.S. Olympic Trials last month, Hiltz punched their ticket to Paris , running the second fastest time ever of any American in the women's 1,500-meter race.\n\nIn a post-race interview with NBC Sports , Hiltz, 29, said the race had significance beyond setting the meet record.\n\n\"This is bigger than just me. ... I wanted to run this one for my community,\" they said. \"All the LGBT folks, yeah, you guys brought me home that last hundred [meters]. I could just feel the love and support.\"\n\nHiltz will be one of at least three nonbinary athletes participating in Paris, according to Zeigler. They'll be joined by U.S. women's rugby player Kris Thomas and Canadian soccer star Quinn, who helped Canada win a gold medal at the Tokyo Games and made history in the process as the first openly trans athlete to nab an Olympic medal.\n\nWhile Zeigler said that some people believe the ban on trans women participating in the women's category for certain sports has an effect on the number of LGBTQ athletes at the Olympics, he said he does not believe that the bans are affecting the overall numbers.\n\nHowever, he noted, the elimination of softball as an Olympic sport, a sport that had eight LGBTQ women at the Tokyo Games, for example, has had an effect on the numbers. Zeigler also pointed out that the Swedish women's soccer team, which \"surprisingly\" didn't qualify for Paris, had four LGBTQ players in Tokyo.\n\nWomen's soccer, across all participating countries, is the queerest sport at the Olympics this year, with at least 46 out players. Spain's team has six out athletes, Brazil's team has eight and Australia's roster has 12 - which  Zeigler said \"might be the most LGBTQ people we've ever seen on an Olympic team.\"\n\nFor more from NBC Out, sign up for our weekly newsletter.\n\nIsabel Yip is an intern for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

      "text": "What is queer food? We asked LGBTQ foodies and chefs to define it\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nIt's unlikely that two LGBTQ people will give you the same definition of \"queer food.\"\n\nThe term has become increasingly popular with the rise of queer restaurants, including The Ruby Fruit , a restaurant and wine bar for the \"sapphically inclined\" in Los Angeles, and HAGS, a fine dining restaurant \"by queer people for all people\" in New York City. Specific foods and drinks have also been claimed by or marketed to the LGBTQ community, such as vodka sodas and sourdough bread .\n\nFor some, queer food is simply food made by queer people. Others say it's about sharing food in queer community, while there are those who believe it should include serving marginalized people who have been excluded from fine dining spaces.\n\nSo what is queer food, aside from a term slowly gaining traction in certain corners of the LGBTQ community? The question was the subject of the Queer Food Conference at Boston University in April, with workshops such as \"Queer Food and Fundraising as Resistance\" and \"Nonbinary Botany: Cultivating Pollinator Community Workshop.\"\n\nOne of the founders of the conference, Megan Elias, the director of the university's gastronomy program, declined to give a rigid definition, because, she noted, it can mean so many different things. \"Which is lovely, right?\"\n\nFor Elias, the term brings back memories of a restaurant she went to in the 1990s in San Francisco's Castro District, one of the country's first gay neighborhoods, called Hot N' Crusty.\n\n\"I was like, 'That's gay food,'\" Elias recalled. \"It's funny and it's tasty and it's messy. But it was because it was being presented to me in the Castro, right? If Hot N' Crusty had been out by the baseball stadium, it would have had a different feel to it, a different meaning.\"\n\nWhat queer food means for Elias \"is circumstantial,\" she said, \"and it's up for conversation.\"\n\nNBC News asked a variety of LGBTQ academics, chefs and foodies across the country what queer food means to them. Though the definition of the term can vary widely, they all agreed that queer food in any form requires one nonnegotiable ingredient: community.\n\nVanessa Parish co-founded the Queer Food Foundation in 2020 as a mutual aid fund to support food service workers who were being laid off at the start of the pandemic. Today, the group also conducts research and hosts events and educational panels.\n\n\"We like to say queer food is us existing in spaces,\" Parish said. \"If you're queer, your food is queer; that's pretty much it. It's not a rainbow cupcake or bagel type of situation. That's fun, but that's not what queer food is.\"\n\nA rainbow cake, Parish added, isn't inherently more queer than a regular cake created by a queer person.\n\n\"If the person that curated it, their hands and their energy and their community building, is queer, then it's queer food,\" she said.\n\nJohn Birdsall started writing about queer food when \"nobody I knew or read remotely talked about queer food,\" he said. In 2013, he wrote an article for Lucky Peach magazine titled \" America, Your Food is So Gay \" about three gay men - James Beard and Richard Olney, both chefs and cookbook authors, and restaurant critic Craig Claiborne - who Birdsall argued were architects of modern American food in the mid- to late 20th century. The article went on to win a James Beard Award for food and culture writing.\n\n\"For me, queer food isn't necessarily focused on dishes or recipes,\" said Birdsall, who is based in Tucson, Arizona. \"It's focused on those voices and those individuals who transformed cookbooks, for instance, transformed restaurant spaces, transformed how queer people could be visible in public spaces.\"\n\nBirdsall cited James Baldwin as one such transformational figure. Baldwin, a gay civil rights activist and one of the most influential writers of the 20th century, wrote about \"shared hospitality being a queer virtue,\" he said. Birdsall added that Baldwin's distinctly queer philosophy of \"complete acceptance\" around a table marked \"a really significant evolution in American food.\"\n\n\"James Baldwin had this sense of the specific food not mattering - it's how you come to the table, who's invited to the table, who's considered family around the table,\" Birdsall said, adding that Baldwin would host dinners at his home in France with a rotating cast of cultural icons, including dancer and singer Josephine Baker and singer-songwriter Nina Simone.\n\nElizabeth Blake, a professor specializing in gender and sexuality studies, food studies and global modernist literature, said her book about depictions of queerness in modernist literature was inspired in part by \"The Alice B. Toklas Cook Book,\" written by the longtime partner of Gertrude Stein, a legendary lesbian novelist. Toklas published the cookbook in 1954, after Stein's death, to support herself.\n\n\"It's this kind of very gossipy memoir, where she knew that a lot of people who would buy it would buy it not to make her recipes, but to get the dirt on [Pablo] Picasso,\" who was friends with Stein and painted a portrait of her, Blake said.\n\nThe recipes, Blake added, \"are also totally over the top.\" It has a famous recipe for hash brownies and a recipe for fish with three sauces arranged to mimic cubism that Toklas served to Picasso. Blake described the text as a \"totally radical\" and queer take on the cookbook.\n\nAlex Ketchum, a professor at McGill University's Institute for Gender, Sexuality and Feminist Studies and a co-founder of the Queer Food Conference, said she asks three questions when she's deciding whether something should be categorized as queer food: Who's creating it? Is it community-centered? Does it have roots in queer history?\n\nKetchum pointed to Mary Rathbun's brownies as an example. Rathbun was a medical cannabis rights activist who became known in the 1980s as \" Brownie Mary \" for a weed brownie recipe she made for AIDS patients who experienced loss of appetite and severe weight loss.\n\nKetchum is also the author of \"Ingredients for Revolution: A History of American Feminist Restaurants, Cafes, and Coffeehouses,\" which is the first history of more than 230 feminist and lesbian-feminist restaurants and coffeehouses in the U.S. from 1972 to the present. She said queer community spaces that serve or provide food create unique spaces for both joy and political organizing.\n\n\"I think food allows us this way to take on the challenging and the difficult and yet kind of reaffirm our own community and then create a space that reinvigorates us and literally nourishes us,\" she said.\n\nChef and cookbook author Liz Alpern founded Queer Soup Night in Brooklyn, New York, after the 2016 election. At the first Queer Soup Night, Alpern made the soup. Now, Queer Soup Night invites local LGBTQ chefs to make soup to help elevate their public profiles.\n\nThe group has 13 active chapters across the U.S. that Alpern said are guided by the importance of connecting with local queer communities and the collective power of those communities, as Queer Soup Nights raise money for local nonprofit organizations.\n\n\"In my heart, for me, queer food is food eaten and enjoyed and produced in queer community,\" she said. \"Everything about queerness to me is about community. It's about identity within community. When I think about being queer, I think about being queer with others. So if I think about queer food, it's about eating with others.\"\n\nLou Weaver, 54, a queer transgender man living in Houston, recently started T Party, a trans and nonbinary barbecue and potluck inspired by popular monthly socials that a local trans center used to host before it closed about a decade ago. Weaver said 12 people attended his first barbecue at Frost Town Brewing in April, which jumped to 30 in May.\n\nWeaver said queer food \"is about the company.\"\n\n\"Being in community with people who accept you for who you are,\" he said. \"Like being vulnerable and at peace while breaking bread together.\"\n\nLudwig Hurtado, a writer and filmmaker based in Brooklyn, started working on a queer cookbook zine in October. When he first told people about it, he said, they would ask whether it was related to gay sex.\n\n\"The first place everyone goes is very sexual, and that was a bit upsetting for me,\" said Hurtado, a former NBC News producer. \"I just felt like queerness is so much more than that.\"\n\nHurtado and co-editors Colleen Hamilton and Gabriella Lewis curated a new zine, titled PLAY , out this month, with a selection of recipes and art from LGBTQ chefs and artists. The zine will benefit two nonprofit organizations: Intransitive , one of the only trans rights groups in Arkansas, and The Okra Project , a mutual aid organization that supports Black trans people.\n\nHe said one of the projects he was inspired by was \"Get Fat, Don't Die,\" a cooking column for people with HIV/AIDS that ran in an AIDS humor zine called Diseased Pariah News from 1990 to 1999.\n\n\"The name of the column itself is very indicative of what we're trying to say, like eat, have fun, let's play with our food,\" Hurtado said.\n\nFor Hurtado, queer food needs to mean more than food made by an LGBTQ person: It has to be \"either radically made or radically served.\"\n\n\"Either it's challenging a paradigm or it's feeding someone who isn't normally fed,\" he said. \"To me, queer food is nourishment that goes against the grain, goes against power.\"\n\nFor more from NBC Out, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\nI am an award-nominated journalist covering the LGBTQ community for NBC News.

      "text": "Mainstream coverage of the LGBTQ community is omitting something vital\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nA quick scan of headlines on any given day reveals a predictable narrative when it comes to the LGBTQ community: From the pope using a homophobic slur to multiple anti-transgender bills in state legislatures , publications tend to center the struggles and hardships that queer and trans people face.\n\nAnd while this is an unfortunate reality for many, it omits an entire range of realities experienced by a vast and diverse community.\n\nKoa Beck, a queer journalist and the author of \" White Feminism: From the Suffragettes to Influencers and Who They Leave Behind ,\" believes mainstream coverage of LGBTQ people \"has the capacity to message to both straight and queer people that queer lives are depressing, violent, scary and abusive.\" And while their lives can be, Beck said, \"they are also so very joyous and special.\"\n\nWhen the dominant media stories about queer and transgender people are focused on inequity and despair, a dangerous and discordant precedent is set.\n\nOutside of June, when outlets publish queer content pegged to Pride Month, profiles of thriving LGBTQ people are often less visible than tales of strife. And when the dominant media stories about queer and transgender people are focused on inequity and despair, a dangerous and discordant precedent is set.\n\n\"The media sets the tone in terms of how we see the worth of people and what we find acceptable in terms of how we talk about LGBTQ+ life,\" said Kate Sosin, a transgender reporter who covers LGBTQ issues for The 19th. \"That translates to not necessarily our joy internally, but externally, and how we're allowed to display that.\"\n\nQueer joy is the notion that LGBTQ people can and do experience joy despite the harrowing hostility they continue to face; that their lives are not solely tragic; and that, instead of relentless suffering, community members have found endless ways to thrive in creative resilience for generations.\n\nWithout narratives of queer joy, \"you can't cope,\" said Sara Angevine , an associate professor of political science at Whittier College. She likened the lack of positive queer coverage to being caught in a thunderstorm: \"You're not gonna feel like going anywhere because you're drenched,\" she said. \"You need to have an umbrella to say, 'I'm singing it in the rain.' If you're isolated and the media is your only window into the world, the media should also play a role in saying, 'There is a house over there that you can get to, and they're having a party.'\"\n\nHomophobia and transphobia have been well documented, but queer joy has a history that has often been overlooked, rewritten or ignored in favor of antiquated ideas about what kind of love or desire is allowed to be expressed in public and by whom.\n\n\"So much of a media agenda will be connected to 'If it bleeds, it leads,'\" Angevine said.\n\nAngevine's research concentrates on global LGBTQ policies and says that for many Americans, themes around sexuality and gender have always been titillating in a way that has, more often than not, skewed toward spectacle. She finds that her students look outside of mainstream media to alternative and social media where collectives such as the Lesbian Herstory Archives use publications and ephemera to highlight the full lives of queer people in the past.\n\n\"It's not the same idea of the history of marginalization and oppression,\" Angevine said. \"It's the history of attraction, flirtation, dances - things so critically important for agency, too.\"\n\nPieces like Ariel Levy's exploration of \"Lesbian Nation\" for The New Yorker in 2009 and Richard Just's \"Hidden Lives\" in 2013, which tracks how gay students at Princeton University found love and friendship in the 1950s, are modern takes on historical accounts of queer life that can offer journalists a lesson in how to present stories that celebrate difference rather than question it. Whether it's queer people experiencing the joy of stealing a kiss in a photo booth, holding hands at a secret beach or participating in political actions, queer history is prescient today. \"Records of these experiences and strategies are deeply valuable,\" Beck said, \"and have the capacity to inform.\"\n\nIn an election cycle where anti-LGBTQ initiatives and talking points are at an all-time high, narratives to combat the bleakness are more pertinent than ever. \"I want stories where queer people are just doing normal things, which is not that queer people are just like everybody else and are completely homogenized,\" Sosin said, \"but that their queerness is not the most central thing or is not a point of contention, but just a part of the fabric of the rest of their story.\"\n\nSosin pointed to their profile of Black transgender former Massachusetts state Rep. Althea Garrison as the type of nuanced piece that presents joy without ignoring or centering hardships. Stories like these aren't just critical for visibility and representation, but follow journalistic standards of news that don't reduce people to tragic stereotypes. Stories of success - like the boom of support around women's sports and lesbian-owned spaces , songs from openly gay musicians being added to the National Recording Registry and trans people finding community in even the most conservative of red states - mark important moments in a wider movement toward integration.\n\nAngevine believes readers are interested in more than just stories of marginalization, harm and violence and sees how her students connect with \"the ways people resist, cope and overcome obstacles.\" Stories that highlight chosen family units , queer movements like the Radical Faeries and allyship in unexpected places are just a few topics underexplored by the media.\n\n\"A lot of joy is about, in my mind, creating new narratives, and that's interesting,\" Angevine said. \"Regardless of your status, it's how you're bending and breaking and playing with things to imagine new worlds.\"\n\nSubstantial cuts have been made to underresourced and understaffed newsrooms, which ultimately affects who and what gets published. With that, Sosin said, \"comes a lack of time and a lack of imagination, and then an inability to slow down enough to stop and take stock of what is really happening.\"\n\nThis undeniably affects how the LGBTQ community, much less queer joy, is covered. \"I think the mainstream media does not even have a language for queer joy,\" Sosin said. \"I think that that's not even on their register.\"\n\nBeing connected to the community on a local and national level makes finding these stories easier. Becoming a trusted reporter whose work reflects respect for LGBTQ people can bring tips to a reporter's inbox, including from organizations like Lambda Legal, the National Center for Lesbian Rights and GLAAD, which have a long history of advocating for the community and resources to connect reporters with the right experts and sources. Notably, this all takes time, resources and trust on the part of news outlets to develop one's craft and reputation.\n\nAnd it's not just about how many LGBTQ reporters are in a newsroom; it's about the initiative taken by people Angevine calls \"critical actors,\" no matter their personal identities, to hold basic journalistic standards - including telling a good story that is of interest to readers, queer and straight.\n\nBeck said that \"a landscape of scarcity and a lack of queer literacy from the top\" still prevents stories of queer joy from being a priority, but that \"agency on behalf of individual reporters and editors cannot compensate for a diminishing industry - nor should they be asked to.\" That's where the \"critical actors\" come into play, where people both within and outside of the LGBTQ community must recognize the value of documenting and reporting on queer joy, in order to push more stories of it into the mainstream media.\n\n\"Your goal is not necessarily to only be with what was,\" Angevine said, \"but to lead with something better and new.\"\n\nTrish Bendix is a writer based in Los Angeles.

It's horrible. Here you survive if you are a stylist or if you are a prostitute, otherwise not. They don't give you work,\" said Ramírez, 36, a Honduran trans woman who lives in Mexico City.\n\nMexico has become one of the largest migratory corridors in the world. In fiscal year 2023, U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded 2,045,838 encounters on the U.S. border with Mexico. So far in 2024, the figure already stands at 1,160,805. In this vast flow of migrants, the LGBTQ community is increasingly present in Mexican territory.\n\n\"The presence and visibility of the LGBT migrant population in transit has become increasingly visible in Mexico,\" said Ana Guadarrama, general coordinator of Mexico's National Network of Support for LGBT Migrants and Refugees.\n\nGuadarrama and other experts said that the increase in the arrival of LGBTQ migrants can be traced to 2013 but, above all, to after 2017, when the first Trans Gay Migrant Caravan was formed.\n\n\"We have seen an increase because the presence and visibility of gay men and trans women is undoubtedly much greater, whether in specifically LGBT care spaces or in a general way within the programs that provide support to the population in transit in the country,\" Guadarrama said.\n\nA new campaign led by the Organization for Refuge, Asylum and Migration, or ORAM, which assists LGBTQ asylum-seekers, has launched a campaign in Mexico to raise money to offer safe shelter, food and transportation for a month to 100 LGBTQ refugees or asylum-seekers in Mexico City.\n\n\"We always think of Mexico as the country from which migrants leave for the United States, but it has already become a place where people from other places pass through on their way to the United States, Canada or even people from the LGBT community who see Mexico as an opportunity to have a life that is a little safer, a little freer,\" said activist Enrique Torre Molina , a member of the ORAM board.\n\nTorre Molina said the idea is to raise 400,000 Mexican pesos (about $21,670) to help 100 migrants for 30 days, through organizations that have physical spaces such as shelters and houses where they receive LGBTQ people, migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers.\n\nIn the last three years, Mexico has recorded 231 murders of LGBTQ people: 78 in 2021, 87 in 2022 and 66 in 2023, according to data from Letra S : Sida, Cultura y Vida Cotidiana, a civil organization dedicated to the defense of LGBTQ people, which has recorded such cases since 1998.\n\nOn average, six people were killed every month. However, Letra S' investigation says that figure doesn't reflect actual numbers, because many murders aren't covered by the media, nor are they reported to the authorities.\n\n\"We have become a country where there are more and more migrants and refugees. And when migrating or passing through Mexico, in addition to the violence, the insecurity of organized crime and the threats that any migrant or refugee experiences, the LGBT community faces additional discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity,\" Torre Molina said.\n\nIn March, the United Nations Refugee Agency published a report surveying more than 15,000 migrants who crossed Mexico last year. It found 56% of migrants who participated in the surveys said they suffered some type of abuse, such as robbery or physical threats\n\nThe civil association Stop Kidnapping reported 772 migrant kidnappings last year. As of March of this year, it had recorded 521 kidnappings, more than half of which were of undocumented people.\n\n\"We are a community that experiences discrimination and violence. In some cases, LGBT people are in danger precisely because of the rejection of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and this affects migrants or refugees differently. Sometimes it is not that these people decide to migrate but that they are forced to cross an international border, looking for a safe place and freedom,\" Torre Molina said.\n\nFor Dana Graber Ladek, head of mission of the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, or IOM, an important aspect of LGBTQ migrants who arrive in Mexican territory is the \"triple vulnerability\" they suffer.\n\n\"First, they are stigmatized because of their sexual orientation or gender identity and second because they are migrants. Furthermore, many of these people are in an irregular situation - they are not documented in the country - so that is like a triple vulnerability that they experience in Mexico,\" she said.\n\nSeveral researchers, including Graber Ladek, say one of the LGBTQ migrant population's big problems is the absence of more data and information about them.\n\n\"The great challenge we have in Mexico, and also in other countries in the region, is to understand the statistics and characteristics of this population, because they really are invisible people who migrate in an irregular, undocumented way,\" she said. \"So there are more challenges in terms of understanding where they are, what their priorities are, their interests, etc. And the National Migration Institute is not collecting this data from migrants.\"\n\nThe IOM does conduct surveys that ask about issues of sexual identity or gender identification to understand what challenges such migrants face.\n\nNoticias Telemundo contacted Mexico's National Migration Institute and the Interior Ministry for access to the most recent data on the LGBTQ migrant population, but spokespeople for both institutions didn't immediately respond.\n\nIn the absence of figures, various organizations offer their internal data to show the increase in the LGBTQ migrant population in Mexico. That is the case for the National Network of Support for LGBT Migrants and Refugees, which in 2021 responded to requests from 150 LGBTQ migrants, 300 in 2022 and 368 last year. So far this year, it has already assisted 250 people.\n\n\"Recognizing ourselves within statistics is a fundamental step for the possibility of creating public policies, programs and services that meet needs,\" Guadarrama said. \"If we do not have that information, many of the actions or services that we are being generated, they are not reaching the populations.\"\n\nFor now, ORAM's campaign to offer shelter and help to LGBTQ migrants in Mexico City continues and has the support of people like Ramírez who experienced firsthand the difficulties of arriving in a big city without knowing anyone.\n\n\"I have experienced so many things here. I was in many shelters, I had to get involved in prostitution and I was mistreated, beaten - I was even kidnapped,\" she said. \"This project is going to help a lot so that people can find a safe place where they will not be discriminated against and can have a roof over their heads and a plate of food, even if it is for a few days. There are opportunities, but you have to fight for them, and I would not like them to experience everything that I have experienced.\"\n\nAlbinson Linares is a reporter for Noticias Telemundo based in Mexico City.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Activate your online access\n\nA close reading of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 document reveals potential major setbacks for gender-affirming care, workplace protections, and same-sex marriage.\n\nA Stop Project 2025 sign during the Democratic National Convention at the United Center in Chicago,.\n\nWhen Project 2025 was first published by the Heritage Foundation in the spring of 2023, most of the legacy media ignored it. Then last December, The New York Times reported on plans that would \"upend core elements of American governance, democracy, foreign policy and the rule of law,\" if Donald Trump returned to the White House.\n\nSince then, the 920 page document -also known as the 2025 Presidential Transition Project-has become a household name, and has garnered negative responses from Americans on both sides of the aisle for some of its extreme policies. These include the abolition of the Department of Education; a policy that would give the White House direct control of the Department of Justice, to allow prosecution of the president's opponents; and a recommendation to fire tens of thousands of federal civil servants so that they could be replaced by Trump loyalists.\n\nTrump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, stating at a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan that some of its elements are \"seriously extreme.\" \"I know nothing about Project 2025,\" he added in a Truth Social post . \"I have no idea who is behind it.\" These statements appear to contradict what he had said at a dinner hosted by the Heritage Foundation in 2022 : \"This is a great group and they're going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do...to save America.\"\n\nSo far, 140 former Trump administration officials have contributed to the document , and the project has been endorsed by more than 100 conservative organizations, including the Family Research Council and the Center for Family and Human Rights, both of which are Southern Poverty Law Center-designated anti-LGBTQ hate groups.\n\nDespite the lack of media attention about how the project could affect queer people, LGBTQ issues are referenced dozens of times in the document, beginning on the very first page, where it falsely states that \"children suffer the toxic normalization of transgenderism with drag queens and pornography invading their school libraries.\"\n\nAdditionally, on page 4, the authors of the document write, \"the next conservative president must make the institutions of American civil society hard targets.... This starts with deleting the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI), diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights, and any other term used to deprive Americans of their First Amendment rights out of every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation.\" \"They want to erase the LGBTQ community from federal documents\" says Wendy Via, president and cofounder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. \"It is a systematic dehumanization and abuse of the LGBTQ community.\"\n\nThe most extreme language in Project 2025-which has been widely denounced by LGBTQ advocacy organizations -is aimed at transgender people. The \"propagation of transgender ideology\" is called \"pornography,\" the document says, and that is an essential reason pornography \"should be outlawed.\" \"Its purveyors are child predators and misogynistic exploiters of women. Their product is as addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime. The people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered.\"\n\nVia says that while pornography and trans issues may seem unrelated, the connection made by the authors of Project 2025 is intentional because they see the deviance associated with pornography as akin to identifying as LGBTQ: \"Their message is that pornography is obscene. Being transgender is obscene. Teaching our kids about affirming their identities or orientations is obscene. And all of this is happening because the left is subversive and deviant and have created this situation.\"\n\nWhile Project 2025 doesn't call for the illegalization of what it refers to as \"transgenderism,\" Via says the way it's connected to pornography in the document is cause for concern. \"If you're going to outlaw pornography and if transgenderism equals pornography, then the through line is once you outlaw the first thing, then everything behind it becomes illegal. And that's why they say in that same paragraph that librarians should be labeled as sex offenders if they allow [LGBTQ inclusive] material in their libraries.\"\n\nIn an interview with Uncloseted Media , Rachel Bitecofer, a political scientist and the founder of the liberal Strike Pac, pointed out that the adult entertainment website Porn Hub is already blocking access to everyone in the 11 states that require age verification, as a protest against these restrictions. The Free Speech Coalition, which opposes a ban on pornography, agrees that the text of Project 2025's provision calling for a ban on porn seeks to create a link between what it calls harmful pornography and the transgender and LGBTQ communities.\n\nFurther down in the document, the project calls for renaming the Department of Health and Human Services \"the Department of Life.\" On page 451, it diminishes LGBTQ families: \"Families comprised of a married mother, father, and their children are the foundation of a well-ordered nation and healthy society. Unfortunately, family policies and programs under President Biden's HHS are fraught with agenda items focusing on 'LGBTQ+ equity'.... These policies should be repealed and replaced by policies that support the formation of stable, married, nuclear families.\" It also states that \"the male-female dyad is essential to human nature\" and \"every child has a right to a mother and father.\"\n\n\"Project 2025 is driven by a far-right desire to turn America back to the 1920s, or even further back,\" says Bitecofe. \"It's quite clear the goal is a religious-based biblical argument of morality,\" targeted against trans rights, the LGBTQ community, marriage equality, and the reproductive control of women.\n\nWhile Project 2025 does not explicitly call for the end of marriage equality, Gillian Branstetter of the ACLU's LGBTQ and HIV Project, says it makes a lot of indirect arguments \"for treating same sex marriages as second-class marriages.\" For example, the chapter on the US Department of Health and Human Services instructs the next president to protect faith-based grant recipients from religious liberty violations and to maintain a biblically based definition of marriage and family. It also states that Healthy Marriage and Relationship Education grants \"should be available to faith-based recipients who reaffirm that marriage is between not just any two adults, but one man and one unrelated woman.\"\n\nIn addition to taking aim at marriage equality, the report targets workplace protections for LGBTQ people. Four years ago, the Supreme Court handed down one of its most surprising decisions in support of LGBTQ rights, when it ruled in Bostock v. Clayton County that the 1964 Civil Rights Act , which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, meant that it was illegal to fire anyone because they were LGBTQ.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nJeet Heer\n\nProject 2025 says the next president must interpret the Bostock decision in such a way that workplace discrimination against LGBTQ people will still be possible. \"The new Administration should restrict Bostock's application of sex discrimination protections to sexual orientation and transgender status in the context of hiring and firing,\" Project 2025 states on page 584. \"The President should direct agencies to withdraw unlawful 'notices' and 'guidances' purporting to apply Bostock's reasoning broadly outside hiring and firing.... The President should direct agencies to rescind regulations interpreting sex discrimination provisions as prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, sex characteristics, etc.\" Uncloseted Media requested comment from four members of the Heritage Foundation press office regarding this provision but received no response.\n\nThe plan's attempt to roll back so many LGBTQ rights shouldn't come as a suprise, given the track record of the Heritage Foundation, which produced Project 2025. Since its inception in 1973, the Heritage Foundation has been a power player in Republican politics. In 1981, it produced its first transition document-known as the \"Mandate for Leadership\"-on the eve of Ronald Reagan's inauguration. The document was described as \"a blueprint for grabbing the government by its frayed New Deal lapels and shaking out 48 years of liberal policy.\" By the end of Reagan's first year in office, almost half of its recommendations had been implemented. In 2016, the foundation saw even greater success, stating that after Trump's first year in office, his administration \"had implemented 64 percent of its policy recommendations.\"\n\nThrough the years, the Heritage Foundation has advocated against marriage equality, LGBTQ people in the military, LGBTQ Boy Scout leaders, and bans on conversion therapy. But Via says that over the last 10 years, the organization has become even more extreme. \"It has always been unfriendly to LGBTQ people, but not abusive. We should not conflate it with classic conservatism anymore when it is actually [the] far right,\" she says.\n\nDespite Trump's attempts to separate himself from Project 2025, the ACLU's Gillian Branstetter describes his positions on LGBTQ rights and the relevant elements of the project as \"kind of inseparable. There really isn't any daylight between what Trump is saying and what 2025 is saying,\" Branstetter says. The strongest confirmation of this comes from Trump's own words. In a campaign video released in 2023, he said. \"The left-wing gender insanity being pushed on our children is an act of child abuse.\" And at one of his rallies in 2024 , he said he would get \"transgender insanity the hell out of US armed forces,\" meaning that he would reimpose his ban on military service by transgender people.\n\nAdditionally, Trump has said he would \"ask Congress to pass a law stating that the only genders recognized by the United States government are male and female and they are assigned at birth.\" He would celebrate rather than erase \"the things that make men and women unique\" and revoke \"Joe Biden's school policies on so-called gender-affirming care, a process that includes giving kids puberty blockers, mutating their physical appearance and ultimately performing surgery.\"\n\nAccording to HHS, \"for transgender and nonbinary children and adolescents, early gender-affirming care is crucial to overall health and well-being as it allows [them] to focus on social transitions and can increase their confidence.\" Via says that regardless of who becomes president in November, the ideology baked into Project 2025 will move forward. \"Who is president makes a difference. But in terms of Project 2025 and all these organizations behind it, they're moving no matter what,\" she says, adding that they have the ears of many courts and state legislatures across the US.\n\n\"These groups, the people behind these groups, have been dedicated to the mission, overturning Roe , eliminating gay marriage and disavowing the LGBTQ community and women. They are not going to stop. They might change tactics, but they will not take their eye off the ball.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Although President Joe Biden largely accomplished that goal on Tuesday, some topics were, of course, given more time than others. Biden rightly used his speech to alleviate concerns about inflation and corner Republicans on Medicare. But, unfortunately, as the right's crusade against queer people intensifies, LGBTQ rights were scarcely mentioned. Though the address lasted more than one hour, the totality of Biden's comments on the subject could be found in two lines: asking Congress to pass the Equality Act, to ensure that \"LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity,\" and referencing the recently passed Respect for Marriage Act . \"While the legislation was intended as a buttress against right-wing attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, activists have criticized the Respect for Marriage Act for writing Republican religious liberty exemptions into law and focusing on an issue that impacts only a small and wealthy portion of the LGBTQ+ community,\" wrote Theia Chatelle in The Nation last month. The LGBTQ community is being attacked more than any time in recent memory. Republican-controlled state legislatures have introduced laws criminalizing and restricting drag shows and banning gender-affirming care for trans youth. Queer teachers are falsely labeled \"groomers\" or fired . Molotov cocktails have been thrown through the windows of bakeries that host drag shows , and the Proud Boys disrupt drag queen story hours with guns at their side. The right's institutionalized dehumanization of LGBTQ people led to the killing of five people at Club Q in Colorado Springs. The language used by conservative pundits, politicians, and media personalities to describe the LGBTQ community is patently eliminationist. One can only assume that the violence perpetuated against LGBTQ people is their expected-and preferred-outcome. One might hope that elected officials would respond with more than rhetoric and half-hearted legislation. Unfortunately, President Biden didn't mention Club Q, or how the resurgence of homophobic and transphobic tropes has created a new generation of anti-gay extremists. He happily challenged Republicans on the debt ceiling, and used the murder of Tyre Nichols as a rallying call for police reform. But Biden's support within the Black community is currently shaky, and the country's economic strength has been called into question by Republicans since his term began. Presumably, Biden didn't feel such exertions were necessary for the nation's queer population. There is little risk of losing queer voters to Republicans. According to GLAAD, 81 percent of LGBTQ voters supported Biden in the 2020 presidential election. Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → Want to Understand the New Cold War?

The 2016 platform explicitly defined \"natural marriage\" as being between one man and one woman and opposed the US Supreme Court's landmark decision Obergefell v. Hodges , and was renewed in 2020 without change, to fiery criticism from some conservative strategists and LGBTQ+ Republicans at the time.\n\nThe 2024 platform , however, makes no mention of same-sex marriage, but calls on Republicans to \"promote a culture that values the sanctity of marriage.\" On paper, it's a seemingly substantial reversal for a party whose 2016 presidential candidates called Obergefell v. Hodges \"judicial tyranny\" and argued that same-sex marriage would cause an \"all-out assault against the religious freedom rights of Christians.\"\n\nCharles Moran, president of the Log Cabin Republicans, the United States' largest Republican organization for LGBTQ+ conservatives, said the removal is indicative of growing efforts from the GOP to include LGBTQ+ people. Moran views the party's progress on inclusion as \"huge,\" and added that he has attended two decades of Republican National Conventions.\n\nMoran went to his first RNC as a staffer in New York City in 2004, amid a Bush-era conservative movement virulently hostile to same-sex marriage. \"The Republicans were campaigning on a constitutional ban to same-sex marriage,\" Moran told The Nation . \"If you look, you know, exactly 20 years later, 2004 to 2024, the party has done a 180 degree flip.\"\n\nMoran largely credits former president Donald Trump for the removal, adding that there are, in his view, a small group of powerful and connected Republicans who leveraged their political and financial influence to keep opposition to same-sex marriage on the party's platform: Moran specifically named Heritage Foundation president and Project 2025 architect Kevin Roberts , as well as Tony Perkins , president of the anti-LGBT group Family Research Council. In spite of these figures' influence, the new platform, he says, brings the party's stance on same-sex marriage closer to the general Republican electorate.\n\nAccording to Dr. Don Haider-Markel, a University of Kansas political science professor who studies public opinion, the removal is driven by Trump's personal ambivalence toward same-sex marriage and the Republican Party's ability to use culture-war attacks against LGBTQ+ people, while simultaneously disengaging from a same-sex marriage debate that's already largely settled.\n\n\"They got what they wanted,\" Haider-Markel told The Nation . \"Being able to say they're anti-LGBTQ+, without having to keep sort of rehashing the same-sex marriage debate.\" He called it a \"cynical approach\" by far-right Republicans. \"They think the real threat of the LGBTQ community is its impact on their own children and families,\" Haider-Markel continued. \"As long as they can push back on things like what's available in public libraries and in public schools and can isolate their children from those influences they're okay with [same-sex marriage].\"\n\nThe removal comes as approval of same-sex marriage among Americans has dropped slightly in recent years-from 71 percent to 69 percent since 2022, according to a June 2024 Gallup poll . The decline is most pronounced among Republicans, who fell from 55 percent approving same-sex marriage in 2022 to 46 percent approving in 2024. Both Moran and Haider-Markel pointed to \"culture war\" issues to explain the decline, though they differed in their reasoning: Haider-Markel says Republicans may feel less pressure to support gay marriage amid a political climate more hostile to LGBTQ+ people, while Moran said the exposure of \"radical gender theory\" has engendered less sympathy toward gay marriage from America at large.\n\nBut even as Republicans removed formal opposition to same-sex marriage, they have also introduced a record numbers of anti-LGBTQ+ bills in recent years-510 in 2023 compared to 180 in 2022, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Though an increasing number of anti-trans bills are making their way across the nation, Moran says the Log Cabin is \"not cutting the transgender community out of our coalition,\" distinguishing what he views as \"radical gender theory\" from support for trans people broadly.\n\nParty higher-ups may disagree with Moran's sentiment. As he gave his first remarks at the RNC on July 18, Trump misgendered a swath of trans athletes when he promised that, under his administration, \"we will not have men playing in women's sports.\" Numerous other GOP mainstays, like Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson and Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, espoused hateful rhetoric toward trans people from the convention floor.\n\nHaider-Markel says that though the GOP's warmer attitude toward same-sex marriage could indicate that it might be willing to eventually modify an explicit opposition to transgender rights, Republicans have an electoral and political incentive to continue pushing anti-trans policy . \"It's gonna be a long time before this period of backlash against transgender folks ends,\" said Haider-Markel. \"Those kinds of successes in so-called blue areas really tell Republicans that this issue going forward is a good one to continue to push on, however they can.\"\n\nThe 2024 platform, too, does not endorse equal rights for LGBTQ+ people. In fact, the only mention of LGBTQ+ people is a section opposing \"left-wing gender insanity.\" Moran said he sees it as \"insulting\" to be asked how he felt about the lack of endorsement, and added that, given legal protections for LGBTQ+ people, the lack of endorsement does not bother him. \"I don't need a specific endorsement of my life by my party,\" said Moran. \"Democrats like to do that shit. We don't do that in the Republican Party.\"\n\nThough it may no longer be officially sanctioned by the party, GOP opposition to same-sex marriage is still common. In 2022, Congress introduced a bill to codify same-sex marriages into federal law-spurred by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' suggestion that the court should \"reconsider\" its Obergefell decision. More than 160 Republican representatives and 36 Republican senators voted against it. Trump's choice for vice president, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance , said that he would have voted against the bill had he been in office at the time.\n\nDemocrats, for their part, say that the Republican party is simply trying to mask a long-standing opposition to LGBTQ+ rights. \"Despite any changes to their convention platform, Republicans have made their priorities crystal clear in the states,\" Will Rusche, vice president of marketing and communications for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, told The Nation. \"Villainizing LGBTQ+ people and attacking their fundamental freedoms is a mainstay of the Republican party and we've seen over 1,000 anti-LGBTQ+ bills introduced in state legislatures in just the last two years alone.\" Iowa Republicans in 2023 filed a bill that would ban same-sex marriage in the state, and in 2022, Texas Republicans approved a party platform that opposed same-sex marriage and called homosexuality an \" an abnormal lifestyle choice .\"\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nFeature / Jess McAllen\n\nElie Mystal\n\nIn Wisconsin, the RNC host state, LGBTQ+ legislative caucus chair and Democratic state Senator Mark Spreitzer has fought since the Obergefell decision to remove numerous instances of statutory language that define marriage as between a man and woman. It's something he notes can affect programs like a \"husband and wife\" fishing license discount or ensuring that same-sex parents have parity in parental rights with heterosexual parents. Each time he has introduced a bill to do so, he told The Nation , it has died in legislative committees without receiving a committee vote or floor vote.\n\nWisconsin, in addition, is one of 25 states that still have non-enforceable statutory and constitutional bans on same-sex marriage, according to a 2022 report from the Movement Advancement Project, as Wisconsinites voted in 2006 to ban same-sex marriage through an amendment that still exists within the state's Constitution. Efforts from Spreitzer to remove that amendment-something that he notes could protect LGBTQ+ Wisconsinites' marriage rights, were Obergefell to be overturned-have been similarly stalled, he said.\n\nAmid many Wisconsin Republicans' hositility to LGBTQ+ rights, the RNC's removal of language around same-sex marriage is \"political theater,\" according to Spreitzer. \"I'll believe that Republicans have removed their opposition to same-sex marriage when they actually are ready to remove the ban on same-sex marriage from our state Constitution and our state statutes.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

The bill would ban gender-affirming care for trans minors, require them to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender at birth, recommend that teachers use incorrect pronouns, and limit education on \"human sexuality or sexually transmitted diseases.\"\n\nStill, it passed the House and the Senate. When Democratic Governor Andy Beshear vetoed the bill, saying it \"strips freedom from parents\" and will \"endanger the children of Kentucky,\" his veto was overridden. The bill finally passed on March 29. The same day, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky announced that it was planning to file a lawsuit against \"one of the worst anti-trans bills in the country.\"\n\n\"Implementing the restrictions proposed by SB 150 will not change the number of LGBTQ children in schools,\" said psychologist Laurie Grimes to lawmakers. \"They'll still be there, and they'll still have needs, but they will no longer be in a safe and accepting environment.\" Chris Hartman, director of the LGBTQ advocacy group the Fairness Campaign, was more forthright. \"You're going to kill kids,\" said Hartman. \"Their blood will be on your hands.\"\n\nWhen SB 150 was first introduced, the bill's main purpose was to force teachers to use pronouns related to a trans student's biological sex, rather than what they preferred. Amendments were filed aiming to give trans students an out by changing teachers or allowing parents to require that teachers use the student's chosen pronouns, but all six were ruled out of order. The bill was eventually combined with House Bill 470, called the \"Do No Harm Act,\" by the House Education Committee.\n\nA majority of the bill is dedicated to provisions that hinder trans students from comfortably living their day-to-day lives, forbidding them to use their preferred bathroom or locker room and encouraging the use of incorrect pronouns or names. \"People are really feeling not just the actual written effects of this law, but also what it means,\" said Oliver Hall, trans health director at Kentucky Health Justice Network. \"What it means to be a trans person in Kentucky at a time when they're actively targeting us.\"\n\nSection 4 of the bill, which eliminated access to gender-affirming care for trans minors, would have originally gone into effect on June 29. But it was temporarily blocked that same day by the ACLU's injunction, which was lifted in July. The rest of the bill will go into effect when the school year starts. \"It's the single most destructive bill I've seen in my life,\" said Willie Carver, a former high school teacher in Kentucky.\n\nSchools should be safe places for students. According to Carver, young people should be able to see that they're important, that they can achieve their wildest dreams. But for young trans children, they often face bullying and erasure from class content. Studies have found transgender individuals are statistically more likely to be diagnosed with a mental illness than the general population, and over six times as likely to seriously attempt suicide.\n\nActively taking a student's identity out of the curriculum itself is a violent act, Carver said, and the law takes it leaps and bounds farther. Some children in Louisville Youth Group, a nonprofit serving LGBTQ youth in Kentucky and Indiana, will have to de-transition, a process called \"exponentially harmful\" by LYG program director Em Joy. \"Despite the strong opposition of every major medical and mental health association, the new law prohibits parents, healthcare professionals, teachers, and clergy from working together to lovingly and privately provide support to transgender youth,\" said LYG in a statement in June.\n\nThe bill prides itself on its protections of parental rights, but parents of trans students are left reeling. \"As a parent, your goal is to support your child and give them opportunities to grow and find themselves,\" said Amanda Wilson. Her child, June Wagner, is trans and nonbinary. \"It hurt me because I knew it was gonna hurt my child.\"\n\nShe doesn't believe the government should get a say in how parents protect their kids. Legislation like this only puts a target on kids' backs, she said, and they end up being bullied or ostracized. \"I don't see the viewpoint of how this bill is going to protect other kids,\" said Wilson. \"I think it's gonna make it worse, not having a community that is as understanding or as supportive to all genders and all people.\"\n\nWagner, an incoming high school senior, said it was \"devastating\" to see the bill's success. With this bill, they said, the government has endorsed transphobic bullying. \"Suddenly it's all legal,\" Wagner said. \"Suddenly, your own legislators are bullying you and threatening you to take away your own medical rights and your school life, too. It's just shocking.\"\n\nJames and Rebecca Simpson, whose son is trans, don't see this bill as a protective measure; rather, they see it as the government stripping parents of their rights. Beyond that, James said, this bill tells trans kids they can't trust the adults in the room-that they have to hide. He saw the change in his son after his son came out to them, and he doesn't understand how denying him that could be seen as protection. \"They just become who they are, when they have the space to do that,\" said James. \"It just makes me so angry that is being vilified in the way it is, how cruel people can be when all anyone's asking is to just be themselves.\"\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nFeature / Jess McAllen\n\nJeet Heer\n\nThe bill also limits sex education, banning it from being taught below the fifth grade and having parents \"opt in\" from sixth to 12th grade. It's a move widely opposed by educators and advocates. Generally, sex education in elementary school is broken into two sections: kindergarten to second grade, and third to fifth grade, according to the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States' National Sex Education Standards. The focus is on learning about one's body, identifying unhealthy and abusive relationships and understanding gender identity, with older elementary students beginning to receive information about puberty.\n\nBut in \"opt-in\" sex education, parents have to actively sign off on their child's participation. This makes the content covered seem more dangerous and uncomfortable, which limits the program's usefulness, according to Valerie Sedivy, the director of capacity building and evaluation for the Healthy Teen Network. It's likely, she said, that the parents whose children most need this education won't sign off.\n\nSex education gives children mental, physical, and social benefits, said Sydelle Barreto, assistant director of federal policy for the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States. Children are taught how to say no, to see past gender stereotypes, and to name their anatomy without shame and stigma. It's empowering, said Barreto, and without it, children are vulnerable to harm. Studies have shown that students who receive comprehensive sex education are more likely to delay sexual initiation, reduce their number of sexual partners, and increase their condom or contraceptive use. It can also reduce gender-based and sexual violence.\n\nAfter the bill's introduction, some senators raised concerns that revealing children's chosen pronouns or expressed sexualities could expose children to abuse or other forms of harm. Senator Max Wise, who authored the bill, said that it's the job of the state to lay out \"basic freedoms.\" Local school districts can make their own decisions on whether they require schools to tell all parents everything, even if it's likely to lead to abuse. Jonathan Zimmerman, professor of education history at the University of Pennsylvania, called this the \"language of local control\" in what's becoming an increasingly federal talking point.\n\nKentucky isn't the only state to pass a bill like this-not even close. Gender-affirming care has been restricted in at least 18 states, and bills have been considered or introduced in 14 others. Florida's recent HB 1069 expands on last year's \"Don't Say Gay\" law and now, like SB 150, bans instruction on human sexuality, sexually transmitted diseases and related subjects before sixth grade. In Indiana , parents must give written consent to student name or pronoun changes, and teachers are prohibited from discussing sexual orientation and gender identity through the third grade. In Oklahoma , instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity are banned through fifth grade, with \"opt-in\" puberty education in fourth and fifth grade.\n\nThese bills don't just ban actions but also discussion of actions. \"If I was a schoolteacher now in this country, I would be extremely worried,\" Zimmerman said. Laws restricting what educators can say have become more and more ambiguous, and it's easier for many to avoid controversial subjects altogether. Laws banning any mention of these issues attempts to silence debate and discussion.\n\nBut the conversation's only just beginning. ACLU representative Angela Cooper said the organization expects to file more lawsuits as the school year begins. School districts face difficult choices, ones that could bring down the fire of a legal battle whether they decide to follow legislation to the letter or not, and while they've been deciding, lobbyists from Kentucky LGBTQ activist groups such as Louisville Youth Group and Fairness Campaign have protested outside school board meetings. Still, it's unclear how this school year will treat Kentucky students.\n\n\"Trans people belong in Kentucky,\" wrote the ACLU, \"and we will continue to fight for their right to equal protection under the law and freedom to access to the things they need to live full and authentic lives, as guaranteed by the national and state constitutions.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Among the episodes in the history of anti-gay discrimination and violence in the United States for which the Mattachine Society is seeking an apology from the American government is the arrest of 1 million gay men (one every 10 minutes) from the end of World War II through the 1960s on a wide range of indecency charges, including sodomy, dancing, kissing, or holding hands. There's also the Lavender Scare , the mid-century witch hunt triggered by President Eisenhower's 1953 executive order that resulted in the firing of some 10,000 federal workers on the suspicion of homosexuality. That was far more than were dismissed during the Red Scare, the persecution of federal workers suspected of being Communist or of being under the influence of Communism. Americans know even less about the use during the 1950s and '60s of \"gay conversion therapy\" at federal institutions, like Washington, D.C.'s St. Elizabeths Hospital, the first federally operated facility intended to treat the mentally ill. While under treatment at St. Elizabeths, an unknown number of federal workers suspected of homosexuality were subjected, against their will, to barbaric and experimental therapies such as lobotomies and insulin-induced comas with the intension of erasing or altering same-sex attraction.

By the time the policy was repealed, in 2011, it had caused the dismissal of 13,000 gays and lesbians from their jobs. The Mattachine resolution introduced this month comes on the heels of other acts of \"gay reparation\" at the state and local level. In 2019, the New York Police Department offered an apology for the 1969 violent raid at the Stonewall Inn, the event that sparked the Stonewall Riots. Soon after, the San Francisco Police Department offered its own apology for the Compton's Cafeteria riot of 1966, an act of resistance against police brutality by the transgender community. In 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a clemency initiative that allows LGBTQ Californians convicted for \"vagrancy, loitering, sodomy or other laws used to prosecute people for having consensual adult sex\" to apply for a pardon. Newsom also issued a posthumous pardon to the late civil rights leader Bayard Rustin for his arrest in 1953 after being seen having sex with another man in parked car. Because Americans know so little about the profound history of anti-LGBTQ discrimination in the United States, it's not surprising that there has been never been a national discussion about gay reparations. As a result of this, misconceptions and outright myths abound about what gay reparations actually are. Current Issue View our current issue Based on the experience of nations like Spain, Britain, and Germany, gay reparations are best understood as policies intended to make amends for a history of systemic anti-gay discrimination. But the movement is not one-size-fits-all; nor is it driven by gay people demanding financial compensation simply for claiming an LGBTQ identity, as some foes of the gay community have contended . Instead, the gay reparations movement encompasses a small but eclectic constellation of approaches to repairing the damage done by state-sponsored anti-gay discrimination and violence, with each approach entailing its own policies and philosophical emphases for how to repair that damage. Among gay reparations, \"atonement\" is the most popular, and, arguably, the least controversial. It requires only an official apology from the government that conveys an admission of wrongdoing and a pledge to do better going forward. Britain 's Alan Turing Law , enacted in 2017, pioneered this approach. It granted an apology and a posthumous pardon to some 65,000 men convicted of homosexual offenses, of whom 15,000 were still alive. The law honors the memory of the brilliant mathematician credited with accelerating the end of World War II by cracking Germany's military codes. Turing was sentenced to chemical castration in 1952 for having admitted to a consensual sexual relationship with another man. He was also fired from his government job. Thrown into despair by the nation for which he had done so much for, Turing reportedly committed suicide in 1954. Britain has also apologized for exporting its homophobic laws to its former colonial possessions. Also prominent is \"rehabilitation,\" which seeks to restore the character and reputation of those persecuted for their sexual orientation and gender identity. In Spain , LGBTQ people are allowed to petition for \"moral rehabilitation,\" which includes expunging any records that may have resulted from a criminal prosecution. There's also \"compensation,\" which entails financial payment to the victims of anti-gay discrimination for the loss of wages and pensions that may have resulted from time spent in prison or in a mental institution because of homophobic laws and policies. Canada and Germany are two prominent examples. In both cases, the government established a fund to be disbursed to anyone claiming financial harm because of prosecution for a homosexual offense. Rounding out gay reparations are \"remembrance,\" or the commemoration of past events of anti-gay discrimination and repression, such as Germany's memorial to the homosexual men who perished in concentration camps (the so-called \"Gay Holocaust), and \"truth-telling,\" which demands a state-sanctioned narrative that speaks of systemic abuse toward the gay community. Two factors in global politics account for the seemingly sudden rise of the gay reparations movement. The first one is that \"reparations\" is now a better and more widely understood concept. A second and less apparent factor is the advent of what some have called the \" Age of Apology .\" This includes nations apologizing to other nations, but also governments apologizing to their own citizens for historical injustices. Ultimately, however, the main driver behind gay reparations is found within the gay rights movement itself and its struggle for \"full citizenship.\" Traditionally, scholars such as T.H. Marshall have defined citizenship as a legal status that emphasizes rights protected by the state and responsibilities to society at large, such as the right to vote and the chance to own property. But in recent years, a more expansive definition of citizenship has emerged that seeks to sketch the non-legal dimensions of citizenship, such as dignity and respect, and more generally a sense of belonging within the political community. It is this newer understanding of citizenship that is driving the gay reparations movement abroad and at home. Success for the Mattachine resolution in Congress is far from certain. A more modest resolution, the \" Lavender Offense Victim Exoneration Act ,\" or LOVE Act, introduced in 2017 that would compel the federal government to review employee terminations at the State Department during the 1950s and 1960s \"due to their actual or perceived sexual orientation\" went nowhere in a Republican-controlled Senate. But there's reason to hope. The current reckoning with racial injustice should remind Americans that racism and homophobia have always traveled hand-in-hand in American history, a point underscored by the propensity of white supremacists to label civil rights leaders \"homos\" and \"queers.\" Moreover, when it comes to gay rights, the United States is slower than many other democracies. By the time marriage equality became US law nationwide, some 20 nations had already legalized gay marriage. The call for gay reparations offers yet another reminder of how steep a climb the American struggle for LGBTQ equality continues to be.\n\nChampioned by the Mattachine Society of Washington, D.C., an organization that takes its name from the pre-Stonewall era group that sought to advance gay civil rights, the resolution was inspired by previous official apologies in American history, including the Acknowledgement and Regret for the Chinese Exclusion Laws (2012), an apology to Japanese-Americans sent to internment camps during World War II (1988), and the apologies issued to African Americans for slavery and Jim Crow by the US House of Representatives and the US Senate in 2008 and 2009, respectively.

A second and less apparent factor is the advent of what some have called the \" Age of Apology .\" This includes nations apologizing to other nations, but also governments apologizing to their own citizens for historical injustices. Ultimately, however, the main driver behind gay reparations is found within the gay rights movement itself and its struggle for \"full citizenship.\" Traditionally, scholars such as T.H. Marshall have defined citizenship as a legal status that emphasizes rights protected by the state and responsibilities to society at large, such as the right to vote and the chance to own property. But in recent years, a more expansive definition of citizenship has emerged that seeks to sketch the non-legal dimensions of citizenship, such as dignity and respect, and more generally a sense of belonging within the political community. It is this newer understanding of citizenship that is driving the gay reparations movement abroad and at home. Success for the Mattachine resolution in Congress is far from certain. A more modest resolution, the \" Lavender Offense Victim Exoneration Act ,\" or LOVE Act, introduced in 2017 that would compel the federal government to review employee terminations at the State Department during the 1950s and 1960s \"due to their actual or perceived sexual orientation\" went nowhere in a Republican-controlled Senate. But there's reason to hope. The current reckoning with racial injustice should remind Americans that racism and homophobia have always traveled hand-in-hand in American history, a point underscored by the propensity of white supremacists to label civil rights leaders \"homos\" and \"queers.\" Moreover, when it comes to gay rights, the United States is slower than many other democracies. By the time marriage equality became US law nationwide, some 20 nations had already legalized gay marriage. The call for gay reparations offers yet another reminder of how steep a climb the American struggle for LGBTQ equality continues to be.\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nFeature / Jess McAllen\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nFeature / Jess McAllen\n\nJeet Heer\n\nThe extent to which many Americans are familiar with official anti-gay discrimination is likely limited to \" don't ask don't tell ,\" the infamous 1993 policy that allowed gays and lesbians to serve in the military as long as they kept their sexual orientation a secret. By the time the policy was repealed, in 2011, it had caused the dismissal of 13,000 gays and lesbians from their jobs. The Mattachine resolution introduced this month comes on the heels of other acts of \"gay reparation\" at the state and local level. In 2019, the New York Police Department offered an apology for the 1969 violent raid at the Stonewall Inn, the event that sparked the Stonewall Riots. Soon after, the San Francisco Police Department offered its own apology for the Compton's Cafeteria riot of 1966, an act of resistance against police brutality by the transgender community. In 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a clemency initiative that allows LGBTQ Californians convicted for \"vagrancy, loitering, sodomy or other laws used to prosecute people for having consensual adult sex\" to apply for a pardon. Newsom also issued a posthumous pardon to the late civil rights leader Bayard Rustin for his arrest in 1953 after being seen having sex with another man in parked car. Because Americans know so little about the profound history of anti-LGBTQ discrimination in the United States, it's not surprising that there has been never been a national discussion about gay reparations. As a result of this, misconceptions and outright myths abound about what gay reparations actually are. Current Issue View our current issue Based on the experience of nations like Spain, Britain, and Germany, gay reparations are best understood as policies intended to make amends for a history of systemic anti-gay discrimination. But the movement is not one-size-fits-all; nor is it driven by gay people demanding financial compensation simply for claiming an LGBTQ identity, as some foes of the gay community have contended . Instead, the gay reparations movement encompasses a small but eclectic constellation of approaches to repairing the damage done by state-sponsored anti-gay discrimination and violence, with each approach entailing its own policies and philosophical emphases for how to repair that damage. Among gay reparations, \"atonement\" is the most popular, and, arguably, the least controversial. It requires only an official apology from the government that conveys an admission of wrongdoing and a pledge to do better going forward. Britain 's Alan Turing Law , enacted in 2017, pioneered this approach. It granted an apology and a posthumous pardon to some 65,000 men convicted of homosexual offenses, of whom 15,000 were still alive. The law honors the memory of the brilliant mathematician credited with accelerating the end of World War II by cracking Germany's military codes. Turing was sentenced to chemical castration in 1952 for having admitted to a consensual sexual relationship with another man. He was also fired from his government job. Thrown into despair by the nation for which he had done so much for, Turing reportedly committed suicide in 1954. Britain has also apologized for exporting its homophobic laws to its former colonial possessions. Also prominent is \"rehabilitation,\" which seeks to restore the character and reputation of those persecuted for their sexual orientation and gender identity. In Spain , LGBTQ people are allowed to petition for \"moral rehabilitation,\" which includes expunging any records that may have resulted from a criminal prosecution. There's also \"compensation,\" which entails financial payment to the victims of anti-gay discrimination for the loss of wages and pensions that may have resulted from time spent in prison or in a mental institution because of homophobic laws and policies. Canada and Germany are two prominent examples. In both cases, the government established a fund to be disbursed to anyone claiming financial harm because of prosecution for a homosexual offense. Rounding out gay reparations are \"remembrance,\" or the commemoration of past events of anti-gay discrimination and repression, such as Germany's memorial to the homosexual men who perished in concentration camps (the so-called \"Gay Holocaust), and \"truth-telling,\" which demands a state-sanctioned narrative that speaks of systemic abuse toward the gay community.

A more modest resolution, the \" Lavender Offense Victim Exoneration Act ,\" or LOVE Act, introduced in 2017 that would compel the federal government to review employee terminations at the State Department during the 1950s and 1960s \"due to their actual or perceived sexual orientation\" went nowhere in a Republican-controlled Senate. But there's reason to hope. The current reckoning with racial injustice should remind Americans that racism and homophobia have always traveled hand-in-hand in American history, a point underscored by the propensity of white supremacists to label civil rights leaders \"homos\" and \"queers.\" Moreover, when it comes to gay rights, the United States is slower than many other democracies. By the time marriage equality became US law nationwide, some 20 nations had already legalized gay marriage. The call for gay reparations offers yet another reminder of how steep a climb the American struggle for LGBTQ equality continues to be.\n\nSuccess for the Mattachine resolution in Congress is far from certain.

When her child came out as nonbinary, they had a \"pretty decent\" time at their public school. Leslie (a pseudonym) wasn't surprised: Massachusetts has long prided itself on being at the leading edge of LGBTQ equality. In 2003, it became the first state to legalize marriage equality, and over the past 15 years it has passed laws that prohibit discrimination against trans people and ban conversion therapy. As red and purple states have been consumed by fights over bathroom bans and gender-affirming care for minors, Massachusetts has charted a different course, enshrining the right to such care. In 2023, Maura Healey became the nation's first openly lesbian governor in the country and declared the state a \"safe haven\" for the LGBTQ community.\n\nBut beneath the surface, a hard core of far-right activists are taking aim at the rights of LGBTQ kids in towns and school districts around the state, an inch-by-inch strategy that avoids statewide fights. Over the past four years, Tanya Neslusan, the executive director of Mass­Equality, a leading grassroots LGBTQ advocacy organization, has attended more than 60 school committee meetings and other events where anti-LGBTQ organizers were trying to make inroads. Neslusan has fought a ban on pride flags in Pembroke, a ban on drag events in North Brookfield, and extremist school committee candidates in Seekonk. Even unsuccessful anti-LGBTQ campaigns have an impact, Neslusan said: They can build name recognition for local candidates and desensitize people to extremist rhetoric, while provoking alarm among children and families who are already facing challenges. For kids facing queer- and transphobia in their communities, the statehouse can feel very far away. Neslusan thinks that conservatives are doing this not in spite of Massachusetts's reputation as a safe haven but because of it. \"If you get this information to catch on in Massachusetts, which is widely considered to be one of the more progressive states in the country,\" they said, \"you can get it to catch on anywhere.\"\n\nOne of the key groups orchestrating the attacks is the Massachusetts Family Institute. Michael King, the organization's acting CEO and director of community alliances, described it as a grassroots group. \"Parental advocacy groups are just organically popping up,\" he said. But the \"non-partisan public policy organization,\" as MFI calls itself on its website, is in fact deeply connected to national conservative groups. Founded in 1991, MFI is a designated state affiliate of the Family Research Council, the $24 million far-right organization that promotes conversion therapy and calls LGBTQ people pedophiles. MFI's website also recommends resources for promoting religion in schools from \"our friends at Alliance Defending Freedom,\" the legal group known for bringing the case that overturned Roe v. Wade . When a middle-school student in Middleborough was prohibited from wearing a transphobic T-shirt, MFI teamed up with ADF to sue the district. As attacks on trans kids have become a central plank in Republican platforms, MFI's budget has grown. For about 10 years, the organization's revenues had hovered around $500,000 a year, but in 2021, its funding increased by 50 percent. The number of staff has doubled since 2020.\n\nIn 2023, as the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education prepared to release new health education standards recommending, for example, that students learn about gender identity, they received about 3,000 comments via e-mail during a public feedback period. Ninety-three percent of the comments were based on a script provided by MFI complaining that the standards would \"teach students that they can change their gender.\" The board ultimately adopted the new standards. But Massachusetts still has not passed the Healthy Youth Act, which would require that all schools teaching sex ed use curriculums that comport with those health education standards.\n\nIn Ludlow, a farm town turned suburb in western Massachusetts, the middle school agreed to remove a couple of library books containing sexual references in fall 2019. But when a parents' group associated with MFI insisted that the school also remove a puberty-themed book (\"about bodies, feelings, and YOU!\") the middle-school librarian, Jordan Funke, refused. The school's policy was to evaluate the books before ditching them, and that process hadn't happened yet. Besides, Funke was trying to create an inclusive environment for students-inviting them to provide their pronouns, for example-and the book contained valuable information about LGBTQ identity.\n\nThat was a problem for some parents. It was also a problem for Funke's colleagues. In November 2019, an educator named Bonnie Manchester spearheaded a letter from 19 fellow middle-school teachers accusing Funke of promoting \"promiscuity\" via library books. \"These students are minors,\" they wrote, \"and we are there to protect them from sexual exploitation.\" Funke, who is nonbinary, filed a complaint claiming that Manchester was targeting them for their perceived gender and sexual orientation.\n\nThen, about a year into the pandemic, two siblings at the school came out as genderqueer and trans. Both asked that no one tell their parents right away, and the administration agreed: State guidance reminds schools that some trans students \"are not openly so at home for reasons such as safety concerns or lack of acceptance.\" Indeed, a counselor noted at the time, the elder \"finds it hard to talk to [their] Dad sometimes because of the way he reacts.\"\n\nBonnie Manchester told the students' parents anyway, and without consulting either administrators or the students themselves. Livid, the parents joined the newly revitalized book-banning group, which reached out to an organization called MassResistance to distribute flyers around town (\"Teachers and counselors are manipulating students to believe they can become opposite [sic] sex\"). When the parents met with the Ludlow superintendent in April, they brought MassResistance president Brian Camenker with them.\n\nEven by the standards of conservative activism, this was an escalation. Camenker, who founded his group in 1995 as the Parents' Rights Coalition, has attended \"straight pride\" rallies alongside white nationalists, denied that gay people died in the Holocaust, compared advocates for LGBT youth to Nazi concentration camp guards, and linked homosexuality to pedophilia and bestiality. In 2010, the Southern Poverty Law Center named MassResistance as one of 18 groups comprising \"the hard core of the anti-gay movement.\"\n\nFunke, the librarian, decided to quit that spring . But their ordeal wasn't over. In a 13-part series on the MassResistance site, Camenker repeatedly referred to them as \"a weird woman who dressed as a man\" and accused them of indoctrinating students. And in April 2022, a lawsuit from the Massachusetts Family Institute arrived: The parents had filed a complaint against Funke, a school counselor, the principal, the former superintendent, the interim superintendent, and the school committee. Using their kids' preferred names and pronouns, the plaintiffs argued, was a form of mental health treatment, and keeping the kids' identities confidential interfered with the parents' due-process rights to direct their upbringing. Among the more specific allegations: that the counselor called their younger child \"brave and awesome\" after they came out and that Funke had directed them to online resources about gender identity. The plaintiffs claimed that the latter constituted grooming.\n\nThe case was initially thrown out of court-calling someone what they want to be called isn't health care, the judge said, and the state has broad authority to regulate education-but is now under appeal at the First Circuit.\n\nUntil recently, conservative groups \"knew that anti-LGBT messaging was not popular,\" said Megara Bell, the director of the Boston-based organization Partners in Sex Education. But over the past few years, it's become more acceptable to target LGBTQ people more directly. \"This is happening in so many communities, in so many states,\" said Erica, another Natick parent who asked to use a pseudonym to protect her nonbinary child's privacy. \"There's a playbook for it. There's a blueprint to do it.\" And it isn't happening only in red states, or only in red towns and cities. The pandemic threw fuel on the fire. \"All of a sudden there were a whole lot of people with time on their hands,\" Bell said-time spent absorbing disinformation campaigns. On the Internet, Bell said, it was easy to find people to affirm your anger about masks in schools while introducing new lies about the education system: that teachers were \"transing\" your children, for example. If you cared about one issue, Bell said, the Internet would \"radicalize you on every other issue.\"\n\nAfter her child's coming out, Leslie was alarmed when parents at a middle-school council meeting in February 2023 began to complain about the school district's DEI programs. Speakers at a PFLAG assembly had told students \"to affirm, celebrate, and embrace\" their peers rather than \"follow their faith,\" one parent, Pam Ahern, complained. By fall 2023, Ahern's \"group of moms\" had become a 501(c)(4) organization, Parental Rights Natick-with the chair of the Republican Town Committee acting as treasurer. The group spent the winter promoting a school committee candidate named James Roberts, who proposed forcing schools to out gender-questioning students to their parents. Then, shortly before the election, the district received a 15-page letter from an out-of-state lawyer best known for his attempt to block the counting of electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election. The letter threatened legal action if the district did not change its policy protecting trans students' confidentiality. Roberts's campaign posted coyly on Facebook: \"Cease and desist served?\"\n\nRoberts lost the election, garnering only 19 percent of the vote. But the community is still reeling. \"When you dehumanize an entire group of people, that makes violence a lot easier,\" said Erica. \"We're scared for our kids.\"\n\nAnd parents are scared for their public schools, too. During a candidate forum, Roberts echoed MFI talking points, claiming that faith communities had an important role to play in public schools. To combat antisemitism, schools should teach about Judaism, he said-but added that parents should be able to pull their kids out of those lessons, too. \"Does that mean when the teachers are referring to my child as 'they,' that other child has to leave?\" asked Erica. \"Does that mean you can opt out when schools talk about evolution? Can you opt out when they start talking about how the world is round?\" Such a policy, she said, would be impossible to implement.\n\nBut right-wing activists don't have a problem setting public schools up to fail. As MFI has disparaged public schools as hotbeds of \"indoctrination and sexualization,\" it's also pushed for the expansion of religious alternatives: homeschooling, church-based learning centers, and \"biblically based schools.\" The strategy is clear, said Megara Bell: Sex education-and LGBTQ inclusion-are being used as wedge issues \"to undermine faith in public education, which then undermines funding for public education.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Once a cornerstone of the city's queer community, the event was canceled in both 2020 and 2021 due to Covid. For most of the pandemic, the state's largest pride marches were confined to private, socially distanced gatherings. After two years of waiting, Pride in 2022 has been especially grandiose, with 100,000 people from Cincinnati and the greater metropolitan area in attendance. But the day's proceedings were lent a surreal quality by the wider social context. On June 24, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade , ignoring half a century of precedent and threatening the bodily autonomy of millions of people. But the court didn't stop at abortion. In the majority opinion, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that SCOTUS should reconsider \"substantive due process precedents, including Griswold , Lawrence , and Obergefell ,\" the cases that protected contraception, ended the enforcement of sodomy laws, and legalized same-sex marriage. Simultaneously, conservative rhetoric towards the LGBTQ+ community has escalated, with a wave of anti-trans and \" Don't Say Gay \" bills sweeping through statehouses across the country. These conflicting realities represent the horrifying contradictions that define American life. How can a queer person celebrate Pride, and embrace the assumptions made by that act of celebration, as the country swings further to the right? It's a question that Lexi Willis, a 20-year-old who will be a student at the University of Cincinnati this fall, has asked. Willis could only find one word to describe how they felt after the Supreme Court's decision: numb. \"We're seeing a reversal of that progress, in real time. In an age where we, Gen-Z, are supposed to be living in a world more tolerant than the one our parents and grandparents had.\" They have other reasons to be concerned. Willis is bisexual and a demigirl-someone who identifies as both female and agender. Unlike some of her peers, Lexi \"never had a coming out moment.\" Rather, they \"just stopped denying it and went from there.\" Fortunately, Willis found a community of people who cared for her, both online and off, which is why she found Thomas's comments on Obergefell and Lawrence so alarming. Willis was a teenager when same-sex marriage was first legalized. \"I remember my friend immediately texting me, crying, and just [being] so happy. I wasn't even out yet and I understood.\" The thought that the United States might revert back was shocking. \"How can I imagine my life without those rights?\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → Want to Understand the New Cold War?

Current Issue View our current issue \"I don't feel represented fully by the Democratic Party,\" said Willis. Without firm opposition, they believe those rights will soon be revoked, and that the worst is yet to come. \"This is the beginning of something a lot deeper, a lot more sinister, and I don't wish to find out in what way.\" This feeling permeates every corner of Cincinnati's young, queer community. Lauren Ulsh, like Willis, is bisexual, but described their gender identity as \"much more complicated.\" Ulsh went to Columbus for their first Pride event, saying it felt rewarding, but isolating. \"This is the only bubble I can be myself in, and everywhere else is unsafe, and the bubble is rather fragile.\" Ulsh worries about Obergefell and Lawrence being overturned in their lifetime, calling politicians \"so far removed from today's society that it feels like nothing we say right now will mean anything.\" Ulsh is similarly critical of the Biden administration and the Democratic Party's ability to stop the tide of hate. \"I don't trust Biden or anyone else in office right now, apart from a select few-like AOC.\" Jim Obergefell-the lead plaintiff in the Obergefell v. Hodges case that made same-sex marriage legal nationwide-is also worried about the future. He is now 56, and is currently running for Ohio's 89th district. Obergefell made his fears about the consequences of the Dobbs decision widely known, warning that LGBTQ rights are next on the chopping block, with public violence against queer people -like Patriot Front's planned riot at a Pride event in Idaho and the Proud Boys protesting in Nevada-becoming more frequent. \"We will see continued attacks on our community, both in governing bodies and on the streets\" led by figures who \"do not believe the LGBTQ community deserves equality, or equity.\" Obergefell was critical of some of the Democratic Party's strategy in recent years, such as the choice by Nancy Pelosi, James Clyburn, and other party leaders to campaign for Henry Cellular, one of the only anti-abortion Democrats in the House. \"It's not a decision I would have made,\" he said, but Obergefell still insisted people should \"vote in every election\" to create governing bodies which \"look like us, and share our values.\" In 2020, an analysis from The Washington Post found that if \"LGBT voters stayed home, Trump might have won the 2020 presidential election.\" Samael Nasir, a drag performer, is far more cynical about the electoral process. Nasir has been frightened by the increased demonization that drag performers have faced from Republican politicians. \"It's scary to see the parallels in history of bad people in power finding marginalized groups to torment, before moving in to actively harm them.\" Nevertheless, Nasir doesn't think voting will be the solution, and says that Democrats should stop behaving as if it is. \"We voted for the 'right' people-like we were told-and we have them currently sitting on their hands watching the right mow over our rights like a weedy yard, just to turn around and beg for donations.\" Instead of contributing to politicians who fundraise off these issues while failing to meaningfully act, Nasir suggests helping queer people directly. \"March with them when they organize. Re-share their fundraisers and crowdfunds and individual payment info.\" When asked if the danger posed by the far right would stop them from celebrating at Pride, Lauren Ulsh scoffed at the idea. \"I do think public Pride events are getting more and more dangerous, but it will never deter me from celebrating who I am with people like me.\" \"The events are called Pride for a reason, and surrender is the worst possible move right now. Nasir echoed that sentiment. \"You can't get rid of queer people. You can run them into hiding, but history proves that we thrived in the underground communities we were forced to build-when our regular ones no longer serviced us.

How can a queer person celebrate Pride, and embrace the assumptions made by that act of celebration, as the country swings further to the right? It's a question that Lexi Willis, a 20-year-old who will be a student at the University of Cincinnati this fall, has asked. Willis could only find one word to describe how they felt after the Supreme Court's decision: numb. \"We're seeing a reversal of that progress, in real time. In an age where we, Gen-Z, are supposed to be living in a world more tolerant than the one our parents and grandparents had.\" They have other reasons to be concerned. Willis is bisexual and a demigirl-someone who identifies as both female and agender. Unlike some of her peers, Lexi \"never had a coming out moment.\" Rather, they \"just stopped denying it and went from there.\" Fortunately, Willis found a community of people who cared for her, both online and off, which is why she found Thomas's comments on Obergefell and Lawrence so alarming. Willis was a teenager when same-sex marriage was first legalized. \"I remember my friend immediately texting me, crying, and just [being] so happy. I wasn't even out yet and I understood.\" The thought that the United States might revert back was shocking. \"How can I imagine my life without those rights?\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → Want to Understand the New Cold War?

Current Issue View our current issue \"I don't feel represented fully by the Democratic Party,\" said Willis. Without firm opposition, they believe those rights will soon be revoked, and that the worst is yet to come. \"This is the beginning of something a lot deeper, a lot more sinister, and I don't wish to find out in what way.\" This feeling permeates every corner of Cincinnati's young, queer community. Lauren Ulsh, like Willis, is bisexual, but described their gender identity as \"much more complicated.\" Ulsh went to Columbus for their first Pride event, saying it felt rewarding, but isolating. \"This is the only bubble I can be myself in, and everywhere else is unsafe, and the bubble is rather fragile.\" Ulsh worries about Obergefell and Lawrence being overturned in their lifetime, calling politicians \"so far removed from today's society that it feels like nothing we say right now will mean anything.\" Ulsh is similarly critical of the Biden administration and the Democratic Party's ability to stop the tide of hate. \"I don't trust Biden or anyone else in office right now, apart from a select few-like AOC.\" Jim Obergefell-the lead plaintiff in the Obergefell v. Hodges case that made same-sex marriage legal nationwide-is also worried about the future. He is now 56, and is currently running for Ohio's 89th district. Obergefell made his fears about the consequences of the Dobbs decision widely known, warning that LGBTQ rights are next on the chopping block, with public violence against queer people -like Patriot Front's planned riot at a Pride event in Idaho and the Proud Boys protesting in Nevada-becoming more frequent. \"We will see continued attacks on our community, both in governing bodies and on the streets\" led by figures who \"do not believe the LGBTQ community deserves equality, or equity.\" Obergefell was critical of some of the Democratic Party's strategy in recent years, such as the choice by Nancy Pelosi, James Clyburn, and other party leaders to campaign for Henry Cellular, one of the only anti-abortion Democrats in the House. \"It's not a decision I would have made,\" he said, but Obergefell still insisted people should \"vote in every election\" to create governing bodies which \"look like us, and share our values.\" In 2020, an analysis from The Washington Post found that if \"LGBT voters stayed home, Trump might have won the 2020 presidential election.\" Samael Nasir, a drag performer, is far more cynical about the electoral process. Nasir has been frightened by the increased demonization that drag performers have faced from Republican politicians. \"It's scary to see the parallels in history of bad people in power finding marginalized groups to torment, before moving in to actively harm them.\" Nevertheless, Nasir doesn't think voting will be the solution, and says that Democrats should stop behaving as if it is. \"We voted for the 'right' people-like we were told-and we have them currently sitting on their hands watching the right mow over our rights like a weedy yard, just to turn around and beg for donations.\" Instead of contributing to politicians who fundraise off these issues while failing to meaningfully act, Nasir suggests helping queer people directly. \"March with them when they organize. Re-share their fundraisers and crowdfunds and individual payment info.\" When asked if the danger posed by the far right would stop them from celebrating at Pride, Lauren Ulsh scoffed at the idea. \"I do think public Pride events are getting more and more dangerous, but it will never deter me from celebrating who I am with people like me.\" \"The events are called Pride for a reason, and surrender is the worst possible move right now.

Nasir has been frightened by the increased demonization that drag performers have faced from Republican politicians. \"It's scary to see the parallels in history of bad people in power finding marginalized groups to torment, before moving in to actively harm them.\" Nevertheless, Nasir doesn't think voting will be the solution, and says that Democrats should stop behaving as if it is. \"We voted for the 'right' people-like we were told-and we have them currently sitting on their hands watching the right mow over our rights like a weedy yard, just to turn around and beg for donations.\" Instead of contributing to politicians who fundraise off these issues while failing to meaningfully act, Nasir suggests helping queer people directly. \"March with them when they organize. Re-share their fundraisers and crowdfunds and individual payment info.\" When asked if the danger posed by the far right would stop them from celebrating at Pride, Lauren Ulsh scoffed at the idea. \"I do think public Pride events are getting more and more dangerous, but it will never deter me from celebrating who I am with people like me.\" \"The events are called Pride for a reason, and surrender is the worst possible move right now. Nasir echoed that sentiment. \"You can't get rid of queer people. You can run them into hiding, but history proves that we thrived in the underground communities we were forced to build-when our regular ones no longer serviced us. To be a queer person is to be defiant.\"\n\n\"This is the only bubble I can be myself in, and everywhere else is unsafe, and the bubble is rather fragile.\" Ulsh worries about Obergefell and Lawrence being overturned in their lifetime, calling politicians \"so far removed from today's society that it feels like nothing we say right now will mean anything.\" Ulsh is similarly critical of the Biden administration and the Democratic Party's ability to stop the tide of hate. \"I don't trust Biden or anyone else in office right now, apart from a select few-like AOC.\" Jim Obergefell-the lead plaintiff in the Obergefell v. Hodges case that made same-sex marriage legal nationwide-is also worried about the future. He is now 56, and is currently running for Ohio's 89th district. Obergefell made his fears about the consequences of the Dobbs decision widely known, warning that LGBTQ rights are next on the chopping block, with public violence against queer people -like Patriot Front's planned riot at a Pride event in Idaho and the Proud Boys protesting in Nevada-becoming more frequent. \"We will see continued attacks on our community, both in governing bodies and on the streets\" led by figures who \"do not believe the LGBTQ community deserves equality, or equity.\" Obergefell was critical of some of the Democratic Party's strategy in recent years, such as the choice by Nancy Pelosi, James Clyburn, and other party leaders to campaign for Henry Cellular, one of the only anti-abortion Democrats in the House. \"It's not a decision I would have made,\" he said, but Obergefell still insisted people should \"vote in every election\" to create governing bodies which \"look like us, and share our values.\" In 2020, an analysis from The Washington Post found that if \"LGBT voters stayed home, Trump might have won the 2020 presidential election.\" Samael Nasir, a drag performer, is far more cynical about the electoral process.

      "text": "15 LGBTQ Books for Kids and Teens Recommended by Queer Librarians, Educators, and Independent Booksellers\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe independently review everything we recommend. When you buy through our links, we may earn a commission. Learn more ›\n\nBy Caitlin Giddings\n\nWe first published this piece in 2022. We've updated this guide to correct broken links and outdated prices.\n\nRecent book bans censor discussions on sexuality and gender identity with young people. But many kids today are growing up with queer parents and other extended family members, as well as in communities with queer families and classmates. Silencing basic information prevents them from understanding their world, fictionalizes reality for all kids-and further erases those who are LGBTQ.\n\nI would know. In 1993, my school district drew nationwide attention for removing and banning Annie on My Mind -one of the first young adult novels about two girls who fall in love-at a time when I was beginning to struggle with my own identity. Reading books about LGBTQ life and identity shows all children how others live, while also holding up a mirror for some kids to see themselves, said Nicole Champoux, a Montessori school administrator and teacher in Washington state. And today there are hundreds of age-appropriate children's books exploring queer families, history, gender expression, and more.\n\nBut for those of us who grew up in eras when those books didn't exist-or in communities where they weren't yet accessible-it can be hard to know where to start in choosing books for our own kids. We asked Champoux, as well as a dozen other queer librarians, educators, and booksellers, for their reading recommendations for kids of all ages. Here are their picks, along with options to support independent, queer-owned bookstores.\n\nBodies Are Cool written and illustrated by Tyler Feder (about $12 at the time of publication)\n\nAlso available at Charis Books & More ($19 at the time of publication)\n\nBodies Are Cool is a body-positive picture book that takes a casual approach to queer representation. It depicts a diverse array of bodies-of all shapes, sizes, races, and genders, including post-top-surgery trans bodies-paired with playful rhyming text. The book doesn't focus on LGBTQ kids specifically, but Sara Luce Look , co-owner of Charis Books & More in Decatur, Georgia, found that it had the perfect inclusive message about anatomy. \"The biggest need we were having was for books on puberty or how to talk about bodies,\" Luce Look said. \"We love this one-it's important for all kids to see different kinds of bodies, and to see fat bodies and disabled bodies and different types of people interacting with each other in all different kinds of ways.\"\n\nFederico and All His Families by Mili Hernández, illustrated by Gómez ($10 at the time of publication)\n\nAlso available at Unabridged Bookstore ($10 at the time of publication)\n\nAs kids with LGBTQ parents begin socializing, they learn early that their family structures aren't the norm. In my family's experience, this growing awareness came from both media and simple observation of the larger community-but also from other young children's repeated insistence that it's impossible to have more than one mom or dad. That's why picture books that serve to normalize different family structures-like Federico and All His Families -are so important for all toddler- and preschool-age kids. The colorful board book tells the story of a helpful neighborhood cat who visits different families as they prepare to start their day, including families with two moms and two dads, a single-parent family, and one with grandparents raising a child. Kate Wilson, children's book buyer at Unabridged Bookstore in Chicago, recommends it as a form of \"incidental representation\" that introduces the concept of family diversity without making it the sole focus of the story.\n\nA Family Is a Family Is a Family by Sara O'Leary, illustrated by Qin Leng ($18 at the time of publication)\n\nAlso available at Unabridged Bookstore ($20 at the time of publication)\n\nFor a more straightforward depiction of family diversity, Naomi Socher-Lerner , children's librarian at the Free Library of Philadelphia, said A Family Is a Family Is a Family is \"a bit on the nose, but very sweet.\" The picture book tells the story of a class of kids asked to share what makes their families special. A young narrator is initially afraid that her family might be too different to include, but she's soon proved wrong by other kids' comical depictions of their own diverse households, including families with divorced parents, foster kids, lots of grandparents, two dads, and two moms who are \"terrible singers\" but nevertheless \"love to sing really loud.\"\n\nWhen Aidan Became a Brother by Kyle Lukoff, illustrated by Kaylani Juanita ($14 at the time of publication)\n\nAlso available at Women & Children First ($20 at the time of publication)\n\nWhen Aidan Became a Brother is recommended by multiple queer librarians and booksellers for its heartwarming tale of a family navigating their son's emerging trans identity while they prepare to welcome a second child. \"When Aidan was born, everyone thought he was a girl,\" the book starts. But as Aidan grew older, he began to realize he was \"a different type of boy.\" Although \"it was hard to tell his parents what he knew about himself, it was even harder not to.\" Sarah Hollenbeck, co-owner of the Women & Children First bookstore in Chicago, said parents of trans kids have picked up the book and really responded to its generous spirit. \"(Aidan's) parents have this beautiful moment of accountability with their child about having made some mistakes by raising him in the wrong gender,\" Hollenbeck said. \"I am so grateful to have that kind of message in the world.\" Wilson agreed that the book portrays family support of a trans kid with empathy and depth. \"It has such emotional intelligence-I can't recommend this one highly enough,\" they said.\n\nJulián Is a Mermaid and Julián at the Wedding written and illustrated by Jessica Love (about $10 and $13 at the time of publication)\n\nAlso available at BookWoman ( each book is $17 for hardcover at the time of publication)\n\nJulián Is a Mermaid and Julián at the Wedding are two more picture books depicting kids exploring gender expression with family support. With scant dialogue and dazzling illustration, the first book tells the story of Julián, a young boy who has some apprehension about sharing his love of makeup, flowy hair, and mermaid role-play with his abuela . But to his surprise, she embraces and celebrates his interests by taking him to the annual Coney Island Mermaid Parade in New York City, where Julián struts down the boardwalk in makeshift mermaid regalia as his glamorous authentic self. The book's sequel shows Julián making delightful mischief at a lesbian wedding with a new friend named Marisol, a little girl who's equally authentic to herself. Audrey Kohler , senior bookseller at the feminist bookstore BookWoman in Austin, Texas, recommends both. \"The books show family embracing gender expression, which is really important for children,\" Kohler said. \"They're just a nice look at the different ways children can explore their genders-and the artwork is so gorgeous.\"\n\nPride: The Story of Harvey Milk and the Rainbow Flag by Rob Sanders, illustrated by Steven Salerno (about $12 at the time of publication)\n\nAlso available at Giovanni's Room Bookstore ($19 at the time of publication)\n\nSo many kids have encountered the rainbow equality flag, whether posted in the window of a local shop or flying from a neighbor's porch. But because LGBTQ history is so rarely taught in school, most don't have a sense of the history of that flag or the context-and recency-of modern Pride movements. Picture books like Pride: The Story of Harvey Milk and the Rainbow Flag help introduce young kids to some of those early struggles for queer rights in a way that's \"bright, cheerful, and really relatable,\" said Nicole Champoux, head of Arbor Montessori School in Sammamish, Washington. The book tells the origin story of the Pride flag through welcoming text and colorful, panoramic illustrations. \"It engages children on an imaginative level and lights up their empathy and understanding,\" she said.\n\nMy Maddy by Gayle E. Pitman, illustrated by Violet Tobacco ($10 at the time of publication)\n\nAlso available at BookWoman ($15 for an eBook at the time of publication)\n\nIn the world of LGBTQ picture books, Gayle E. Pitman is probably best known for This Day in June , a joyful, rhyming ode to Pride parades. But in 2020 Pitman published another winning celebration of queer life and families, My Maddy , which introduces kids to a nonbinary parent while highlighting the beauty of other things that defy easy categorization, like sporks, motorcycles, and hazel eyes. Austin, Texas, bookseller Audrey Kohler said it's among their favorite books showcasing diverse family structures for young readers.\n\nA Princess of Great Daring! by Tobi Hill-Meyer, illustrated by Eleanor Toczynski ($16 at the time of publication)\n\nA Princess of Great Daring! is a favorite of Lee Steube, YA librarian at the Upper Darby Township & Sellers Memorial Free Public Library in Pennsylvania. Ostensibly, the book is about a trans girl coming out to her friends for the first time while they're playing a make-believe game involving princesses and dragons. But the coming-out process isn't the narrative's primary focus. \"The book models several things well-it models her parents being supportive, her friends being positive and supportive, and it fights back against the idea of, 'Oh, you're a princess, you're going to sit back and be rescued.'\" Jamie gets to be a princess and save the day in this imaginative adventure. The book comes from publishing house Flamingo Rampant , a great source of picture and middle-grade books that center on LGBTQ identities, Steube said. \"They have such a wide range of books that highlight queer families and include the joy, just by showing queer people living their lives in ways that are fun and interesting.\"\n\nThe Every Body Book: The LGBTQ+ Inclusive Guide for Kids About Sex, Gender, Bodies, and Families by Rachel E. Simon, illustrated by Noah Grigni (about $17 at the time of publication)\n\nAlso available at Charis Books & More ($20 at the time of publication)\n\nFor late-elementary and early middle-school kids, there's a real need for explanatory nonfiction books that challenge some of our traditional thinking about bodies and gender, said Remy Timbrook, a librarian at the Oakland Public Library in Oakland, California. \"We've had a lot of caregivers asking for books that explain these topics without being quite so binary or old-fashioned, so they don't make people feel bad about themselves when reading them.\" She praises The Every Body Book: The LGBTQ+ Inclusive Guide for Kids About Sex, Gender, Bodies, and Families for its gender-inclusiveness in approaching big topics like puberty, hormones, pregnancy, and childbirth-and briefly even miscarriage, abortion, birth control, and safer sex. \"Nobody wants to be erased, right?\" Timbrook said. \"Kids are always getting handed these classic books about growing up-having one that includes matter-of-fact descriptions and discussions of what it means to be cisgender or transgender is really important,\" she said, for validating and celebrating kids' realities. (We have more book suggestions in our guide to tools to help prepare your kid for puberty .)\n\nThis Is Our Rainbow: 16 Stories of Her, Him, Them, and Us edited by Katherine Locke and Nicole Melleby (about $14 at the time of publication)\n\nAlso available at Giovanni's Room Bookstore ($17 at the time of publication)\n\nFor similarly broad-sweeping representation, This Is Our Rainbow: 16 Stories of Her, Him, Them, and Us is an \"all-inclusive anthology of fiction geared toward middle-grade readers,\" said Katharine Milon, manager of the long-running Giovanni's Room Bookstore in Philadelphia. \"Usually when you find queer fiction, one identity is showcased per story-and I understand that as a teaching tool,\" Milon said. \"But in reality, friend groups are much more complex.\" She describes the book as a playful set of stories about kids from various identities under the queer umbrella, written by some notable authors. But any education about queerness or gender identity is purely secondary to each chapter's plots. \"It's not just, 'Oh, here is a nonbinary character, this is how the character would like to be addressed'-but more like, 'Here's a nonbinary kid that gets to be a pirate.' Kids want to see themselves in a story, but more than that, they want to be told a story.\"\n\nThe Tea Dragon Society written and illustrated by K. O'Neill (about $16 at the time of publication)\n\nAlso available at A Room of One's Own ($18 at the time of publication)\n\nKids who are drawn to graphic novels will likely find a lot to love about The Tea Dragon Society , a delightful book that features gentle, warm depictions of many different queer characters, said Gretchen Treu , co-owner at A Room of One's Own bookstore in Madison, Wisconsin. The 2018 Eisner Award-winning book series follows a young blacksmith apprentice as she dives into the fantastical world of tea dragons , miniature dragons who can sprout tea leaves from their heads. Treu said the series gives queer kids both a sense of being seen and an opportunity to explore their own identities. \"They're looking for stories that are mirrors, but they're also looking for windows that help them learn about other people, or other worlds and experiences,\" Treu said of the Tea Dragon series , which spans three titles . \"These books give kids an opportunity to step into an identity, and see opportunities to figure themselves out without having to know everything about themselves to begin with.\"\n\nHeartstopper series by Alice Oseman (about $22 for Volume One at the time of publication)\n\nAlso available at Giovanni's Room Bookstore ($25 for Volume One at the time of publication)\n\nEmily Hersh, librarian at Navarro Early College High School in Austin, Texas, said graphic novels are huge with her school's large immigrant population because so many of the students are English-language learners, and the illustrations aid their understanding. She recommends the Heartstopper series -sweet and realistic illustrated novels about two boys who fall in love (now a Netflix series ). \"The book's characters have a group of friends who are also on the queer spectrum, and it's beautiful to see them interact so naturally and comfortably, like it's not even a big deal that one's transgender or one's gay,\" Hersh said. \"Let's normalize it all.\"\n\nBitter by Akwaeke Emezi ($11 at the time of publication)\n\nAlso available at A Room of One's Own (about $19 at the time of publication)\n\nBitter is another of bookstore owner Gretchen Treu's fantasy favorites, for its inclusion of queer characters in a compelling storyline. The book is the prequel to Akwaeke Emezi's popular Pet , and it tells the alternate-reality tale of a teen called to use her voice for protest when her supposed utopian city of Lucille becomes embroiled in violence. \"It's very much a question of 'what will you do when the revolution comes-will you use what privilege you have to help?'\" Treu said. The story depicts an array of queer and trans characters fighting for equality and justice-but also enjoying love and support from their families and communities.\n\nLast Night at the Telegraph Club by Malinda Lo ($9 at the time of publication)\n\nAlso available at Unabridged Books (about $12 at the time of publication)\n\n\"It's not easy being a queer teen in 2022, and it was even less so in the 1950s,\" said Spokane, Washington-based librarian Candise Branum of her pick, Last Night at the Telegraph Club . The National Book Award-winning YA novel places queer youth in a historical context via the tale of a Chinese-American teen navigating her sexuality at the time of the Red Scare in 1954. Branum praises the story for including a sense of hope and positivity absent from most queer pulp tales of the era. \"Seeing evidence of lesbians thriving and finding love and community in a time of extreme oppression-especially now with everything that's happening in Texas and Florida and across the entire country-demonstrates the fight and resiliency our community has historically had,\" she said.

      "text": "People Say Queer People Are Born That Way.\n\nWhen Lady Gaga released \"Born This Way,\" the 2011 song on an album of the same name, it was an instant hit and an instant L.G.B.T.Q. anthem. The song debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top 100, and Elton John called it \"the new gay anthem.\"\n\nIt was the dictum of a generation, three words operating with bumper sticker efficiency, conveying that queerness was natural and immutable, and that it was not a result of abuse, grooming or impairment. Queer people were not broken, and therefore in no need of fixing. Queerness was neither a choice nor a curse. It was not a \"lifestyle\" but a state of being.\n\nThe idea that sexuality was innate, captured in the phrase, was a rhetorical work horse that began to lead the conversation around L.G.B.T.Q. issues. Although the idea of homosexual bio-essentialism has a history that long predates this modern iteration, \"born this way\" this time was a phrase that matched the moment and captured the zeitgeist. As with most things in politics, it was about timing.\n\nLater that year, during remarks delivered at the Human Rights Campaign annual dinner, President Barack Obama joked to the gay rights group that \"I also took a trip out to California last week, where I held some productive, bilateral talks with your leader: Lady Gaga.\"\n\nDon't Tell My Friends, But...

The problem is that it isn't supported by science. The emerging scientific consensus is that sexual orientation isn't purely genetic. A person's genetic makeup and exposure to prenatal hormones may provide a propensity to queerness, but they aren't determinative. Other factors most likely also play a role.\n\n\"Born this way\" may, unfortunately, have been an oversimplification. It's probably closer to the truth to say that people are \"formed this way.\" As the complexity of human sexuality has become clearer, scientists and writers have attempted to add necessary nuance to the subject. But the slogan remains entrenched in the culture.\n\nJust last year, Rolling Stone crowned \"Born This Way\" the most inspirational L.G.B.T.Q. song of all time, calling it a \"battle cry\" that \"is as relevant as ever.\"\n\nBut the time may have come to retire the phrase. It is not only unsupportable by science but also does not capture the full reality of queer experience and is unjust to some members of the queer community itself.\n\nAs Lisa Diamond, a professor of developmental psychology, health psychology and gender studies at the University of Utah, explained in her 2018 TED talk, the argument is \"unjust because it implies that L.G.B.T. individuals who fit a certain cultural stereotype, the ones who have been exclusively gay for as long as they can possibly remember, are somehow more deserving of acceptance and equality than someone who came out at age 60 or whose attractions have been more fluid or who is bisexual rather than exclusively gay.\"\n\nI fully understand how frightening relinquishing this phrase may be.\n\n\"Born this way,\" as both a scientific concept and a political ideology, was easy to understand, accept and digest. A more nuanced explanation of attraction, one with a bit of mystery, opens the door to ambiguity and uncertainty that the opponents of gay rights will no doubt seek to exploit.\n\nRelinquishing such a powerful tool might feel like giving up too much. But incoming Stony Brook University professor Joanna Wuest, author of \"Born This Way: Science, Citizenship, and Inequality in the American LGBTQ+ Movement,\" believes that retiring the idea may potentially not be much of a loss at all, because the science is so strong that things like conversion therapy \"are extremely detrimental to mental health and even the lives of queer people.\"\n\nAs she explained to me, \"we don't need a strong biological theory of identity to understand that when you punch someone, they say it hurts.\"\n\nNow the argument has to be more sophisticated: We may choose how we identify and how we express - or suppress - our attractions, but our attractions themselves are not a choice.\n\nWe must insist that people's right to exist, and our responsibility to affirm and protect them, doesn't hinge on the mechanisms by which they came to exist. The \"end\" exists, regardless of the \"means.\"\n\nCharles M.

      "text": "A Huge Triumph of the LGBTQ+ Movement Is Suddenly in Peril at the Supreme Court\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed on Monday to consider whether state laws that prohibit \"conversion therapy\" for LGBTQ+ minors violate the First Amendment. It is very likely that the conservative supermajority will declare that these bans violate the free speech rights of anti-LGBTQ+ counselors. In doing so, the court will effectively invalidate laws in 28 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico that restrict \"conversion therapy\" for minors. Today, these laws protect a majority of LGBTQ+ youth from this dangerous practice. All those protections could soon be cut down by a supermajority eager to wield the First Amendment as a sword in the furious culture war against gay and transgender children.\n\nIt is easy to forget in today's climate of anti-trans persecution, but \"conversion therapy\" bans were recently a point of bipartisan consensus in much of the country. Many Republican governors signed these measures into law, leading to their adoption even in red and purple states like Utah , Nevada , and New Hampshire . Lawmakers were moved to action by accounts from victims of the cruel and horrific methods that go into \"converting\" an LGBTQ+ child into a straight or cisgender person. In one New Jersey case , for instance, a counselor forced his \"clients\" to undress in front of him, beat effigies of their mothers, and physically hurt themselves each time they felt same-sex attraction.\n\nThe reality is that conversion therapy simply does not work: Being gay or transgender is not a disease to be cured, it's a fundamental aspect of a person's identity that cannot be driven out through dubious \"therapeutic\" methods. Every mainstream medical group in the United States that has considered the issue has opposed \"conversion therapy\" and endorsed its prohibition, including the American Psychological Association , the American Psychiatric Association , the American Medical Association , the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry , and the American Academy of Pediatrics . As the American Psychological Association recently explained following a \"comprehensive\" review of the scientific literature, efforts to \"convert\" LGBTQ+ children are \"dangerous, unethical, ineffective\" and \"discredited.\" They fail to change the patient's sexual orientation or gender identity while frequently contributing to \"depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, substance abuse,\" and a host of other ills. \"A confluence of research,\" the group wrote, \"supports the conclusions\" that these practices \"are not psychotherapy interventions\" at all, but rather \"forms of stigma\" that do vastly more harm than good. They are rooted in bigotry, not science, and have no place in professional psychotherapy.\n\nFor all these reasons, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10 th Circuit upheld Colorado's ban on conversion therapy last year, joining the 9 th Circuit in holding that they comply with the First Amendment. Both courts held that these laws regulate \"professional conduct,\" imposing only \"incidental burdens on speech.\" All kinds of medical treatment, they pointed out, involve some measure of speech, but that fact does not automatically implicate constitutional rights. A doctor has no freedom to pretend you're not having a heart attack when you are, or deny the utility of a pacemaker, or refuse to reveal the true conditions of your arteries-even though all these communications are technically \"speech.\" And so, the courts held, it follows that a therapist has no fundamental right to \"convert\" a patient from gay to straight, or trans to cisgender, when doing so is harmful and impossible.\n\nThe courts therefore held that \"conversion therapy\" bans, like other medical speech, are subject to mere rational basis review, not strict scrutiny. And the laws easily survive this lower standard of review given the government's strong interest in shielding minors from the injuries inflicted by a discredited treatment. The courts also pointed out that these bans exclusively target licensed therapists working in professional settings. A parent, family friend, or religious counselor may still attempt to \"convert\" an LGBTQ+ minor. So, too, may a professional therapist outside of her practice. These are, in short, licensure laws that hold practitioners to a certain standard. The penalties for violation are accordingly limited to revocation of license and modest administrative fines.\n\nConservative lawyers have nonetheless launched an assault on these bans, urging the federal judiciary to wade into-and abruptly halt-the robust democratic debate that has produced so much success for LGBTQ+ advocates. They argue that the laws violate therapists' free speech rights by \" censoring \" therapists' ability to convey \"certain messages\" about sexual orientation and gender identity. They've had mixed success: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11 th Circuit struck down two local bans in 2020. And last term, the Supreme Court narrowly refused to consider the issue, with Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh urging their colleagues to take it up. On Monday, the Supreme Court finally agreed to review Chiles v. Salazar , a challenge to Colorado's conversion therapy law, which the 10 th Circuit upheld. It did so even though the state has never actually enforced the measure against anyone.\n\nThere's little mystery how the court is inclined to rule. In 2018's NIFLA v. Becerra , these justices struck down a California law requiring \"crisis pregnancy centers\" to disclose their lack of a medical license to the public. The majority held that these fake clinics-which masquerade as real clinics then evangelize against abortion -have a First Amendment right to conceal from patients their inability to practice actual medicine. In his majority opinion, Thomas pointedly criticized a 9 th Circuit decision upholding California's conversion therapy ban, suggesting it was wrongly decided; he specifically wrote that \"professional speech\" was not exempt from heightened constitutional scrutiny. His decision had grave implications for all manner of licensure laws that mandate standards across the medical profession.\n\nThen, in 2023's 303 Creative v. Elenis , the Supreme Court granted an anti-gay website designer an exception from Colorado's civil rights law, allowing her to discriminate against same-sex couples. The conservative supermajority declared that the First Amendment guarantees every professional, even those working for a profit, the right \"to speak his mind regardless of whether the government considers his speech sensible and well intentioned or deeply 'misguided.' \" Once again, the court seemed to be casting doubt on the premise that states could regulate speech by \"professionals\" by deeming it \"conduct.\"\n\nThe conservative supermajority now seems poised to follow through on the implied threats of NIFLA and 303 Creative and invalidate \"conversion therapy\" bans. It is difficult to overstate the impact of such a decision: laws in more than half the states -representing years of advocacy, lobbying, and democratic debate-gone in a flash, as well the preemptive condemnation of a proposed federal ban . More than half of LGBTQ+ minors are, today, safeguarded by these laws, thanks to the work of thousands of elected representatives and governors around the country. Soon, six justices may tear their hard-won triumphs to the ground.\n\nSuch a ruling would also mark yet another example of the Supreme Court selectively brandishing the Constitution to take sides against blue states in the culture wars. The Supreme Court looks poised to uphold state bans on gender-affirming health care for trans minors. Yet it may now strike down state bans on the attempted conversion of LGBTQ+ youth. And it has already carved a huge loophole in state laws that protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination. Progressive states, organizations, and individuals are left fighting with one hand tied behind their back, while their opponents enjoy freedom from constitutional restraints. This manifestly unfair situation resembles an asymmetry that the Supreme Court has created in the abortion debate. Crisis pregnancy centers have a right to lie to patients about the phony \"care\" they provide. Meanwhile, actual doctors may be forced to promote anti-abortion propaganda to patients over their own sincere objections.\n\nWhen this Supreme Court extols the virtues of democracy, pay attention to which debates it withdraws from the democratic process. To the Republican-appointed justices, questions about a pregnant patient's life and death must be left to \"the people and their elected representatives.\" But an anti-LGBTQ+ therapist's ability to tell a child that they must stop being gay or transgender? That may prove too important to leave to the people. It is clear who gets the benefit of this court's protection: not those most in need of a constitutional defense against discrimination, but those most eager to enshrine their bias into law.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Why We Need More Queer Identity Labels, Not Fewer\n\nThis post is part of Outward , Slate ' s home for coverage of LGBTQ life, thought, and culture. Read more here .\n\nThe acronym for gender and sexual minorities-nowadays styled LGBT, LGBTQ, or increasingly, LGBTQIA+-has expanded over the years, growing in length as the movement has gained strength and momentum. (For those who find themselves lost beyond the queer/questioning \"Q,\" \"I\" stands for intersex, \"A\" for ally, and + for, well, everything else.) But has it gotten too long? The number of labels included has, for many, reached mockable proportions: Tucker Carlson recently took the acronym to task , calling it an example of the \"tolerance police.\" And even those who champion this civil rights movement fear that the expansion of the acronym could be perceived as evidence of the community's hyper-PC, extra-sensitive, flighty nature.\n\nBut adding more labels to the acronym isn't about making sure all the snowflakes know they are special. These labels save lives. These labels create a powerful sense of understanding and self-acceptance. The fact that the acronym has become a target for mockery only indicates the amount of work that still needs to be done around LGBTQIA+ civil rights.\n\nTurn back the clock to the 1980s, when the movement for LGBTQIA+ rights gained momentum on the national level. Then, it was the gay rights struggle. Gay stood for everyone in the community, or at least that's how its proponents justified the term. But like man standing for person, gay wasn't adequate to describe everyone. And so, by the mid-to-late '80s, lesbians and bisexuals had successfully pushed for inclusion, with LGB emerging as the new term. In the '90s, it was transgender people's turn to ask for recognition in the form of the T. Soon after, the Q followed.\n\nThis addition of the Q seems to have been a crucial tipping point, the moment at which the community, represented by the acronym, opened its arms wider. To admit transgender folks and queer folks was to accept that this movement was not just about sexual orientation but about a broader sense of identity: gender identity and gender expression, sexual identity and sexual behavior, and non-normativity in all these areas. So it made sense for intersex, asexual, pansexual, and other terms to be included in the acronym-whether in even lengthier versions like LGGBDTTTIQQAAPP or just under that +.\n\nFor many, particularly for those who want to make gay seem normal, this expansion is too much. They worry that by advertising an increasing array of identities, the community will appear too on the fringe and become an easy target for mockery. However, this argument ignores the important role that labels play within marginalized communities. Specific terminology and the robust expansion of it is crucial to the continued success of the LGBTQIA+ civil rights struggle. And even though in some liberal circles labels are viewed as confining (think of every celebrity who has ever refused to be \"put in a box\"), I believe that labels are not only necessary, but also liberating.\n\nMany coming out stories begin with internal clarity ( I felt this way my whole life ) mixed with external confusion ( I didn't know how to explain it ), resolving when the person meets either an \"out\" person who acts as a life-model or encounters a term that explains what they have been feeling in language. That's the power of these labels: They don't restrict people, boxing them in to a limited sense of self. Rather, they help individuals articulate what has previously been an undefined internal state.\n\nIt's not a fluke that same-sex relationships were termed \"the love that dare not speak its name\" during Oscar Wilde's infamous trial for \"gross indecency\" in 1895. To speak of such things was dangerous, to engage in them was illegal, and therefore terminology was slow to develop. At first the labels applied to the identity (or behavior, as it was understood at the time) were derogatory or criminal, such as sodomite, and then later became clinical, such as homosexual. These were labels that others applied to the LGBTQIA+ community, and thus terms that were used not to promote better self-understanding, but to demonize, to render a group as \"other,\" and define it against the norm.\n\nOur new wave of terminology-demisexual and polyamorous, genderqueer and two-spirit-has the opposite effect. Yes, it's easy to mock the proliferation of labels: There are a lot of them! But we should think hard about doubting the importance of these terms. Language grants us the ability to explain ourselves, to put words to what we feel and think and experience. When, in the '90s, the term transgender was added to the LGB acronym, it wasn't that transgender people had never existed before that moment. The term was simply new, replacing earlier, less-affirming vocabulary like transvestite, which often fetishized the identity. But the feeling, the experience of self-that had always been there. Having a word for it helped individuals to come out, making that process less tortured and easier to explain to others.\n\nHaving terminology also creates community: If a word exists to describe something, the implication is that the concept is important enough to merit a term, that there's a critical mass in need of this word. If the feeling an individual has \"dares not speak its name,\" then how is one to find others who share that feeling? These labels-all of them, not just the original one or two or three-play a necessary role in generating solidarity.\n\nThough many of the slogans of the early \"gay\" rights movement now seem antiquated, the queer action group ACT UP coined a phrase that seems more pressing today than ever before: Silence Equals Death. That slogan covered many signs in the early years of AIDS activism, when the Reagan White House sought to cover up, or worse, simply ignore the existence of the disease. We should be reminded of that as we hear about the ways CDC scientists under Trump have learned to censor themselves around certain terms, particularly the word transgender. We should be reminded that to not speak words is to give silence power, and silence breeds ignorance and fear. The ever-expanding LGBTQIA+ acronym shouldn't be a cause for mockery; it should be a cause for celebration. We should speak these terms loudly and clearly. And we should be ready to explain and expand even further, welcoming new ones as their owners share them with us. Everyone deserves a name.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

      "text": "The Decade When the Fight for LGBTQ Rights Went Mainstream\n\nRead the rest of Slate's coverage of the end of the decade.\n\nIn 2008, Barack Obama won the Democratic nomination, and the presidency, without supporting gay marriage. In 2019, gay-married presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is leading the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, and he's a strong contender elsewhere. The past decade has seen American public opinion move further on gay marriage than almost any other issue, with support climbing 19 points between 2010 and 2019. One year into the decade, for the first time, more people approved of equal marriage than opposed it. Public opinion had flipped for good.\n\nRising support for equal marriage was just the beginning. This was the decade when outright homophobia became an increasingly untenable political position, when Democrats went from hedging their support for gay rights to scrambling to demonstrate their literacy on trans issues, when even many Republicans had to find ways to ground their anti-gay policies in concepts other than morality . In state and federal policy, in national political discourse and public opinion, LGBTQ people became truly visible, not just as a small minority whose sex lives inflame the culture wars, but as diverse subjects whose humanity should not be circumscribed by discrimination under the law. With some basic rights secured and mounting pressure on corporations and politicians to prove their pro-gay bona fides, LGBTQ people found themselves able to demand more from their allies-and to have deep, critical discussions about where and how the community should apply its growing political power.\n\nThe aughts had seen some notable wins for gay rights: States began performing same-sex civil unions and marriages for the first time, and the Supreme Court struck down laws that criminalized gay sex. But the victories were piecemeal, and the bruising battle over Prop 8, the 2008 voter referendum that reversed California's legalization of gay marriage, made every court ruling and blip in public opinion feel tenuous. Many, if not most, elected Democrats weren't even willing to say that gay people deserved full rights and protections. At a presidential candidate forum on LGBTQ issues in 2007, the only two candidates who said they supported equal marriage were the long shots, Dennis Kucinich and Mike Gravel. The others, including then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, spent the evening explaining to the gay moderators why civil unions were good enough.\n\nWhat changed in the 2010s, and why did things change so fast? Long-running coming-out campaigns from advocacy groups, smart activist messaging, liberalizing faith communities, and friendly pop culture representations from a heavily queer entertainment industry helped the American public see that gay people were all around us, and most of them weren't so scary. With both carrots and sticks, LGBTQ advocates began to convince Democratic political leadership to follow public opinion on gay rights issues. In 2011, Obama repealed \"don't ask, don't tell,\" a policy that was already unpopular when Bill Clinton signed it into law in 1993. A year later, Obama publicly backed marriage equality, and the Democratic Party put it in its national platform for the first time, four years after a majority of Democrat-identified Americans said they favored it.\n\nBelated as these actions might have been, they helped create a sense of momentum and the appearance of an inevitable march toward progress, leading many more straight Americans to change their minds on policies like gay marriage, lest they be on the wrong side of an issue that already seemed decided. Public opinion and political action each pushed the other forward, creating a pro-gay feedback loop that eventually reached the Supreme Court: In 2013, United States v. Windsor struck down a pivotal section of the Defense of Marriage Act; two years later, Obergefell v. Hodges allowed gays across the country to access the institution of marriage.\n\nRadical queer activists had long pushed gay rights organizations to deprioritize marriage rights in favor of issues that more directly affect trans people and low-income queers, such as access to employment, housing, and health care. All this has been slower to come. (Edith Windsor's case concerned marital estate tax exemptions, further ingraining the sense among some activists that marriage protections primarily benefit the rich.) The Obama administration implemented LGBTQ nondiscrimination rules in schools and public housing, only to have them reversed by President Donald Trump. And while Americans have generally settled on the notion that gay people can do what they want on their own beds and altars, \"love is love\" and \"live and let live\" have been a lot easier to sell than laws that extend gay rights from the confines of coupledom to the workplace and public accommodations. Even as a majority of Americans say the country needs more LGBTQ anti-discrimination laws , the U.S. remains a ragtag patchwork of protections-and over the past five years, public support for allowing businesses to refuse to serve LGBTQ people for \"religious reasons\" has nearly doubled .\n\nIn this political landscape, it became clear that Republicans were making trans people the new primary target of their antipathy. Obergefell was followed by a flurry of \"bathroom bills\" in state legislatures that aimed to prohibit trans people from using public restrooms that matched their lived genders. LGBTQ activists refocused around trans rights and protections, putting to rest fears that the achievement of equal marriage would dull enthusiasm for subsequent fights. In previous decades, trans people had often been sold short by, and sometimes flat-out excluded, from LGBTQ advocacy efforts. Many still shudder at the memory of the Human Rights Campaign, the country's largest LGBTQ rights lobbying group, backing a trans-exclusionary version of a 2007 employment nondiscrimination bill, saying it had the best chance of passing the House. Trans activists remember it as a galvanizing moment for the movement: the first real battle for trans rights at a national level. Since then, there has been little disagreement in mainstream LGBTQ movements about the necessity of trans inclusion in public policy.\n\nStill, the rise of the state-sanctioned queer nuclear family in the 2010s has magnified other rifts in LGBTQ communities: divisions of race, class, and gender; friction between assimilationist and radical visions of queer politics; and conflicts that surface when perpetrators of violence and bigotry start bearing the rainbow flag. Pride celebrations became a popular venue for dissent this decade, with activists protesting the depoliticization of the proceedings and the inclusion in local parades of defense contractors, police departments, and banks that profit from immigrant detention centers. Now that LGBTQ people are no longer begging for scraps from the only party that will have them, it can be harder to see the entire acronym as representative of a unified set of interests. For some, the more rights and protections we get, the less we have in common.\n\nNo single political figure has simultaneously embodied and inflamed these tensions more than Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, a white, gay, married veteran who came out midway through the decade, frames his sexuality in the terminology of Christianity, and has a seeming blind spot on issues of race. Buttigieg's corporate-tinged pragmatism has resurrected the disagreements over respectability politics that have animated clashes within LGBTQ communities for generations. The video of protesters at a CNN LGBTQ presidential town hall demanding Buttigieg address violence against black trans women seemed to some like an apt symbol of the uneven distribution of political gains this past decade. The fact that he and Anderson Cooper engaged the protesters and spoke to their concerns speaks volumes about how the power within the LGBTQ community is shifting, and how radicalism will continue to insert itself into venues of respectability.\n\nThe Buttigieg candidacy has provided both the 2010s' most on-the-nose symbol of gay political progress and a valuable opportunity for LGBTQ self-reflection: about what perspectives we seek when we advocate for gay representation in politics, about the benefits white gay men still reap from their race and gender, and about what it means that the first viable major party gay presidential candidate is running against several people who are just as eloquent and progressive on LGBTQ issues as he is. The decade that first produced a gay presidential candidacy is also the first decade to see a Democratic primary in which LGBTQ rights aren't raised as a point of controversy. It feels like a privilege to have the opportunity to disagree.\n\nRead the rest of Slate's coverage of the end of the decade.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "\"A Car Crash in Slow Motion\": Why Increasing Anti-LGBTQ Violence Feels Inevitable\n\nListen to What Next:\n\nRight before the holidays, the White House hosted a celebration. Actually, this was a signing ceremony; it just felt like a party. The boisterous crowd on the White House South Lawn was there to celebrate the Respect for Marriage Act, which is a law that protects the validity of same-sex and interracial marriages, both at the federal level and state by state. Strangely, it's a law that doesn't do all that much-yet. The mood was victorious anyway.\n\n\"It's funny, isn't it? Because it's a victory against a hypothetical,\" says BuzzFeed's David Mack.\n\nMack says it was a little jarring to see so much enthusiasm for what is, at its core, a defensive move. \"They used this moment where they had the power in Congress to pass this should the Supreme Court do to marriage equality what they've just done to 50 years of abortion rights in this country-to  protect the worst-case scenario from happening.\"\n\nThe worst-case scenario seemed to be the last thing on the minds of the crowd at the White House. There were drag queens in the audience, Lady Gaga blaring out of the speakers, and Cyndi Lauper talking to reporters in the White House briefing room. When Chuck Schumer stepped up to the microphone, he gushed over his daughter's gay wedding. Even though, back in the '90s, he and Joe Biden both voted to define marriage as between a man and a woman, when they passed the Defense of Marriage Act.\n\n\"That just shows the remarkable transformation that's taken place in this country, where Joe Biden has become someone who gladly and willingly signs this legislation and celebrates it with a big gay party on the White House lawn,\" Mack says.\n\nBut there's an asterisk here. This happy crowd was also feeling palpable relief. Because, Mack says, being gay in America right now means carrying two realities around with you. Gay rights are more protected than they've ever been. But also, gay people are astonishingly vulnerable. \"Suddenly there were these moments where we were being victimized very openly and politically once again, and people were coming after us in a way that I don't think I've felt in a long time.\"\n\nIn the past year, there's been a sharp uptick in anti-LGBTQ incidents around the country. One group estimates that there's been a 12-fold increase in demonstrations and political violence targeted at the queer community, just since 2000. In fact, the very same people in the audience watching the Respect for Marriage Act get signed? They were fighting off harassment the moment they got home.\n\n\"I spoke to a drag artist by the name of Marti G. Cummings. They're a nonbinary performer here in New York City, and they were invited to the White House ceremony. And the night after the signing, Tucker Carlson ran a segment about this and included references to Marti Cummings, saying that they have an unusual interest in children,\" Mack says. \"Marti Cummings told me that to them, Tucker Carlson knows what he's doing. To frame drag artists as this predatory threat to children is something that felt very shocking to me in March. But now, I'm not shocked at all. That focus on children is not a coincidence. It is entirely related to the events that we saw in the pandemic and the political strategy that sections of the right developed.\"\n\nOn Wednesday's episode of What Next , we try to make sense of this bifurcated moment for the queer community by examining the common thread linking conservative activism around COVID to anti-gay demonstrations in the street. My conversation with David Mack has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nMary Harris: Back when a shooter opened fire in a Colorado Springs gay nightclub, in November, BuzzFeed's David Mack wrote an article lamenting the fact that this kind of violence seemed inevitable. Mack was hurting as he wrote this-he's gay himself; he felt at risk. But he also felt like he should have seen this violence coming.\n\nTo him, it didn't begin with gay people at all. Instead, it began with concerns around COVID and schools. Because protecting children seemed to resonate. Over the past year, he says he's watched this political message metastasize.\n\nDavid Mack: It's funny. In November 2021, I was in Grand Junction, Colorado, for a school board race, of all things. I'd chosen to go there for a few reasons. It's a bit of a hotbed for election denialism. It was having this school board race that was suddenly very partisan. And it's also an overwhelmingly white area where suddenly \"critical race theory\" was this big subject of debate. One of the candidates told me that she'd knocked on a door and someone had told her that they blamed \"critical race theory\" for turning their child bisexual.\n\nWhoa. Quite a leap there.\n\nIt certainly was. But it spoke perfectly to this wonderful boogeyman that the right had created. Most people I spoke to, even the candidates themselves, couldn't really define what CRT was. It became this wonderful catchall for anything that could possibly influence young minds to hate America or to make them less American. And to make them less conservative is where it naturally led.\n\nProtecting the presumed innocence of children is what connects all this. Whether conservative parents were talking about \"critical race theory\" or LGBTQ issues, the idea was the same: to avoid \"corrupting the minds of young people.\"\n\nAnd to be clear, I'm not the one marrying these things. In Ohio, one of the bills that was put forward to legislate against \"critical race theory\" also included, in the very same bill, language that mirrored restrictions on sexual teachings, on sexual orientation, and on gender identity that you saw famously in the \"don't say gay\" bill in Florida.\n\nDo you think it is a top-down strategy? Or do you think it's more like something was successful and then it spread and morphed?\n\nCertainly people at the highest levels of the Republican Party are aware of this strategy and are using this strategy. You saw Glenn Youngkin in Virginia run in 2021 on a campaign about giving parents more control over the curriculum and listening to parents when it comes to schools. And they're clearly recognizing schools and classrooms are a winning issue. Steve Bannon famously said last year the path to retake the country runs through school board elections.\n\nThis focus on kids is not new, and I'm wondering if you're able to go back a little bit and explain how in the 1970s the fight for gay rights was turbocharged by these allegations that gay people were somehow going to harm children? I'm thinking specifically about how in Florida this woman named Anita Bryant became a real lightning rod. Do you know Anita Bryant's story?\n\nI do. What you're talking about are some of the earliest battles that happened in the first decade of the gay liberation movement. In the 10 years or so after Stonewall, it very quickly became a debate about gay people in schools.\n\nAnita Bryant , in 1977, she was living in Miami and the city was looking to pass an ordinance that would protect the civil rights of gay people. It was being spearheaded by someone whom she'd given money to. And it just really lit a fire under her to speak out against the civil rights of gay people. She eventually became part of this political coalition literally called Save Our Children . It's interesting to look back on how that went, because she was successful and then she was not successful. It's important to remember at this moment how this push and pull might continue for a while.\n\nThat's exactly right. That's why, to me at least, I felt kind of flabbergasted in March to see these arguments being made again in the mainstream political realm. It was Ron DeSantis' press secretary who first brought back this term groomer in a political context in March when talking about the \"don't say gay\" bill. And from there, it took off like a rocket. It felt surprising to me, because I felt like we had left all that behind. It's felt like this is the last gasp of this kind of movement that knows that they're losing. They know they are losing the public. They know that the ship is sailing. They are reverting back to some classics to try to fight back one final time.\n\nThe thing that makes this current attempt to frame queer people as a threat to children new is how the message is spreading-person to person, unfiltered, straight out of the faucet of social media. The internet firehose Mack worries the most about is an account we've talked about before: Libs of TikTok .\n\nLibs of TikTok is mostly a Twitter account that has over a million followers at this point. It's run by a Brooklyn real estate agent who basically takes videos from TikTok of teachers or other public officials that she deemed corrupting to children. She's sort of saying here is this teacher in so-and-so, Iowa, telling proudly how they are running a class on transgender issues for 9-year-olds.\n\nThese innocuous videos of gay and trans teachers talking about their jobs and students can rack up hundreds of thousands of views and plenty of hateful comments. They're always presented with a digital eyeroll, like, \"Can you believe what those libs are saying now?\"\n\nIt was drawing national attention online to random people across the country. And then it started changing to drag queen story hours and pointing out when these events were happening.\n\nHave they also been involved in promoting how hospitals are caring for trans children?\n\nYes. There has been a huge focus on the care that some hospitals and some medical clinics will give to transgender children. And a lot of misinformation. But you look at the language again: It is centered on children and what is being done to them.\n\nThis word pops up again and again- mutilate -when they're talking about what care is being done. The idea is that these liberal doctors are chopping off the genitals of 9-year-olds who may be corrupted by a trend that their teacher taught them in class.\n\nAnd we have seen hospitals go into lockdown because of bomb threats and people facing federal charges because of the threats that they've made to hospitals, which is just an astonishing thing to say out loud.\n\nAnd political people started engaging with this account, right?\n\nIt's become a hugely influential account, and the right is also very protective of it. A big bunch of the Elon Musk \"Twitter Files\" that we've seen lately is whether or not this account was restricted or muted in some ways, or if it wasn't-if it was protected, which some of those Twitter Files seem to indicate that there were special measures given to make sure this account was not taken down, because it has become such a political lightning rod. It bridges the gap between this political strategy that we've talked about, mostly interested in mobilizing people and getting them to the polls, and then this very dark online world where there are a lot of actors who politicians famously can't control but have influenced.\n\nHow much do you credit this account for what's being seen in the real world? People showing up at drag shows or drag story hours and being threatening, having weapons, things like that. Is that directly related to Libs of TikTok?\n\nYes. And other accounts like them. They will promote events on that page. They will say this library is having an event or this bar is having a midday brunch for families. And people will turn up at that event. Armed people will turn up with that event. Or, the event will need to be shut down in advance because of threats that they've received. This has happened again and again and again. They will say that they are merely highlighting public information and letting people know that there is this event going on. But the wink-wink there is that you need to do something about this.\n\nAnd right now, we're seeing armed people turning up at not just children's events, but outside events at gay bars and inside gay bars-like in Colorado Springs.\n\nThis is clearly really personal for you. Over the past year, have you had to change the way you move in the world because of what you've noticed all around you?\n\nIt's funny, I cover so many of these horrible things in this country, and it's horrible to say, but you do become numb to covering so many of these things. And I woke up after that Club Q thing and I was furious. I felt anger in a way that I hadn't felt because it felt to me like this was the end point that we knew was coming. It was like a car crash in slow motion that we could see all year long. And we know it will happen again. I do feel angry and scared, I'm sad to say, in a way that I haven't. I was in a gay bar in Raleigh the week after Thanksgiving, and I found myself for the first time looking for the exits when I got in there. I caught myself doing that and I thought just how sad that is that I am in a bar with my boyfriend trying to just have a drink and I am worried.\n\nGet more news from Mary Harris every weekday.\n\nWe started off the show talking about the Respect for Marriage Act and how celebratory the vibe was when it was signed into law. It seems to me in this moment that the fight that queer Americans are in is a lot harder than the fight for marriage equality. And I say that because the fight for gay marriage was a fight about allowing queer people to adhere to straight norms. And the fight now is really about making straight people deal with queerness. Do you see it that way, too?\n\nI think your point, and it's a fair one, is that above all it's a cultural fight and it's a cultural debate. My one ray of sunshine in all of this is that we gays are very good at the cultural stuff. If you think you can beat us on culture, you got another thing coming. You look at the media landscape that kids are coming up in now and the openness of queer shows and queer celebrities and I draw huge inspiration from that because if we're going to be fighting this out in the cultural sphere, that's a fight I'm willing to have because I think we'll win.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Remote Learning Accidentally Introduced a New Danger for LGBTQ Students\n\nImagine this: A 13-year-old student is called into their school counselor's office. There they find their counselor and their parents waiting for them, concerned looks on their faces. \"We know you think you're trans,\" one of them says. The student is horrified. They've never shared these private thoughts with anyone, channeling their feelings and questions into their personal diary on their laptop. Had their parents been reading their diary? No. Their laptop was given to them by their school, and it contains software that flags any student writing that uses, among other terms, \"queer\" or \"transgender.\" The company forwarded the flagged content to a school counselor. And under a recently passed \"Don't Say Gay\" bill in the student's state, the counselor was required to report the writing to the student's parents, outing the student. Outing the student before they were ready to share their identity, or even sure of it themselves, puts that student at risk of their family disowning them, or worse.\n\nThis story is hypothetical, but it's realistic. Last year, a student in Minneapolis was outed when school administrators contacted their parents after a surveillance software flagged LGBTQ keywords in their writing, and schools' abilities to screen students' writings are becoming more and more invasive.* The COVID-19 pandemic brought about a seismic shift in the use of surveillance software by schools. Simultaneously, a growing reactionary backlash against school policies affirming and supporting LGBTQ students is resulting in legislation, lawsuits, and pressure campaigns to implement anti-LGBTQ policies. These coinciding events threaten to turn schools into a surveillance apparatus uniquely suited to outing and marginalizing at-risk LGBTQ students.\n\nAs schools scrambled to shift to remote learning, they hastily signed contracts with educational technology vendors without understanding the implications on students' privacy. A recent survey by the Center for Democracy and Technology showed that 81 percent of teachers report their schools are now using surveillance software to monitor students. One particular software used by schools around the country is Gaggle, which surveils school computers and student accounts. The use of Gaggle has resulted in the constant monitoring of students through their Gmail and Microsoft Office accounts, even when at home using personal devices. Gaggle even monitors in real time the content being written by students on Google Docs.\n\nGaggle flags the terms \"lesbian,\" \"gay,\" and \"transgender\" as sexual content that is reported to human reviewers at the company to determine if it should be passed along to school staff. Gaggle's CEO, Jeff Patterson, defended the policy of flagging LGBTQ content as a means to protect students from bullying.\n\nThere are real potential harms to this kind of surveillance. A student writing that they might be queer or trans in a personal diary in a Google Doc on their school Google account-whether on their school or personal computer-could then result in that writing being reported to school administrators and outing the student.\n\nWhile off-campus surveillance of students' personal devices presents a grave threat to all students' privacy, low-income students unable to afford personal devices feel the brunt of these surveillance technologies. Prior to the pandemic, 43 percent of schools had device distribution programs; now, 86 percent do . We know that school-issued devices often feature more invasive surveillance software and internet content filters. But despite this rapid increase, there is no readily available information on how schools monitor their students or with what software. It's often up to journalists and nonprofit advocacy organizations to uncover this information through public information requests that take months or longer.\n\nWhether on school-issued devices or downloaded onto students' own, these software tools do not disclose the source code of their software nor how they prioritize student information for review and reporting, leaving parents, students, and even school administrators ignorant of what the privacy concerns even are before they can begin working for mitigation. But what is known is not good. A.I. automation tools, such as those used by Gaggle, are rife with broken promises about accuracy. They often have fundamental racial and gender biases . A consequence of using these tools to monitor students' online content is that they will disproportionately affect people of color and marginalized groups .\n\nThis surveillance technology becomes even more harmful when combined with recent efforts to require the outing of students, such as the now-withdrawn amendment to Florida's \"Don't Say Gay\" bill that would have required school staff to out children within six weeks of discovering the information, regardless of concerns about the child's health and safety. Even worse, Texas has declared that providing gender-affirming care to trans children is child abuse. Legislation like this is part of a massive reactionary backlash directed at school boards for everything from mask mandates to so-called critical race theory, or CRT.\n\nThere is concerted effort by anti-LGBTQ organizations and politicians to ride the coattails of the anti-CRT movement. They seek to reverse gender-affirming policies and implement the forced outing of students to their parents by school staff. Recently, a group of anonymous parents in New Hampshire requested that the Hanover school board \"repeal or substantially amend\" its trans-affirming policy adopted in 2016 and require parental notification if a student reveals they are trans to a teacher or school counselor.\n\nIn Florida, anti-LGBTQ forces are trying more direct measures. Over the past few months, two lawsuits were filed in Florida by the Child & Parental Rights Campaign, or CPR-C, seeking to implement forced outing through litigation. These lawsuits seek to require school staff to out students by reporting to parents if a student has gender dysphoria or is questioning their gender. CPR-C is a thinly veiled anti-trans organization affiliated with the Alliance Defending Freedom, which the Southern Poverty Law Center lists as a hate group. The CPR-C executive director has been on record comparing LBGTQ people to \"cockroaches.\"\n\nRepublican state legislators have increasingly picked up on this trend and have introduced several bills targeting school officials who come to learn of a student's transgender status. Several anti-trans bills, such as Alabama's S.B. 184 and Arizona's H.B. 2161 , outlaw school staff, including mental health counselors, withholding a trans student's gender identity from their parents.\n\nIt is not hard to see how schools requiring the forced outing of queer and trans students to their parents could be a threat to their well-being and safety. Given the recent moves by Texas, it could even mean trans children being separated from their parents. It bears repeating that LGBTQ youth, especially those of color, have the highest rates of youth homelessness among any demographic, often due to family rejection of their sexual orientation or gender identity .\n\nThe confluence of increased school surveillance with the movement to require school officials to out LGBTQ students presents a perilous future for queer and trans youth. If these lawsuits and bills succeed, trans youth would not be able to turn to trusted adults at their schools to confide their feelings without fear that their potentially homophobic or transphobic parents will be notified. Add surveillance technologies, and they may not even be able to safely commit these private thoughts to writing.\n\nIronically, many of the purveyors of surveillance software proclaim that their intentions are to reduce student suicide and self-harm. Yet the software contains the potential to expose the privacy of trans students, who are at the greatest risk of suicide . Queer and trans youth face a future of increasing paranoia and isolation. School is supposed to be a safe place for students, where they can access supportive staff and resources. Instead, schools may increasingly become a nightmare of surveillance used for the purposes of harming LGBTQ students.\n\nCorrection, Feb. 24, 2022: This piece originally conflated two separate incidents that happened to two separate LGBTQ students.

      "text": "How the War on Critical Race Theory Revived Anti-Gay Activism in Schools\n\nFor decades, anti-gay activists have pushed their agenda by masking their homophobia in a concern for children's innocence. But as gay Americans have demanded equal rights and gained greater visibility, these anti-gay sentiments have fallen out of favor in polite society. As a result, the bigots began cloaking their hatred of homosexuality in terms of religious liberty and \"natural law.\" Now, the anti-gay lobby has found a tantalizing new opportunity to continue their crusade: The right's war against critical race theory. Suddenly, Republican lawmakers are establishing speech codes for public schools, censoring students and teachers, and banning diverse educational materials. Homophobic activists have piggybacked off this campaign by reframing LGBTQ-related school speech as dangerous liberal propaganda.\n\nIn multiple states run by Republicans, the anti-gay crusaders are on the brink of success, reviving a pernicious strain of hate that seemed to be fading just a few years ago.\n\nThe most notorious of these anti-gay gag orders is Florida's \"Don't Say Gay\" measure. The bill, H.B. 1557 , has already passed the state House of Representatives and is on the brink of passage in the state Senate; Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has signaled that he'll sign it. H.B. 1557 outlaws \"classroom instruction\" about \"sexual orientation or gender identity\" in kindergarten through third grade, then bans such \"instruction\" in grades 4-12 if it \"is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate.\"\n\nThese terms are not clearly defined, and this ambiguity is by design. As my colleague Christina Cauterucci explained , their intent is \"to create a chilling effect, such that teachers and school administrators are too afraid to teach LGBTQ history, discuss relevant current events, or offer support to queer and trans students, lest they run afoul of a vaguely written law.\" H.B. 1557 empowers parents to file a lawsuit against schools that don't comply and win damages-that is, a cash payout-as well as attorneys' fees if they prevail. Like Texas' abortion ban , it creates a vigilante enforcement scheme, relying on the threat of ruinous lawsuits to bring its targets into line.\n\nFlorida is not alone in silencing LGBTQ-related speech. There are at least 15 similar bills in eight states, and several go far beyond H.B. 1557. Oklahoma's S.B. 1654 bans schools from using books that \"make as their primary subject the study of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender issues.\" Tennessee's H.B. 800 would proscribe classroom materials \"that promote, normalize, support, or address lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) issues or lifestyles.\" Kansas' H.B. 2662 forbids any material that \"depicts\" homosexuality-not gay sex, but the mere existence of same-sex couples. Any teacher who violates the law could be fined and jailed.\n\nMany of these anti-LGBTQ bills are framed as \"parents' rights\" or \"curriculum transparency\" measures. The reason is obvious. As PEN America has reported , such measures represent \"a convergence between two distinct but related sets of actors: First, anti-LGBTQ+ activists, well-established but with limited success in penetrating public schools; and second, the 'anti-Critical Race Theory' movement.\" This anti-CRT campaign \"has primed the public to support sweeping censorship of classroom speech. For anti-LGBTQ+ activists, this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, a chance to ram through bills that are far more restrictive than anything the public would normally accept.\"\n\nThe groups pushing these bills view speech about race and LGBTQ people as part of the same broader evil. Heritage Foundation, the conservative D.C. think tank, lobbies against both CRT (defined as virtually any discussion of race) and LGBTQ acceptance (which it labels \"sexual orientation and gender identity ideology\") in schools. Family Policy Alliance , the lobbying arm of Focus on the Family, advocates against education about race and LGBTQ identities under the umbrella of protecting \"parental rights.\" So does its Florida chapter , which has mobilized in support of Florida's gag rule.\n\nOne registered lobbyist for H.B. 1557, Moms for Liberty, formed just two years ago. The group's trajectory illustrates how these causes have melted together. Moms for Liberty first came on the scene to lobby against mask mandates in school in 2020. It quickly morphed into a \"parents' rights\" organization and set its sights on educational censorship, demanding that schools ban books depicting interracial marriage, Martin Luther King, Jr., and civil rights protests (allegedly for depicting police in a negative light). Naturally, the group then took aim at LGBTQ-themed books, equating sensitive depictions of gay youth with pornography. It even objected to a book about seahorses because it explained that males carry the eggs.\n\nThe interests of anti-LGBTQ activists and anti-CRT activists overlap where it matters: Both groups want to control what information their children are exposed to at school by gagging educators and students. Our current moral panic is rooted in the fear-carefully cultivated by Republican lawmakers and conservative media-that schools are indoctrinating students with a dangerous, un-American \"ideology.\" They seize on ambient parental concerns that cultural currents are drawing their children further out to sea and away from the shores of traditional morality. Just as some parents don't want their kids to learn about same-sex marriage, others don't want them to discover structural racism, Jim Crow, and slavery . Already, this movement is shifting toward the censorship of all ideas that offend them, including the existence of communism , sexism, and atheism. (You can read an index of these bills here .)\n\nOn a podcast supporting H.B. 1557, Ben Shapiro declared that he would always \"passionately defend protecting small children from the predations of adults who wish to talk about controversial social issues with children.\" This word-\"predations,\" which Shapiro deployed repeatedly-is the skeleton key to this entire debate. It reflects an angst that gay people who do not conceal their sexuality are attempting to brainwash and molest children.\n\nThis outlandish and bigoted notion has deep roots. You see this assumption in the infamous 1961 short film Boys Beware , which warned schoolchildren against predatory homosexuals and was produced in part by (of course) a school district. You see it in the failed 1978 campaign to ban gay teachers from California schools. You see it in Board of Education v. National Gay Task Force , a 1985 case in which the Supreme Court struck down an Oklahoma law barring teachers from \"encouraging or promoting\" homosexuality. (The state cited a need to protect \"student morality\" and \"traditional cultural values,\" worrying about student \"imitation\" of gay teachers.) You see it in many ads supporting Proposition 8, which asserted that legal same-sex marriage would force educators to indoctrinate kids . (Tagline: \"It has everything to do with schools.\") Now we see it in Florida, Tennessee, Kansas, Oklahoma-it's a safe bet that a \"Don't Say Gay\" bill will gain traction in every state legislature controlled by Republicans.\n\nWhenever there is a moral panic involving children, homophobes see an opportunity. The CRT fracas presented them with a chance to shoehorn their cause into a much larger and more successful movement, giving it a huge boost of attention, money, and political support. But there is nothing new about its underlying demands, or the bigotry that motivates them. We are still trapped in the same argument over the humanity of gay people. And as usual, it is the youngest and most vulnerable among us who will pay the greatest price.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Person Is Political\n\nThis piece is part of the Radical issue , a special package from Outward , Slate's home for coverage of LGBTQ life, thought, and culture. Read more here .\n\nThe First Amendment is a source of anxiety these days, for queer communities specifically and progressive communities more broadly. That anxiety is not unfounded. From efforts to erode LGBTQ anti-discrimination laws to decisions striking down common-sense regulations providing women information on their reproductive options, the First Amendment is being deployed as a deregulatory tool. But disquiet regarding the First Amendment's transformation into a conservative cudgel should be tempered with an understanding of its continued emancipatory potential for queer people. Because LGBTQ movement litigation has recently favored equal protection arguments, advancing a rhetoric of sameness and conformity, we've forgotten what the First Amendment, focused on individual expression, can do for us. But used strategically, the First Amendment has the potential to be more radically inclusive of intersectional queer identities and diversity within LGBTQ communities than the \"just-like-you\" discourse of marriage equality.\n\nIn fact, history suggests that the First Amendment was in many ways the first legal foothold for LGBTQ people. As detailed in Carlos Ball's recent book , decades before the Supreme Court would acknowledge the importance of equal treatment of same-sex relationships, the court protected the ability of queer people to express explanations of their identities and granted them leeway to gather together to further explore and elaborate those identities. In this way, the First Amendment served an important incubating function for the development of future equality and privacy arguments in favor of LGBTQ individuals while it simultaneously created space for greater visibility of queer people to each other and in American society writ large.\n\nBut the First Amendment was also the first \"queer\" right -as opposed to gay right-in a second sense. A strong argument can be made that when LGBTQ rights were originally pursued under the First Amendment, litigants crafted a broader, more comprehensive, and diverse tableau of queer identity. This was in part because plaintiffs were not encouraged to place themselves squarely within a particular socially constructed category or contend that they were the \"same\" as straight people in order to obtain equal treatment, as arguably required by more familiar equal protection doctrine.\n\nMy research of the roughly 90 cases involving around 600 plaintiffs pending in the period after Windsor and before Obergefell was decided two years later highlights that time after time, plaintiffs' roles as parents, their religiosity, military service, law enforcement backgrounds, and professionalism were emphasized to the courts. Plaintiffs were routinely characterized as \"same\" or mainstream and otherwise depicted as \"productive members of society.\" In reality, LGB individuals face higher rates of poverty than heterosexual people, in part as a result of the lack of uniform employment and housing discrimination protections. And queer people in America are often targeted for police surveillance rather than being members of law enforcement.\n\nEqually important in this batch of cases is what same-sex couples were, supposedly, not. Virtually none of the complaints emphasize or mention whether any of the plaintiffs are HIV-positive. Nor is there mention of any of the plaintiffs being transgender. Bisexuality is nowhere mentioned. That is, rather than exploring queer difference or queer sexuality or emphasizing the ways in which queerness intersects with and magnifies other forms of marginalization (such as poverty, immigration status, or racial discrimination), the equal protection challenges emphasized sameness, painting a highly circumscribed portrait of queer identity.\n\nConversely, as chronicled by Ball, in the early First Amendment LGBTQ cases from the 1950s to 1970s, courts and society were forced to confront queer difference and queer sexuality more directly. Indeed, two of the first LGBTQ cases to ever be considered by the Supreme Court were challenges to government efforts to censor publications discussing gay and lesbian subject matter for violating obscenity laws.\n\nIn a second category of First Amendment cases, courts protected the freedom of association. In cases ranging from prohibitions on gay bars to refusal to recognize queer student groups, courts began to recognize the right of LGBTQ people to congregate, socialize, and organize for the purpose of expressing their opinions. Importantly, often the opinions being expressed were in opposition to laws criminalizing same-sex sexual conduct. The free association cases provided queer communities further opportunity to introduce courts and society to their sexualities and their sexual conduct.\n\nA third category of cases revolved around free speech challenges by public employees who had been fired for coming out of the closet. While not uniformly successful, there were nevertheless important civil servant and public employee victories, reflecting, at least in broad strokes, a judicial recognition of the relationship between identity, social context, and expression. That is, certain identities within a hegemonic cultural setting can, in and of themselves, take on a political expressive valence -one that may be entitled to First Amendment coverage.\n\nThese three categories of cases (obscenity, association, and public employee coming-out cases) created the conditions for increased visibility of queer people in American society and paved the way for the expression of equality demands that would follow. But just as significant is that they compelled, or at the very least facilitated, consideration of the sexual and political components of queer identities by courts and the American public.\n\nAnd there is still opportunity for the First Amendment to deepen judicial and societal understanding of identity and social context, providing protections to a broader variety of queer identities, especially gender-nonconforming and genderqueer people. The freedom of expression can pick up where the equality litigation has left off: It has further work to do in expanding-and complicating-society's understanding of queer identities.\n\nIdentities-including sexual and gender identities-are dynamic. And our \"sexed\" bodies are similarly dynamic - the product of biology and genetics, yes, but also social forces that shape and construct our bodies and identities. In turn, our outward-facing identities contribute to the social tableau and shape others' identities. In the end, our identities say something . They say something personal and often political. They are individually expressive-even if partially (largely?) the product of social forces.\n\nThe First Amendment can help society and courts better understand these dynamics. A look at some recent examples of First Amendment litigation challenging the regulation of queer identity shows how. While this litigation often receives less attention than the equality-based marriage litigation or efforts to protect LGBTQ anti-discrimination laws from First Amendment challenges, it is no less critical and, in my view, has tremendous liberating potential.\n\nMany jurisdictions have laws that greatly restrict or outright prohibit a person from changing the gender marker on their birth certificate or driver's license. Transgender people and many gender-nonconforming people are exposed to discrimination and violence because of such laws, which may out their nonnormative status to potential employers or anyone else who may need to evaluate their identification. And restrictive identification laws also force-compel-people to embrace a gender and an identity that do not reflect their reality. A recent Lambda Legal lawsuit challenging Puerto Rico's law restricting people's ability to change the gender marker on their birth certificate makes that very point (and also centers Latinx transgender clients). The lawsuit highlights that speech and identity are often intimately linked, with self-identifying speech helping to construct queer identities and gender norms, and with compelled identification disciplining and restricting those same identities. Moreover, to the extent such lawsuits require courts to grapple with the fact that one's gender identity and expression may be divorced from certain biological components (namely, external genitalia), these challenges have the potential to educate courts about transgender, intersex, and gender-nonconforming identities, much as the early First Amendment obscenity cases forced courts to confront gay and lesbian sexuality.\n\nSimilarly, public school districts and government employers not infrequently impose dress codes that restrict people's ability to wear clothing that best reflects their gender or sexuality. These dress codes directly police gender and sexuality . For example, one school punished a student and forbade him from wearing a T-shirt containing a rainbow ichthys-known popularly as the \"sign of the fish\" or \"Jesus fish,\" a Christian symbol-and the slogan \"Jesus Is Not a Homophobe.\" Another school prohibited a black transgender student, who had been assigned a male sex at birth, from wearing a dress to prom. In another example, a school refused to permit a male student to bring another male to prom as his date. Each of these instances of government regulation of clothing and association performatively reconstructing gender and sexuality norms was successfully challenged as violating the First Amendment.\n\nIn each of these contexts, nothing about the First Amendment doctrine would necessitate painting a portrait of a plaintiff as \"normal.\" On the contrary, the less conforming the plaintiff, the stronger the argument that the nonconforming aspect of the plaintiff's identity is expressive and therefore entitled to First Amendment coverage. The deviation from social norms is meaningful enough to communicate something external-and, in certain instances, is being read as expressive by the government regulator and regulated for that reason (subjecting the regulation to heightened First Amendment scrutiny).\n\nIn short, while skepticism regarding the First Amendment is warranted, the First Amendment still has the potential to enable legally protected articulation of noncategorized identities. And it also permits further, future contestation of those very same \"queer\" identities. In other words, the First Amendment, like the meaning of the word \"queer\" itself, will always encourage and reward difference.\n\nThis article draws from a piece entitled \" The First Queer Right \" published by the Michigan Law Review.\n\nRead all of Outward's special issue on Radicalism .
