      "text": "Freedom Caucus Chair blasts GOP colleagues for campaigning against him: 'RINOs'\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has been working hard to keep his job to escape the same fate as his predecessor, US Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), amid months of attempting to negotiate with Democrats on government spending despite constant criticism from far-right colleagues.\n\nIn addition to juggling threats of his ouster from certain members, the speaker is also challenged with the fact some members are actively campaigning against each other. According to CNN, Johnson told his GOP colleagues to \"cool it\" during the lawmakers' retreat earlier this month.\n\nFreedom Caucus Chair Bob Good (R-VA) on Thursday took to X (formerly Twitter) to blast a few of \"his House Republican colleagues who backed his primary challenger,\" according to Politico.\n\nPer the news outlet, \"The battle goes against Johnson's entreaties for Republicans to refrain from campaigning against each other in primaries, as the party tries to keep its control of the lower chamber.\"\n\nGood wrote , \"The RINOs who hosted a DC fundraiser for my opponent last night are going to vote for the massive uniparty spending bill on the House floor without having time to read it. Shows how he would vote if he were in Congress with them.\"\n\nThe Virginia lawmaker also tagged the GOP members, including, US Rep. Austin Scott (R-GA), US Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA), US Rep. Morgan Luttrell (R-TX), US Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL), US Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-MT), and US Rep. Derrick Van Arden (R-WI).\n\nSimilarly, US Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) last week went against GOP leaders' \"pleas\" by campaigning against his fellow Republican House member, Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Texas) for a far-right \"pro-gun social media influencer.\"\n\nLast month, Politico reported as Johnson faces several obstacles that \"include twin government funding deadlines, a twice-punted surveillance fight and growing concerns that Republicans are poised to lose House control in November,\" several GOP members, like Good , threaten \"consequences\" for the Louisiana lawmaker if he makes the wrong move.\n\nAs GOP House members, like McCarthy, US Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) - most recently, Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), and others, announce their retirement, threatening an already razor-thin Republican majority, Good couldn't care less.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus chair told CNN last month, \"Why don't you survey the country and see if there is any brain to drain in Congress. Congress has a 20 percent approval rating. Most of what we do to the country is bad. I think the retirements are a wonderful thing.... I have no concerns, zero concerns. We probably need a few more retirements.\"\n\nIn January, Good was one of the far-right members among about a dozen others who told reporters , according to the New York Times, that despite a potential government shutdown, the bipartisan spending deal Johnson and US Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) reached was \"unacceptable.\""

      "text": "House Republican slams colleagues for trying to 'torpedo' policy 'we all ran on doing'\n\nRep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) isn't happy with House Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-Louisiana) promise to kill immigration legislation that the US Senate is working to pass.\n\nAccording to reporter Emily Brooks of the Hill, Crenshaw railed against his Republican colleagues on Thursday for refusing to even consider any legislation to address the flow of migrants at the Southern border. Brooks tweeted that Crenshaw - while not naming names - specifically addressed his comments to \"the right\" in airing his frustrations.\n\n\"I'm extremely disappointed in the very strange maneuvering by many on the right to torpedo a potential border reform bill. That's what we all ran on doing,\" Crenshaw said. \"If we have a bill that decreases illegal immigration - and that's an if, right? ... But if we have a bill that on net significantly decreases illegal immigration, and we sabotage that, that is inconsistent with what we told our voters we would do.\"\n\nThe US Senate is currently close to finalizing legislation aimed at providing additional funding for border security, as well as new authorities for the executive branch allowing for a temporary shutdown of the border if crossings number more than 5,000 in a given week. President Joe Biden has insisted he's done all he can to stem the flow of migrants without additional powers over the border that would have to be granted by an act of Congress.\n\nSens. James Lankford (R-Oklahoma), Chris Murphy (D-Connecticut) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Arizona) have been leading the bipartisan negotiations since late last year, and the Democratic-controlled US Senate is poised to pass a legislative package that would include many items on the Republican wish list. Included in the proposed framework is language that would allow for the automatic expulsion of asylum seekers and shortening the time for asylum to be considered to just six months (where it used to take up to 10 years). The Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) has criticized the framework as potentially committing \"refoulement,\" which pertains to international law aimed at preventing governments from knowingly sending people fleeing danger back to their home countries.\n\n\" Refoulement was frequent during the Title 42 era. In addition to exposing some asylum seekers to the same perils they were originally fleeing, border expulsions placed them in new danger,\" WOLA wrote. \"Despite the difficulty of monitoring during the pandemic, Human Rights First and border-zone partners tracked 13,480 attacks-killings, rapes, kidnappings, assaults, robberies-against people expelled into dangerous Mexican border cities.\"\n\nDespite the conservative nature of the bill, former President Donald Trump has been reportedly lobbying Republicans to not support the legislation, hoping to prevent Biden from notching a win on a key campaign issue for Trump."

      "text": "Republicans unveil new strategy to deal with town halls filled with angry voters\n\nDemocrats have a great opportunity here.\n\nCongressman Mark Pocan has been doing it for years. Representative Ro Khanna is doing three of them this coming month. Bernie Sanders is doing it, too. We should all be reaching out to our members of the House and Senate to ask them to do the same.\n\nI'm talking about elected Democrats traveling to Red districts (House members) or Red states (Senators) to hold town halls in those places where Republicans refuse to show their faces.\n\nAfter all, Republicans are running in the other direction. As NBC News reports:\n\nThere are 215 Democratic members of the House and 47 Democrats in the Senate: if even a quarter of them were to adopt this strategy, even once a month, it could turn around politics in America.\n\nFor years, Congressman Pocan has regaled my listeners on his regular \"Middays With Mark\" segments with stories about how his Republican colleagues in nearby districts generally refuse to do town halls. So, he goes into those districts and does them himself, much to the delight of local Democrats and the curiosity of local Republican voters.\n\nCongressman Ro Khanna revealed last week on my program that he's planning to do the same in two or three districts represented by \"bashful\" Republicans in California.\n\nAnd Bernie Sanders has been absolutely kicking ass, traveling across Red states and drawing huge crowds, filling and selling out major venues, with his \"anti-oligarchy\" tour .\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer recently bragged to reporters how he was learning how to do social media from a PowerPoint that Cory Booker put together. It's a start, but why - if he's truly a leader - isn't he doing what Bernie is and visiting Red states to carry the Democrats' message?\n\nSimilarly, House Leader Hakeem Jefferies told Rachel Maddow that he doesn't need any more \"steel\" in his spine. But why isn't he visiting Republican-controlled parts of America to let people trapped in the Fox \"News\"/rightwing-hate-radio bubble know what's really happening?\n\nWhen members of Congress visit their constituents and take questions, it's almost always a newsworthy event, getting the kind of local coverage that you just can't pay for. When a member from the opposite party drops in, it's even more of a media event!\n\nIf you're represented by Democrats in the House or Senate, call them now - at 202-224-3121 - to encourage them to visit Red areas to carry the message of our democracy under assault by the Trump/Musk MAGA movement.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're represented by Republicans who refuse to visit their state or district to meet with voters, find a local venue (school auditoriums are generally easy to book) willing to host a town hall and tentatively set up a town hall for a visiting Democrat, then start reaching out to elected Democrats to find one who'll come to town.\n\nIt's so easy for members of Congress to settle into Washington, DC or take fancy junkets to the south of France, but this is a time of national emergency. Political theater is one of the few ways to break through media complacency - just look at the impact of the Tea Party when President Obama was talking about adding a Medicare buy-in to Obamacare - and this is political theater of the first degree.\n\nIt's time to get active, and to encourage our reluctant, wary, or even lazy Democratic politicians to get with the program.\n\nOur Founders fought and died for our nation; the least our elected officials can do is hop on a plane and answer an hour's worth of questions.\n\nNOW READ: DC insider has an urgent message for America - and the rest of the world"

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) blasted her right-wing colleagues during a Tuesday interview over their failure to back her ongoing efforts to impeach President Joe Biden, The Daily Beast reports.\n\nFollowing House Republicans' failed attempt to oust Biden, CNN reported in April that \"after 15 months of coming up short in proving some of his biggest claims against the president, [House Oversight Committee Chair James] Comer (R-KY) recently approached one of his Republican colleagues and made a blunt admission: He was ready to be 'done with' the impeachment inquiry into Biden.\" CNN added that the chairman's probe had reached \"a dead end.\"\n\nDuring a conversation on Steve Bannon's \"War Room\" podcast Tuesday, the Beast reports Greene said, \"Today, we should be voting to impeach Joe Biden, because of the invasion in the United States. Oh, but no! None of that is happening up here in Washington, D.C. because Republicans continually have their head up their a**.\"\n\nThe right-wing leader added, \"This is a new time in America, and I am so fed up, Steve. I am so fed up. I am so sick of it because I know people at home are sick of it. People are sick and tired of a feckless, useless Republican Party that never does a damn thing to stop any of this. They just sit in the boat and row along with the Democrats and row.\"\n\nThe Beast noted , \"House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) told reporters that impeachment needs to be 'very methodical' and that his colleagues should wait to see what current investigations will yield, according to Roll Call .\"\n\nNew York Times opinion writer Michelle Cottle explained that the Georgia lawmaker also found herself without support in her efforts to oust Johnson last month.\n\n\"In the wake of Ms. Greene's failed crusade to depose House Speaker Mike Johnson, her craziest-clown-at-the-carnival act seems to have descended into a sad clown party of one,\" Cottle wrote.\n\n\"Not long ago, people were buzzing about the MAGA radical as a kind of shadow speaker, the woman who had her party's leadership running scared,\" the Times writer continued. \"Three years into her congressional tenure, Ms. Greene has reached a defining moment of sorts. Does she want to remain a fringy, bomb-lobbing troll in the backbenches, or will she try to become something more?\"\n\nThe Daily Beast's full report is available at this link (subscription required)."

      "text": "'Significant concerns': GOP analyst explains why Jordan's plan to 'bully' Republican colleagues might fail\n\nHours after House Majority Leader Steve Scalise ended his bid for speaker Thursday, October 12, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) announced he would pursue the GOP nomination for a second time.\n\nDuring Sunday's episode of CNN This Morning Weekend, CNN analyst and former special assistant to ex-President George W. Bush Scott Jennings spoke with hosts Victor Blackwell and Amara Walker about the potential fate of Jordan's bid.\n\nBlackwell said, \"Congressman Jim Jordan is the GOP's nominee for the job, but there is a big problem. He is still far short of the 217 votes needed to get the gavel. He only got 152 votes in THE secret ballot after Steve Scalise abandoned his bid. He has been spending the weekend trying to win over holdouts. Joining us, Scott Jennings. He can only afford to lose four. Five in all the Democrats is a loss. Are there five absolute no's on Jim Jordan? Can he get there?\"\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\nJennings replied, \"I mean, great question. I mean, one thing about being the GOP nominee for this office is it doesn't really mean anything. Steve Scalise was the GOP nominee and he had to drop out. Kevin McCarthy, of course, was the selection of the conference. He's no longer the Speaker of the House. So that means nothing. And there are significant concerns with Jordan among people who are on the armed services committee, defense hawks, and a few more moderate members of the party. I think the Jordan plan is to try to use the conservative grassroots to bully these people when they actually have to go on floor and cast their ballot publicly. What happened in conference was a secret ballot. But, I don't know. I talked to a member this weekend who told me it was possible, but not likely. So that was one man's handicapping.\"\n\nWalker then asked, \"So, Scott, what do you think about the strategy then or this reported plan for him to try to bully people into voting for him? Will it work?\"\n\nScott said, \"Well, the conservatives that i that the moderates who often talk a good game and always fold, will fold when they get to the floor and have to face down public vote. but i don't know if they can bank on that this time because the numbers are so small as was pointed out. You only need five people to tank this thing. obviously, there is any goodwill from the democrats for Jim Jordan. He has been a big thorn in their side for years. I don't know if that will work. I mean, there's a part of the party views being on television and views being sort of a talking head as the most important part of the job. That's what the grassroots sees. But there's also a part of the party in the House, the rank and file members who know the job of speaker is political mechanics, running the conference and actual governing. That's not what Jim Jordan is known for. He is certainly beloved by conservative grassroots, but that's really different than running the House of Representatives.\"\n\nWatch the video below or at this link .\n\n'Significant concerns' with Jordan's speaker run: GOP analyst youtu.be"

      "text": "MTG 'lost a whole lot of respect in her district' after failing to oust Mike Johnson: report\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) is increasingly alienating her Republican colleagues and even some of her own constituents after her unsuccessful attempt to strip House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) of the gavel on Wednesday.\n\nPolitico reported Thursday that the Georgia congresswoman has become more isolated among the House Republican Caucus since her motion to vacate - which 10 other Republicans supported - was soundly defeated with the help of House Democrats . One unnamed member of Congress speaking anonymously to Politico dismissed Greene's motion as \"fundraising.\"\n\n\"She's pissed off because she was friends with [former Speaker Kevin] McCarthy and she missed the first vacancy, so she called the second vacancy,\" the member said.\n\nRep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Georgia), whose congressional district (the 11th) borders Greene's (the 14th), said the far-right lawmaker has reason to worry about losing the support of her constituents after trying to boot a sitting Republican speaker. He added that she even defied former President Donald Trump in pursuing her doomed motion.\n\n\"People are calling me saying: 'Please, tell her to not do this.' Mike is a good man. He's doing the best he can. Trump's calling her and telling her not to,\" Loudermilk said. \"I think she's lost a whole lot of respect in her district.\"\n\nOther Republicans - particularly from swing districts - have been loudly expressing their distaste with the firebrand congresswoman. Politico reported that Rep. Mike Lawler (R-New York) said that \"Moscow Marjorie has clearly gone off the deep end - maybe the result of a space laser.\" That comment is likely a reference to a 2018 social media post Greene made alleging that California wildfires were the fault of \"lasers or blue beams of light\" caused by a family of Jewish bankers.\n\n\"Why do those losers get all of the attention?\" wondered Rep. Brandon Williams (R-New York), when seeing Greene surrounded by a slew of journalists and photographers.\n\nGreene spent hours in Johnson's office earlier this week, in which the speaker presumably attempted to convince her to abandon her effort. However, the Georgia Republican held fast to her position that Johnson wasn't doing enough to pass conservative policy victories, and was being overly accommodating to House Democrats in his bipartisan work to keep government agencies funded and send more funding overseas to help Ukraine fight its war with Russia.\n\n\"I'm proud of myself, because this is the whole reason why I ran for Congress,\" Greene told a gaggle of reporters on Capitol Hill. \"I'm sick and tired of the Republican Party that never does what they say they're going to do. I'm tired of them making promises on television.\"\n\n\"I'm doing everything I promised my district when I ran for Congress,\" she added.\n\nAfter winning her primary unopposed earlier this year, Greene will face off against Democrat Shawn Harris. Cook Political Report has rated her district R+22 , meaning a Republican would win against a Democrat with an approximate advantage of 22 points."

Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) resigned from Congress to pursue his short-lived bid to be attorney general. But even his former Republican colleagues don't appear to be missing him.\n\nThat's according to a recent video in which the 119th Congress - which will serve between 2025 and 2027 - was in the early process of being sworn in. Earlier Friday afternoon, House Clerk Kevin McCumber announced that Congress had received official communication from the Florida Republican that he was not returning to the House of Representatives. Members could be heard loudly cheering and applauding as the announcement was read.\n\n\"The clerk is in receipt of a letter from the honorable Matt Gaetz from the state of Florida, indicating that he will not serve in the House in the 119th Congress,\" McCumber said, as members applauded. \"Without objection, the letters relating to his resignation will be printed in the record.\"\n\nGaetz had reportedly resigned in order to speed aling the special election process to allow Governor Ron DeSantis to quickly fill the seat for the vacant 1st Congressional District, which encompasses the Florida panhandle. However, his resignation also came on the heels of the House Committee on Ethics' pending release of a report detailing multiple scandalous allegations of paying for sex with a minor and illegal drug use.\n\nBecause the Ethics Committee only has jurisdiction over sitting members, it was believed that Gaetz's resignation would have allowed the Republican-controlled committee to bury the report. However, the report was eventually made public after weeks of sustained public pressure. Despite the details of the allegations - which include Gaetz reportedly paying a teenage girl for sex despite her just having completed her junior year of high school - the DOJ has elected to not charge him with crimes.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump tapped Gaetz to lead the Department of Justice, though Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration after just eight days when it became clear that he wouldn't have enough votes in the Republican-controlled Senate to be confirmed. He's now launching his own show on the far-right One America News Network.\n\nWatch the video of McCumber's announcement below, or by clicking this link ."
