      "text": "'Even Mike Pence knows': Internet erupts after Trump's former VP skewers his new tariffs\n\nBedford, N.H. USA - Aug. 5, 2023: Former Vice President Mike Pence speaks during an event sponsored by Polaris National Security (Image: Shutterstock)\n\nShortly after President Donald Trump issued Wednesday's announcement of new tariffs, four Senate Republicans joined Democrats to extend a lopsided bipartisan rebuke to his trade policy. The Senate adopted a resolution by a 51 to 48 vote to block his proposed tariffs on imports from Canada, a longtime US ally. Now, former Vice President Mike Pence is further infuriating Trump supporters by calling out his new tariffs as \"a tax.\"\n\nPence cited a statement from his Advancing American Freedom Foundation describing the tariffs as \"the largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history,\" capable of spoiling \"America's golden age before it begins.\"\n\n\"The Trump Tariff Tax will cost American families more than $3,500 per year,\" Pence's foundation claimed, adding, \"The median American family earns about 101,000 a year. A new $3,500 tax would easily erase three years' worth of pay raises for most families.\"\n\nThe statement quickly drew howls of fury from Trump supporters who believe Pence undermined Trump's attempt to overthrow the 2020 election when he refused to support Trump and his \" gaggle of crackpot lawyers \" who asked him \"to literally reject votes\" at the Jan. 6 certification proceeding in 2020.\n\nOne supporter compared Pence's tariff-related share on X as \"treason\" because he owes Trump \"his loyalty,\" while hundreds of others accused him of betrayal.\n\nMany more notable X observers welcomed Pence as one of few Republican voices speaking openly against the destructive tariffs, even as Trump's announcement sank stock prices and tumbled markets within minutes on Wednesday. FamiliesUSA Deputy Senior Policy Director Ben Anderson seized on Pence's post, pointing out that \"even Mike Pence knows Trump's tariffs are taxing poor and middle-income families to give to the rich, and extort American businesses to establish cronyism and oligarchy.\n\nNews anchor Lawrence O' Donnell referenced the post as an example that, \"Trump Republicans now support the biggest tax increase in history,\" and agreed that \"Yes, it's not just a tax. It's the biggest one in history.\"\n\nUntil today, the vast majority of GOP members have supported Trump's multiple tariffs, or they have refused to publicly speak against them. It was no surprise, then, that reporters like New York Times bestselling author and NPR reporter Steve Inskeep and Sandiego Union-Tribune reporter Tom Mallory were quick to document the growing chink in Republican unity.\n\nStill more X users expressed gratitude to Pence, \" for being a conservative and supporting free markets ,\" while others were more grudging in their appreciation. Pence spent most of his tenure as Trump's VP fully endorsing the most controversial of Trump's first-term initiatives.\n\n\"I HATE when I have to agree with Mike Pence,\" said one user, echoing a long roster of similar admissions.\n\nOther commenters, including \"Useful Idiot\" author and reporter S.V. Dáte , worried Pence was working his way onto Trump's hit list, saying \"Hope the VP doesn't have tattoos or he's El Salvador bound.\""

      "text": "'Completely out of step': Mike Pence's org comes out swinging against Trump Cabinet pick\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence may no longer be President-elect Donald Trump's right-hand man, but he's not quite done with politics yet.\n\nThat's according to a Wednesday article in Politico , which reported that Pence's organization, Advancing American Freedom (AAF), is waging a campaign aimed at Republican senators urging them to reject one of Trump's high-profile Cabinet picks. AAF is setting its sights on Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary-designate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over his previous positions in favor of abortion.\n\nAAF wrote in a statement that Kennedy is \"pro-abortion,\" which the group argues is \"completely out of step with the strong, pro-life record of the first Trump Administration.\"\n\n\"While RFK Jr. has made certain overtures to pro-life leaders that he would be mindful of their concerns at HHS, there is little reason for confidence at this time,\" AAF's letter continued.\n\nAAF's letter advocating against Kennedy's confirmation comes on the heels of a remark Pence made in December, when he lamented that RFK Jr. was \"the most pro-abortion Republican appointed secretary of HHS in modern history.\" And so far, the president-elect's team has remained relatively quiet regarding RFK Jr.'s past comments in favor of abortion.\n\nWhen Kennedy was fielding his own presidential bid as an independent, he had conflicting positions on abortion. At first, he backed a 15-week ban on the procedure, but then did a one-eighty and said all pregnant individuals should have the right to an abortion, \" even if it's full-term .\" He's since walked that statement back saying that he only supports abortion restrictions late into a pregnancy.\n\nAs Politico reported, HHS has significant sway over abortion in the United States as it provides funding for women's health nonprofit Planned Parenthood. HHS also has jurisdiction over abortion drug Mifepristone, which has been used for medication abortions with FDA approval for decades. The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 has called for the enforcement of the Comstock Act of 1873 as a means of restricting access to abortion drugs like Mifepristone."

      "text": "Watch: Mike Pence declares that Americans have no right to 'freedom from religion'\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence claimed during a Wednesday appearance on Fox Business that the First Amendment to the  United States Constitution does not protect Americans from having other people's faiths forced upon them.\n\n\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances,\" it states.\n\nIn fact, there are no references to a supreme being anywhere in the Constitution, because the Founding Fathers were adamantly opposed to centralized religious power as well as requiring individuals to subscribe to any particular denomination.\n\nThe concept of separation of church and state was sacrosanct to men like President Thomas Jefferson, who wrote in his 1776 Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom that \"setting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as such endeavoring to impose them on others, hath established and maintained false religions over the greatest part of the world and through all time\" and that \"to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors , is sinful and tyrannical.\"\n\nJefferson's condemnation of forced faith in the document was unambiguous, further affirming that \"no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.\"\n\nPresident James Madison, in whose hand the Constitution was penned, concurred with Jefferson.\n\n\"The settled opinion here is that religion is essentially distinct from Civil Government, and exempt from its cognizance; that a connexion between them is injurious to both; that there are causes in the human breast, which ensure the perpetuity of religion without the aid of the law,\" Madison explained in an 1819 letter, noting that \"a legal establishment of religion without a toleration could not be thought of, and with toleration, is no security for public quiet and harmony, but rather a source itself of discord and animosity.\"\n\nBenjamin Franklin took it one step further, arguing in 1780 that any religion that seeks to impose itself is simply \"bad.\"\n\nYet Pence and host Larry Kudlow share an interpretation that strays wildly from what Jefferson, Franklin, and Madison clearly spelled out more than two centuries ago.\n\n\"These lefties want to scrap religion, Mike Pence, and I think it's a terrible mistake,\" Kudlow griped.\n\n\"Well, the radical left believes that the freedom of religion is the freedom from religion. But it's nothing the American founders ever thought of or generations of Americans fought to defend,\" Pence said.\n\nAs mentioned, that statement is completely false. Jefferson even concluded in his treatise that \"such act will be an infringement of natural right.\"\n\nBut Pence was not finished. He also suggested that the Supreme Court's right-wing supermajority has a duty to side with one faith over another. Today, that means the GOP's embrace of Christian nationalism .\n\n\"You know, I said today here in Houston that the source of our nation's greatness has always been our faith in God, our freedom, and our vast natural resources. And the good news is, that after four years of the Trump-Pence administration, I'm confident that we have a pro-religious freedom majority on the Supreme Court of the United States. And I'm confident that come Election Day, November the 8th, you're gonna see that freedom majority around the country turn out and vote pro-freedom majorities in the House, and in the Senate, and in statehouses around the country,\" Pence said. \"So stay tuned, Larry. Help is on the way.\"\n\nWatch below or at this link ."

      "text": "'Hardline MAGA supporters' rip JD Vance for Jan. 6 comments - and compare him to Mike Pence\n\n\"Hillbilly Elegy\" author JD Vance was once a scathing critic of Donald Trump , but by time he ran for the U.S. Senate via Ohio in 2022, he had given himself an ultra-MAGA makeover and become a forceful Trump defender. That defense played a role in Trump's decision to make Vance his running mate in 2024.\n\nBut now, the vice-president-elect is drawing angry criticism from some MAGA Republicans for saying he favors pardons for some but not all of the January 6, 2021 rioters.\n\nPresident-elect Trump, since winning the 2024 election, has doubled down on his promise to pardon rioters who have faced federal charges for their attack on the U.S. Capitol Building that day. And he hasn't ruled out the possibility of pardoning January 6 rioters who violently attacked police.\n\nVance, during an appearance on Fox News , drew a distinction between violent and nonviolent defendants.\n\nVance told Fox News' Shannon Bream , \"If you protested peacefully on January 6.... you should be pardoned. If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned. And there's a little bit of a grey area there.\"\n\nThe London Times' Hugh Tomlinson notes that Vance's comments have angered some Trump supporters, and Vance has responded that he has long been a supporter of the January 6 defendants.\n\n\"Social media posts have circulated comparing Vance to Mike Pence, Trump's vice-president during his first term in office,\" Tomlinson explains . \"Pence is loathed by hardline MAGA supporters for refusing to block certification of the 2020 election result on the day of the riot. Some who marched on the Capitol chanted 'Hang Mike Pence.'\"\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, Vance posted, \"The president saying he'll look at each case (and me saying the same) is not some walk-back. I assure you, we care about people unjustly locked up. Yes, that includes people provoked and it includes people who got a garbage trial.\""

While he was waiting for Trump's official announcement of Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) as his 2024 running mate, Murphy asked several delegates at Milwaukee's Fiserv Forum what they thought of Trump's first running mate refusing to endorse his former boss in his third bid for the White House.\n\n\"He was a great vice president until he wasn't,\" Nevada Republican Mike Bassett told Murphy. He added that \"loyalty to Trump \" was one of his own main criterion in the former president's search for a new running mate.\n\nFlorida Republican Rose Roque, who was attending the convention with her daughter, Rose Rodriguez, told Murphy that she didn't \"even want to say\" what she thought about Pence when he asked her. But her daughter was more outspoken about the former vice president who declined to intervene in Congress' certification of the 2020 Electoral College vote count on January 6, 2021.\n\n\"He betrayed his country,\" Rodriguez said. \"Although he thought he was doing the correct thing, according to him, he let himself be poisoned. And I think he already was poisoned-he came in already being that way.\"\n\nBefore Vance was announced as Trump's pick for vice president, Murphy reported that other delegates ruminated about other options. Those favored by delegates include disgraced former two-star General Michael Flynn (Trump's former National Security Adviser) and others that would help the GOP shore up support from key voting blocs, like women and people of color.\n\n\"I did talk to delegates who wanted governing or managerial experience, strong communication skills, and even a bit of gender or racial diversity from their VP. Republicans floated Byron Donalds and Tulsi Gabbard. More than one person pined for Glenn Youngkin,\" Murphy wrote. \"But Pence had cast a shadow over the search.\"\n\nNew Jersey Republican Michael Rosen opined that Pence \"seemed to be trying to do a balancing act and it never really worked,\" culminating in the January 6 insurrection in which a mob of Trump supporters roamed the halls of the U.S. Capitol chanting \"hang Mike Pence.\" He said Trump needed \"someone who's gonna work with him and not gonna leave him in a lurch at the end.\"\n\n\"[Pence] should have worked with Trump when he was going through all that stuff instead of throwing his hands up and saying 'I've got no control,'\" Rosen said. \"We were kind of left with nothing.\""

      "text": "The curious case of Mike Pence\n\nFor 1,461 days, Mike Pence was literally a heartbeat, or a lack of one, away from ascending to the most powerful office in the world.\n\nPence, of course, was the vice president to the most corrupt, morally busted president in U.S. history from 2017 to 2021. He was unflinchingly loyal to the traitor, Donald J. Trump , and often at an embarrassingly pathetic level.\n\nHe had the singular talent of melting away into the background and making himself completely invisible, while his orange boss harrumphed his way around the world making our country look small, while becoming more bloated and full of himself by the day.\n\nPence knew his proper place in the administration was as far away from the limelight as possible. He was nothing but an expensive blue suit who hung himself neatly in the closet at the end of each lonely day spent in the shadows during those four long years.\n\nREAD: Jon Stewart, still a 'tiny, neurotic man,' back to remind Americans what's at stake\n\nHe was the perfect No. 2 for a sick, malignant narcissist, who has never been able to see anything past the end of those signature red ties that slop across his fat belly and hang down over his fat, little feet. Everything was about this wreck of a man, and if Pence wasn't good with that, nobody, with the possible exception of his wife, Mother, would have known it.\n\nCabinet members came and went during those chaotic four years, some exiting Trump's wobbly orbit loudly calling him \"a moron,\" while others slithered away more quietly, and out of the line of fire with hopes of landing a book deal and well-paid gigs on Rupert Murdoch's noxious, right-wing propaganda channel.\n\nBut Pence stayed put, staring straight ahead and far off into the distance literally thinking God knows what, while his boss defended Nazis, Putin, and greedy billionaires, and attacked our environment, human rights, and Democracy.\n\nIt wasn't until four years ago this month when Pence finally got his shot to actually do something good and meaningful for our country, which was spiraling into the death grips of a killer pandemic his broken boss had done everything to hide.\n\nJust when it seemed like things couldn't get any worse, we were faced with the grueling possibility that a pandemic could kill millions of us, while the orange parasitical tumor somehow hung on to survive four more years in our White House.\n\nTrump's approvals shot up to the highest level of his presidency, as many desperate Americans hoped that maybe, just maybe, he could finally rise to the occasion and do something right for just once in his miserable life.\n\nThat's when he did the most predictable thing ever and tapped Pence to lead his Coronavirus Task Force. The economy was beginning to tank, fear was rampant, death was all around us, and now Trump was suddenly the guy who was looking to become invisible and blend into the orange woodwork.\n\nHe needed a fall guy but quick to take the hit for his repulsive dereliction of duty.\n\nWell, Pence stepped in and something curious happened: He actually did a half-decent job. Pence calmly gave daily press briefings and assured the American public that everything was being done to combat this dangerous airborne virus.\n\nFlanked by Dr. Anthony Fauci, Americans saw something they hadn't witnessed in four years: calm and competence.\n\nThe reviews were good, which quickly became very bad news for him.\n\nJust like that, the slobbering attention-hog Trump was back on the scene, and within weeks was comfortably acting the part of the big, know-it-all buffoon and pitching Lysol to help us wash down our meals.\n\nREAD: How the GOP plans to drag America back to the 19th century\n\nNo way he was going to let his vice president be the face of this hit reality TV show.\n\nWell, we know how it all ended.\n\nTrump almost died from the pandemic he refused to take seriously, and then Pence almost died certifying our vote when his dark lord let loose his orcs in the Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nFour years later, both men are still with us, but have ended up in two very different places. Thanks to a cooperating attorney general, Merrick Garland, who it turns out isn't much interested in law and order, Trump has successfully avoided jail for his traitorous attack on America, while Pence has re-wrapped himself in some odd version of Christianity and tried to quietly restore whatever dignity he once had before so willingly surrendering it to evil.\n\nHe ran one of the most inconsequential presidential campaigns in history last year, branding himself as a real conservative Republican. Trouble was, there was already something far more shiny, and a woman no less, occupying that shrinking lane in their eroding party.\n\nNikki Haley, not Pence, would end up being the weak GOP alternative to the ghastly and poisonous Trump.\n\nHaley, of course, fell away, too, but not before letting the fascist forces in MAGA's GOP know they still had some work to do to earn her endorsement.\n\nIf Haley still had a sliver of power inside of her crumbling party, it looked like it was most certainly the end of the story for Pence, who could now fade away into the farmlands of Indiana to join his buddy, Dan Quayle. The two former Hoosier VPs could trade stories as two of the most notable footnotes in American history - both second fiddles to failed, off-key, one-term Republican presidents.\n\nThen last Friday the wind suddenly shifted and Pence took to the Fox propaganda airways and decided to let everybody know he'd changed his tune. Though to hear him tell it, he was still singing from the same sheet of music he always had.\n\n\"It should come as no surprise that I will not be endorsing Donald Trump this year,\" he said matter-of-factly.\n\nHe was right. It wasn't surprising, it was completely shocking.\n\nREAD: 'Hunters will become the hunted': Convicted J6er running for Congress makes a new promise\n\nAfter all, this was the same guy who raised his hand like a rocket during a GOP debate last fall when the group of presidential wannabes on the stage were asked if they would support Trump as the party's nominee even if he were convicted of a crime.\n\nBy Sunday, he was really pouring it on taking his former boss to task for calling the lowlifes who attacked our country and wanted him dead, \"hostages.\"\n\n\"I think it's very unfortunate at a time that there are American hostages being held in Gaza that the President or any other leader will refer to people that are moving through our justice system as hostages,\" Pence said Sunday on Face the Natio n. \"It's just unacceptable.\"\n\nWhere has this guy been?\n\nI've heard too many people say, that by also making it clear he won't be voting for Joe Biden, Pence's words are completely worthless. This is just about the worst political take I have ever heard.\n\nMike Pence didn't need to say anything. Something or someone changed his mind. And if something or someone was capable of changing Pence's mind, then Pence and his actions, however late, were capable of changing the minds of others who are still on the fence about supporting the gruesome Trump. In an election that could be close, these are the things that can make a real difference.\n\nTrump is now running unopposed, but still netted only 78 percent of the vote in the battleground state of Arizona in Tuesday's presidential primary. He got just 79 percent of the vote in Ohio, and 75 percent in Kansas.\n\nThere are a helluva lot of Republican voters who'd rather he just finally went away, and Pence is telling us he is one of them.\n\nLook, I disagree with Pence on almost everything on the political spectrum. His ugly, white 1950s take on America is gross and insulting to everybody who has fought for their rightful place to be stitched into America's colorful fabric.\n\nThe guy doesn't deserve a Profile in Courage Award, but he did think it was important enough to put his life on the line once again, this time by saying publicly that he doesn't think Trump, the guy he faithfully served for four years, should ever be our president again.\n\nIt's a big, damn deal, and I'm shocked more people don't see it that way.\n\nD.

Despite what the former president and his allies have said now for more than two and a half years and continue to insist to this very hour, the Georgia election was not stolen, and I had no right to overturn the election on January 6th.\"\n\nPOLL : Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\nMenendez then said, \"So you have some Georgia Republicans testifying; you got Mike Pence testifying. How does that then scramble Trump's claim that all this is a partisan witch hunt?\"\n\nMiller replied, \"It scrambles it quite a bit, and then the key state for 2024 - I'll defer to [former prosecutor] Barbara [McQuade]'s expertise on the legal ramifications of the Georgia trial that the former president would face. But it looks like he's going to be the nominee for the Republican Party. And it is fascinating to think that he would be running in a state, a key state that he would probably need to win if he were to win the presidency again, and have major officials, Republican elected officials within the state, and his own vice president, his own attorney general, testifying against him in the same state about his attempts to steal that election the last time. And to me, the thing that becomes the most fascinating in all this is, how can you, if you're Mike Pence or [ex-Attorney General] Bill Barr, testify truthfully to Fani Willis about Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the election - they both testified that to the January 6th committee, so we know what they're going to say in broad strokes - how can you do that and then go out and endorse Donald Trump's presidential campaign? It doesn't make sense. The two don't work together.\"\n\nHe continued, \"And I think that's a fascinating political question that will have real ramifications [...] for a key swing vote group, which is Atlanta suburban, former Republicans, that maybe voted for [Georgia Governor] Brian Kemp, but went for Joe Biden last time. And I think Pence and the others that are testifying have sway with that key swing group.\"\n\nWatch the video below or at this link .\n\nRepublican questions whether Mike Pence and Bill Barr will 'testify truthfully' in GA trial youtu.be"

      "text": "Why 'Mike Pence is a dead man walking in 2024': conservative\n\nSenior columnist for The Daily Beast and \"Reagan conservative,\" Matt Lewis, recently offered a case for why former Vice President Mike Pence is \"a dead man walking\" as he considers running for president in 2024.\n\nLewis breaks down the former vice president's journey as a once revered leader within the GOP who now finds himself grasping for support from former Republican allies and supporters.\n\nThe columnist writes :\n\nThis past week, we learned that, unlike Ron DeSantis, Pence doesn't think we should use the coercive power of the government to punish private businesses like Disney. We also learned that, contrary to Donald Trump , Pence thinks reining in our long-term debt crisis will require us to put entitlement reform on the table . And lastly, we learned that, unlike Fox News' primetime anchors, Pence thinks it's vital that America support Ukraine against Russia's invasion.\n\nDuring a recent Fox News interview with Sean Hannity, Pence said, \"I think it's important that we hold the line here, support the Ukrainians as they make the fight just like [the] Reagan doctrine said.\"\n\nLewis argues with a \"courageous\" stance such as this, the possible presidential hopeful \"has no shot at winning the GOP nomination,\" considering \"how far the GOP has diverged from its traditional path.\"\n\nHe notes :\n\nIt's easy to highlight how unstable the GOP has become in the last decade. But the most obvious changes involve tone, attitude, temperament, and sanity . Policy preferences have largely taken a back seat to nihilism, showmanship, and culture war battles that don't easily track with our recent past experience. Pence is reminding us that the shift isn't just in style.\n\nRegarding recent criticism of the former vice president's political decisions, in a recent New York Times op-ed , retired conservative Judge J. Michael Luttig expressed his disapproval of Pence's decision to resist a subpoena from Department of Justice (DOJ) Counsel Jack Smith, threatening to take his fight to The Supreme Court.\n\nLuttig wrote, \"The former vice president should not want the embarrassing spectacle of the Supreme Court compelling him to appear before a grand jury in Washington just when he's starting his campaign for the presidency.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast's full report is available at this link (subscription required). Luttig's full op-ed is here ."

(AP Photo/Johnson Lai)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - His group spent nearly $1 million on ads opposing Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Donald Trump's pick to lead the nation's health agencies. He's delivering speeches urging the president to stand with longstanding foreign allies and lobbying members of Congress while aides write letters and opinion columns.\n\nThis weekend, he posted an article he penned more than a decade ago on the limits of presidential power after Trump claimed that, \"He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.\"\n\nMike Pence is emerging as one of the last Republicans in Washington willing to publicly criticize the new administration.\n\nIt's an especially jarring role for the former vice president, whose refusal to break with Trump defined their time together in office until the two had a falling out over Trump's refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election and his efforts to remain in power .\n\nPence and those who work with him at Advancing American Freedom, his political advocacy group, stress they are not looking to take on the \"Never Trump\" mantle. They intend to praise the administration when they agree with it, while raising concerns when they don't, advocating for longtime conservative principles that have fallen out of favor as Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" brand of populism has taken hold.\n\n\"We're calling balls and strikes here,\" Pence told The Associated Press.\n\nPence opposed Kennedy - who has since been confirmed as secretary of health and human services - due to Kennedy's past comments voicing support for abortion rights. His group is now lobbying against Lori Chavez-DeRemer , Trump's pick for labor secretary, accusing her of being pro-union , and plans to spend the coming months pushing to increase military spending, shrink the deficit, and make permanent 2017 tax cuts, as well as trying to convince Trump to stop slapping tariffs on allies.\n\nThe AP recently sat down with Pence to discuss his efforts and his relationship with Trump - including a closely watched handshake at the funeral of President Jimmy Carter and his wife's lack of reaction as the 45th and 47th president took his seat.\n\nHere is a transcript of that conversation, which has been lightly edited for space and clarity:\n\nPence: \"To be an anchor to windward ... I came across that line I think in a Herman Melville book a long time ago.\"\n\n\"The wind blows in the direction of more government. And I think it's a role of conservatives to anchor the party so that when the wind blows, you put the anchor to windward so you stay grounded and hopefully do some small part to hold, you know, hold the ship of state on the principles that really minted my career in this movement.\"\n\n\"A strong defense, to American leadership of the free world, limited government, fiscal responsibility, growth, the right to life, traditional values - those were the values that drew me to the Republican Party. And I still think that they are the timeless ideals of the party of Lincoln. And so I want to do my part, even as a former elected official, to use whatever remains of my bully pulpit to be a champion for those principles.\"\n\nPence: \"Well, for me, it's always principles first. It's not personal. I went to the inauguration last month and I was very moved in the outpouring of kind words and expressions of appreciation from former colleagues, including many members of the new administration who I encountered in hallways. And I saw Secretary of State (Marco) Rubio. I gave him a hug, told him how proud I was of him. We had praised him from here when he was selected. I must have seen about or interacted with about half the incoming Cabinet.\"\n\n\"We went to the Carter funeral. And the president and I had a very cordial exchange. You know, he was coming down the row in front of us at the National Cathedral and he said, 'Hi, Mike.' And I was standing up, extended my hand, and I said, 'Congratulations, Mr. President.' And I could see his countenance softened. And he said, 'Thanks.' And Melania reached out and I said, 'Congratulations, Melania.' And it was, you know, the people that know me know it's not personal. I've long since forgiven the president for any differences that we had at the end of our administration. We still have those differences as the president still holds the view that, to my knowledge, that I had some authority that I did not have under the Constitution or laws of the country. But from my heart, I've prayed often for the president.\"\n\n\"And so, to answer your question, I think that the way we want to approach this is with integrity to principle. And I'm very encouraged. I think the Trump administration is off to a great start ... I'm very pleased about the president undoing Biden's border policies and putting back into place the policies that we had negotiated and established that secured the border. But you know, with regard to the nomination of RFK ... for me, it would begin and end with the right to life ... I saw the nomination of an abortion rights supporter to be secretary of HHS to be a dramatic departure from 50 years of strong pro-life leadership at HHS under Republican administrations. So we thought it was important to speak out. And we got a lot of quiet encouragement about that.\"\n\n\"Well, we got a lot of quiet encouragement from people that, for whatever reason, didn't feel compelled to join us in that chorus. But I thought it was an important point for us to make. And, you know, we'll continue to be a champion.\"\n\nPence: \"I never speculate on motives. You know, I'm not new to town. I've waged lonely battles before.\"\n\n\"But you know, you have to be willing to step out and lead. And my hope is that even in the wake of this fight that, you know, the Senate has worked its will, the president will get his choice at HHS. My hope is that when the next issue of life comes up, that people will have been encouraged, emboldened to know that they're not alone.\"\n\nPence: \"Well now you hit it. Now you're on it. I don't think - look, I think some of the prominent voices in the party have embraced a more populist thinking. I don't believe the overwhelming majority of people that ever vote Republican think any differently than they thought during our administration when we hewed to a conservative agenda or the years before or since.\"\n\n\"Let me give you one anecdote. So I'm at a town hall meeting when I'm running for president. And at the end of the town hall meeting - it was well-attended, it was in Iowa - a farmer walked up to me and he said, 'It was a great town hall meeting. I agree with everything you say.' You know, and I argued for - this was literally in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack. And I argued for strong American support for Israel, strong American leadership in the world, continued support for Ukraine in their fight and limited government and bringing about reforms to put our fiscal house in order and right to life.\n\nAnd this farmer says to me, he said, 'I agree with absolutely everything you said.' So I said, 'Well, can I count on your vote?' And he said, 'No, I got to be for Trump this time.' And he goes, 'But I'll see you in four years. You're going to be a great president someday.' I said, 'Would you mind telling me, you know, why?' And he said words I never forgot, which was in effect: He lamented Biden's failed record. And I saw that he was drawn to the need for a rematch. And then he said, 'Plus, if they can do that to a former president, they can do that to me.' And the 'lawfare' stuff went into higher relief.\n\n\"So I didn't see in this last election a Republican Party that was embracing big government or a vision to pull back from America's commitments on the world stage or marginalizing the right to life. I didn't see that traveling all over the country and I still don't see it. I think there were other factors that gave the former president a decided advantage in the election. He'd earned it. He'd won it. And then he won it in the fall. But I don't think the party's changed.\"\n\n(At the funeral, former second lady Karen Pence refused to acknowledge the then-president elect or shake Melania Trump's hands - footage that ended up going viral online.)\n\nPence: \"My wife loves her husband. And I love my wife and I have great respect for her. And so - but I've been really moved at how many people around the country have thanked us both for that day.\n\n\"But again, you know, I want to emphasize, we're eyes forward here. You know, I'd always thought the president was going to come around on the position he took on Jan. 6. If you read the end of my book, which I'd be flattered if you did, you'll read we actually parted on very amicable terms, very good terms. But in the spring, when he returned to the rhetoric about how I could have done something that neither the Constitution nor the law would ever permit any vice president to do, then I just decided it was important to go our separate ways. But hope springs eternal. And we want to be a constructive force for the conservative agenda. I think that's good for the administration. It's good for the Congress. More importantly, it's good for America.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Former Vice President Mike Pence says he will not be backing Donald Trump in the 2024 election.\n\n\"It should come as no surprise that I will not be endorsing Donald Trump this year,\" Pence said in an interview with Fox News Channel Friday , weighing in for the first time since the former president became the presumptive GOP nominee. Pence ran against Trump for their party's nomination but dropped his bid before voting began last year.\n\nThe decision makes Pence the latest in a series of senior Trump administration officials who have declined to endorse their former boss's bid to return to the Oval Office. While Republican members of Congress and other GOP officials have largely rallied behind Trump , a vocal minority has continued to oppose his bid.\n\nIt also marks the end of a metamorphosis for Pence, who had long been seen as one of Trump's most loyal defenders but broke with his two-time running mate by refusing to go along with Trump's unconstitutional scheme to try to remain in power after losing the 2020 election. When Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, trying to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden's win, Pence was forced to flee to a Senate loading dock as rioters chanted, \"Hang Mike Pence!\" outside.\n\nIn order to participate in the Republican primary debates, Pence was required to sign a pledge saying that he would support the party's eventual nominee. And during the first debate in Milwaukee, Pence was among the candidates who raised their hands when asked whether they would support Trump even if he were convicted in one of his four criminal indictments.\n\nBut Pence had made clear he had come to harbor serious reservations about Trump's actions and his policy stances.\n\n\"I believe anyone that puts themselves over the Constitution should never be president of the United States and anyone who asks someone else to put them over the Constitution should never be president of the United States again,\" he said during his campaign launch speech .\n\nAs the campaign progressed, he raised alarms about the party's resistance to sending aid to Ukraine and called on his fellow Republicans to reject what he called the \"siren song of populism\" espoused by Trump and his followers.\n\nIn the interview on Fox's \"The Story with Martha MacCallum,\" Pence said he was \"incredibly proud\" of his and Trump's record in office, but said, \"During my presidential campaign I made it clear that there were profound differences between me and President Trump on a range of issues, and not just our difference on my Constitutional duties that I exercised on January the 6th.\"\n\n\"I mean, as I have watched his candidacy unfold, I've seen him walking away from our commitment to confronting the national debt. I've seen him starting to shy away from a commitment to the sanctity of human life,\" he went on, also referencing what he called Trump's \"reversal on getting tough on China and supporting our administration's effort to force\" the sale of the popular TikTok app.\n\n\"In each of these cases, Donald Trump is pursuing and articulating an agenda that is at odds with the conservative agenda that we governed on during our four years. And that's why I cannot in conscience endorse Donald Trump in this campaign,\" he said.\n\nPence declined to say whom he would be voting for - \"I'm going to keep my vote to myself,\" he said - but made clear it wouldn't be Biden.\n\n\"I would never vote for Joe Biden,\" he said. \"I'm a Republican.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Pence refused, saying he lacked such authority.\n\nWhen a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, some chanted that they wanted to \"hang Mike Pence.\" Pence was whisked away by Secret Service agents, narrowly avoiding a confrontation with the rioters.\n\n\"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify,\" Trump wrote at the time on X, formerly Twitter, as rioters moved through the Capitol and Pence was in hiding with his family, aides and security detail inside the building.\n\nPence rejected the Secret Service's advice that he leave the Capitol, staying to continue the ceremonial election certification of Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election victory once rioters were cleared.\n\nTwo years ago, Pence said Trump's \"reckless words endangered my family.\"\n\nThe Profile in Courage Award, named for a book Kennedy published in 1957, before he became president, honors public officials who take principled stands despite the potential political or personal consequences.\n\n\"His decision is an example of President Kennedy's belief that an act of political courage can change the course of history,\" Caroline Kennedy and Jack Schlossberg, JFK's daughter and grandson, said in a statement.\n\nPence said in a statement that he's \"deeply humbled and honored\" to get the award.\n\n\"I have been inspired by the life and words of President John F. Kennedy since my youth and am honored to join the company of so many distinguished Americans who have received this recognition in the past,\" Pence said.\n\nThe award will be presented on May 4 at the JFK library in Boston.\n\n___\n\nThis story and headline have been updated to correct that the award is given by the JFK Library Foundation, not the JFK Library.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The Republican Jewish Coalition's annual gathering of donors in Las Vegas that is being held this weekend has for years been a key stop for GOP candidates as they seek not only to court Jewish voters but also to present themselves as stalwart allies of Israel, a key priority for many in the party's base, particularly evangelicals. (AP Photo/John Locher, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Former Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday dropped his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, ending his campaign for the White House after struggling to raise money and gain traction in the polls.\n\n\"It's become clear to me: This is not my time,\" Pence said at the Republican Jewish Coalition's annual gathering in Las Vegas. \"So after much prayer and deliberation, I have decided to suspend my campaign for president effective today.\"\n\n\"We always knew this would be an uphill battle, but I have no regrets,\" Pence went on to tell the friendly audience, which reacted with audible surprise to the announcement and gave him multiple standing ovations.\n\nPence is the first major candidate to leave a race that has been dominated by his former boss-turned-rival, Donald Trump, and his struggles underscore just how much Trump has transformed the party. A former vice president would typically be seen as a formidable challenger in any primary, but Pence has struggled to find a base of support.\n\nHe chose the Las Vegas event to announce his decision, in part, so he could continue to voice his support for Israel and to make his case one last time as a candidate that the isolationist and populist tides that have swept the Republican Party pose a danger to its future and embolden the nation's enemies, according to two people close to Pence who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss his thinking.\n\nPence's decision, more than two months before the Iowa caucuses that he had staked his campaign on, saves him from accumulating additional debt, as well as the embarrassment of potentially failing to qualify for the third Republican primary debate, on Nov. 8 in Miami.\n\nBut his withdrawal is a huge blow for a politician who spent years biding his time as Trump's most loyal lieutenant, only to be scapegoated during their final days in office when Trump became convinced that Pence somehow had the power to overturn the results of the 2020 election and keep both men in office - which he did not.\n\nWhile Pence averted a constitutional crisis by rejecting the scheme, he drew Trump's fury, as well as the wrath of many of Trump's supporters, who still believed his lies about the election and see Pence as a traitor.\n\nAmong Trump critics, meanwhile, Pence was seen as an enabler who defended the former president at every turn and refused to criticize even Trump's most indefensible actions.\n\nAs a result, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research from August found that the majority of U.S. adults, 57%, viewed Pence negatively, with only 28% having a positive view.\n\nThroughout his campaign, the former Indiana governor and congressman had insisted that while he was well-known by voters, he was not \"known well\" and set out to change that with an aggressive schedule that included numerous stops at diners and Pizza Ranch restaurants.\n\nPence had been betting on Iowa, a state with a large white Evangelical population that has a long history of elevating religious and socially conservative candidates such as former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Rick Santorum. Pence often campaigned with his wife, Karen, a Christian school teacher, and emphasized his hard-line views on issues such as abortion, which he opposes even in cases when a pregnancy is unviable . He repeatedly called on his fellow candidates to support a minimum 15-week national ban and he pushed to ban drugs used as alternatives to surgical procedures.\n\nHe tried to confront head-on his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, explaining to voters over and over that he had done his constitutional duty that day, knowing full well the political consequences. It was a strategy his campaign and outside supporters believed would help defuse the issue and earn Pence the respect of a majority of Republicans, whom they were were convinced did not agree with Trump's actions.\n\nBut even in Iowa, Pence struggled to gain traction.\n\nHe had an equally uphill climb raising money, despite yearslong relationships with donors. Pence ended September with just $1.18 million in the bank and $621,000 in debt, according to his most recent campaign filing. That debt had grown in the weeks since and adding to it could have taken Pence, who is not independently wealthy, years to pay off.\n\nThe Associated Press first reported earlier this month that people close to Pence had begun to feel that remaining a candidate risked diminishing his long-term standing in the party, given Trump's dominating lead in the race for the 2024 nomination. While they said Pence could stick it out until the Jan. 15 Iowa caucuses if he wanted - campaigning on a shoestring budget and accumulating debt - he would have to consider how that might affect his ability to remain a leading voice in the conservative movement, as he hopes.\n\nSome said that Hamas' attack on Israel in October, which pushed foreign policy to the forefront of the campaign, had provided Pence a renewed sense of purpose given his warnings throughout the campaign against the growing tide of isolationism in the Republican Party. Pence had argued that he was the race's most experienced candidate and decried \"voices of appeasement\" among Republican, arguing they had emboldened groups such as Hamas.\n\nBut ultimately, Pence concluded that he could still speak out on the issue without continuing the campaign.\n\nStill, his announcement came as a surprise even to Matt Brooks, the CEO of the Republican Jewish Coalition, who said he spent about 10-15 minutes backstage with Pence before the former vice president's speech and had gotten no indication from Pence that he intended to end his candidacy.\n\n\"Look, he picked an incredibly appropriate audience to do this,\" Brooks said. \"I think you saw the love for him in that room. And it was obviously a difficult decision for him and his family. But he was in the right place at the right time to share it with us all.\"\n\nIt was unclear which, if any, candidates would benefit from Pence's departure, given his limited support. But those hoping to see the party move on from the former president welcomed the news as a step toward consolidating around a single Trump alternative.\n\nPence did not endorse any of his rivals Saturday, but continued to echo language he has used to criticize Trump.\n\n\"I urge all my fellow Republicans here, give our country a Republican standard-bearer that will, as Lincoln said, appeal to the better angels of our nature,\" he said, \"and not only lead us to victory, but lead our nation with civility back to the time-honored principles that have always made America strong and prosperous and free.\"\n\nTrump, who spoke shortly after Pence at the RJC event, did not acknowledge his former vice president's announcement on stage, but said Saturday night at a separate event in Las Vegas that he believed Pence owed him his support.\n\n\"He should endorse me. I chose him, made him vice president. But people in politics can be very disloyal,\" he said.\n\nPence is expected to remain engaged in politics, in part through Advancing American Freedom, the conservative think tank he founded after leaving the vice presidency and that he envisions it as an alternative to The Heritage Foundation. He also has a book coming out next month.\n\n___ Associated Press writer Michelle L. Price in Las Vegas contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Darron Cummings)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Mike Pence fought the Department of Justice in court to try to avoid testifying against his former boss. But the former vice president plays a central role in a new federal indictment unsealed Tuesday that outlines the first criminal charges against Donald Trump connected to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe 45-page indictment is informed, in part, by contemporaneous notes that Pence kept of their conversations in the days leading up to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, as Trump tried to pressure Pence to go along with his desperate - and prosecutors say illegal - scheme to keep the two men in power.\n\nAmong the discussions: an episode in which Trump is alleged to have told Pence that he was \"too honest\" for rejecting Trump's false claims that Pence had the power to overturn the vote. \"Bottom line - won every state by 100,000s of votes,\" Trump said in another conversation, according to the indictment.\n\nPence, who is among a crowded field of Republicans now challenging Trump for the 2024 presidential nomination, has spent much of his nascent campaign defending his decision to defy Trump. He launched his bid with a firm denunciation of his two-time running mate, saying Trump had \"demanded I choose between him and our Constitution. Now voters will be faced with the same choice.\"\n\nStill, Pence said last month that he did not believe Trump had broken the law in connection with Jan. 6 and has repeatedly questioned the Department of Justice's motivations for investigating him.\n\nOn Tuesday night, he hit anew on his belief that Trump was unfit to serve again.\n\n\"Today's indictment serves as an important reminder: Anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be President of the United States,\" he said in a statement. \"Our country is more important than one man. Our Constitution is more important than any one man's career.\"\n\nAt a campaign stop Wednesday at the Indiana State Fair, Pence, who previously served as the state's governor, said he had \"hoped it wouldn't come to this,\" but believed that he had \"done his duty\" that day.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has been indicted by the Department of Justice in connection with a long running investigation into efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the days before the January 6, 2021 riot at the US Capitol. (Aug. 1)\n\n\"Sadly the president was surrounded by a group of crackpot lawyers that kept telling him what his itching ears wanted to hear,\" he said. \"The president ultimately continued to demand that I choose him over the Constitution.\"\n\nDespite his once-prominent position as Trump's No. 2, Pence has struggled to gain traction in his presidential campaign. Many of the former president's most loyal supporters still blame him for Trump's loss, believing Trump's false claims that he could have used his ceremonial role overseeing the counting of the Electoral College votes on Jan. 6 to prevent Democrat Joe Biden from becoming president.\n\nTrump critics, on the other hand, fault Pence as being complicit in Trump's most controversial actions and standing by his side for so many years. Until the insurrection, Pence had been an extraordinarily loyal defender of his former boss.\n\nWith just three weeks until the first 2024 GOP presidential debate , it's unclear if Pence will even qualify to make the stage. He has yet to meet the donor minimum set by the Republican National Committee, but told donors during a call Wednesday that he expects to hit that mark in the next seven to 10 days.\n\n\"We feel really encouraged about the progress that we're making. ... We're not there yet, though,\" he said, before encouraging his supporters to ask friends and family members to chip in. Campaign manager Steve DeMaura said that, as of Wednesday morning, Pence had over 30,000 donors and was adding an average of more than 1,000 new names a day.\n\nIn Washington, Pence had refused to testify before the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack, dismissing the probe as politicized. And he fought a subpoena demanding he testify before a grand jury , arguing that, because he was serving on Jan. 6 as president of the Senate, he was protected under the Constitution's \"speech or debate\" clause from being forced to testify. That provision is intended to protect members of Congress from questioning about official legislative acts.\n\nPence eventually complied when a judge refused to block his appearance , but said he wouldn't be forced to answer questions related to his role as Senate president.\n\nTrump's lawyers had objected, too, citing executive privilege concerns.\n\nTrump's new indictment outlines his and his allies' frantic efforts to remain in power. After first trying to persuade state lawmakers to reject certifying Biden's win, it says, they focused on Jan. 6 and \"sought to enlist the Vice President to use his ceremonial role at the certification to fraudulently alter the election results.\"\n\nThey tried to persuade him to accept slates of fake electors or to reject states' electoral votes and send them back to state legislatures for further review, the indictment says.\n\nThat effort included a series of phone calls in late December and early January, including on Christmas Day.\n\n\"You know I don't think I have the authority to change the outcome,\" Pence said during one call with Trump, the indictment says.\n\nIn another, on New Year's Day, Trump berated Pence, telling him, \"You're too honest\" - an episode also recounted in Pence's book \"So Help Me God.\"\n\nSome Trump claims were viewed as dangerous. During a private meeting on Jan. 5, he \"grew frustrated\" at Pence and told the then-vice president that he would have to publicly criticize him. Concerned for Pence's safety, his chief of staff, Marc Short, alerted the head of Pence's Secret Service detail.\n\nThe indictment also outlines how Trump worked to falsely convince his supporters that Pence had the power to overturn the results.\n\nImmediately after their final conversation before the riot, on the morning of Jan. 6, the indictment alleges that Trump revised the speech he was set to give at the Ellipse, \"reinserting language that he had personally drafted earlier that morning - falsely claiming that the Vice President had authority to send electoral votes to the states - but that advisors had previously successfully advocated be removed.\"\n\nTrump, in his speech, repeated his false claims of election fraud and again gave false hope to his supporters that Pence had the power to change the outcome.\n\nNot long after, hundreds of Trump's supporters were slamming through barricades, battling with police and breaking into the Capitol building - some chanting \"Hang Mike Pence\" as the former vice president and his family were rushed to safety.\n\nEven after the rioters were cleared from the Capitol and Congress reconvened to certify the results, Trump's allies were still pushing Pence, emailing his attorney to urge that he seek further delay by adjourning the session for 10 days.\n\nPence instead certified the election, finalizing his and Trump's defeat.\n\n___ Associated Press writer Rick Callahan contributed to this report from Indianapolis.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty)\n\nMANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) - Former Vice President Mike Pence cast the 2024 election as a fight for the future of conservatism and his party as he called on fellow Republicans to reject the \"siren song of populism\" championed by former President Donald Trump and his followers.\n\n\"Should the new populism of the right seize and guide our party, the Republican Party we've long known will cease to exist and the fate of American freedom would be in doubt,\" Pence said Wednesday afternoon in what his campaign plugged as a major speech at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College.\n\nPence's plea comes at a critical time for his campaign, which has been struggling to build momentum since its launch. Four months ahead of Iowa's kickoff caucuses, Trump remains the race's undisputed front-runner, while Pence still polls in single digits. Pence, who served four years as Trump's loyal second-in-command, has tried to paint himself as the most conservative candidate in a crowded Republican field. But he is championing policies that have fallen out of favor with many Republican voters who have embraced Trump's anti-establishment rhetoric, protectionist trade policies and isolationist worldview.\n\n\"If we are to defeat Joe Biden and turn America around, the Republican Party must be the party of limited government, free enterprise, fiscal responsibility and traditional moral values,\" Pence argued in his speech. He compared the right's ascendant populism - generally defined as a focus on ordinary people's complaints about big government and so-called elites - to the left's progressivism, calling them \"fellow travelers on the same road to ruin.\"\n\nPence, who broke with Trump before the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and refused to go along with his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, continued the more aggressive posture he has taken in recent weeks. He went after the former president repeatedly by name.\n\nHe quipped that the Republican Party \"did not begin on a golden escalator in 2015,\" a reference to Trump's campaign launch in New York, and argued that the former president has abandoned the conservative principles he ran on when Pence was his running mate in 2016.\n\n\"When Donald Trump ran for president in 2016, he promised to govern as a conservative. And together we did. But it's important for Republicans to know that he and his imitators on this Republican primary make no such promise today,\" Pence said. \"The truth is Donald Trump, along with his imitators, often sound like an echo of the progressives they seek to replace.\"\n\n\"The growing faction would substitute our faith in limited government and traditional values with an agenda stitched together by little else than personal grievances and performative outrage,\" he added.\n\nTrump, responding on his Truth Social site, accused Pence of going to the \"Dark Side\" after only speaking well of him for years.\n\n\"His advisers have led him down a very bad path!\" Trump said.\n\n\"The conservative movement and the Republican Party have changed for the better, and nobody wants it to go back to the way it was before,\" added Trump's adviser, Jason Miller.\n\nThe ideological shift is, in part, a reflection of changing demographics as the GOP has increasingly become a party of the working class, while Democrats have attracted college-educated voters. Right-wing populism has also been on the rise across Europe and around the globe in response to factors including globalization and mass migration.\n\nPence, in his speech, called for a course correction, accusing Trump and his followers of abandoning U.S. allies abroad with isolationist policies and ignoring the national debt.\n\nBeyond Trump, he criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is polling in second, for using \"the power of the state to punish a corporation for taking a political stand that he disagreed with\" in his ongoing feud with Disney , one of the largest employers in the state. And he attacked tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who has become a favored punching bag as he has risen in the polls, for his past statements on raising inheritance taxes.\n\nPence also accused Trump and his \"imitators\" of trying to \"blatantly erode our constitutional norms,\" referencing Trump's call last year for \"the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution\" over his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\n\"You know there's already a party that embraces appeasement abroad. There's already a party that would ignore our national debt,\" Pence said, adding that this is \"not conservatism. It's Republicanism that prioritizes power over principles.\"\n\nInstead, Pence repeatedly hailed the example of President Ronald Reagan, arguing the party must return to his model of limited government, strong national defense and traditional social values, including staunch opposition to abortion rights.\n\nRepublicans face a \"time for choosing,\" he said, referencing a famous Reagan speech. \"The future of this movement, of this great party, belongs to one or the other - not both. That's because the fundamental divide between these two factions is unbridgeable.\"\n\nThe speech comes ahead of the second GOP presidential debate, which will be held in California at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\nPence has hinged much of his campaign on doing well in Iowa, which will hold the Republicans' first nominating contest next January. But he has also spent significant time campaigning across New Hampshire and South Carolina, which also vote early. Saint Anselm College has long been a popular venue for candidates to deliver major speeches.\n\n___ Colvin reported from New York.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Pence will officially launch his widely expected campaign for the Republican nomination for president in Iowa on June 7. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Former Vice President Mike Pence filed paperwork on Monday declaring his campaign for president in 2024, setting up a challenge to his former boss, Donald Trump , just two years after their time in the White House ended with an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and Pence fleeing for his life.\n\nPence, the nation's 48th vice president, will formally launch his bid for the Republican nomination with a video and kickoff event in Des Moines, Iowa, on Wednesday, which is his 64th birthday, according to people familiar with his plans. He made his candidacy official Monday with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nWhile Trump is currently leading the early fight for the nomination, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis polling consistently in second, Pence supporters see a lane for a reliable conservative who espouses many of the previous administration's policies but without the constant tumult.\n\nWhile he frequently lauds the accomplishments of the \"Trump-Pence administration,\" a Pence nomination in many ways would be a return to positions long associated with the Republican establishment but abandoned as Trump reshaped the party in his image. Pence has warned against the growing populist tide in the party, and advisers see him as the only traditional, Reagan-style conservative in the race.\n\nA staunch opponent of abortion rights, Pence supports a national ban on the procedure and has campaigned against transgender-affirming policies in schools . He has argued that changes to Social Security and Medicare, like raising the age for qualification, should be on the table to keep the programs solvent - which both Trump and DeSantis have opposed - and criticized DeSantis for his escalating feud with Disney. He also has said the U.S. should offer more support to Ukraine against Russian aggression, while admonishing \"Putin apologists\" in the party unwilling to stand up to the Russian leader.\n\nPence, who describes himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order,\" has spent months laying the groundwork for an expected run, holding events in early voting states like Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire, visiting churches, delivering policy speeches and courting donors.\n\nPence's team sees Iowa and its evangelical Christian voters as critical to his potential path to victory. Advisers say he plans to campaign aggressively in the state, hitting every one of its 99 counties before its first-in-the-nation caucuses next year.\n\nThe campaign is expected to lean heavily on town halls and retail stops aimed at reintroducing Pence to voters who only know him from his time as Trump's second-in-command. Pence served for more than a decade in Congress and as Indiana's governor before he was tapped as Trump's running mate in 2016.\n\nAs vice president, Pence had been an exceeding loyal defender of Trump until the days leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump falsely tried to convince Pence and his supporters that Pence had the power to unilaterally overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nThat day, a mob of Trump's supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol building after being spurred on by Trump's lies that the 2020 election had been stolen. Many in the crowd chanted \"Hang Mike Pence!\" as Pence, his staff and his family ran for safety, hiding in a Senate loading dock.\n\nPence has called Trump's actions dangerous and said the country is looking for a new brand of leadership in the 2024 election.\n\n\"I think we'll have better choices,\" he recently told The Associated Press. \"The American people want us to return to the policies of the Trump-Pence administration, but I think they want to see leadership that reflects more of the character of the American people.\"\n\nPence has spent the 2 1/2 years since then strategically distancing himself from Trump. But he faces skepticism from both anti-Trump voters who see him as too close to the former president, as well as Trump loyalists, many of whom still blame him for failing to heed Trump's demands to overturn the pair's election defeat, even though Pence's role overseeing the counting of the Electoral College vote was purely ceremonial and he never had the power to impact the results.\n\nPence joins a crowded Republican field that includes Trump, DeSantis, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, U.S. Sen Tim Scott of South Carolina, tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie plans to launch his own campaign Tuesday evening in New Hampshire, and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum will announce his bid Wednesday in Fargo.\n\nWith Trump, a thrice-married reality star, facing skepticism among some Republicans during his 2016 run, his pick of Pence as a running mate assuaged concerns from evangelical Christians and others that he wasn't sufficiently conservative. As vice president, Pence refused to ever criticize the former president publicly and often played the role of emissary, trying to translate Trump's unorthodox rhetoric and policy proclamations, particularly on the world stage.\n\nAfter Trump's legal efforts to stave off defeat of the 2020 election were quashed by courts and state officials, he and his team zeroed in on Jan. 6, the date that a joint session of Congress would meet to formally certify President Joe Biden's victory. In the weeks leading up to the session, Trump engaged in an unprecedented pressure campaign to convince Pence he had the power to throw out the electoral votes from battleground states won by Biden, even though he did not.\n\nAs the riot was underway and after Pence and his family were rushed off the Senate floor and into hiding, Trump tweeted, \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done.\" Video footage of the attack shows rioters reading Trump's words aloud and crowds breaking into chants that Pence should be hanged. A makeshift gallows was photographed outside the Capitol.\n\nPence has said that Trump \" endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day\" and that history will hold him accountable.\n\nDespite his harrowing experience, Pence opposed efforts to testify in investigations into Trump's actions on and in the lead-up to Jan. 6. He refused to appear before the House committee investigating the attack and fought a subpoena issued by the special counsel overseeing numerous Trump investigations, though he did eventually testify before a grand jury.\n\nOnly six former U.S. vice presidents have been elected to the White House, including Biden, who is running for a second term.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - As Donald Trump was being arraigned in Washington on yet another round of criminal charges, his running mate-turned-rival Mike Pence hurried to capitalize on the news.\n\nPence's campaign unveiled new T-shirts and baseball caps for sale featuring the phrase \"Too Honest\" in big red letters - a reference to an episode in the indictment in which the former president called Pence to berate him over his refusal to go along with Trump's scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\n\"You're too honest,\" Trump allegedly scoffed at his second-in-command on New Year's Day.\n\nPence's decision to seize on the words marks a notable change in tone for a usually cautious candidate who has struggled to break through in a primary dominated by his former boss. Since the release of the indictment in which he plays a central role , Pence has criticized Trump more aggressively, casting himself as the person who stood up to Trump, averting catastrophe.\n\n\"The American people deserve to know that President Trump and his advisers didn't just ask me to pause. They asked me to reject votes, return votes, essentially to overturn the election,\" Pence told Fox News Wednesday. Had he listened to Trump and \"his gaggle of crackpot lawyers,\" Pence said, \"literally chaos would have ensued.\"\n\nPence's response might seem like the expected reaction of a man who had to flee for his life on Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob of Trump's supporters violently stormed the Capitol building, clashing with police and disrupting the joint session of Congress over which Pence was presiding. Trump had convinced legions of his followers that Pence had the unilateral power to undo the election, and Pence, his staff and family spent hours in hiding in a Senate loading dock as rioters chanted, \"Hang Mike Pence!\" outside.\n\nBut Pence's new words stand out, in part because of just how staunchly he refused to publicly criticize Trump during his four years as vice president, dutifully and deferentially defending his boss, no matter what. His newly tough talk also contrasts with Trump's other rivals, who have largely shied away from attacking the former president over his mounting legal troubles and efforts to remain in power.\n\nFILE - Vice President Mike Pence speaks alongside President Donald Trump during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House in Washington on March 22, 2020. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)\n\n\"I think this is the 'Enough is enough' Mike Pence. This is the 'Let's do this thing,' 'Let's get it done' Mike Pence,\" said his spokesman, Devin O'Malley.\n\nPence notably had refused to appear before the congressional committee that investigated Jan. 6, criticizing its work as politicized. And he fought a subpoena to appear before the grand jury that heard the election case.\n\nBut Pence had never shied away from defending his own actions on Jan. 6.\n\nHis advisers had long acknowledged that many of the former president's followers continue to believe Trump's lies and blame Pence for failing to keep Trump in power. But they believed that if he addressed the issue head-on and spent time explaining his position to voters, they would come to respect his decision and adherence to the Constitution.\n\nIn his campaign launch speech , Pence put his actions at the forefront and directly assailed Trump, saying, \"Anyone that puts themselves over the Constitution should never be president of the United States\" and \"Anyone who asks someone else to put them over the Constitution should never be president of the United States again.\" The press Wi-Fi password at the event underscored that message: \"KeptHisOath!\"\n\nWhen a supportive super PAC first launched , allies said Jan. 6 would be a fundamental part of their messaging. The group's first ad featured footage from the riot and contrasted the two men's actions that day.\n\nSince then, however, Pence has spent most of his energy casting himself as the most conservative candidate in the field on economic and social issues, particularly abortion , instead of going after Trump.\n\nHe did not issue statements in response to Trump's first two indictments. When he did react, he focused heavily on charges of a two-tiered system of justice and allegations that the Justice Department had been \"weaponized\" by the Biden administration. Pence had spent four years as a loyal Trump defender and, even when pressed, seemed unwilling to drop his guard.\n\nBut during a senior campaign leadership call Monday, as Washington awaited news of the indictment, Pence and his team discussed the idea of releasing a statement this time given his central role in the day's events. Some on the call urged Pence to go further than he had before and to deliver a message in line with what he'd said as he launched his campaign and argued Trump was unfit to return to the White House. If we're running against him, one person urged, let's run against him.\n\nA draft of the statement was ready by Tuesday morning, before the indictment was unveiled.\n\n\"Today's indictment serves as an important reminder: Anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be President of the United States,\" it read. \"Our country is more important than one man. Our constitution is more important than any one man's career.\"\n\nThe next day, Pence continued to drive that message, telling reporters at the Indiana State Fair that \"Sadly the president was surrounded by a group of crackpot lawyers that kept telling him what his itching ears wanted to hear.\"\n\nOn Fox, he argued that \"all the other legal issues around the president,\" including a possible additional indictment in Georgia, were a distraction.\n\nPence's team blasted out clips of the interview via email - \"ICYMI: PENCE CHOSE THE CONSTITUTION OVER TRUMP AND ALWAYS WILL\" - and another in which Pence clashed with a conservative talk radio host who had characterized Pence's stance on Jan. 6 as merely his \"beliefs.\"\n\nThe attention sparked by the Trump indictment also brought a cash infusion. The Pence campaign received 7,000 new contributions in the first 24 hours, aides said. While 5,000 of those stemmed from the more than 1 million pieces of direct mail the campaign recently sent to voters, it nonetheless marked a sevenfold increase from the campaign's usual daily haul and will likely qualify Pence for the first GOP debate in the coming days.\n\nCommitted to America, the super PAC supporting Pence's candidacy, also increased its spending on digital ads amid heightened interest in Pence online.\n\n\"This is the first of many moments Pence will have between now and the Iowa caucus,\" said Scott Reed, the group's co-chair.\n\nThe attention caught Trump's notice as well.\n\n\"I feel badly for Mike Pence, who is attracting no crowds, enthusiasm, or loyalty from people who, as a member of the Trump Administration, should be loving him,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social network.\n\nSoon after, the Pence campaign decided to move forward with the new merchandising plan.\n\nWhile some outside allies had long believed that Trump would eventually face charges and that Pence would have to respond more forcefully, Marc Short, who was Pence's chief of staff on Jan. 6 and was referenced several times in the indictment, said Pence had grown increasingly tired of Trump's bad-mouthing.\n\n\"I just think there's the reality that for 2 1/2 years, the president has misrepresented the events of that day and grossly distorted what the vice president's authority was and knowingly presented that in false ways to the American people. And I think that there's an understandable frustration,\" he said.\n\nWhile Short believes most Republican voters would rather be talking about other issues and focusing on President Joe Biden, he said he always believed Pence's actions that day would serve as a point of strength.\n\n\"I think people respect him for upholding his oath under enormous pressure,\" he said.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

He has advocated pulling from the market a widely used abortion pill that has a better safety record than penicillin and Viagra. And he's implored his Republican rivals to back a 15-week federal ban as a minimum national standard, which several have not done.\n\nIn a recent interview, Pence went even further, saying abortion should be banned when a pregnancy isn't viable. Such a standard would force women to carry pregnancies to term even when doctors have determined there is no chance a baby will survive outside the womb.\n\n\"I'm pro-life. I don't apologize for it,\" Pence said in the interview. \"I just have heard so many stories over the years of courageous women and families who were told that their unborn child would not go to term or would not survive. And then they had a healthy pregnancy and a healthy delivery.\"\n\nDoctors disputed Pence's characterization, saying there are conditions that are always incompatible with life and others where the chance of survival is so slim that most patients, when previously given the choice, concluded that continuing the pregnancy wasn't worth the suffering, grief or risk.\n\nPence, however, says he's undeterred.\n\n\"I want to always err on the side of life,\" he said. \"I would hold that view in these matters because ... I honestly believe that we got this extraordinary opportunity in the country today to restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law.\"\n\nThose comments place Pence firmly to the right of the rest of the 2024 presidential field and alone among GOP candidates, who largely declined to take a stance on the issue. And they drew alarms from obstetricians and doctors who specialize in high-risk pregnancies and say nonviable pregnancies are far more common than people realize. They range from ectopic pregnancies, when an embryo implants somewhere other than the uterus, to deadly birth defects and other severe pregnancy complications.\n\nBanning abortions in these cases, doctors say, leads to outcomes that are both cruel and put women's lives and mental health at risk .\n\n\"One of the things that you cannot understate is the difficulty for a woman to carry a nonviable pregnancy,\" said Alan Peaceman, professor emeritus of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. \"It is psychological torture to go out in the world, for people to see your pregnancy - and people will come up to you and want to talk about your pregnancy. And that puts the woman in a terrible position that nobody should be in unless they chose to be in that position.\"\n\nOnce an issue largely hidden from public view, nonviable pregnancies have gained attention since the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to an abortion last year, ushering in a wave of bans and restrictions in Republican-led states . Those moves have implications not only for unwanted pregnancies but also for cases where women receive heartbreaking diagnoses , often when they're months along into pregnancies that were deeply desired.\n\nIn states like Texas , Florida and Louisiana , women have described the anguish of being denied abortions even when they know their babies will be stillborn or die shortly after birth. Some have had to wait until they developed life-threatening infections for intervention. Others have spent thousands of dollars to travel to states where the procedure is still allowed.\n\nSarah Prager, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Washington Medical Center, said she and her colleagues have seen a steady stream of patients coming from states where abortions are now banned. About 11% of those patients, she said, have received a serious diagnosis, including cases where there is no chance of the fetus surviving.\n\n\"They are often absolutely shocked to learn that the abortion laws also prohibit them from being able to get care to be safe,\" she said, \"even though they knew these laws were in place in this state.\"\n\nSpokespeople for former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declined to say whether they back Pence's position. Trump, the early front-runner, has repeatedly said he backs exceptions in cases of rape, incest and the life of the mother and has blamed hard-line abortion stances for costing the party in last year's midterm elections.\n\nDeSantis, who is polling a distant second, signed a six-week ban in Florida that includes an exception for fatal fetal abnormalities, along with rape, incest and to save the mother's life. He has declined to say whether he supports a federal ban.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott's campaign pointed to an article that did not address the question of unviable pregnancies. A spokesman for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said only that she \"will sign pro-life legislation that includes exceptions for rape, incest, and for the life of the mother,\" suggesting she, too, may be opposed to an exception for nonviable pregnancies - but declined to clarify.\n\nPence's push to end abortion puts him at odds with the majority of Americans who are broadly opposed to the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade reversal.\n\nWhile most favor at least some restrictions, a majority of U.S. adults say abortion should be legal during the first weeks of pregnancy, even in states with the strictest limits, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research .\n\nBut Pence, an evangelical Christian, for whom the issue is deeply personal, argues restricting abortion is \"more important than politics\" and calls it the \"cause of our time.\"\n\nAs he works to appeal to conservatives in states like Iowa, Pence also points to the issue as one that distinguishes him from his GOP rivals, contrasting himself with \"some people in this field now who want to relegate this issue to just a debate among the states.\"\n\nPence does say he has \"always supported\" exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, though he told an Indiana anti-abortion group in 2010 that he believed, \"Abortion should never be legal,\" and later that it should only be legal to save the \"life of the mother.\"\n\nThere are a number of fetal conditions in which doctors generally agree there is \"truly zero probability for a healthy outcome,\" including anencephaly, a severe neural tube defect in which the skull doesn't form and the brain is exposed, said David Hackney, a spokesperson for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and a high-risk obstetrician in the Cleveland area.\n\n\"The chances of survival are absolute zero ... no matter what Mike Pence says,\" he said. In such cases, he said, \"it feels absurd\" for people to be \"forced against their will to carry pregnancies to term.\"\n\nBut other cases are grayer. Take premature rupture of membranes, when the water breaks early, often in the second trimester, leaving a fetus without the amniotic fluid that protects it and supports the development of organs, including the lungs. In those cases, survival generally depends how early the rupture has occurred.\n\nHackney said with early membrane rupture, \"you do have rare survivors,\" but that \"exceedingly poor prognosis\" comes with a litany of risks, including hemorrhaging, blood loss and dangerous infection, which can cause permanent infertility, shock and sepsis as women wait to deliver or qualify for abortions under \"life of the mother\" exceptions.\n\nThat's what happened to Savita Halappanavar, the 31-year-old woman who died in Ireland in 2012 of sepsis after she was denied an abortion, prompting the country to overturn its longstanding ban .\n\nRachel Neal is a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health and an OB-GYN in Georgia, where abortion is outlawed after cardiac activity is detected, around six weeks. While the state provides an exception in cases in which the \"physician determines, in reasonable medical judgment, that the pregnancy is medically futile,\" she said water breaking in the late second trimester would typically not be covered.\n\nThat means women who previously had the choice to end their pregnancies early now either have to leave the the state or wait to deliver a baby that will likely die immediately or shortly after birth, while putting themselves at high risk of infection that could impact their ability to get pregnant again.\n\n\"It's completely uncharted territory,\" Neal said. \"Before all of this, almost nobody chose this. ... It was very uncommon that someone would choose to wait ... because realistically any outcome that would result in a live birth is so slim.\"\n\nNine states with abortion restrictions explicitly exempt cases of lethal fetal anomalies, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. Even in states with such exemptions, however, doctors say there can be confusion.\n\nSome states have developed lists for what qualifies as a fatal fetal condition, but doctors say they will never fully capture every potential diagnosis. And most states do not have such lists, leaving definitions up for interpretation.\n\n\"How lethal does it have to be?\" Peaceman asked. \"Does it have to die within the first few hours? Or the first 30 days?\"\n\nAt the same time, doctors in some states risk felony convictions that can carry five or 10 years of mandatory prison time if others dispute their interpretations of what some complain are overly broad and confusing rules.\n\nEric Scheidler, the executive director of the Pro-Life Action League, a nonprofit that advocates against abortion, accused \"politically motivated physicians\" of focusing on \"edge cases\" to \"maintain a broad abortion license\" and in some cases \"deliberately misunderstanding what the law says in order to create this narrative that we have to have complete abortion license or we'll have physicians caught in a quandary.\"\n\nNonetheless, he said he thinks candidates should focus on the majority of abortions and not these kinds of cases.\n\n\"I really want to see these candidates talk about where we have areas of broad consensus,\" he said. \"I would encourage political candidates to espouse positions that are widely held. ... I don't want to get hung up on these very rare cases.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

      "text": "Nobody Likes Mike Pence\n\nIn focus groups, Republican voters are brutal in their assessment of the former vice president.\n\nMike Pence is making little secret of his presidential ambitions. He's written his book ; he's assembling his team ; he's mastered the art of the coy nondenial when somebody asks (in between trips to Iowa) if he's running. In early Republican-primary polls, he hovers between 6 and 7 percent-not top-tier numbers, but respectable enough. He seems to think he has at least an outside shot at winning the Republican nomination.\n\nAnd yet, ask a Republican voter about the former vice president, and you're likely to hear some of the most withering commentary you've ever encountered about a politician.\n\nIn recent weeks, I was invited to sit in on a series of focus groups conducted over Zoom. Organized by the political consultant Sarah Longwell, the groups consisted of Republican voters who'd supported Donald Trump in both 2016 and 2020. The participants were all over the country-suburban Atlanta, rural Illinois, San Diego-and they varied in their current opinions of Trump. In some cases, Longwell filtered for voters who should be in Pence's target demographic. One group consisted entirely of two-time Trump voters who didn't want him to run again; another was made up of conservative evangelicals, who might presumably appreciate Pence's roots in the religious right.\n\nI've been covering Pence's strange Trump-era arc since 2017, when I first profiled him for The Atlantic . By some accounts, he's wanted to be president since his college-fraternity days. I've always been skeptical of his chances, but now that he finally seems ready to run, I wanted to understand the appeal of his prospective candidacy. My goal was to see if I could find at least one Pence supporter.\n\nFrom the January/February 2018 issue: God's plan for Mike Pence\n\nInstead, these were some of the quotes I jotted down.\n\n\"I don't care for him ... He's just middle-of-the-road to me. If there was someone halfway better, I wouldn't vote for him.\"\n\n\"He has alienated every Republican and Democrat ... It's over. It's retirement time.\"\n\n\"He's only gonna get the vote from his family, and I'm not even sure if they like him.\"\n\n\"He just needs to go away.\"\n\nIt went on and on like that across four different focus groups. Of the 34 Republicans who participated, I heard only four people say they'd consider Pence for president-and two of them immediately started talking themselves out of it after indicating interest.\n\nSome of the reasons for Pence's lack of support were intuitive. Hard-core Trump fans said they'd been alienated by Pence's refusal to block the certification of the 2020 electoral votes, as the president was demanding. This break with Trump famously prompted chants of \"Hang Mike Pence!\" to echo through the U.S. Capitol on January 6.\n\nAlthough the sentiment expressed in the focus groups wasn't quite so violent, the anger was still present. During one session, three people-all of whom had reported \"very favorable\" views of Trump-took turns trashing Pence for what they saw as his weakness.\n\n\"I'm so mad at Pence that I would never vote for him,\" said one man named Matt. \"He would be a horrible president ... I just don't think he has the leadership qualities to be president.\" (I agreed to identify the participants only by their first name.)\n\n\"That's exactly it,\" a woman named Christine said, nodding eagerly. \"He didn't have the leadership qualities to do what everyone wanted him to do on January 6. He just doesn't have that spine.\"\n\nA third participant, Nicholas, chimed in: \"He just chose to go along with all the other RINOs and Democrats, not to upset the applecart.\"\n\nMeanwhile, less MAGA-inclined Republicans thought Pence was too Trumpy.\n\n\"The only thing I liked about him was that he actually did stand up to Donald Trump,\" a woman named Barbara said. \"He's too a part of Trump. I don't think Trump has a chance, and I don't think anybody in that inner circle has a chance either.\"\n\n\"I think he put a stain on himself for any normal Republican when he joined the Trump administration,\" said another participant, Justin. \"And then he put a stain on himself with any Trump Republican on January 6. So I don't think he has a constituency anywhere. I don't know if anyone would vote for him.\"\n\nRead: Republicans' 2024 magical thinking\n\nLongwell told me this is how Pence is talked about in every focus group she holds. What to make of that 6 to 7 percent he gets in the primary polls? \"I imagine there's a cohort of GOP voters who are not particularly engaged who don't want Trump again, and Pence is the only other name they really know,\" she speculated. That, or \"they're all from Indiana,\" the state where Pence served as governor. A second Republican pollster, who requested anonymity to offer his candid view, told me, \"Seven percent is a weak showing for the immediate former VP.\"\n\nDevin O'Malley, an adviser to Pence, responded to a request for comment in an email: \"Mike Pence has spent the last two years traveling to more than 30 states, campaigning for dozens of candidates, and listening to potential voters. Those interactions have been incredibly positive and encouraging, and we place more value in those experiences than of a focus group conducted by disgruntled former Republicans like Sarah Longwell and paid for by some shadow organization that The Atlantic won't disclose.\" (Longwell told me the costs for the focus groups are split between The Bulwark and the Republican Accountability Project, two anti-Trump organizations with which she is affiliated.)\n\nWhat I found most fascinating about the voters' digs at Pence was that they were almost always preceded by passing praise of his personal character: He was a \"top-of-the-line guy,\" a \"nice man,\" a \"super kind, honest, decent\" person. Not only did these perceived qualities fail to make him an appealing candidate, but they were also often held against him-treated as evidence that he lacked a certain presidential mettle.\n\n\"I don't like how Trump was just in your face with everything, but Pence is almost too far in the other direction,\" one participant named Judith said.\n\nPerhaps these voters were identifying a simple lack of charisma. But their casual dismissal of Pence's wholesome, God-fearing, family-man persona is emblematic of a sea change in conservative politics-and a massive miscalculation by Pence himself.\n\nWhen Pence was added to the ticket in 2016, his chief function was to vouch for Trump with mainstream Republicans, especially conservative Christian voters. Pence's reputation as a devout evangelical gave him a certain moral credibility when he defended Trump amid scandal and outrage. He performed this task exceptionally well. Those adoring eyes, those fawning tributes, that slightly weird fixation on the breadth of his boss's shoulders-nobody was better at playing the loyalist. And for a certain kind of voter, Pence's loyalty provided assurance that Trump was worthy of continued support.\n\nPence had his own motives, as I reported in my profile. All of this vouching for Trump was supposed to buy Pence goodwill with the base and set him up for a future presidential run. For many in Pence's camp, the project took on a religious dimension. \"If you're Mike Pence, and you believe what he believes, you know God had a plan,\" Ralph Reed, an evangelical power broker, told me back then.\n\nBut in creating a permission structure for voters to excuse Trump's defective character and flouting of religious values, Pence was unwittingly making himself irrelevant. In effect, he spent four years convincing conservative Christian voters that the very thing he had to offer them didn't matter.\n\nIn 2011, a poll by the Public Religion Research Institute found that only 30 percent of white evangelicals believed \"an elected official who commits an immoral act in their personal life can still behave ethically and fulfill their duties in their public and professional life.\" By 2020, that number had risen to 68 percent.\n\nPeter Wehner: The moral desolation of the GOP\n\nPence won the argument. Now he's reaping the whirlwind.\n\nIn one of the focus groups, a devout Christian named Angie was asked how much she factored in moral rectitude when assessing a presidential candidate. \"I try to use my faith to choose someone by character, but it hasn't always been possible,\" she said. Sometimes she had to vote for a candidate who shared her politics but didn't live her values.\n\n\"Who comes to mind?\" the moderator asked.\n\n\"I think Trump falls into that category,\" Angie conceded. \"But quite honestly, the vast majority of others do as well.\" She paused. \"I would say Pence actually doesn't fall into that category. I would say his character probably aligns with biblical values fairly well.\"\n\nBut Angie remained uninterested in seeing Pence in the Oval Office. If he had a record to run on, she wasn't aware of it.\n\n\"Anything he did got overshadowed by all the drama of these last four years,\" she said, hastening to add, \"Seems like a perfectly nice man.\""

      "text": "Mike Pence Is Haunting This Election\n\nHe's a reminder of the moment when Trump broke free of all consequences.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here .\n\nYou can't blame Mike Pence for wanting to keep his head down in this presidential election, given that he nearly had his head in a noose after the last one.\n\n\"I'm staying out of this race,\" Pence said plaintively-more plaintively even than usual-in a rare interview with Lyndsay Keith on something called Merit Street Media (founded, apparently, by Dr. Phil). Pence sat stiffly, and his voice was hushed and dramatic, as it typically is. He was repeating what he has said before: that he could not support Donald Trump after everything the former president had done, and that he could never back Kamala Harris, either, because of what he holds sacred-namely \"the sanctity of life,\" which is the \"calling of our time.\"\n\n\"I've made it clear I won't be endorsing,\" he reiterated. \"How I vote, I will keep to myself.\"\n\nBut it's not so simple for Pence. He can try to opt out, but his ordeal inevitably makes him an inescapable figure in this cliff-hanger for American democracy.\n\nAt so many turns, his absence has spoken louder than his presence ever could. He is a reminder of Trump's abject indecency, the former president's pitiless trampling of norms and the consequence-free zone afforded him by the Republican Party and the Supreme Court.\n\nRead: How Jack Smith outsmarted the Supreme Court\n\n\"Well, it's a shame,\" Trump said in a recent interview, in an answer to a question about Pence. He conveyed not a speck of regret about Pence, only grievance, as he does. Trump started talking about January 6, 2021, that most fateful day of choosing for his most slavishly devoted of deputies. No one did complete submission to Trump like Pence did-right up until he chose fealty to the Constitution over the wishes of \"my president,\" as Pence used to refer to Trump (also: \"this extraordinary man,\" paragon of \"broad-shouldered leadership\"). \"He couldn't cross the line of doing what was right,\" Trump lamented. He also allowed that Pence was a \"good man.\" They'd had a \"very good relationship.\" In the end, though, Pence lacked the \"courage\" and \"stamina\" to do Trump's ultimate bidding-for which many thought he should pay the ultimate price.\n\n\"So what?\" Trump was saying in the Oval Office while rioters chanted \"hang Mike Pence\" at the Capitol. This latest detail was dropped into the delirium bowl by Special Counsel Jack Smith's recent court filing in the January 6 case. In a rational world, this would be a bombshell-another example of Trump's callous dereliction, his willingness to leave his deputy to a hanging mob of his own supporters.\n\nBut \"so what?\" pretty much summed up Americans' response to this latest October non-surprise .\n\n\"So what\" about Mike Pence? He can't help but remain-the specter of him, if not the man himself. \"When Mike Pence made that decision to certify that election, that's why Mike Pence isn't on this stage,\" Tim Walz said, taunting his counterpart, J. D. Vance, in their debate.\n\nDemocrats like to point out that even Trump's own vice president won't support him. Remarkable, right? It should be, yes-it should speak volumes about Trump. Except: So what? Republican voters keep speaking their own volumes about Trump and keep nominating him. They keep proving, if more proof was needed, that Trump is a special case.\n\nFrom the start, it was a bit of a mystery with Pence: how this most ostentatiously virtuous of Christians could affix himself to one of the most vulgar creatures ever to soil our public stage. Sure, ambition, opportunism, a mansion and a big plane-great. But how did Pence even get past, say, the Access Hollywood tape in 2016? His approach was essentially to swallow everything-all of the cruelty, crassness, and chaos from Trump-in the belief that this presidency would be a boon to the far-right policies that Pence had spent decades yearning for. He went along to get what he needed and to keep the peace with the boss, until he no longer could.\n\n\"Pence is always going to occupy this complex, almost unfathomable place,\" the presidential historian Ted Widmer of the City University of New York told me. A speechwriter in the Clinton White House, Widmer has written several books on American democracy, leaders, and campaigns. He says that by standing firm against Trump on January 6, Pence ensured himself a kind of historical purgatory. \"Nobody was as true blue of a Republican or loyal vice president as Pence was,\" Widmer said. \"Everything could have turned out so perfectly for him.\" His refusal to help Trump thwart the will of American voters \"might buy Pence whatever the historian's version of a mulligan is,\" Widmer told me. \"But it is also the same thing that was unforgivable in Trump's moral universe.\"\n\nPence rarely talks about the day that will always define him. If it comes up, he prefers to frame January 6 as \"a disagreement\" that he had with Trump over what authority a vice president had (or clearly did not have) to challenge the certification of Electoral College votes. In the end, he declared his allegiance to an even higher authority than Trump. \"I've always said that the safest place in the world is to be at the center of God's will,\" Pence said.\n\nHe likes to remind people that he and Trump spoke several times in the final, post-insurrection days of their administration. \"We parted amicably,\" he said in the Merit Street Media interview, adding that Trump \"told me in the Oval Office with many present that he thought I'd done a great job.\" Also, Pence said, Trump thanked him on the tarmac of Andrews Air Force Base. And they'd spoken often by phone in the days after he left office.\n\n\"But there was something in the early days of the spring of 2021 where he seemed to shift back,\" Pence told Keith. Pence said he then concluded that, \"like the Bible says, at some point, you've just got to wipe the dust off your feet and go your own separate ways.\"\n\nIn so much as Pence is willing to discuss his breakup with Trump, he tends to focus on how the former president has abandoned the conservative positions that they championed in office. This particularly relates to abortion, but extends to a broader betrayal: \"I've literally seen him walking away from strong American leadership on the world stage. I've seen him marginalize the right to life, and even parrot Democrats when it comes to the crisis facing our children and grandchildren in the national debt,\" Pence told Keith.\n\n\"When you now see Trump separating from Pence, it's not just [Trump] going back to being pro-abortion,\" Marc Short, Pence's former vice-presidential chief of staff, who remains one of Pence's closest advisers and confidants, told me. \"It's Trump moving away from the free-trader Mike Pence, who is also anti-tax and anti-tariff, and who would not abandon Ukraine.\"\n\nRead: The Christian radicals are coming\n\nAs for January 6, it has become something of a gateway drug. If Trump can be forgiven for that, what would his supporters not tolerate? Whether or not he ever gets convicted for it, Trump's ability to overcome that day politically has come to represent its own get-out-of-jail-free card. What's a little wobbliness on abortion?\n\n\"Once Republicans decide to condone Trump going the wrong way on the rule of law,\" Short said, it becomes possible to rationalize all manner of ideological trespass. \"I do think for a lot of people, once you've crossed that bridge, set aside your oath to the Constitution,\" Short told me-\"when you have violated what you know to be true-you figure that you might as well go all in.\"\n\nFriends of Pence say that many Republicans, including Trump supporters, will often express support for him. They tell him he is a good man, and they respect what he did, and that it's unfair how he's been treated. But these conversations almost always happen in private. They would never say as much in public-for fear, of course, of crossing Trump.\n\nWhere does that leave Pence, a Christian conservative in a GOP now governed by one man's impulses? In powerful circles of the party, Pence remains a pariah. \"Judas Pence is a dead man walking with MAGA,\" Steve Bannon told The New York Times in June. If Trump wins, maybe he softens and absolves his former vice president, who did nearly everything he asked. If nothing else, Pence will endure as the cautionary scoundrel of the Trump age: one who was loyal to the bitter end, and barely lived to tell about it."

      "text": "The Agony of Mike Pence\n\nWhy does he think the people who wanted to kill him will vote for him?\n\nH ere is a theory I cannot test, but which I believe to be true:\n\nIf Mike Pence were to walk through the crowd at a Donald Trump rally-for instance, the recent giant event where 50,000 Trump supporters swamped the town of Pickens, South Carolina-he would need a security detail. He would not be safe without one, and he might not be safe with one either. In fact, I have a hard time believing that any Secret Service team would agree to go along with such an excursion. Enough Trump supporters hate Pence that much .\n\nBy contrast, I believe Pence could safely walk through the crowd at a Joe Biden event-like his June 17 rally in Philadelphia -without any security. Some Biden supporters might make snide comments, but it seems equally possible that others might shake his hand and thank him for saving the republic on January 6, 2021.\n\nJonathan V. Last: Mike Pence is an American hero\n\nNot to belabor the obvious, but, for Pence, this is a problem. Because Pence is running for president as a Republican.\n\nYet for the country, this isn't just a problem; it's an almost biblical tragedy. Mike Pence is the man who told his tribe the truth. They turned on him for it. And now, having finally found the courage to leave, he's desperate for acceptance among them once again.\n\nF or more than a quarter century, Pence was a dutiful and committed conservative. He started in talk radio, where his brand was \"Rush Limbaugh on decaf.\" On his third try, he got himself elected to the House of Representatives, where he was happy to buck the Republican Party by opposing George W. Bush on two of his big legislative achievements-No Child Left Behind and Medicare expansion-both of which Pence believed violated his commitment to certain small-government conservative principles. But Republicans forgave these heresies. Pence ascended to the No. 3 position in House GOP leadership.\n\nFrom the House, Pence vaulted to the Indiana governor's mansion and then, finally, onto a presidential ticket as Trump's running mate. You know how that went: For four years, Pence defended everything Trump did and said. Behind the scenes, he tried to be the grown-up in the room. A fly camped out on his head on national TV. Yada yada yada, then came the coup.\n\nAt which point, Trump instructed several thousand of his supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol \"with strength\" and prevent Pence from performing his constitutional duty to count and certify electoral votes-which would officially make Biden the president-elect. So a bunch of very fine people who had recently voted to make Pence vice president walked down Constitution Avenue, erected a gallows, and stormed the Capitol. During the course of these events, many raised their voices to chant, \"Hang Mike Pence.\"\n\nF or his part, Pence is sanguine about this unpleasantness. Last month, when asked about Trump's latest threat-that it would be \"very dangerous\" for America if he were convicted of crimes-he waved away the possibility. \"Everyone in our movement are the kind of Americans who love this country, are patriotic or law-and-order people who would never have done anything like that there or anywhere else,\" Pence told CNN's Dana Bash.\n\nBash was brought up short. \"That's pretty remarkable that you're not concerned about it, given the fact that they wanted to hang you on January 6,\" she said.\n\nPence responded, \"The people in this movement, the people who rallied behind our cause in 2016 and 2020, are the most God-fearing, law-abiding, patriotic people in this country, and I ... won't stand for those kinds of generalizations, because they have no basis in fact.\"\n\nNever in American politics has a candidate so dutifully followed the instruction of Jesus: \"To one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also.\" So whatever you want to say about Mike Pence, I'll bet that if a bunch of MAGA Proud Boys demanded his tunic, he'd offer them his cloak too. God bless him.\n\nI n other ways, Pence reminds me of an Old Testament figure, one of the prophets who told the Israelites news they didn't want to hear-but stuck around anyway, reviled by the people he was trying to save.\n\nJanuary/February 2018 Issue: God's plan for Mike Pence\n\nA few weeks ago, Pence attended a town-hall event in Iowa sponsored by the Family Leader. It was an evangelical-forward gathering attended by the kind of midwestern conservative Christians who have been Pence's people since he was in short pants. Tucker Carlson, the event's moderator, tore into Pence both for his refusal to overturn the 2020 election and for his hawkish support of military aid to Ukraine. Pence stood up to Carlson and held to his conservative convictions.\n\nAnd so, given the choice between a TV presenter who has privately talked about how he hates Trump \"passionately\" and Trump's own vice president-a man who has dutifully served conservative causes in government for a generation and who stood by Trump for everything except overthrowing American democracy, the evangelicals ... cheered for Tucker and booed Pence.\n\nGive us Barabbas.\n\nT he rest of America doesn't quite know what to do with Pence. He's a complicated figure.\n\nOn the one hand, he tolerated and defended all of the depredations of the Trump years. By vouching for Trump with evangelical voters in 2016, he cemented Trump's takeover of the party. He stood by Trump after Charlottesville, Virginia. He was Trump's rock during the first impeachment. He tried to clean up the worst parts of Trump's mishandling of COVID while being at pains to praise Trump for doing a heroic job. He was a loyal running mate in 2020. He did all of this with his eyes wide open.\n\nOn the other hand, at the moment when Trump attempted to thwart the peaceful transition of power, Pence was the only man standing between the Constitution and collapse. After a full term of cowardice, he displayed courage in the moment it mattered most. If he hadn't followed the law on January 6, there is no telling what would have happened.\n\nSome people maintain that Pence does not deserve credit simply for not breaking the law . I sympathize. I did not rob a bank this morning-do I get a cookie? But ultimately, I find Pence's heroism in the performance of his duty too great to wave away. He faced physical and professional risk on January 6; his career, his life, and the lives of his family were imperiled. He risked all of that to follow the law. It is nice to think that we all would have done the same, but I'm not sure. And I am sure that the overwhelming majority of Pence's fellow Republicans would not have.\n\nFurther, Pence is one of only three Republicans running for president who consistently speaks straightforwardly about January 6 and the rule of law, and he does not couch his criticisms of Trump as merely being \"bad for Republican chances to win.\" Pence possesses much of what the prodemocracy movement hopes for in a Republican. In some ways, he is an example of what, in the small- d democratic sense, a Republican Party aiming to restore itself to health and liberalism should look like.\n\nIt is precisely because of this that Pence is so reviled by so many Republicans, with a favorability rating that barely breaks even .\n\nI t turns out that Pence doesn't quite know what to do with himself either. So he's trying his luck at becoming the avatar of the same voters who wanted to hang him.\n\nIt's the damnedest thing. Pence overcame a lifetime of political tribalism to break with his team. And now he's trying to get back on it-because he can't see what he helped them become.\n\nOne of my pet theories is that during the Trump years, we discovered that our political spectrum had two axes. There's the left-right, progressive-conservative x-axis that we're all familiar with. But there's also an up-down, liberal-illiberal y-axis. This has been the case in America for a long time-since its founding, really-but with the end of Jim Crow, a lot of us had forgotten that this y-axis existed. We assumed that everyone on the conservative, right-hand side of the x-axis-the Reagans, the Bushes, the Doles, the McCains, the Romneys-was also at the top (the liberal end) of the y-axis, too. Because they were.\n\nBut with Trump's emergence, some people-both voters and elected officials-began drifting downward on that y-axis toward the illiberal side of the spectrum.\n\nPence was happy to play along until the chips were down, at which point he chose liberalism and democracy. And for that, America owes him a debt that can never be repaid.\n\nThe tragedy of Pence is that, for all of his x-axis conservative policy views, it's his conviction in favor of liberalism on the y-axis that now matters most to the conservatives he is asking to vote for him.\n\nA liberal society can have arguments about tax rates and infrastructure spending and foreign policy. In an illiberal society, none of those questions really matters-the only thing that matters is who holds power. \"Who, whom?\" as the Leninists used to put it.\n\nOn the biggest issues-democracy, the Constitution, the rule of law-Mike Pence is now much closer to Joe Biden on the y-axis than he is to Republican voters.\n\nAnd he either can't see it, or won't."

      "text": "Mike Pence Refuses to Connect the Dots\n\nIn his new memoir, the former vice president selectively edits his four years with Trump to avoid a necessary reckoning.\n\nO n the morning of January 1, 2021, Mike Pence awoke after a terrible night's sleep, poured a cup of coffee, and started his new year with a tongue-lashing from the president of the United States.\n\nDonald Trump's angry phone call didn't come as a surprise. The vice president had gone to bed the night before \"with a growing foreboding about the days ahead,\" he writes in his new book, So Help Me God , which is part memoir, part soft launch of a 2024 campaign, and part eyewitness account of the lies, betrayals, and abuses of power that roiled the nation during Trump's final days in office. For weeks, the president had been subtly suggesting to Pence that, as vice president, he could act unilaterally on January 6 and prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden's victory. Pence had continually resisted, explaining that his only authority under the Constitution was to tally the electoral votes after Congress certified them. Now the proceeding was just days away, and Trump was done being subtle.\n\nTearing into Pence over the phone-\"hundreds of thousands are gonna hate your guts,\" the president told him-Trump was vexed about one thing in particular. A few days earlier, Louie Gohmert, the far-right representative from Texas, had joined other Republican officials in filing a federal lawsuit that would have given Pence \"exclusive authority and sole discretion\" to decide which electoral votes would be counted on January 6. Pence, in turn, had enlisted lawyers from the Department of Justice to defeat the \"frivolous\" lawsuit, which he considered an affront to the Constitution. The president could not comprehend his reasoning. \"If it gives you power,\" Trump asked Pence, \"why would you oppose it?\"\n\nThe anecdote speaks to what makes Pence's book utterly captivating-and equally unsatisfying.\n\nIn the growing library of Trump White House tell-alls published by staffers , family members, and grifters of a general sort, Pence's could have been the most intimate. It does offer a truly distinctive window into the Trump phenomenon, from unlikely election winner to unwilling election loser, recounting conversations and deliberations to which he alone was privy. And yet, the book is also singularly frustrating, tortured in its appraisal of so many history-making moments and reluctant to reflect meaningfully on the author's view of them.\n\nT he New Year's Day phone spat is illuminating, because it's the moment Pence finally sees the light. Once nonchalant about Trump's refusal to concede defeat-Pence makes no mention of ever encouraging him to do so-he came to realize just how determined the president was to remain in office. Trump didn't just want to subvert our system of self-government; he wanted Pence to make it happen. Here, the vice president hopes the reader will be as shocked and horrified as he was. The problem is, Trump's egomaniacal fixation on thwarting a peaceful transition of power is not some anomaly to be understood in a vacuum; rather, it is the continuation of a long pattern of selfishness, deception, and even treachery that long foretold such a crisis. That it took Pence four years-or, in this case, 446 pages-to reach the startling conclusion that the president cares more about himself than about the country robs the book of the visceral authenticity that flashes throughout the opening and closing passages.\n\nRead: Mike Pence owes the country an explanation\n\nThe author's caginess is hardly surprising. Pence, a onetime talk-radio host who communicates as deliberately as any politician I've ever met, had no choice but to acknowledge his bad blood with Trump as it relates to January 6 . There was no brushing it aside or wishing it away, not after the public had seen the gallows and the noose and heard the mob's chants of \"Hang Mike Pence!\" Whatever suspense accompanied the news, then, that Trump's once-loyal sidekick was writing a memoir pertained to the rest of their relationship. It was widely understood that Pence, a scripture-annotating family man from southern Indiana, has little in common with the Manhattan playboy turned president. Because of the literally violent nature of their falling out, it was fair to wonder whether Pence, who had been insistent on keeping their disagreements private, might finally provide an open, honest assessment of the totality of Trump's presidency.\n\nAnyone who hoped so-anyone who figured that having a seditious mob sicced on you and your family by the president of the United States might be cause for public introspection-is going to be disappointed. It's not clear whether Pence's stubbornness on this front is to protect his own presidential ambitions, which remain very much alive, or to safeguard his vice-presidential legacy, which is already under assault. Either way, it makes for a maddening read: Pence surely has thoughts on Trump beyond the book's carefully crafted, made-for-promotional-material talking points, but he won't give them to us.\n\nHere, for transparency's sake, I should pause to clarify two things. First, I have some history with Pence; he once lost his (typically well-concealed) Irish temper in response to a story I wrote detailing his turbulent partnership with Trump and his own designs on the presidency. Pence believes I've unfairly picked on him, holding him to a higher standard than I have other people in Trump's orbit. The second thing is: I have . Why? Because I believe that unlike so many other Trump associates-Steve Bannon, Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn-Pence is a decent human being. (Any number of high-profile Democrats, including Joe Biden and the late Representative John Lewis, have said the same.) The former vice president isn't another craven, self-indulgent schemer bent on domination; he's a humble, civil person who takes his faith seriously and knows the difference between right and wrong.\n\nFor decades, Pence has introduced himself to audiences in the same way: \"I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican. In that order .\" To lead with that identifier-to profess publicly, time and again, that you're a follower of Jesus before anything else-is to invite and deserve perpetual scrutiny. Pence and his team of longtime loyalists would often bristle at that scrutiny, especially when it stemmed from his silence in the face of some blatant offense committed by Trump. They would remind people that he was the vice president, that his job was to support the boss, not undermine him by opining publicly on the president's honesty or integrity or judgment.\n\nThat defense was plausible, if not always convincing, while Pence was helping Trump lead the free world. But given that he no longer is-and given the rupture in their relationship, which Pence suggests in the book's closing pages is now permanent-a reader might hope to ascertain how the former vice president truly felt about the controversies that will be debated for decades to come. This is not a journalist's lazy game of gotcha, hoping to pin down Pence on every policy judgment or political statement the president ever made (although it would be nice to know the author's innermost thoughts about, say, Trump siding with Vladimir Putin over the U.S. intelligence community in Helsinki; Pence shares only that he encouraged Trump a day later to \"clarify his remarks\"). At the very least, because Pence orients much of the book around his Christian faith-assigning scriptural subtitles to each of the 52 chapters, plus the epilogue-it is fair to expect that he would at least acknowledge the moral dilemma that gripped many Christians who observed Trump only from afar. What to think of the administration separating children from their parents at the southern border? Whom to believe when convincing evidence surfaces to show that Trump paid hush money to a porn star during his presidential campaign? How to reconcile the example of Christ with Trump's swaggering insults and unrepentant falsehoods and constant, merciless marginalization of those who are the least among us?\n\nP ence makes a conscious decision not to engage with these questions. There is an argument, certainly, that politics requires even the most pious of public servants to make compromises that are justified by some greater good. But Pence does not make this argument. In fact, he flatly refuses to recognize the existence of any such compromises. He wants to impress upon the reader that no soul searching is required. He cannot even bring himself to deal with the perceptions of Trump that span ideological divides. When navigating the sea of buzzwords that substitute for any description of Trump's manifest vulgarity-the former president is repeatedly described as \"brash\" and \"blunt\"; his \"freewheeling manner\" and \"hardball approach\" are not for \"the faint of heart\"-the reader can almost see Pence's face contorting into that quizzical, far-off look he gives when confronted with questions about Trump's decorum.\n\nMaking this even more conspicuous-at times, almost comical-is Pence's earnest attempt to communicate his own moral code. The only non-insurrection-related private tiff with Trump that he describes is when, after the then-Republican presidential nominee ridiculed the Gold Star parents who spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, he registered his \"disagreement\" with Trump's \"tactics.\" He concludes, \"I think he got the message.\" Trump did not get the message, but you wouldn't know it from Pence's recollection of the following four years, which speeds past so much of Trump's hateful, deceptive, dehumanizing commentary but stops often to dwell on Pence's own persecution at the hands of the Democratic Party.\n\nRead: Mike Pence is an American hero\n\nSome of Pence's grievances are legitimate. The mocking of his personal relationship with God, by Joy Behar of The View , among others, was repulsive. And the snickering coverage of \"the Pence Rule\" (borrowed from the evangelist Billy Graham), which prohibits him from being alone with any woman who is not his wife, was embarrassing.\n\nStill, the extent to which Pence portrays Trump as a martyr, a good and virtuous man who suffered gallantly for the sake of his supporters, makes his lecturing of the left ring hollow. There is harsh judgment of many Democrats-Hillary Clinton, John Brennan, Adam Schiff, and, of course, Joe Biden-and their scheming, but abundant grace and bottomless benefit of the doubt for Trump himself.\n\nIn fact, Pence goes out of his way to depict all critiques of Trump as partisan and therefore politically motivated, ignoring the fact that plenty of his fellow Republicans, including close, longtime friends such as Jeff Flake , were among the most outspoken critics of the administration. Naturally, Pence does not mention Trump's cruel ad hominem attacks on Flake-a man who was once like a brother to Pence when they served together in Congress-or on the other former senator from Arizona, John McCain, whom Pence considered a friend and mentor. That the sitting president of the United States was not invited to McCain's funeral, while former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush delivered eulogies, is the subject of zero analysis.\n\nI t's true that the political warfare had become more conventionally partisan by the end of Trump's term, because he purged so many of his critics from the party (a fact that Pence does not mention). But it's also true that 10 House Republicans voted to impeach Trump after the attack on the Capitol, and that another seven Senate Republicans voted to convict and bar him from running for president again (another fact Pence does not mention).\n\nThis is the fundamental failing of the book. Pence has been known to lament to friends the myopic examination of Trump and his presidency, complaining that journalists like me and disaffected Republicans like Flake focus only on the negatives and ignore anything constructive that was accomplished. But in writing such a selectively edited history of the Trump era, Pence has done exactly the opposite: He focuses almost exclusively on the positives of those four years and declines to validate any of the trepidation Americans felt long before the Capitol was overrun on January 6.\n\nPence wants readers to believe that the carnage of that day came out of the blue, that we could not possibly have foreseen any of it. It's an insult to the reader's intelligence. So many dots along the way-the defense of \"very fine people\" in Charlottesville; the demeaning of anyone who dared, as Defense Secretary James Mattis did, to question his judgment; the quid pro quo with Ukraine and the obstruction of Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election-collectively pointed to how Trump's approach to governance was shaped by vanity and self-interest. But Pence refuses to connect those dots. Even now, with the full benefit of hindsight, nearly two years after fleeing for his very life, Pence refuses to consider the connection between the manipulative propaganda of Trump's administration and the people wearing Make America Great Again hats who wanted to murder him for doing his constitutional duty.\n\nIt's a shame for many reasons, chief among them the fact that Pence acted so admirably on January 6. Not only did he stand up to the mafioso tactics of Trump and his henchmen-more than could have been expected of, say, a Vice President Newt Gingrich-but Pence also refused to leave the Capitol that day, defying his own Secret Service detail and insisting that the work of Congress to certify the election results be completed in the face of bloodshed and death.\n\nPence deserves the gratitude of every American for his courage and conviction in that moment. Unfortunately, with the moment now passed, he has chosen to revert to vice-presidential form, excusing and ignoring the authoritarian impulses that incited a mob long before the election of 2020 was lost.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "God's Plan for Mike Pence\n\nWill the vice president-and the religious right-be rewarded for their embrace of Donald Trump?\n\nNo man can serve two masters, the Bible teaches, but Mike Pence is giving it his all. It's a sweltering September afternoon in Anderson, Indiana, and the vice president has returned to his home state to deliver the Good News of the Republicans' recently unveiled tax plan. The visit is a big deal for Anderson, a fading manufacturing hub about 20 miles outside Muncie that hasn't hosted a sitting president or vice president in 65 years-a fact noted by several warm-up speakers. To mark this historic civic occasion, the cavernous factory where the event is being held has been transformed. Idle machinery has been shoved to the perimeter to make room for risers and cameras and a gargantuan American flag, which-along with bleachers full of constituents carefully selected for their ethnic diversity and ability to stay awake during speeches about tax policy-will serve as the TV-ready backdrop for Pence's remarks.\n\nWhen the time comes, Pence takes the stage and greets the crowd with a booming \"Hell ooooo , Indiana!\" He says he has \"just hung up the phone\" with Donald Trump and that the president asked him to \"say hello.\" He delivers this message with a slight chuckle that has a certain, almost subversive quality to it. Watch Pence give enough speeches, and you'll notice that this often happens when he's in front of a friendly crowd. He'll be witnessing to evangelicals at a mega-church, or addressing conservative supporters at a rally, and when the moment comes for him to pass along the president's well-wishes, the words are invariably accompanied by an amused little chuckle that prompts knowing laughter from the attendees. It's almost as if, in that brief, barely perceptible moment, Pence is sending a message to those with ears to hear-that he recognizes the absurdity of his situation; that he knows just what sort of man he's working for; that while things may look bad now, there is a grand purpose at work here, a plan that will manifest itself in due time. Let not your hearts be troubled , he seems to be saying. I've got this .\n\nAnd then, all at once, Pence is back on message. In his folksy Midwestern drawl, he recites Republican aphorisms about \"job creators\" and regulatory \"red tape,\" and heralds the many supposed triumphs of Trump's young presidency. As he nears the end of his remarks, his happy-warrior buoyancy gives way to a more sober cadence. \"We've come to a pivotal moment in the life of this country,\" Pence soulfully intones. \"It's a good time to pray for America.\" His voice rising in righteous fervor, the vice president promises an opening of the heavens. \"If His people who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray,\" he proclaims, \"He'll hear from heaven, and He'll heal this land!\"\n\nIt's easy to see how Pence could put so much faith in the possibilities of divine intervention. The very fact that he is standing behind a lectern bearing the vice-presidential seal is, one could argue, a loaves-and-fishes-level miracle. Just a year earlier, he was an embattled small-state governor with underwater approval ratings, dismal reelection prospects, and a national reputation in tatters. In many ways, Pence was on the same doomed trajectory as the conservative-Christian movement he'd long championed-once a political force to be reckoned with, now a battered relic of the culture wars.\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nBecause God works in mysterious ways (or, at the very least, has a postmodern sense of humor), it was Donald J. Trump- gracer of Playboy covers , delighter of shock jocks, collector of mistresses-who descended from the mountaintop in the summer of 2016, GOP presidential nomination in hand, offering salvation to both Pence and the religious right. The question of whether they should wed themselves to such a man was not without its theological considerations. But after eight years of Barack Obama and a string of disorienting political defeats, conservative Christians were in retreat and out of options. So they placed their faith in Trump-and then, incredibly, he won.\n\nIn Pence, Trump has found an obedient deputy whose willingness to suffer indignity and humiliation at the pleasure of the president appears boundless. When Trump comes under fire for describing white nationalists as \" very fine people ,\" Pence is there to assure the world that he is actually a man of great decency . When Trump needs someone to fly across the country to an NFL game so he can walk out in protest of national-anthem kneelers, Pence heads for Air Force Two.\n\nMeanwhile, Pence's presence in the White House has been a boon for the religious right. Evangelical leaders across the country point to his record on abortion and religious freedom and liken him to a prophet restoring conservative Christianity to its rightful place at the center of American life. \"Mike Pence is the 24-karat-gold model of what we want in an evangelical politician,\" Richard Land, the president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary and one of Trump's faith advisers, told me. \"I don't know anyone who's more consistent in bringing his evangelical-Christian worldview to public policy.\"\n\nBut what does Pence make of his own improbable rise to the vice presidency, and how does he reconcile his faith with serving a man like Trump? Over the past several months, I've spoken with dozens of people who have known the vice president throughout his life-from college fraternity brothers and longtime friends to trusted advisers and political foes. (Pence himself declined my requests for an interview.) While many of them expressed surprise and even bewilderment at the heights of power Pence had attained, those who know him best said he sees no mystery in why he's in the White House. \"If you're Mike Pence, and you believe what he believes, you know God had a plan,\" says Ralph Reed, an evangelical power broker and a friend of the vice president's.\n\nPence has so far showed absolute deference to the president-and as a result he has become one of the most influential figures in the White House, with a broad portfolio of responsibilities and an unprecedented level of autonomy. But for all his aw-shucks modesty, Pence is a man who believes heaven and Earth have conspired to place him a heartbeat-or an impeachment vote-away from the presidency. At some crucial juncture in the not-too-distant future, that could make him a threat to Trump.\n\nPence's public persona can seem straight out of the Columbus, Indiana, of his youth, a quiet suburb of Indianapolis where conformity was a virtue and old-fashioned values reigned. His dad ran a chain of convenience stores; his mom was a homemaker who took care of him and his five siblings. The Pences were devout Irish-Catholic Democrats, and Mike and his brothers served as altar boys at St. Columba Catholic Church.\n\nYoung Mike did not initially thrive in this setting. He was useless at football (he later sized up his own abilities as \"one grade above the blocking sled\"), and he lacked the natural athleticism of his brothers, who were \"lean and hard and thin.\" Pence was \"a fat little kid,\" he told a local newspaper in 1988, \"the real pumpkin in the pickle patch.\"\n\nBut by the time Pence arrived at Hanover College-a small liberal-arts school in southern Indiana-he had slimmed down, discovered a talent for public speaking, and developed something akin to swagger. The yearbooks from his undergraduate days are filled with photos that portray Pence as a kind of campus cliché: the dark-haired, square-jawed stud strumming an acoustic guitar on the quad as he leads a gaggle of coeds in a sing-along. In one picture, Pence mugs for the camera in a fortune-teller costume with a girl draped over his lap; in another, he poses goofily in an unbuttoned shirt that shows off his torso.\n\nPence wasn't a bad student, but he wasn't especially bookish either, managing a B-plus average amid a busy campus social life. As a freshman, he joined Phi Gamma Delta and became an enthusiastic participant in the Greek experience. Dan Murphy, a former fraternity brother of Pence's who now teaches history at Hanover, told me that the \"Phi Gams\" were an eclectic bunch. \"You had in that fraternity house everything from the sort of evangelical-Christian crowd to some fairly hard-core drug users.\" Pence was friendly with all of them, and in his sophomore year was elected president of the fraternity.\n\nMurphy and Pence lived in neighboring rooms, and made a habit of attending Catholic Mass together on Sunday nights. On their walks back home, they often talked about their futures, and it became clear to Murphy that his friend had a much stronger sense of his \"mission in the world\" than the average undergrad. Pence agonized over his \"calling.\" He talked about entering the priesthood, but ultimately felt drawn instead to politics, a realm where he believed he could harness God's power to do good. It was obvious to his fraternity brothers, Murphy told me, that Pence wanted to be president one day.\n\nPence underwent two conversions in college that would shape the rest of his life. The first came in the spring of 1978, when he road-tripped to Kentucky with some evangelical friends for a music festival billed as the Christian Woodstock. After a day of rocking out to Jesus-loving prog-rock bands and born-again Bob Dylan imitators, Pence found himself sitting in a light rain, yearning for a more personal relationship with Christ than was afforded by the ritualized Catholicism of his youth. \"My heart really, finally broke with a deep realization that what had happened on the cross in some infinitesimal way had happened for me,\" Pence recounted in March 2017 . It was there, he said, that he gave his life to Jesus.\n\nThe other conversion was a partisan one. Pence had entered college a staunch supporter of Jimmy Carter, and he viewed the 1980 presidential election as a contest between a \"good Christian\" and a \"vacuous movie star.\" But President Ronald Reagan won Pence over-instilling in him an appreciation for both movement conservatism and the leadership potential of vacuous entertainers that would serve him well later in life.\n\nMurphy told me another story about Pence that has stayed with him. During their sophomore year, the Phi Gamma Delta house found itself perpetually on probation. The movie Animal House had recently come out, and the fraternity brothers were constantly re-creating their favorite scenes, with toga parties, outlandish pranks, and other miscellaneous mischief. Most vexing to the school's administration was their violation of Hanover's strict alcohol prohibition. The Phi Gams devised elaborate schemes to smuggle booze into the house, complete with a network of campus lookouts. Pence was not a particularly hard partyer, but he gamely presided over these efforts, and when things went sideways he was often called upon to smooth things over with the adults.\n\nOne night, during a rowdy party, Pence and his fraternity brothers got word that an associate dean was on his way to the house. They scrambled to hide the kegs and plastic cups, and then Pence met the administrator at the door.\n\n\"We know you've got a keg,\" the dean told Pence, according to Murphy. Typically when scenes like this played out, one of the brothers would take the fall, claiming that all the alcohol was his and thus sparing the house from formal discipline. Instead, Pence led the dean straight to the kegs and admitted that they belonged to the fraternity. The resulting punishment was severe. \"They really raked us over the coals,\" Murphy said. \"The whole house was locked down.\" Some of Pence's fraternity brothers were furious with him-but he managed to stay on good terms with the administration. Such good terms, in fact, that after he graduated, in 1981, the school offered him a job in the admissions office.\n\nDecades later, when Murphy read about Pence vying for a spot on the presidential ticket with Donald Trump, he recognized a familiar quality in his old friend. \"Somewhere in the midst of all that genuine humility and good feeling, this is a guy who's got that ambition,\" Murphy told me. And he wondered, \"Is Mike's religiosity a way of justifying that ambition to himself?\"\n\nFor all Pence's outward piousness, he's kept the details of his spiritual journey opaque. Despite his conversion to evangelical Christianity in college, he married his wife, Karen, in a Catholic ceremony and until the mid‐'90s periodically referred to himself as an \"evangelical Catholic.\" That formulation might befuddle theologians, but it reveals the extraordinary degree to which Pence's personal religious evolution paralleled the rise of the religious right.\n\nIndeed, it was just a year after Pence's born-again experience in Kentucky that Jerry Falwell founded the Moral Majority, a national movement that aimed to turn Christian voters into a pavement-pounding political force. In the decades that followed, white evangelicals forged an alliance with conservative Catholics to fight abortion, gay marriage, and an encroaching secularism that they saw as a threat to their religious freedom. With conservative believers feeling under siege, denominational differences began to melt away.\n\nIn 1988, at age 29, Pence launched his first bid for Congress. He garnered attention by riding a single-speed bicycle around his district in sneakers and short shorts, dodging aggravated motorists and drumming up conversations with prospective voters on the sidewalk. It was a perfectly Pencian gimmick-earnest, almost unbearably cheesy-and it helped him win the Republican nomination. But he was unable to defeat the Democratic incumbent, Phil Sharp.\n\nPence tried again two years later, this time ditching the bike in favor of vicious attack ads. The race is remembered as one of the nastiest in Indiana history. In one notorious Pence campaign spot, an actor dressed as a cartoonish Arab sheikh thanked Sharp for advancing the interests of foreign oil. The tone of the campaign was jarring coming from a candidate who had nurtured such a wholesome image, a contrast memorably captured in an Indianapolis Star headline: \"Pence Urges Clean Campaign, Calls Opponent a Liar.\" He ended up losing by 19 points after it was revealed that he was using campaign funds to pay his mortgage and grocery bills (a practice that was then legal but has since been outlawed).\n\nAfterward, a humbled Pence attempted public repentance by personal essay. His article, \" Confessions of a Negative Campaigner ,\" ran in newspapers across the state. \"Christ Jesus came to save sinners,\" the essay began, quoting 1 Timothy, \"among whom I am foremost of all.\"\n\nWith two failed congressional bids behind him, Pence decided to change tack. In 1992, he debuted a conservative talk-radio show that he described as \"Rush Limbaugh on decaf.\" The quaint joke belied the meticulousness with which Pence went about building his local media empire. \"He knew exactly what he wanted his brand to be and who his audience was,\" says Ed Feigenbaum, the publisher of a state-politics tip sheet, whom Pence often consulted. Most of his listeners were \"retirees and conservative housewives,\" Feigenbaum says, and Pence carefully catered to them. Over the next eight years, he expanded his radio show to 18 markets, started hosting a talk show on a local TV station, launched a proto-blog, and published a newsletter, \"The Pence Report,\" which locals remember primarily for its frequent typos and Pence's lovingly drawn political cartoons.\n\n\"His Mikeness,\" as he became known on the air, began each radio show with a signature opening line-\"Greetings across the amber waves of grain\"-and filled the hours with a mix of interviews, listener calls, and medium-hot takes. Pence's commentary from this period is a near-perfect time capsule of '90s culture-war trivia. He railed against assisted suicide (\"Kevorkian is a monster\") and fretted about the insufficient punishment given to a female Air Force pilot who had engaged in an extramarital affair (\"Is adultery no longer a big deal in Indiana and in America?\"). He mounted a rousing defense of Big Tobacco (\"Despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn't kill\") and lamented parents' growing reliance on day care (pop culture \"has sold the big lie that 'Mom doesn't matter' \").\n\nPence also demonstrated a knack for seizing on more-creative wedge issues. For instance, a 1995 initiative to reintroduce otters into Indiana's wildlife population became, in Pence's able hands, a frightening example of Big Government run amok. \"State-sanctioned, sanitized otters today,\" he warned, ominously. \"Buffaloes tomorrow?\"\n\nDespite Pence's on-air culture-warring, he rarely came off as disagreeable. He liked to describe himself as \"a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order,\" and he was careful to show respect for opposing viewpoints. \"Nobody ever left an interview not liking Mike,\" says Scott Uecker, the radio executive who oversaw Pence's show.\n\nBy the time a congressional seat opened up ahead of the 2000 election, Pence was a minor Indiana celebrity and state Republicans were urging him to run. In the summer of 1999, as he was mulling the decision, he took his family on a trip to Colorado. One day while horseback riding in the mountains, he and Karen looked heavenward and saw two red-tailed hawks soaring over them. They took it as a sign, Karen recalled years later: Pence would run again, but this time there would be \"no flapping.\" He would glide to victory.\n\nTo his colleagues on Capitol Hill-an overwhelmingly secular place where even many Republicans privately sneer at people of faith-everything about the Indiana congressman screamed \"Bible thumper.\" He was known to pray with his staffers, and often cited scripture to explain his votes. In a 2002 interview with Congressional Quarterly , for example, he explained, \"My support for Israel stems largely from my personal faith. In the Bible, God promises Abraham, 'Those who bless you I will bless, and those who curse you I will curse.' \" He became a champion of the fight to restrict abortion and defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nPence didn't have a reputation for legislative acumen (\"I would not call Mike a policy wonk,\" one former staffer told the Indianapolis Monthly ), and some of his colleagues called him a nickname behind his back: \"Mike Dense.\" But he did have sharp political instincts. Before long, he was climbing the leadership ranks and making connections with key figures in the conservative-Christian establishment. The New Yorker' s Jane Mayer has documented Pence's close ties to the Koch brothers and other GOP mega-donors, but his roots in the religious right are even deeper. In 2011, as he began plotting a presidential run in the upcoming election cycle, Pence met with Ralph Reed, the evangelical power broker, to seek his advice.\n\nReed told Pence he should return home and get elected governor of Indiana first, then use the statehouse as a launching pad for a presidential bid. He said a few years in the governor's mansion-combined with his deep support on the Christian right-would make him a top-tier candidate in the 2016 primaries.\n\nPence took Reed's advice, and in 2012 launched a gubernatorial bid. Casting himself as the heir to the popular outgoing governor, Mitch Daniels, he avoided social issues and ran on a pragmatic, business-friendly platform. He used Ronald Reagan as a political style guru and told his ad makers that he wanted his campaign commercials to have \"that 'Morning in America' feel.\" He meticulously fine-tuned early cuts of the ads, asking his consultants to edit this or reframe that or zoom in here instead of there.\n\nBut he wasn't willing to win at all costs. When the race tightened in the homestretch, Pence faced immense pressure from consultants to go negative. A former adviser recalls heated conference calls in which campaign brass urged him to green-light an attack ad on his Democratic opponent, John Gregg. Pence refused. \"He didn't want to be a hypocrite,\" the former adviser says.\n\nPence won the race anyway, and set about cutting taxes and taking on local unions-burnishing a résumé that would impress Republican donors and Iowa caucus-goers. The governor's stock began to rise in Washington, where he was widely viewed as a contender for the 2016 presidential nomination.\n\nThen, in early 2015, Pence stumbled into a culture-war debacle that would come to define his governorship. At the urging of conservative-Christian leaders in Indiana, the GOP-controlled state legislature passed a bill that would have allowed religious business owners to deny services to gay customers in certain circumstances. Pence signed it into law in a closed-press ceremony at the statehouse, surrounded by nuns, monks, and right-wing lobbyists. A photo of the signing was released, and all hell broke loose. Corporate leaders threatened to stop adding jobs in Indiana, and national organizations began pulling scheduled conventions from the state. The NCAA, which is headquartered in Indianapolis, put out a statement suggesting that the law might imperil \"future events.\" The Indianapolis Star ran a rare front-page editorial under an all-caps headline: \"FIX THIS NOW.\"\n\nCaught off guard by the controversy, Pence accepted an invitation to appear on This Week With George Stephanopoulos , where he intended to make the case that the law wasn't anti-gay but rather pro-religious liberty. What took place instead was an excruciating 12-minute interview in which Pence awkwardly danced around the same straightforward question: Does this law allow a Christian florist to refuse service for a same-sex wedding? \"George, look,\" Pence said at one point, sounding frustrated, \"the issue here is, you know, is tolerance a two-way street or not?\"\n\nFor Pence-and the conservative-Christian movement he represented-this was more than just a talking point. In recent years, the religious right had been abruptly forced to pivot from offense to defense in the culture wars-abandoning the \"family values\" crusades and talk of \"remoralizing America,\" and focusing its energies on self-preservation. Conservative Christians had lost the battles over school prayer, sex education, and pornography censorship, and the Supreme Court was poised to legalize same-sex marriage. Meanwhile, a widespread decline in churchgoing and religious affiliation had contributed to a growing anxiety among conservative believers. By 2017, white evangelicals would tell pollsters that Christians faced more discrimination in America than Muslims did.\n\nTo many Christians, the backlash against Indiana's \"religious freedom\" bill was a frightening sign of the secular left's triumphalism. Liberals were no longer working toward tolerance, it seemed-they were out for conquest. \"Many evangelicals were experiencing the sense of an almost existential threat,\" Russell Moore, a leader of the Southern Baptist Convention, told me. It was only a matter of time, he said, before cultural elites' scornful attitudes would help drive Christians into the arms of a strongman like Trump. \"I think there needs to be a deep reflection on the left about how they helped make this happen.\"\n\nAfter seven chaotic days, Pence caved and signed a revised version of the religious-freedom bill-but by then it was too late. His approval ratings were in free fall, Democrats were raising money to defeat him in the next gubernatorial election, and the political obituaries were being written. Things looked grimmer for Pence, and the religious right, than they ever had before.\n\nD eliverance manifested itself to Mike Pence on the back nine of Donald Trump's golf course in New Jersey. It was the Fourth of July weekend, and the two men were sizing each other up as potential running mates. Each had his own hesitations. Coming into the game, Trump had formed an opinion of the Indiana governor as prudish, stiff, and embarrassingly poor, according to one longtime associate. Pence, meanwhile, had spent the primaries privately shaking his head at Trump's campaign-trail antics, and had endorsed Senator Ted Cruz for the nomination. But as the two men played golf, Pence asked what his job description would be if they wound up in the White House together. Trump gave him the same answer he'd been dangling in front of other prospective running mates for weeks: He wanted \"the most consequential vice president ever.\" Pence was sold.\n\nBefore flying out to New Jersey, Pence had called Kellyanne Conway, a top Trump adviser, whom he'd known for years, and asked for her advice on how to handle the meeting. Conway had told him to talk about \"stuff outside of politics,\" and suggested he show his eagerness to learn from the billionaire. \"I knew they would enjoy each other's company,\" Conway told me, adding, \"Mike Pence is someone whose faith allows him to subvert his ego to the greater good.\"\n\nTrue to form, Pence spent much of their time on the course kissing Trump's ring. You're going to be the next president of the United States , he said. It would be the honor of a lifetime to serve you . Afterward, he made a point of gushing to the press about Trump's golf game. \"He beat me like a drum,\" Pence confessed, to Trump's delight.\n\nThe consensus among the campaign's top political strategists was that a Trump-Pence ticket was their best shot at winning in November. After a bitter primary season, Trump's campaign had moved swiftly to shore up support from conservative Christians, who advisers worried would stay home on Election Day. Trump released a list of potential Supreme Court nominees with unimpeachably pro-life records and assembled an evangelical advisory board composed of high-profile faith leaders.\n\nOne of the men asked to join the board was Richard Land, of the Southern Evangelical Seminary. When the campaign approached him with the offer, Land says, he was perplexed. \"You do know that Trump was my last choice, right?\" he said. But he ultimately accepted, and when a campaign aide asked what his first piece of advice was, he didn't hesitate: \"Pick Mike Pence.\"\n\nNonetheless, as decision time approached, Trump was leaning toward New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a fellow bridge-and-tunnel loudmouth with whom he had more natural chemistry. The candidate's advisers repeatedly warned that the \"Bridgegate\" fiasco would make Christie a liability in the general election. But they were unable to get through to Trump.\n\nThen, on July 12, a miracle: During a short campaign swing through Indiana, Trump got word that his plane had broken down on the runway, and that he would need to spend the night in Indianapolis. With nowhere else to go, Trump accepted an invitation to dine with the Pences.\n\nIn fact, according to two former Trump aides, there was no problem with the plane. Paul Manafort, who was then serving as the campaign's chairman, had made up the story to keep the candidate in town an extra day and allow him to be wooed by Pence. The gambit worked: Three days later, Trump announced Pence as his running mate.\n\nOn the stump and in interviews, Pence spoke of Trump in a tone that bordered on worshipful. One of his rhetorical tics was to praise the breadth of his running mate's shoulders. Trump was, Pence proclaimed, a \"broad-shouldered leader,\" in possession of \"broad shoulders and a big heart,\" who had \"the kind of broad shoulders\" that enabled him to endure criticism while he worked to return \"broad-shouldered American strength to the world stage.\"\n\nCampaign operatives discovered that anytime Trump did something outrageous or embarrassing, they could count on Pence to clean it up. \"He was our top surrogate by far,\" said one former senior adviser to Trump. \"He was this mild-mannered, uber-Christian guy with a Midwestern accent telling voters, 'Trump is a good man; I know what's in his heart.' It was very convincing-you wanted to trust him. You'd be sitting there listening to him and thinking, Yeah, maybe Trump is a good man! \"\n\nEven some of Trump's most devoted loyalists marveled at what Pence was willing to say. There was no talking point too preposterous, no fixed reality too plain to deny-if they needed Pence to defend the boss, he was in. When, during the vice-presidential debate, in early October, he was confronted with a barrage of damning quotes and questionable positions held by his running mate, Pence responded with unnerving message discipline, dismissing documented facts as \"nonsense\" and smears.\n\nIt was the kind of performance-a blur of half-truths and \"whatabout\"s and lies-that could make a good Christian queasy. But people close to Pence say he felt no conflict between his campaign duties and his religious beliefs. Marc Short, a longtime adviser to Pence and a fellow Christian, told me that the vice president believes strongly in a scriptural concept evangelicals call \"servant leadership.\" The idea is rooted in the Gospels, where Jesus models humility by washing his disciples' feet and teaches, \"Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave.\"\n\nWhen Pence was in Congress, he instructed his aides to have a \"servant's attitude\" when dealing with constituents. Later, as the chairman of the House Republican Conference, he saw his job as being a servant to his fellow GOP lawmakers. And when he accepted the vice-presidential nomination, he believed he was committing to humbly submit to the will of Donald Trump. \"Servant leadership is biblical,\" Short told me. \"That's at the heart of it for Mike, and it comes across in his relationship with the president.\"\n\nAnother close friend of Pence's explained it to me this way: \"His faith teaches that you're under authority at all times. Christ is under God's authority, man is under Christ's authority, children are under the parents' authority, employees are under the employer's authority.\"\n\n\"Mike,\" he added, \"always knows who's in charge.\"\n\nOn Friday, October 7, 2016, The Washington Post published the Access Hollywood tape that showed Trump gloating about his penchant for grabbing women \"by the pussy,\" and instantly upended the campaign. Republicans across the country withdrew their endorsements, and conservative editorial boards called on Trump to drop out of the race. Most alarming to the aides and operatives inside Trump Tower, Mike Pence suddenly seemed at risk of going rogue.\n\nTrump's phone calls to his running mate reportedly went unreturned, and anonymous quotes began appearing in news stories describing Pence as \"beside himself\" over the revelation. One campaign staffer told me that when she was asked on TV the day after the tape came out whether Pence would remain on the ticket, she ad-libbed that, yes, he was 100 percent committed to Trump. She remembers walking away from the set and thinking, \" I have no idea if what I just said is true .\"\n\nIt's been reported that Pence sent Trump a letter saying he needed time to decide whether he could stay with the campaign. But in fact, according to several Republicans familiar with the situation, he wasn't just thinking about dropping out-he was contemplating a coup. Within hours of The Post 's bombshell, Pence made it clear to the Republican National Committee that he was ready to take Trump's place as the party's nominee. Such a move just four weeks before Election Day would have been unprecedented-but the situation seemed dire enough to call for radical action.\n\nAlready, Reince Priebus's office was being flooded with panicked calls from GOP officials and donors urging the RNC chairman to get rid of Trump by whatever means necessary. One Republican senator called on the party to engage emergency protocols to nominate a new candidate. RNC lawyers huddled to explore an obscure legal mechanism by which they might force Trump off the ticket. Meanwhile, a small group of billionaires was trying to put together money for a \"buyout\"-even going so far as to ask a Trump associate how much money the candidate would require to walk away from the race. According to someone with knowledge of the talks, they were given an answer of $800 million. (It's unclear whether Trump was aware of this discussion or whether the offer was actually made.) Republican donors and party leaders began buzzing about making Pence the nominee and drafting Condoleezza Rice as his running mate.\n\nAmid the chaos, Trump convened a meeting of his top advisers in his Manhattan penthouse. He went around the room and asked each person for his damage assessment. Priebus bluntly told Trump he could either drop out immediately or lose in a historic landslide. According to someone who was present, Priebus added that Pence and Rice were \"ready to step in.\" (An aide to the vice president denied that Pence sent Trump a letter and that he ever talked with the RNC about becoming the nominee. Priebus did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nThe furtive plotting, several sources told me, was not just an act of political opportunism for Pence. He was genuinely shocked by the Access Hollywood tape. In the short time they'd known each other, Trump had made an effort to convince Pence that-beneath all the made-for-TV bluster and bravado-he was a good-hearted man with faith in God. On the night of the vice-presidential debate, for example, Trump had left a voicemail letting Pence know that he'd just said a prayer for him. The couple was appalled by the video, however. Karen in particular was \"disgusted,\" says a former campaign aide. \"She finds him reprehensible-just totally vile.\"\n\nYet Pence might also have thought he glimpsed something divine in that moment of political upheaval-a parting of the seas, God's hand reaching down to make his will known. Marc Short told me that in moments of need, Pence turns to a favorite passage in Jeremiah: \"For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\" Short said, \"Mike believes strongly in the sovereignty of God, and knowing that the Lord has a plan for him.\"\n\nWhatever God had planned for Mike Pence, however, it was not to make him the Republican nominee that weekend. Trump proved defiant in the face of pressure from party leaders. \"They thought they were going to be able to get him to drop out before the second debate,\" said a former campaign aide. \"Little did they know, he has no shame.\" Indeed, two days after the tape was released, Trump showed up in St. Louis for the debate with a group of Bill Clinton accusers in tow, ranting about how Hillary's husband had done things to women that were far worse than his own \"locker-room talk.\" The whole thing was a circus-and it worked. By the time Trump left St. Louis, he had, in pundit-speak, \"stopped the bleeding,\" and by the next day, Pence was back on the stump. The campaign stabilized. The race tightened. And on the night of November 8, 2016, Pence found himself standing on a ballroom stage in Midtown Manhattan-silently, obediently, servant-leaderly-while Trump delivered the unlikeliest of victory speeches.\n\nBack in Indiana, Pence's Trump apologia on the campaign trail surprised those who knew him. In political circles, there had been a widespread, bipartisan recognition that Pence was a decent man with a genuine devotion to his faith. But after watching him in 2016, many told me, they believed Pence had sold out.\n\nScott Pelath, the Democratic minority leader in the Indiana House of Representatives, said that watching Pence vouch for Trump made him sad. \"Ah, Mike,\" he sighed. \"Ambition got the best of him.\" It's an impression that even some of Pence's oldest friends and allies privately share. As one former adviser marveled, \"The number of compromises he made to get this job, when you think about it, is pretty staggering.\"\n\nOf course, Pence is far from the only conservative Christian to be accused of having sold his soul. Trump's early evangelical supporters were a motley crew of televangelists and prosperity preachers, and they have been rewarded with outsize influence in the White House. Pastor Ralph Drollinger, for example, caught Trump's attention in December 2015, when he said in a radio interview, \"America's in such desperate straits-especially economically-that if we don't have almost a benevolent dictator to turn things around, I just don't think it's gonna happen through our governance system.\" Now Drollinger runs a weekly Bible study in the West Wing.\n\nBut the president has also enjoyed overwhelming support from rank-and-file conservative Christians. He won an astonishing 81 percent of white evangelicals' votes, more than any Republican presidential candidate on record. And while his national approval rating hovers below 40 percent, poll after poll finds his approval rating among white evangelicals in the high 60s. The fact that such an ungodly president could retain a firm grip on the religious right has been the source of much soul-searching-and theological debate-within the movement.\n\nOn one side, there are those who argue that good Christians are obligated to support any leader, no matter how personally wicked he may be, who stands up for religious freedom and fights sinful practices such as abortion. Richard Land told me that those who withhold their support from Trump because they're uncomfortable with his moral failings will \"become morally accountable for letting the greater evil prevail.\"\n\nOn the other side of the debate is a smaller group that believes the Christians allying themselves with Trump are putting the entire evangelical movement at risk. Russell Moore, of the Southern Baptist Convention, has made this case forcefully. In a New York Times op-ed in September 2015 , Moore wrote that for evangelicals to embrace Trump \"would mean that we've decided to join the other side of the culture war, that image and celebrity and money and power and social Darwinist 'winning' trump the conservation of moral principles and a just society.\"\n\nMoore and others worry that conservative Christians' support for Trump has already begun to warp their ideals. Consider just one data point: In 2011, a poll by the Public Religion Research Institute found that only 30 percent of white evangelicals believed \"an elected official who commits an immoral act in their personal life can still behave ethically and fulfill their duties in their public and professional life.\" By 2016, that number had risen to 72 percent. \"This is really a sea change in evangelical ethics,\" Robert P. Jones, the head of the institute and the author of The End of White Christian America , told me. \"They have moved to an ends-justifies-the means style of politics that would have been unimaginable before this last campaign.\"\n\nBut even as the debate rages on, there is one thing virtually all conservative Christians seem to agree on: Mike Pence. \"He's an incredibly popular figure,\" Moore told me. \"Evangelicals who disagree about all sorts of things still respect Mike Pence. Regardless of how they voted or what they think about Trump, they feel a sense of identification with him, and trust in him.\"\n\nSome prominent evangelicals have gone even further to describe Pence's role-reverently invoking biblical heroes who aligned themselves with flawed worldly leaders to do God's will. One pastor compared Pence to Mordechai, who ascended to the right hand of a Persian king known for throwing lavish parties and discarding his wife after she refused to appear naked in front of his friends. Pence has also drawn comparisons to Daniel-who served a procession of godless rulers-and to Joseph of Egypt, the valiant servant of God who won the favor of an impetuous pharaoh known for throwing servants in prison when they offended him.\n\nPastor Mark Burns-a South Carolina televangelist who was among the first to sign on as a faith adviser to Trump-told me Pence's role in the administration is like that of Jesus, who once miraculously calmed a storm that was threatening to sink the boat on which he was traveling with his disciples. (Burns, who stressed that he was not equating Pence with the Savior, said Trump is represented in this analogy by one of Jesus's more \"foulmouthed\" apostles.) \"Mike Pence is there praying over the White House every day,\" Burns said. And in this tempestuous political climate, the success of Trump's presidency may depend on those intercessions. \"It takes somebody who knows when you're headed toward a storm to be there praying for you.\"\n\nThe religious right began reaping the rewards of Trump's victory almost immediately, when the president-elect put Pence in charge of the transition. Given wide latitude on staffing decisions, Pence promptly set about filling the federal government with like-minded allies. Of the 15 Cabinet secretaries Trump picked at the start of his presidency, eight were evangelicals. It was, gushed Ted Cruz, \"the most conservative Cabinet in decades.\" Pence also reportedly played a key role in getting Neil Gorsuch nominated to the Supreme Court.\n\nPence understood the price of his influence. To keep Trump's ear required frequent public performances of loyalty and submission-and Pence made certain his inner circle knew that enduring such indignities was part of the job. Once, while interviewing a prospective adviser during the transition, Pence cleared the room so they could speak privately. \"Look, I'm in a difficult position here,\" Pence said, according to someone familiar with the meeting. \"I'm going to have to 100 percent defend everything the president says. Is that something you're going to be able to do if you're on my staff?\" (An aide to Pence denied this account.)\n\nTrump does not always reciprocate this respect. Around the White House, he has been known to make fun of Pence for his religiosity. As Mayer reported in The New Yorker , he has greeted guests who recently met with Pence by asking, \"Did Mike make you pray?\" During a conversation with a legal scholar about gay rights, Trump gestured toward his vice president and joked, \"Don't ask that guy-he wants to hang them all!\"\n\nWhen I asked Marc Short, who now serves as the White House director of legislative affairs, about these exchanges, he dismissed them as good-natured razzing between friends. \"I think it's fun for him to tease Mike,\" Short told me, \"but at the same time, the president respects him.\" Not everyone is so sure. When it was reported last January that the Pences would be moving some of their family pets-which include two cats, a rabbit, and a snake-into the Naval Observatory, Trump ridiculed the menagerie to his secretary, according to a longtime adviser. \"He was embarrassed by it; he thought it was so low class,\" says the adviser. \"He thinks the Pences are yokels.\"\n\nPence's forbearance hasn't always yielded concrete policy victories for the Christian right, a fact that was highlighted during a skirmish over religious freedom early in the Trump administration. Social conservatives had been lobbying the president to issue a sweeping executive order aimed at carving out protections for religious organizations and individuals opposed to same-sex marriage, premarital sex, abortion, and transgender rights. The proposed order was fairly radical, but proponents argued that it would strike a crucial blow against the militant secularists trying to drive the faithful out of the public square. At first, Pence's office reportedly worked to build support for the executive order inside the White House-but the effort was torpedoed when a draft was leaked to The Nation magazine, which warned that signing it would \"legalize discrimination.\" There proceeded a noisy backlash from the left, and hasty backpedaling by the White House. By the time Trump got around to signing the order, several months later, it was dramatically watered down.\n\nConservatives blamed Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner for gutting the order. But according to one Trump associate with knowledge of the debate, Pence barely put up a fight. The surrender infuriated Steve Bannon, who was then serving as the chief White House strategist. \"Bannon wanted to fight for it,\" says the Trump associate, \"and he was really unimpressed that Pence wouldn't do anything.\" But perhaps Pence was playing the long game-weighing the risks of taking on Trump's kids, and deciding to stand down in the interest of preserving his relationship with the president. Pence, after all, had his future to think about.\n\nIn an embattled White House, the question of the vice president's ambition for higher office is radioactive. When The New York Times reported last summer that Pence appeared to be laying the groundwork for a 2020 presidential bid, he denied the \"disgraceful and offensive\" story with theatrical force. But Pence has shown that his next move is never far from his mind-and he's hardly the only one weighing the possibilities. One senior GOP Senate aide told me that pundits miss the point when they speculate about what kind of scandal it would take for the president to face a serious defection from lawmakers of his own party. \"It's not a matter of when Republicans are ready to turn on Trump,\" the aide said. \"It's about when they decide they're ready for President Pence.\"\n\nWhat would a Pence presidency look like? To a conservative evangelical, it could mean a glorious return to the Christian values upon which America was founded. To a secular liberal, it might look more like a descent into the dystopia of The Handmaid's Tale . Already, in some quarters on the left, it has become fashionable to fret that Pence's fundamentalist faith and comparative political savvy would make him an even more \"dangerous\" president than Trump. He has been branded a \"theocrat\" and a \"Christian supremacist.\"\n\nThere is, of course, nothing inherently scary or disqualifying about an elected leader who seeks wisdom in scripture and solace in prayer. What critics should worry about is not that Pence believes in God, but that he seems so certain God believes in him. What happens when manifest destiny replaces humility, and the line between faith and hubris blurs? What unseemly compromises get made? What means become tolerable in pursuit of an end?\n\nOn the night of May 3, 2017, members of the president's evangelical advisory board arrived for a private dinner at the White House. They were scheduled to appear the next day in the Rose Garden to cheer Trump on as he signed an executive order most of them considered a disappointment. Instead of creating the far-reaching protections for believers that they had been hoping for, Trump's order merely made it easier for pastors to voice political opinions from the pulpit-a conspicuously self-serving take on religious freedom. Some social conservatives were already voicing their discontent. Ryan Anderson, a scholar at the Heritage Foundation, called the order \"woefully inadequate\"; David French, a writer for National Review , dismissed it as a \"sop to the gullible.\"\n\nBut inside the West Wing, the president's faith advisers were getting the full Trump experience. After dining on shrimp scampi and braised short ribs in the Blue Room, they were treated to a tour of the private residence. Trump led them onto the Truman Balcony, and waved off Secret Service agents who tried to stop them from taking pictures. The faith leaders pulled out their smartphones and snapped selfies, intoxicated by the VIP treatment. \"Mr. President,\" Robert Jeffress, the pastor of the First Baptist Church in Dallas, said at one point, \"we're going to be your most loyal friends. We're going to be your enthusiastic supporters. And we thank God every day that you're the president of the United States.\"\n\nFor many of the attendees, though, the most memorable moment came when Pence stood to speak. \"I've been with [Trump] alone in the room when the decisions are made. He and I have prayed together,\" Pence said. \"This is somebody who shares our views, shares our values, shares our beliefs.\" Pence didn't waste time touting his own credentials. With this crowd, he didn't need to. Instead, as always, he lavished praise on the president."

      "text": "Mike Pence Is an American Hero\n\nDemocrats should honor the Republican who's trying to end Trumpism.\n\nAt the January 6 Committee hearings this week, there is likely to be evidence of gross misbehavior-bordering on sedition-from President Donald Trump and his confederates. The object of the hearings is to hold these bad actors to account and propose systemic reforms to prevent another insurrection.\n\nHere is another idea the committee might consider: Take a moment to praise Mike Pence. Congress can name a building in his honor. The House and Senate could propose nonpartisan resolutions recognizing Pence for his service to democracy. And then Joe Biden could give Pence the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Because while Pence may not be the hero you or I might have wanted, he was the hero America needed.\n\nPence has long been caricatured as a comically loyal stooge standing behind the president with befuddlement on his face and a fly on his head. Yet Pence did more to protect democracy-both on January 6 and since-than any other person inside the Trump administration. Or any Republican not named Liz Cheney or Adam Kinzinger.\n\nRead: Mike Pence has nowhere to go\n\nRecall that Trump had demanded that Pence refuse to count the Electoral College votes and certify the election at the Joint Session of Congress that was to formalize the outcome of the 2020 election. When Pence informed him that this was not legally permissible, Bob Woodward and Robert Costa reported , the president told him, \"You can do this. I don't want to be your friend anymore if you don't do this.\"\n\nPence knew what the president's mafioso talk meant. Maggie Haberman writes that on January 5, Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, called the Secret Service to inform them that \"the president was going to turn publicly against the vice president, and there could be a security risk to Mr. Pence because of it.\"\n\nWhich is exactly what happened. At Trump's January 6 rally on the Mall, the president told his audience, \"You're never going to take back our country with weakness,\" and said he hoped Pence would \"do the right thing\" by not certifying the election. After the mob stormed the Capitol, Trump tweeted, \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.\"\n\nAround this same time, some of Trump's supporters erected a gallows-an actual hanging station-outside the Capitol building. Other Trump supporters attacked police, breached the building, and roamed the halls chanting, \"Hang Mike Pence.\"\n\nWhether Pence knew these details at the time remains unclear-he was being hustled out of harm's way by the Secret Service. Pence was probably unaware that one mile away, as Trump was watching the scene on television, the president said, two witnesses reportedly told the Committee , \"something to the effect of, maybe Mr. Pence should be hung.\"\n\nPer Haberman's reporting, the Secret Service wanted to evacuate Pence from the Capitol, but the vice president refused to leave, because he judged that doing so would weaken our democracy and give Trump and his violent followers a victory. So he stayed in an underground loading dock until it was safe for him to return to the Joint Session and formalize Joe Biden's victory.\n\nThis extraordinary series of events added up to a constitutional crisis. The crisis was set in motion by President Trump and then abetted by Republicans in the House and Senate who voted to reject electors. Had Pence done what the president of the United States and his party's members in Congress demanded he do, it's not clear what would have happened next.\n\nFrom the January/February 2018 issue: God's plan for Mike Pence\n\nPence single-handedly averted the next catastrophe, and then tried to restore some sense of normal functioning to our democracy. On January 20, Pence returned to the Capitol. The trumpets played a fanfare; he and his wife, Karen, were announced, and they walked down the red carpet together, holding hands. The people assembled to witness the inauguration of Joe Biden clapped politely. When Kamala Harris made her entrance, Pence applauded her in turn.\n\nIn the intervening months, Pence has tried, however ineffectually, to push back against the most virulent aspects of the Trump administration.\n\nHe should have been much more aggressive in repudiating Trump's Big Lie about the 2020 election. But attending the inauguration-something the outgoing president refused to do-was an implicit and public acknowledgment of Biden's victory. Last February, Pence gave a speech in which he said that Trump was \"wrong\" about the election. He also countered the revisionist view of January 6 as being a peaceful protest by very fine people who are now political prisoners: Pence called it \"a dark day\" and framed the question as being about the survival of democracy. \"The truth is there's more at stake than our party or our political fortunes,\" he said. \"If we lose faith in the Constitution, we won't just lose elections-we'll lose our country.\"\n\nIn April, Pence gave a pedestrian political speech at the University of Virginia but detoured to pay his respects at the memorial to Heather Heyer, who was killed in August 2017 during the white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville.\n\nThe story of Mike Pence is the negative space in the January 6 Committee investigation. As more details about the machinations of John Eastman, Mark Meadows, Ted Cruz, and others emerge, Pence's own actions are ever present in the background. Without him, we might not have this committee. Without him, we might not even have this republic.\n\nAt some point, the January 6 Committee will complete its work and issue a report, which will probably be heavy on malefactors who attempted to overturn our democracy. Hopefully it will also have recommendations on how to avoid another January 6.\n\nBut the report should reserve some space to praise Mike Pence, the man who stood in the breach. And when the committee has finished its work, congressional Democrats should honor Pence.\n\nPence's attempt to salvage the Republican Party won't succeed. It will fail not because of any intrinsic problem with the party itself-political parties are merely vessels for the will of the people-but because the problem with the Republican Party is Republican voters. They're the ones who wanted Trump. They're the ones who approve of January 6 . They're the ones who insist that Trump actually won in 2020 . They're the ones who are clamoring to nominate him again in 2024 .\n\nRead: Pence 2024?\n\nRepublican voters view all of the terrible outcomes from the first Trump administration-the political violence, the white nationalism, the fiscal irresponsibility, the COVID death tolls-not as bugs but as features. This is what they want.\n\nBut political parties are not monoliths. About one-third of Republican voters have a relatively clear-eyed view of what happened on January 6. About one-fifth of Republican voters know that Joe Biden won a sacred landslide victory over Trump in 2020. About one in 20 Republican voters prefers Pence to Trump for 2024.\n\nDemocrats ought to be trying to pry these voters away from the Republican Party in the event that Trump runs again. By making it clear that the Democratic Party appreciates Mike Pence as a hero of democracy-and that GOP lawmakers do not-they might just persuade a small but crucial percentage of these Pence Republicans to cross over in 2024."

      "text": "Mike Pence Is Warning Us About Trump\n\nBut we're too complacent to hear it.\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nA former vice president of the United States identified a sitting president as a mortal danger. In another time, it would have been the Story of the Century. Instead, it was the Kerfuffle of the Week, and it is already dissolving away in the new media cycle.\n\nBut first, here are three new stories from The Atlantic .\n\nBroken Sycophants\n\nMike Pence stunned Washington at this weekend's annual Gridiron Club dinner and gained the attention of the media and the ire of the White House by making an offensive joke about the Cabinet member Pete Buttigieg.\n\nAt the same event, by the way, Pence affirmed that on January 6, 2021, Donald Trump-at the time, the president of the United States-endangered his life along with the lives of his family, the members and staff of Congress, and numerous law-enforcement officers. Trump did this by inciting a mob to attack the Capitol, stop our constitutional process by force, and allow him to remain in office.\n\n\"Donald Trump was wrong,\" Pence said at the white-tie event, which was attended by journalists, politicians, and other D.C. insiders. \"I had no right to overturn the election, and his reckless words endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day, and I know that history will hold Donald Trump accountable.\" He continued:\n\nWhat happened that day was a disgrace. And it mocks decency to portray it any other way. For as long as I live, I will never, ever diminish the injuries sustained, the lives lost, or the heroism of law enforcement on that tragic day.\n\nYet here we are, three days later, talking about inappropriate jokes. This is the story now? That Pence tried out a dumb gag line aimed at Buttigieg? Make no mistake, the joke was stupid and disrespectful, but perhaps we might zero in on the more important point: Pence told us something horrifying this weekend about the condition of our democracy. The national underreaction to his comments, however, is a warning that we have all become too complacent about the danger my former party now represents.\n\nLet us stipulate here that Pence is shamefully late to this criticism and has no obvious intention of going further. He had his one moment of courage, and there will be no others. My friend Neal Katyal, the former acting solicitor general, was present at the dinner, and he rightly lambasted Pence for posturing while refusing to answer a subpoena about what happened on January 6. \"There are great actors at the gridiron,\" he tweeted after the dinner. \"But no one, and I mean no one, could pretend to be [Mike Pence] with a backbone.\"\n\nNevertheless, we should not lose focus. I am still almost vertiginous at hearing a former constitutional officer of the United States government say what Pence said out loud. After all the violence, all the court cases, all the horrific videos (the stuff that will never air on Tucker Carlson's show ), and all the needless deaths, I am almost relieved that I'm still capable of being shocked. I was a boy during Watergate-I delivered the local newspaper that announced President Richard Nixon's resignation, in 1974-but that long-ago scandal now seems like a polite comedy of errors next to the conspiracy fueled by Trump's monstrous narcissism.\n\nEven before Pence's Gridiron-dinner speech, I had a conversation last week with Tom Joscelyn, one of the principal authors of the House's January 6 committee report . Joscelyn is worried , as am I, that Americans don't really yet grasp the degree to which the Republicans have been taken over by their most extreme wing. \"The American right is overrun with grievance politics now,\" he told me. \"And they've married that approach to an authoritarian movement and cult of personality\" around Trump.\n\nJoscelyn is not a man who rattles easily: He was Rudy Giuliani's senior counterterrorism adviser back in 2007, when \"America's mayor\" was gearing up to run for president. He thinks Giuliani's sad decline, in which he has become a kind of political Dorian Gray right before our eyes, is emblematic of the Republican collapse and surrender to Trump. He argues, and I agree, that Trump's opponents, especially those running against him in the GOP, are not taking this threat as seriously as they should. Trump \"puts the auto in autocrat ,\" Joscelyn said, because Trump sublimates everything to his personal needs, including his party. (I would argue that this is why Trump, despite his fascist rhetoric and Mussolini-like strutting, is incapable of the consistency and discipline required to build a truly fascist movement , but that's an argument for another day.)\n\nToday, as Joscelyn notes, the GOP has ceased to function as a normal political party. There is no consistent ideology or set of policies, no internal mechanisms to check the power of the Trump cult. Even the people who want to dislodge Trump as the leader of the party and the 2024 nominee dare not to take him on in a direct confrontation. Trump's critics are often accused of having \"Trump Derangement Syndrome,\" an irrational hatred of Trump that forces disagreement with Trump on everything, but Joscelyn rightly points out that Trump's Republican enablers are the ones who have had to betray all of their deepest beliefs merely to avoid being cast out. Trump, he says, \"broke his sycophants, not his critics.\"\n\nWhich brings us back to Pence. It might not sound like much for Pence to admit what millions of people already know, but within the Republican Party, this is about as close as you can get to open heresy; Pence's team deliberated making even this small move against Trump. Yet Pence's comments have been shrugged off by both the press and the public.\n\nTo put into perspective how numb we've become, let's do a thought experiment. Imagine, for example, if Hubert Humphrey, after the riots that broke out in 1968 at the Democratic National Convention , said later, \"Lyndon Johnson encouraged those anti-war protesters and put me and hundreds of other people in danger. History will hold President Johnson accountable.\" Those two sentences would have shaken the foundations of American democracy and changed history.\n\nBut not today. Instead, we've already moved on to whether Pence should apologize for a clumsy and offensive joke. (He should.) This, however, is the danger of complacency. What would have been a gigantic, even existential political crisis in a more virtuous and civic-minded nation is now one of many stories about Donald Trump that rush past our eyes and ears.\n\nVoters are tired, and the national media are committed to treating the GOP as a mainstream party. Trump and his coterie are counting on this exhaustion to return to national power, but so are people such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is using Trump's themes of bigotry , grievance, and cultural panic to harness that same authoritarian energy for his own purposes. Republican leaders have no intention of speaking truth-or decency-to their base, and until someone in the party of Lincoln is able to muster even the tiniest fraction of Lincoln's courage, we will indulge our complacency about the Republicans at our peril.\n\nRelated:\n\nToday's News\n\nDispatches\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nHow Not to Cover a Bank Run\n\nBy Brian Stelter\n\nOn September 17, 2008, the Financial Times reporter John Authers decided to run to the bank. In his Citi account was a recently deposited check from the sale of his London apartment. If the big banks melted down, which felt like a distinct possibility among his Wall Street sources, he would lose most of his money, because the federal deposit-insurance limit at the time was $100,000. He wanted to transfer half the balance to the Chase branch next door, just in case.\n\nWhen Authers arrived at Citi, he found \"a long queue, all well-dressed Wall Streeters,\" all clearly spooked by the crisis, all waiting to move money around. Chase was packed with bankers too. Authers had walked into a big story-but he didn't share it with readers for 10 years. The column he eventually published, titled \"In a Crisis, Sometimes You Don't Tell the Whole Story,\" was, he wrote this week, \"the most negatively received column I've ever written.\"\n\nRead the full article.\n\nMore From The Atlantic\n\nCulture Break\n\nRead.

I hope The Last of Us , which has been remarkable in every aspect, illustrates how, for many years, computer games have had plots more intricate and more involving than much of the stuff Hollywood has been cranking out now for decades. (I say this fully aware of the creativity of this year's Best Picture , Everything Everywhere All at Once . But I will remind you that it is also the 30th anniversary of The Beverly Hillbillies , a terrible movie full of great actors that I think was an early sign of American cultural exhaustion.)\n\nI have particularly high hopes-that I fear will be dashed-for Amazon Prime's upcoming Fallout series . Unlike The Last of Us , the Fallout games, set long after a global nuclear war, leaven the despair and violence of postapocalyptic survival with outrageous humor. If you've been watching Hello Tomorrow! , the Apple TV+ series that features the always excellent Billy Crudup selling lunar condos in a reimagined 1950s full of robots and floating cars-and yes, we are living in a golden age of television-you have a taste of what the world of Fallout looks like. I can only hope that Amazon's series about life after the Bomb doesn't turn out to be a bomb itself.\n\n- Tom\n\nIsabel Fattal contributed to this newsletter."

      "text": "Why Not Pence?\n\nThe former vice president might be the GOP's best bet to move past Trump and win in 2024.\n\nThe Republican Party's strongest alternative to former President Donald Trump is in trouble. Trumpy Republicans want the real thing, not an imitation. Non-Trumpy Republicans just aren't impressed. The candidate himself has yet to find a compelling message. The result is that once again, as in 2016, Trump is likely to prevail because Republicans cannot coalesce around an alternative-even though a candidate who is experienced in government, solidly conservative, and acceptable to most factions of the party is right there in front of them.\n\nI speak, of course, of former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nPence? Seriously? His polling is in the single digits. He had to scramble to get into the first Republican presidential debate. But Republicans, if they're smart, won't write him off, because he is their best bet to win in 2024 and move past Trump without splitting the party.\n\nConsider the position Republicans find themselves in. First, and most obviously, their front-running candidate is fighting four criminal prosecutions. To say that this will be a distraction for him and the party is putting it mildly. Trump may be required to attend one or more of his trials in person. Even when he is not physically present, managing his trials will be a full-time job. His campaign, his social media, and his public persona will all be consumed by his legal problems, which are not what most voters want to hear about.\n\nJonathan V. Last: The agony of Mike Pence\n\nRegardless of Trump's entanglement with the law, he is a lousy candidate. He has already lost once to Joe Biden, and nothing has changed dramatically in his favor since then. Biden has weaknesses of his own, but his flaws-his age, his lack of vision, his muddled messaging-recede into the background against Trump's chaotic volatility. He is well positioned to run another version of his 2020 front-porch campaign, emphasizing his steadiness, the strong economy, and a thousand infrastructure projects while Trump noisily defeats himself. Biden is a weak incumbent who is strong only against Trump.\n\nEven on his own terms, Trump is a bad bet. He lost the popular vote twice and drove Republican losses in 2018 and 2022. He is a turnout machine-for Democrats, who will walk over hot coals to vote against him. True, the plurality of the Republican base loves him, but many Republicans do not.\n\nFigure that roughly a third of Republicans are Only Trumpers. They adore him and will not consider anyone else for the nomination. Perhaps another third are Anybody But Trumpers, who want to put Trump in the rear-view mirror. They will jump at a plausible, electable alternative, and almost anyone in the Republican field will do.\n\nThat leaves a third group, the Open-Minded Middle. They like Trump, maybe even love him, but are worried about his electability and will consider alternatives. They don't want to see Trump bad-mouthed, but if the Republican Party were to coalesce around another candidate with a path to victory, they would rally to the cause.\n\nWhat Republicans need, then, is a candidate who can gather enough Anybody But Trumpers and Open-Minded Middlers to win the nomination and then corral enough independents and swing voters to win the general election. Who is qualified for that job?\n\nFirst, a candidate who is not Donald Trump and is not involved in multiple criminal trials. Enough said.\n\nSecond, a candidate with a reputation for probity and decency. That puts the party on high moral ground and allows it to highlight Biden's problems with his wayward son, while appealing to voters who want an honest and law-abiding president.\n\nThird, a low-risk proposition-someone who has governed at the highest levels and is ready for the White House; who has knowledge of world affairs and leaders; who has a steady temperament and can be trusted to keep the heat on Russia and not wreck NATO.\n\nFourth, a proven conservative who can plausibly sell himself as continuing the policies and appointments that conservatives admire without all the baggage and chaos that marred Trump's effectiveness.\n\nRead: The GOP primary is a field of broken dreams\n\nFifth, someone with a strong connection to the party's evangelical base. Though perhaps no one can rival Trump's cultic hold on white evangelicals, a deeply convicted Christian who has actually read the Bible and can be relied on for solid judges and conservative policies would be more than adequate from evangelicals' point of view.\n\nOnly one person checks all those boxes. No one else even comes close. The presumptive rival to Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, has no foreign-policy experience, no message except anti-wokeness, and a persona that makes Grumpy Cat seem genial. He would unify Democrats in opposition and drive them to the polls as no one other than Trump himself will do. And, as of now, he is falling to pieces.\n\nThe three anti-Trump candidates-Chris Christie, Asa Hutchinson, and Will Hurd-have no message other than being anti-Trump, and they alienate not just the party's Only Trump faction but also its Open-Minded Middle, which tunes out candidates who repudiate Trump. Former Governor and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Senator Tim Scott have governing chops and personal appeal, and they have been shrewd about keeping Trump at a distance without seeming to attack him, but they are relative newbies and unknown quantities in national politics-high-risk propositions against an incumbent. The remaining candidates flunk the plausibility test.\n\nIn the days when party insiders played a key role in choosing presidential candidates, they looked for exactly the qualities that Mike Pence exhibits: the ability to govern, to unify the party, and to win in November. From their point of view, Pence should be the obvious favorite. Though humbled by Trump's populist revolution, the party establishment still matters. It ought to be investing in Pence by talking up his chances, opening the dollar spigots, and offering support and endorsements. Party elders should see him, not DeSantis, as the logical alternative to Trump. They cannot coronate him (even if they wanted to), but they can boost his credibility now and signal that, should he do well in the early contests next year, they will quickly close ranks behind him.\n\nThe other Republican candidates should be prepared to do the same. In 2016, Trump won the nomination because too many candidates stayed in the race too long. In 2020, Biden won the presidency because most of the other candidates cleared the field for him as soon as he emerged as the front-runner. The lesson for Republicans is not rocket science. Strategic discipline-coalescing quickly around an alternative to Trump-is essential in 2024.\n\nOf course, Pence's chances depend mainly on Mike Pence. No amount of boosting can rescue him if he withers on the stump or voters simply don't want him. Still, given his many strengths, pundits and politicians have been too quick to write him off. Remember, after all, the story of John McCain in 2008. Though his campaign seemingly collapsed, he came back to win the nomination because primary voters saw that he was their most electable candidate. Much the same happened to Biden himself in 2020.\n\nThe noisiest Republicans may love Trump's abrasive style and entertainment value. But to most of the rank-and-file Republicans who show up at the polls, electability matters. On that score, Pence is far and away their strongest bet. Which is why smart Republicans should put money on him now. And if they wait too long? We know how that story ends."

      "text": "Mike Pence's Plan to Save Trump-And Himself\n\nTheir fates are wholly entwined: \"You get the Trump stink on you, it's hard to get it off.\"\n\nIn private moments, Donald Trump has told aides that he rescued Mike Pence from a potentially embarrassing defeat by pulling him out of a tough reelection bid in the 2016 Indiana governor's race and putting him on the ticket, a former White House official told me. Now it's Vice President Pence's turn to see what, if anything, he can do to rescue Trump from a more momentous loss-and keep alive a long-held ambition to win the presidency in his own right.\n\nTheir fates, at this point, are wholly entwined. Pence would have trouble winning in 2024 if voters repudiate Trump in November. Yet even if he runs after a second Trump term, he'd surely be tarnished by the rolling tragedies of 2020. For three years, Pence largely sidestepped Trump's unending dramas. Not so with the pandemic. Trump pulled Pence from the bubble wrap and plunked him into a crisis, making him the head of the coronavirus task force overwhelmed by COVID-19's relentless spread. Now Pence is forever tied to the government's botched response. And that's something he'll need to defend and explain as the current campaign ramps up, and if he ever runs for the higher office he's long prized.\n\n\"You get the Trump stink on you, it's hard to get it off,\" said the former official, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk more freely.\n\nFor the moment, Pence needs to help salvage a campaign whose prospects look bleak. Trump has made the race a referendum on him . Part of Pence's role is convincing voters that there's something in it for them. In the coming months, he will spend several days a week visiting crucial swing states, a campaign adviser told me. Pence will approach each state as if he's running to be its governor, zeroing in on local issues important to voters' daily lives, the adviser said, and he'll try to showcase the federal grants and other benefits the Trump administration has dished out. He'll also talk about the stakes in broader terms, if past speeches are a guide. At the president's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last month, Pence predicted that Joe Biden would appoint \"activist\" judges, weaken border security, and harm the economy through expanded government regulation.\n\nRead: Trump's blank vision for a second term\n\nStaff may try to recruit some surprise guests along the way, perhaps inviting former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan to join Pence on a Wisconsin bus tour, where the pair could \"tool around from Appleton to La Crosse at some point,\" the adviser told me. (Ryan, who hasn't joined Pence for past campaign stops, has feuded with Trump for years, though he's stayed on good terms with his onetime colleague Pence, a former congressman from Indiana.)\n\nIf there's an organizing theme to Pence's vice presidency, it's that he must never offend a man whose emotional antennae quiver at any slight. That means he's perennially validating a president who insists the pandemic is under control when reality screams that it's not. Privately, he is under no illusions about the crisis, people who work with him have told me. \"He never shoots the messenger,\" one member of the task force said. \"If you tell him something that the administration won't like or the president won't like, you never get the impression that he's saying, 'Enough of that, let's move on to the next topic.' He hears you out.\" (Trump, meanwhile, has turned on the government's top infectious-disease expert, Anthony Fauci, telling an interviewer this week that he disagrees with Fauci's warnings about the virus and believes \"we are in a good place.\")\n\nPence knows it's important to wear masks; he grasps that the virus is a serious public-health threat; and he appreciates the governors who have played a prominent role in combatting the disease, the people who've worked with him told me. One governor's office sent me notes of a private conference call last month with Pence and governors from both parties. Pence delivered a more supportive message than Americans typically hear from Trump, who has scolded some Democratic governors for failing to \"liberate\" their states. The notes show Pence saying, \"We're with you,\" while commending states that have \"taken prudent steps to pause reopening\" because of the spike in new infections.\n\nIn public, Pence takes pains to ensure that he and the president are aligned. On June 26, at the task force's first public briefing in two months, he delivered the Trumpian message that \"truly remarkable progress\" had been made fighting the coronavirus, despite a worrisome rise in cases in dozens of states.\n\nI asked the task-force member why, at times, Pence hasn't worn a mask in public to model responsible behavior. Is it because he doesn't want Trump to see and take umbrage? \"That's the only reason,\" this person said. \"He'll wear it in a microsecond. He doesn't want to egregiously look like he's opposing the president.\" (Asked about Pence's mask-wearing message, John Fea, a historian and the author of Believe Me: The Evangelical Road to Donald Trump , referenced Pence's Christian identity: \"You can't apply these scriptural ideas about loving your neighbor until you first understand that actually wearing a mask is to protect your neighbor.\")\n\nEven if he's mirrored the president in his public comments about the virus, Pence will campaign in his own style. Normally, vice-presidential nominees are the ones who level the most pointed attacks, while presidents try to be the statesmen. Here, the roles are reversed. Trump is only too happy to stick nicknames on Biden and question his mental capacity, while Pence-avoiding visceral attacks-talks policy and draws more substantive contrasts with Biden's record.\n\nWhether anyone's listening to what Pence has to say is another matter. The bottom half of the ticket seldom decides presidential races. And, in any case, Pence is defending a record that looks more damaged by the day. The pandemic is getting worse, not better. Millions of people have lost their jobs. Three-quarters of voters believe that the country is on the wrong track.\n\nBy some measures, Pence's undimmed loyalty to Trump has paid off. He's one of the few senior officials whom Trump hasn't marginalized and, partly as a consequence, his presidential aspirations are still within reach. He considered jumping into the 2012 presidential race when he was in the House, but instead chose a different office. \"I counseled him: Don't run for president now, run for governor,\" says former Vice President Dan Quayle, who viewed the Indiana governor's office as a more viable springboard to the presidency. Quayle, Pence's friend for more than 30 years, thinks he'll run for president four years from now, though he says they haven't spoken about it. \"He's been an effective and loyal vice president to Donald Trump,\" Quayle says. \"I would think he'd get a lot of credit for that. But it's not automatic.\" (One White House official told me that Pence is \"entirely focused on helping this ticket win in November 2020.\")\n\nRead: When a vice president becomes a threat\n\nIf he runs in 2024, Pence will need to stay in Trump's favor. And that's no easy thing. His allegiance hasn't stopped Trump from questioning his value. Inside the White House, Trump has mused about whether Pence pulls in enough voters beyond Christian conservatives, the ex-White House official told me. In reply, aides would tell Trump: \"Be careful, he brought an awful lot of votes your way and if you're seen to be turning your back on the evangelicals, you may be in trouble,\" this person said. (The White House spokesman Judd Deere told me in a statement that \"any suggestion that President Trump does not appreciate and value Vice President Pence's advice, experience, and skill is simply false and complete fabrication.\")\n\nHow exactly Pence stays on Trump's right side is something of a mystery. Obsequiousness is surely part of it. Last year, Pence gave a speech at the Munich Security Conference and in the course of the half-hour address he mentioned the president's name 30 times-once per minute. (In his own half-hour speech at the same conference in 2015, then-Vice President Biden mentioned his boss, Barack Obama, just one time.) A European official who attended Pence's speech told me that he was approached later by a Chinese diplomat who confided that the performance had reminded him of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution, \"where you had to mention the name of the 'Great Leader' every third sentence.\"\n\n\"There's no more loyal person who truly believes in President Donald Trump and all his accomplishments than Mike Pence,\" said one senior Trump-administration aide, when I asked about Pence's unstinting praise.\n\nEven some senior White House officials have seemed unsure of what goes on between the pair when they talk alone. Pence tends to be reticent in larger staff meetings, former aides have told me. John Bolton, the president's former national security adviser, writes in his new book, The Room Where It Happened , that he suspected Pence \"did much of his best work in private conversations with Trump.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail this summer and fall, Pence could face pressure to speak more openly about the administration's pandemic response and his own role leading the task force. That pressure will be inescapable if he runs for president. \"Trump's legacy, which doesn't look particularly good at this point, will certainly splash hard onto Pence,\" Charlie Dent, a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania, told me.\n\nAt least one of his former associates has echoed that warning. After Pence won an Indiana congressional race in 2000, he would meet with Rob Schenck, an evangelical minister, and pray and read scripture together. Schenck sees two warring and unresolved dimensions of Pence's personality, ambition and altruism, and says that one seems to be crowding out the other. \"If he were to seek pastoral counseling from me, I would say to him, 'Brother Mike, Jesus commands you to love your neighbor, not love your boss,'\" says Schenck, who plans to vote for Biden, the first Democrat he's supported in a presidential race since Jimmy Carter in 1976. \"That's not God's command.\"\n\nA couple of years ago, Schenck sent a letter to Pence after seeing him at a swearing-in ceremony for Sam Brownback, the administration's ambassador for international religious freedom. In the letter, Schenck cited the commandment that warns against bearing false witness. \"I conveyed in the letter that that was one of the greatest failures of this administration: truth-telling,\" Schenck told me. \"I was trying to say to him, 'You need to be a truth-teller.'\" He never got a reply."

      "text": "Mike Pence Owes the Country an Explanation\n\nThe constitutional authority to call out the military is vested in the president of the United States. So what was Pence doing on January 6?\n\nOn January 6, 2021, from a parking garage under the Capitol Visitor Center, then-Vice President Mike Pence ordered the military to defend the Capitol against a violent insurrection. According to a taped deposition of General Mark Milley , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Pence \"issued very explicit, very direct, unambiguous orders\" to him and Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller: \" Get the military down here. Get the Guard here. Put down this situation .\"\n\nThis is a problem-one that has been overshadowed by the larger events of January 6 . The constitutional authority to call out the military to defend the Capitol is vested in the president of the United States, not in the vice president. Why did Pence seize constitutional authority that wasn't his? The country needs answers to this question, and it needs them from Pence, not from his chief of staff or his counsel .\n\nIn ordinary circumstances, Pence's actions would be unconstitutional. Indeed, a vice president who usurped the president's constitutional authority, and the Cabinet and military officers who followed his orders, could be committing an impeachable offense. But these were no ordinary circumstances: With Pence huddled in a secure location protected by his security detail, his actions were almost certainly justified.\n\nRead: The January 6 Committee's most damning revelation yet\n\nConstitutional government depends on following the law, but emergency circumstances may provide for what the 17th-century political philosopher John Locke called prerogative power: power that in ordinary circumstances is unlawful, but that in extraordinary circumstances is warranted. There is a long-standing debate about whether the public should view such power as constitutional because necessary or as extra-constitutional but justified. In \"Federalist No. 23,\" Alexander Hamilton argued that people should see emergency power as constitutional because \"the circumstances that endanger the safety of nations are infinite.\" The Constitution, Hamilton insisted, must provide the lawful power for its preservation.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Jefferson argued that people ought to recognize that emergency power is extra-constitutional but justified. As Jefferson famously wrote in a letter to John B. Colvin-the author of the early-19th-century book The Magistrate's Guide, and Citizen's Counsellor , who was then writing about Aaron Burr's treason-\"A strict observance of the written laws is doubtless one of the highest duties of a good citizen: but it is not the highest . The laws of necessity, of self-preservation, of saving our country when in danger, are of higher obligation.\" For Jefferson, preserving the nation was more important than \"a scrupulous adherence to written law.\"\n\nYet, as Jefferson also insisted, the officer who exercises emergency power must justify his actions to \"his fellow citizens generally.\" For Jefferson, \"the good officer\" must throw \"himself on the justice of his country and the rectitude of his motives.\" Whether one sees emergency power from the perspective of Hamilton (constitutional because necessary) or Jefferson (extra-constitutional but justified), it is crucial that the officer who exercises emergency power justify himself to the public. The public must know what constitutional ends the officer thought he was serving and why the circumstances commanded extraordinary action. But Pence has retreated to silence, allowing some proxies to speak for him while ducking the crucial constitutional questions that surround his actions on January 6.\n\nDid Pence think he was acting to preserve the constitutional transfer of power and save the country when it was in danger? Did Pence think that President Donald Trump was threatening the peaceful transfer of power? General Milley and those who followed Pence's commands seem to think this. But the public should not have to guess at Pence's motives-he has a constitutional obligation to explain why he thought the nation was in peril and how he acted to obviate that peril.\n\nRead: Mike Pence is trying to send a message\n\nAmerican history is replete with claims to emergency power. Whether people think they are justified depends on the circumstances and how they are attached to larger constitutional ends.\n\nIn the opening months of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus, called up state militias, and blocked southern ports and harbors. Critics thought many of these actions unconstitutional and unjustified. Lincoln insisted that they were necessary to preserve constitutional ends and therefore justified. In a special message to Congress on July 4, 1861, Lincoln explained his actions to the people and Congress, while also asking for congressional approval. Squarely taking up the question of extra-constitutional action, Lincoln asked with a rhetorical flourish, \"Are all the laws but one to go unexecuted, and the Government itself go to pieces lest that one be violated? Even in such a case, would not the official oath be broken if the Government should be overthrown when it was believed that disregarding the single law would tend to preserve it?\"\n\nSimilarly, on 9/11, just after two hijacked civilian planes were flown into the World Trade Center, Vice President Dick Cheney, from a secure location in Washington, D.C., acted to prevent further attacks on the United States and keep the government operational under emergency conditions while President George W. Bush was on Air Force One. (With so many unknowns, the Secret Service thought Bush was safest aboard Air Force One rather than in D.C.) While there is dispute over whether Cheney issued the order before or after authorization from Bush, Cheney did ask Bush to authorize him to order the military targeting of civilian planes if necessary , as communications aboard Air Force One were spotty. Bush gave the authorization, which happily did not need to be carried out.\n\nAmericans can understand why Cheney exercised such power. They can understand why it was justified. Cheney was not grabbing power for himself, but issuing a truly awful order that was seen as necessary to prevent further casualties and, especially, an attack on the White House and Congress. People also understand that Cheney asked the president for authorization because Bush was unable to discharge his duties.\n\nIn contrast, Pence has given us no justification for or explanation of why he seized constitutional authority that was not lawfully his. Article II of the Constitution provides that in the event of the president's removal, resignation, death, or \"inability to discharge the powers and duties\" of the office, those powers devolve on the vice president. If Pence thought Trump was unable or unwilling to discharge the constitutional powers and duties of his office, that informs the constitutional analysis of his decision. The formal constitutional mechanism for suspending such a president is by way of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. It provides that the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet may convey to Congress a written declaration of the president's inability, allowing the vice president to assume those powers as acting president.\n\nGiven the circumstances, following the formal terms of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment was nearly impossible. With the Capitol under siege, Pence's actions were probably justified. We can surmise that he sought to protect the lives of the people in Congress and to ensure that he remained at the Capitol to officially preside over the counting of electoral votes. But Pence himself should explain to America why he feared for those in Congress, why he would not leave with the Secret Service, and why the sitting president was unable to carry out his duties. The president, after all, was not incapacitated as far as we know.\n\nJustifying Pence's actions turns almost entirely on Trump's state of mind both before and on January 6-something Pence is uniquely situated to speak to. We can guess much of what Pence would say. Still, his explanation will help us better understand the events that led to that day. And it will very likely require him to explain that he acted to thwart a sitting president's unlawful attempt to stay in power.\n\nIn retreating to silence, Pence is acting to preserve his own interests, not the country's. One assumes that he does not want to explain why he used emergency power because it will implicate Trump-and doing so will make Pence unpopular with Republicans. This is the sort of self-serving use of authority that makes emergency power so dangerous.\n\nTo put it plainly: Pence either acted extra-constitutionally to preserve the constitutional transfer of power or unlawfully seized power from a sitting president who was acting in accord with his constitutional responsibilities. Pence is trying to have the best of both options, but those two components don't square. The January 6 committee should force his hand."

The president said he was imposing a baseline 10 percent tax on imports from all countries, with higher rates of up to 49 percent applied to products from about 60 countries.\n\nThe Trump Tariff Tax is the largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history. These Tariffs are nearly 10x the size of those imposed during the Trump-Pence Administration and will cost American families over $3,500 per year. Check Out\"Spoiling America's Golden Age\" @AmericanFreedom 👇 pic.twitter.com/2NghyDc8c1\n\nBut according to a recent Fox News poll, 69 percent of respondents thought tariffs would make the products they buy more expensive. That 69 percent was right, Pence said in separate post .\n\nIn response to criticism, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick -who over the past few months has reportedly been pushing Trump to impose more and more aggressive tariffs, even as the likelihood of recession grows-accused Pence of being \"bitter.\"\n\n\"These tariffs are the definition of America First, which is a concept he doesn't understand,\" Lutnick wrote in a post on X .\n\nRepublican Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio told CNN's Kaitlan Collins that \"career politicians\" like Pence \"were part of the problem\" and \"did nothing for decades while our industrial sector was gutted.\"\n\nMike Pence is just bitter. These tariffs are the definition of America First, which is a concept he doesn't understand. https://t.co/tpQR4XfS84\n\nThe comments on Pence's post were also full of MAGA diehards saying Pence needed to \" re-evaluate his loyalties \" and asking when he \" became a Democrat .\"\n\n\"Dude we all rejected you,\" MAGA influencer Michael J. Morrison wrote. \"You don't need to keep proving us right.\"\n\nDude we all rejected you . You don't need to keep proving us right.\n\nTrump has labeled the new duties \"reciprocal tariffs\" and claimed they were based on the tariffs that other countries charge on U.S. products. Financial journalists have calculated that they're based on the trade deficits between the U.S. and other countries.\n\nStocks plunged in after-hours trading as investors recoiled at Trump's move, which threatened to upend the global economic order and spark broader trade wars.\n\n\"This just seems like the president having his own sort of school of economics that's different from everybody else,\" said Steve Liesman , CNBC's s enior economics reporter, after the tariffs were announced.\n\nGot a tip?

The indictment claims Trump deliberately excluded his White House counsel from the meeting because lawyers had already pushed back on the idea.\n\n\"Bottom line ― won every state by 100,000s of votes,\" Trump said at the time, according to Pence.\n\nThen, in a private meeting between the pair on Jan. 5, Trump became \"frustrated and told the Vice President that the Defendant would have to publicly criticize him.\"\n\nThe next day, Trump eventually did just that during a speech at the Ellipse in Washington.\n\nThe indictment also notes how a large crowd of Trump's supporters chanted \"Hang Mike Pence!\" and \"Traitor Pence!\" while they approached the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday night, Pence said \"today's indictment serves as an important reminder: anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be the President of the United States.\"\n\nPence added he will \"have more to say\" after reviewing the indictment, echoing special counsel Jack Smith's earlier comments Tuesday night that Trump is \"entitled to the presumption of innocence.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence \"could end up being the most important witness\" in the federal Jan. 6 case, @costareports reports. \"This indictment says Pence took contemporaneous notes.\" \"He was the recipient of maximum pressure...according to the indictment,\" @majorcbs adds. pic.twitter.com/1pVcALnNQf\n\nCBS News' Robert Costa described Pence on the air as a \"central, crucial key witness in this investigation,\" adding \"he could end up being the most important witness in this case.\"\n\n\"He can speak to possible criminal intent. By Pence detailing what Trump said... Pence is someone who was weaponized at the end of the presidency for Trump, and to have him cooperating with the investigation gives the special counsel an eyewitness account who is not a lawyer or some Trump functionary.\"\n\nNight Editor\n\nmatt.young@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Mike Pence: history will hold Donald Trump accountable over Capitol attack\n\nFormer vice-president, speaking at Gridiron dinner, says it 'mocks decency' to portray January 6 as anything other than a 'disgrace'\n\nMike Pence has offered a rebuke of his one-time boss Donald Trump , saying history will hold the former president accountable for his role in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.\n\nPence, then vice-president, was in the Capitol when thousands of Trump supporters breached the building in an attempt to stop Congress certifying the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost to Joe Biden.\n\nAs Senate president, Pence presided over the ceremonial task of approving the votes of the electoral college.\n\nThroughout the siege, Trump sent several tweets, one calling on Republicans to \"fight\" and others making false claims of voter fraud. He also criticised Pence for certifying the results.\n\nSome rioters chanted \"Hang Mike Pence\". A makeshift gallows was erected outside. Pence was spirited to safety by Secret Service agents.\n\nOn Saturday at the Gridiron dinner in Washington, Pence told journalists and their guests: \"President Trump was wrong. I had no right to overturn the election, and his reckless words endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day, and I know that history will hold Donald Trump accountable.\"\n\nPence is now considering a run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 - against Trump, the clear leader in polling.\n\nPence rarely addressed January 6 in the months after the riot but he has now upped his criticism of the rioters and Trump. In a memoir released in November he accused Trump of endangering his family.\n\n\"What happened that day was a disgrace,\" Pence told the Gridiron audience. \"And it mocks decency to portray it any other way. For as long as I live, I will never, ever diminish the injuries sustained, the lives lost, or the heroism of law enforcement on that tragic day.\"\n\nA Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPence's remarks came a few days after the Fox News host Tucker Carlson aired highly selective, misleading security footage of the Capitol attack, in an attempt to claim many rioters were \"orderly\".\n\nCarlson's depiction was sharply criticised by Democrats and Senate Republicans. Many other Republicans, particularly in the House of Representatives, shrugged off the episode.\n\nOn Sunday, a relatively moderate House Republican was asked if Pence was right to say history would hold Trump accountable for January 6. Nancy Mace, from South Carolina, sidestepped the question.\n\n\"I see this in two parts,\" she told CNN's State of the Union. \"I think both sides are really struggling, looking at the nomination process. You've got some on the left that don't want Biden to run, you've got those on the right that don't want [Trump] to run.\n\n\"You know, a lot of folks on both sides keep bringing up January 6, and it's keeping us from moving our country forward.\"\n\nMace was not among the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over the Capitol attack, making Trump's second impeachment the most bipartisan in US history.\n\nNonetheless, she also saluted her own success in defeating a challenger endorsed by Trump last year, and said Republicans should unite behind a candidate \"who can win the White House\".\n\nAsked again if Trump would be held accountable, Mace said: \"He is one of the only candidates in right now ... we have a long way to go for additional candidates to jump in and see how the field lays out.\"\n\nAsked if the Republican House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, was right to have released more than 40,000 hours of Capitol security footage to Carlson - a decision for which McCarthy has faced fierce criticism - Mace said: \"I said early on ... it was important that it should be released to every outlet including CNN, every media outlet, every defense attorney so that the public can see for itself.\n\n\"There was violence on that day. You cannot deny that and you know, it was a dark day in our history. But so was the summer of 2020.\"\n\nMace proceeded to compare the deadly attack on Congress - now linked to nine deaths, more than a thousand arrests and hundreds of convictions including some for seditious conspiracy - to protests for racial justice after the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020.\n\n\"We saw very few arrests when there were attacks by ... members of Antifa and Black Lives Matter. I had my house spray painted two summers ago and no one's been held to account for that.\"\n\nReuters contributed reporting"

I've seen him starting to shy away from a commitment to the sanctity of human life.\"\n\nThe US national debt ballooned under Trump and Pence.\n\nOn abortion rights, the supreme court to which Trump appointed three rightwingers did remove federal rights in 2022. But Republicans have since suffered a succession of election defeats as Democrats campaign on the issue.\n\nAs Trump claims credit for appointing those justices, Democrats are positioning to make reproductive rights a central issue in November.\n\nPence also cited Trump's \"reversal\" on \"getting tough on China and supporting our administration's effort to force the sale of ... TikTok\".\n\nPence refused to speculate on why Trump has come out against forcing the sale by ByteDance, TikTok's China-based parent company.\n\nHe said: \"What I can tell you is that in each of these cases, Donald Trump is pursuing and articulating an agenda that is at odds with the conservative agenda that we governed on during our four years.\n\n\"And that's why I cannot in good conscience endorse Donald Trump in this campaign.\"\n\nMost of Trump's former rivals for the Republican nomination have now endorsed him. The last to drop out, the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, has not.\n\nOpponents of Trump welcomed Pence's decision not to endorse.\n\nAdam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican who retired from Congress over his opposition to Trump, said simply: \"Good job Mike Pence.\"\n\nTommy Vietor, an aide to Barack Obama turned political commentator, said : \"I did not expect this from Mike Pence. Credit to him for showing some backbone. This is a big deal.\"\n\nBut Pence, who has outlined plans to spend $20m this year in an attempt to shape the conservative agenda, told Fox News he would not vote for Biden.\n\n\"I'm a Republican,\" he said . \"How I vote when that curtain closes, that'll be for me.\""

      "text": "Mike Pence: 'Trump asked me to choose him or the constitution - I chose the constitution' - as it happened\n\nFormer US vice president says was proud to stand by Trump but goes on to criticise attempts to overturn election result in Iowa campaign launch\n\nMike Pence directly addressed the rivalry between him and Donald Trump , saying on January 6, his then-boss asked him to \"choose between him and the constitution.\"\n\n\"January 6 was a tragic day in the life of our nation,\" Pence began. \"As I've said many times, on that fateful day, president Trump's words were reckless. They endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol. But the American people deserve to know that on that day, president Trump also demanded that I choose between him and the constitution. Now, voters will be faced with the same choice: I chose the constitution and I always will.\"\n\nMike Pence is now officially on the presidential campaign trail, after kicking off his bid for the White House with a speech in Iowa where he unsurprisingly attacked Joe Biden , but also went directly at Donald Trump . Pence accused his former running mate of drifting away from conservative values and of asking him to violate the constitution , as the former vice-president sought to carve a place out for himself in the crowded Republican field. In the months to come, we'll find out what voters think.\n\nHere's what else happened today:\n\nNorth Dakota governor Doug Burgum started his own campaign for the Republican presidential nomination with a speech in Fargo.\n\nTrump said he has not been told he is being indicted, after days of reports that prosecutors are nearing the end of their investigation into his possession of classified documents.\n\nMajor East Coast cities including Washington DC and New York City are grappling with an influx of wildfire smoke that has drifted down from Canada, rendering the air quality hazardous for some groups.\n\nClarence Thomas , the conservative supreme court justice, asked for extra time to file his financial disclosures following reports that he'd accepted gifts and travel from a Republican megadonor.\n\nRon DeSantis isn't letting the wide gap between his second place and Trump's lead in the polls phase him.\n\nDonald Trump says he has not been told he is being indicted, despite reports in recent days that prosecutors are nearing the conclusion of their investigation into the classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago resort last year.\n\nHere's what the former president wrote on his Truth social account :\n\nNo one has told me I'm being indicted, and I shouldn't be because I've done NOTHING wrong, but I have assumed for years that I am a Target of the WEAPONIZED DOJ & FBI, starting with the Russia, Russia, Russia HOAX, the \"No Collusion\" Mueller Report, Impeachment HOAX #1, Impeachment HOAX #2, the PERFECT Ukraine phone call, and various other SCAMS & WITCH HUNTS. A TRAVESTY OF JUSTICE & ELECTION INTERFERENCE AT A LEVEL NEVER SEEN BEFORE. REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS MUST MAKE THIS THEIR # 1 ISSUE!!!\n\nEarlier this week, attorneys for the former president met at justice department headquarters in Washington DC with top officials, including Jack Smith , the special counsel appointed to handle the investigation into the classified documents, as well as Trump's involvement in the January 6 insurrection and the plot to overturn the 2020 election result.\n\nSuch meetings typically take place before charging decisions are announced in federal investigations. Today, an aide to the former president, Taylor Budowich , said he had spoken to a grand jury investigating Trump.\n\nThe Guardian's Hugo Lowell has reported the Budowich was among those summoned by federal prosecutors to appear before a new grand jury convened in Florida, which is focusing on Trump's handling of national security matters and potential obstruction of justice. It remains unclear what that grand jury's empaneling implies for the status of the overall investigation, but you can read more about it here:\n\nRon DeSantis doesn't appear to be too worried about trailing Donald Trump in the polls for the Republican presidential nomination, and claims to be \"really excited\" about the enthusiasm he believes he has generated.\n\nFlorida's governor, who entered the race with a glitch-ridden launch event on Twitter last month, has just been speaking at a immigration roundtable in Arizona, and was asked by a reporter about his numbers.\n\n\"Did you just see the Iowa polls that just came out?\" DeSantis said, presumably referring to his own internal polling, reported by the New York Post , that purportedly shows him gaining ground on the former president in the state.\n\n\"We can talk about polls all day long. You've seen some some great stuff. When you run in these things, you run and you persuade people. I mean, that's the whole point of it. Like you don't do a poll a year out and say that that's how the election runs out.\n\n\"If that were the case, you know, I wouldn't have been elected in the first place as governor, and even my reelection I had people saying we were going to win by a couple of percentage points. We won by 20 .\n\n\"So we're really excited about the enthusiasm we've generated. I think you're gonna see a lot of really good stuff over the ensuing weeks and months.\"\n\nThe latest polling by Real Clear Politics for the Republican nomination has Trump at 53% and DeSantis at 22.\n\nThe academic and public intellectual Cornel West could pose a threat to Joe Biden's hold on the White House, the former Trump strategist Kellyanne Conway said - not because West's People's Party candidacy has a chance of winning the race but because it could draw young voters and voters of colour away from the Democratic president.\n\n\"Even if you don't become president, you, as a third-party candidate spoiler, can decide who is the president,\" Conway told Fox News.\n\nConway gave the example of Ross Perot , the millionaire businessman whose third-party run is widely held to have cost George HW Bush dear in 1992, when he was turfed out of the White House by Bill Clinton .\n\nOther third-party candidates who have had an impact on presidential races include Ralph Nader , widely held to have damaged Al Gore in the knife-edge 2000 election against George W Bush .\n\nIn 2016, when Conway managed Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton , both the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson , and the Green candidate, Jill Stein , made an impact at the polls in states that decided the contest.\n\nConway continued: \"It's important also ... that if you play to win and you're Cornel West, and you are still not satisfied with the trajectory of the Democratic party being progressive enough for you under a Biden-Harris administration, then you're going to run to the left of them.\"\n\nWest, Conway said, is \"going to make a play for people who feel forgotten, who feel abandoned by this Democratic party, who feel like nobody's listening to them and including them.\n\n\"It's part of how Trump won in 2016, but I think he could do it from the left.\n\n\"I know him. He's a super-smart guy. He's very committed to the principles and policies that he thinks more Americans want to hear.\"\n\nThe supreme court justice Clarence Thomas has asked for extra time to file his financial disclosures, records keenly awaited amid the ongoing scandal concerning his links to, and extensive gifts from, the Republican mega-donor Harlan Crow .\n\nCrow and another conservative on the court, Samuel Alito , asked for 90 more days to file their annual financial disclosures, the Washington Post reported .\n\nThe Post added: \"Both requests were confirmed by the Administrative Office of the US Courts on Wednesday, the same day that disclosure reports filed by their court colleagues were posted on the court system's website .\"\n\nAs the Post also said, the supreme court \"is under increasing pressure from Democratic lawmakers and transparency advocates to strengthen disclosure rules and adopt ethics guidelines specific to the justices after news reports revealed Thomas's undisclosed real estate deals and private jet travel, and raised questions about the recusal practices of both conservative and liberal justices\".\n\nCrow is the subject of attempts by Senate Democrats to obtain details of gifts given to Thomas.\n\nSupreme court justices are nominally subject to the same ethics rules as all federal judgs but in practise govern themselves. Thomas and Crow deny wrongdoing. Thomas has said he did not declare extensive and costly gifts from Crow because he was advised he did not have to.\n\nIn a statement after news of Thomas's request for an extension, Kyle Herrig , president of the pressure group Accountable.US, said: \"Justice Thomas and his billionaire benefactor Harlan Crow can't dodge accountability forever. It was their decades-long improper relationship that sparked the supreme court corruption crisis in the first place.\n\n\"What more is Thomas trying to hide? Are his gifts and connections so extensive that he needs more time to account for them all? Chief Justice [John] Roberts needs to act immediately to clean up his court.\"\n\nFurther reading:\n\nMike Pence is now officially on the presidential campaign trail, kicking off his bid for the White House with a speech in Iowa where he unsurprisingly attacked Joe Biden , but also went directly at Donald Trump . He accused his former running mate of drifting away from conservative values and asking him to violate the constitution in an attempt to carve a place out for himself in the crowded Republican field. In the months to come, we'll find out what voters think.\n\nHere's what else has happened today so far:\n\nNorth Dakota governor Doug Burgum started his own campaign for the Republican presidential nomination with a speech in Fargo.\n\nAn aide to Trump confirmed he had spoken to a grand jury that the Guardian reports has been empaneled in Florida to look into the former president's handling of national security matters and potential obstruction of justice.\n\nIt's really smoky on the East Coast . Also, a volcano is erupting in Hawaii, and you can watch it happen live.\n\nA major Pac supporting Donald Trump has responded to Mike Pence 's campaign announcement with a statement that dismisses both him and Florida governor Ron DeSantis .\n\n\"Mike Pence's entrance into the race caps off another bad week for Ron DeSantis' faltering campaign, but the question most GOP voters are asking themselves about Pence's candidacy is 'Why?'\" Make America Great Again Inc spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said.\n\nAs Pence's speech wrapped up, he accused Donald Trump and Joe Biden of being too mean to lead.\n\n\"Joe Biden promised to restore decency and civility if he was elected president. He broke that promise on day one. He's continually vilified those of us that disagree with him, and even vilified members of his own party,\" Pence said.\n\n'Our politics are more divided than ever before, but I'm not convinced our country is as divided as our politics. Most Americans treat each other with kindness and respect even when we disagree. We know how to be good neighbors. That's not too much to ask our leaders to do the same. But sadly, it's clear that neither Joe Biden or Donald Trump share this belief.\"\n\nPence is taking both Joe Biden and Donald Trump to task over their approach to managing the US government's debt and spending, and their support for Ukraine.\n\n\"Joe Biden's policy is insolvency,\" Pence said, after recounting the looming challenges the massive government Social Security and Medicare problems face. \"But you deserve to know, my fellow Republicans , that Donald Trump's position on entitlement reform is the same. Both of them refuse to even talk about the issue taken to the American people.\"\n\nHe then turned to both Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the possibility of war with China.\n\n\"America is the leader of the free world. We're the arsenal of democracy ... Donald Trump and others who would seek the presidency would walk away from our traditional role on the world stage,\" Pence said.\n\n\"President Trump, he described Vladimir Putin as a 'genius' at the outset of the invasion and another candidate for the Republican nomination described the invasion of Ukraine as a quote, territorial dispute,\" he continued in a reference to Florida governor Ron DeSantis , a competitor for the Republican nomination.\n\n\"I know the difference between a genius, I know the difference between a territorial dispute and a war of aggression. The war in Ukraine is not our war but freedom is our fight and America must always stand for freedom, and when I'm your president, we will.\"\n\nOne more broadside at Trump: \"What President Trump and others are forgetting is that our administration succeeded not because we compromised or abandoned conservative principles, but because we acted,\" Pence said.\n\nPence hasn't held back on criticizing Joe Biden .\n\nEarlier in the speech, he decried his \"disastrous presidency\", and promised to, if elected, lower taxes, \"give the American people freedom from excessive federal regulations\" and end Biden's \"trillion-dollar spending spree that's driving inflation\".\n\nBut Pence also needs to get through a crowded Republican primary field that includes Donald Trump if he wants to appear on the general election ballot, and the former vice-president has spent a considerable portion of his speech criticizing his ex-boss.\n\n\"You know, when Donald Trump ran for president in 2016, he promised to govern as a conservative. Together, we did just that. Today, he makes no such promise,\" Pence said.\n\n\"After leaving the most pro-life administration in American history, Donald Trump and others in this race are retreating from the cause of the unborn. Sanctity of life has been our party's calling for a half-a-century, long before Donald Trump was a part of it. Now he treats it is an inconvenience, even blaming our election losses in 2022 on overturning Roe v Wade,\" he continued.\n\n\"Mr. President, I will always stand for the sanctity of life, and I will not rest and I will not relent until we restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in every state in the land,\" Pence said.\n\nWhat he did not say: whether he would sign a federal law banning abortion.\n\nAs Pence continues his speech, his strategy for taking on Donald Trump has become clear.\n\nThe former vice-president is touting the Trump administration's accomplishments, while simultaneously portraying his former running mate as straying from true conservative principles.\n\n\"I'll always be grateful for what president Trump did for this country. I've often prayed for him over the past few years. And I prayed for him again today. I had hoped he would come around, see that he had been misled about my role that day,\" Pence said, referring to January 6.\n\n\"The Republican party must be the party of the constitution of the United States. We've had enough of the Democrats in the radical left repeatedly trampling on our constitution, threatening to pack the court, to dismantle the God given rights that are enshrined,\" Pence continued, saying the GOP must protect the \"right to life\" as well as keep firearms freely available.\n\nAnd then he again turned to Trump.\n\n\"I believe that anyone who puts themselves over the constitution should never be president of the United States. And anyone who asked someone else to put them over the constitution should never be president of the United States again,\" Pence said. \"Our liberties have been bought at too high a price.\""

      "text": "So Help Me God review: Mike Pence's tortured bid for Republican relevance\n\nTrump's VP is surprisingly critical of the boss whose followers wanted him dead. But surely the presidency won't be his too\n\nA fter four years at Donald Trump's side, Mike Pence emerged as the Rodney Dangerfield of vice-presidents: he gets no respect . So Help Me God, his memoir, is well-written and well-paced. But it will do little to shake that impression.\n\nAt the Capitol on January 6, his boss was prepared to leave him for dead. And yet the Republican rank-and-file yawned. Among prospective presidential nominees, Pence is tied with Donald Trump Jr for third. The GOP gravitates to frontrunners. Pence, once a six-term congressman and governor of Indiana, is not that.\n\nAs governor, he was dwarfed by his predecessor, Mitch Daniels. On Capitol Hill, he was eclipsed by the late Richard Lugar, also from Indiana and chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, and Dan Coats, another Hoosier senator. On the page, Pence lauds all three. Say what you like, he is unfailingly polite.\n\nCoats became Donald Trump's director of national intelligence and repeatedly pushed back against the president . That cost Coats his job. Pence pushed back less.\n\nThe former vice-president is a committed Christian with sharp elbows but also a sonorous voice . He has struggled with the tugs of faith and ambition. Family is an integral part of his life. He takes pride in his son's service as a US marine. Born and raised a Catholic, the 48th vice-president is now one of America's most prominent evangelicals. So Help Me God is replete with references to prayer. Pence begins with a verse from the Book of Jeremiah and concludes with Ecclesiastes: \"There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens.\"\n\nTrump picked him as a running mate at the suggestion of Paul Manafort. Unlike Newt Gingrich and Chris Christie, other possible picks, Pence could do \"normal\".\n\nTime passes. On 3 November 2020, America delivered its verdict on the Trump presidency. Trump lost. By his own admission, Pence was surprised. He refused to believe the polls and mistook the enthusiasm of the base for the entire political landscape. He wrongly believed he would serve another four years, yards from the Oval Office, enjoying weekly lunches with the Man.\n\nInstead, two months later, at great personal peril, he accepted reality and abided by his conscience and the constitution. Like Richard Nixon, Walter Mondale, Dan Quayle (another hapless Hoosier) and Al Gore, Pence presided over the certification of an election he had lost.\n\nFor Pence and those around him, it was a matter of duty and faith. They refused to subvert democracy. Yet along the way Pence flashed streaks of being in two minds politically - as he continues to do. He rebuffed Trump's entreaties to join a coup but gave a thumbs-up to the turbulence. He welcomed the decision by the Missouri senator Josh Hawley to object to election results.\n\n\"It meant we would have a substantive debate,\" Pence writes. He got way more than that. His own brother, Greg Pence, an Indiana congressman , voted against certification - mere hours after the insurrectionists sought to hang his brother from makeshift gallows. As the mob raged, Greg Pence hid too. After it, the brass ring came first.\n\nAmong House Republicans, Trump remains emperor. Rightwing members have extracted a pledge that the GOP-controlled House will investigate Nancy Pelosi and the justice department for the purported mistreatment of defendants jailed for invading the Capitol. Pence's anger and hurt are visible.\n\n\"The president's words were reckless, and they endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol building,\" he recently said . But in the next breath, he stonewalled the House January 6 committee. Pence told CBS it would set a \"terrible precedent\" for Congress to summon a vice-president to testify about conversations at the White House. He also attacked the committee for its \"partisanship\".\n\nBennie Thompson, the Democratic committee chair, and Liz Cheney, the Republican vice-chair, pushed back hard .\n\n\"Our investigation has publicly presented the testimony of more than 50 Republican witnesses,\" they said. \"This testimony, subject to criminal penalties for lying to Congress, was not 'partisan'. It was truthful.\"\n\nFrom Pence, it was a strained attempt to retain political viability. Surely, that train has left the station.\n\nPence's memoir does deliver a perhaps surprisingly surgical indictment of Trump. The book catalogs Trump's faults, errors and sins. From Charlottesville to Russia to Ukraine, Pence repeatedly tags him for his shortcomings and missteps.\n\nHe upbraids Trump for his failure to condemn \"the racists and antisemites in Charlottesville by name\", but then rejects the contention Trump is a bigot.\n\nAs for Putin, \"there was no reason for Trump not to call out Russia's bad behaviour\", Pence writes. \"Acknowledging Russian meddling\" would not have \"cheapen[ed] our victory\" over Hillary Clinton. On Ukraine, the subject of Trump's first impeachment, Pence terms the infamous phone call to Volodymyr Zelenskiy \"less than perfect\".\n\nBut even as Putin's malignance takes center stage, the Trumps refuse to abandon their man. Don Jr clamors to halt aid to Ukraine, the dauphin gone Charles Lindbergh . He tweets: \"Since it was Ukraine's missile that hit our NATO ally Poland, can we at least stop spending billions to arm them now?\"\n\nThese days, Pence leads Advancing American Freedom , a tax-exempt conservative way-station with an advisory board replete with Trump refugees. Kellyanne Conway, Betsy DeVos and Callista Gingrich are there, so too David Friedman and Larry Kudlow. If more than one of them backs Pence in 2024, count it a minor miracle.\n\nRodney Dangerfield is gone. But his spirit definitely lives on - in Mike Pence , of all people.\n\nSo Help Me God is published in the US by Simon & Schuster"

He was then shamed into standing up to Trump by his son, a US marine.\n\n\"Dad, you took the same oath I took,\" the then vice-president's son Michael Pence said , according to ABC News, adding that it was \"an oath to support and defend the constitution\".\n\nUltimately, Pence did supervise certification, even as it was delayed by the deadly January 6 attack on Congress.\n\nTrump incited the attack by telling supporters to march on the Capitol and \"fight like hell\" in his cause - the lie that Biden's win was the result of electoral fraud.\n\nSome chanted for Pence to be hanged. Nine deaths have been linked to the riot, more than a thousand arrests made and hundreds of convictions secured.\n\nThroughout the investigation of January 6 by a House committee, Pence was praised for standing up to Trump and fulfilling his constitutional duty. He later released a memoir, So Help Me God, about his time as Trump's No 2.\n\nBut according to ABC , which on Tuesday cited sources familiar with Pence's testimony to the special counsel Jack Smith, investigating Trump's election subversion, Pence offered details not included in his book, including how he had to be prodded into doing his duty.\n\n\"Not feeling like I should attend electoral count,\" Pence reportedly wrote in contemporaneous notes in late December 2020, as Trump pressured him to help overturn Biden's win.\n\n\"Too many questions, too many doubts, too hurtful to my friend. Therefore I'm not going to participate in certification of election.\"\n\nABC reported that Pence told investigators, \"Then, sitting across the table from his son, a [US] marine, while on vacation in Colorado, his son said to him, 'Dad, you took the same oath I took' - it was 'an oath to support and defend the constitution'.\n\n\"That's when Pence decided he would be at the Capitol on 6 January after all.\"\n\nTrump now faces four federal criminal counts regarding election subversion. He also faces 13 counts relating to election subversion in Georgia, 40 from Smith regarding his retention of classified information, and 34 in New York regarding hush-money payments to the adult film star Stormy Daniels. He also faces civil threats, including a defamation suit arising from a rape allegation a judge said was \" substantially true \".\n\nNonetheless, Trump is the clear frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination next year.\n\nPence also described to investigators an Oval Office meeting on 21 December 2020, \"as the campaign's legal challenges across the country were failing but Trump was continuing to claim the election was stolen and had begun urging supporters to gather in Washington DC for a 'big protest' on 6 January\", per ABC.\n\nTrump reportedly asked what he should do. Pence, according to ABC , said he \"should simply accept the result ... should take a bow\", should \"travel the country to thank supporters ... and then run again if you want\".\n\n\"And I'll never forget, he pointed at me ... as if to say, 'That's worth thinking about.' And he walked\" away.\n\nNearly three years on, Trump has not walked away. But Pence has. Last month, long before the first vote of a primary in which he and others grappled with how to oppose Trump without alienating his supporters, Pence dropped out of the Republican race."

Pence Bond is also the author of a series of children's books about the family's pet rabbit, Marlon Bundo , which the HBO talkshow host John Oliver memorably satirised with a book in which Marlon turned out to be gay .\n\nPence published a campaign-oriented memoir, So Help Me God , last year. In that project, in preparation for his presidential run and now on the campaign trail, he has sought to gradually distance himself from his former boss - not least because Donald Trump sent to the Capitol the mob which threatened Pence's life on January 6.\n\nOn Thursday, Simon & Schuster said: \"When Mike Pence was a young politician, reporters used to ask him: 'Where do you see yourself in five, 10 years?' Without fail, the former vice-president would reply: 'Home for dinner.'\"\n\nBefore becoming vice-president, Pence was a congressman and governor of Indiana.\n\nPence looks set to lose the Republican primary, lagging about 50 points behind Trump in polling, despite the former president's various forms of serious legal jeopardy.\n\nWhile facing likely indictments over his election subversion and incitement of the Capitol riot, Trump has pleaded not guilty to 37 federal criminal charges over his retention of classified records and 34 state criminal charges over his hush money payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who claimed a sexual affair.\n\nSimon & Schuster said Pence would offer readers a \"straightforward and personal\" guide to a lifestyle rather more cloistered than Trump's.\n\nPromising \"short chapters\", the publisher said Pence would walk readers \"through the principles he and his wife, Karen, developed to raise their family\", while giving \"credit to his parents for setting the precedent of gathering around the dinner table and for being attentive listeners\".\n\nPence, Simon & Schuster said, will \"discuss how he and Karen prioritised their relationship, even when they struggled professionally through two failed congressional races and personally with infertility.\n\n\"He reveals how he learned to trust God, make difficult choices, and take leaps of faith, all with an eye to what his family needed.\""

Pence is considered a major witness in the criminal investigation led by special counsel Jack Smith, since Trump pressured him to unlawfully reject electoral college votes for Joe Biden at the joint session of Congress, and was at the White House meeting with Republican lawmakers who discussed objections to Biden's win.\n\nThe two interactions are of particular investigative interest to Smith as his office examines whether Trump sought to unlawfully obstruct the certification and defrauded the United States in seeking to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nPence had privately suggested to advisers that he would provide as complete an account as possible of what took place inside and outside the White House in the weeks leading up to the 6 January Capitol attack, as well as how Trump had been told his plans could violate the law.\n\nHis appearance came the morning after the US court of appeals for the DC circuit rejected an emergency legal challenge seeking to block Pence's testimony on executive privilege grounds, and Trump ran out of road to take the matter to the full DC circuit or the supreme court.\n\nThe government has been trying to get Pence's testimony for months, starting with requests from the justice department last year and then through a grand jury subpoena issued by Smith, who inherited the complicated criminal investigation into Trump's efforts to stay in power.\n\nThe subpoena came under immediate challenges from Trump's lawyers, who invoked executive privilege to limit the scope of Pence's testimony, as well as from Pence's lawyer, who argued his role as president of the Senate on 6 January meant he was protected from legal scrutiny by the executive branch.\n\nBoth requests to limit the scope of Pence's testimony were largely denied by the new chief US judge for the court James Boasberg, who issued a clear-cut denial to Trump and a more nuanced ruling to Pence that upheld that he was protected in part by speech or debate protections.\n\nStill, Boasberg ruled that speech or debate protections did not shield him from testifying about any instances of potential criminality.\n\nThe former vice-president's team declined to challenge the ruling. But Trump's legal team disagreed, and filed the emergency motion that was denied late on Wednesday by judges Gregory Katsas, Patricia Millett and Robert Wilkins.\n\nSign up to Headlines US\n\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nStarting weeks after the 2020 election, Trump tried to cajole Pence into helping him reverse his defeat by using his largely ceremonial role of the presiding officer of the Senate on 6 January to reject the legitimate Biden slates of electors and prevent his certification.\n\nThe effort relied in large part on Pence accepting fake slates of electors for Trump - now a major part of the criminal investigation - to create a pretext for suggesting the results of the election were somehow in doubt and stop Biden from being pronounced president.\n\nThe pressure campaign involved Trump, but it also came from a number of other officials inside and outside the government, including Trump's lawyer John Eastman, other Trump campaign-affiliated lawyers such as Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, and dozens of Republican members of Congress.\n\nPence was also unique in having one-on-one discussions with Trump the day before the Capitol attack and on the day of, which House January 6 select committee investigators last year came to believe was a conspiracy that the former president had at least some advance knowledge."

      "text": "Pence the 'hero' who foiled Trump's plot - could it lead to a 2024 run?\n\nThe former VP rejected the plot to overturn the election - the death knell for Trump and Pence's marriage of convenience\n\nMike Pence was described as the hero of the hour, the man who stood his ground to Donald Trump's coup plot and saved America from a violent \" revolution \".\n\nYet among the rows of committee members, witnesses, reporters, congressmen and women and young citizens at Thursday's January 6 hearing into the attack on the Capitol, the former vice-president was nowhere to be seen. Pence was 500 miles away in Ohio to promote \"American energy dominance\".\n\nBoth events could ultimately lead in the same direction: Pence 2024, a once unlikely presidential campaign illuminating the complexity of his relationship with his former boss, Trump.\n\nPence has dropped numerous clues already, from founding an organisation, Advancing American Freedom , to touring Republican primary battlegrounds. Nothing that the 63-year-old says on the early campaign trail, however, might be as crucial as the near three hours that played out in his absence on Thursday before a TV audience of millions.\n\nBut the panel came to praise Pence, not to bury him, or to hang him, for that matter - like some of Trump's insurrectionists wanted. Even while he was taking part in a roundtable discussion in Cincinnati, the ex-vice-president's ears might have been burning as the congressional committee investigating last year's deadly assault on the US Capitol cast him as the savior of the republic.\n\nThey spoke of a man who put his loyalty to country ahead of his loyalty to Trump, a potential selling point to Republican voters who may want to move on from the former president. But the session could also prove a serious liability for Pence with the Trump base, hardening its view of him as a traitor.\n\nThe third public hearing was about Trump's attempts to pressure Pence to overturn his 2020 election defeat. It heard how the president was told repeatedly that Pence lacked the constitutional and legal authority to meet his demands.\n\nBennie Thompson, chairman of the committee, began the hearing by observing : \"Mike Pence said no. He resisted the pressure. He knew it was illegal. He knew it was wrong. We are fortunate for Mr Pence's courage on January 6. Our democracy came dangerously close to catastrophe. That courage put him very close to tremendous danger.\"\n\nThe vice-chairwoman, Liz Cheney, a Republican who in theory could run against Pence in 2024, added : \"Pence understood that his oath of office was more important than his loyalty to Donald Trump. He did his duty. President Trump unequivocally did not.\"\n\nThe committee heard how Trump latched on to a \"nonsensical\" plan from a conservative law professor, John Eastman, and launched a public and private pressure campaign on Pence days before he was to preside over the January 6 joint session of Congress to certify Joe Biden's election victory.\n\nWitness Greg Jacob, who was the vice-president's counsel, testified that Pence refused to yield to it. The former Indiana governor understood the founding fathers did not intend to empower any one person to affect an election result and never wavered from that view.\n\nIt was the death knell for the Trump and Pence's marriage of political convenience. The president whined : \"I don't want to be your friend any more if you don't do this.\"\n\nAnd as a giant screen in the cavernous caucus room showed, it lit the fuse for a mob on January 6 to make bellicose declarations such as \"Mike Pence has betrayed the United States of America!\" The sound of chanting \"Hang Mike Pence!\" was juxtaposed with the image of a mock gallows against the backdrop of the US Capitol dome.\n\nComputer graphics demonstrated how Pence was evacuated from the Senate chamber but was just 40 feet from the mob and in great peril. Jacob recalled: \"I can hear the din of the rioters in the building while we moved. I don't think I was aware they were as close as that.\"\n\nThe committee noted that a confidential informant told the FBI that the far-right group the Proud Boys would have killed Pence if they got the chance. Jacob recalled how Pence declined to leave , insisting that the world must not see the vice-president \"fleeing the United States Capitol\".\n\nYet Trump never called to check on his safety. Asked how Pence and his wife Karen reacted to that, Jacob replied simply: \"With frustration.\"\n\nThe implication was that Pence bravely alone stood between America and catastrophe. But the praise singing was jarring to critics who wondered why he was far away in Ohio and not here to speak for himself.\n\nMichael Beschloss, a presidential historian, tweeted : \"Why won't Pence testify before the January 6 House Committee and tell all of us what really happened?\"\n\nPence did, after all, act as Trump's enabler for the previous four years. As vice-president he gave speech after speech lauding his boss and his policies, betraying no hint of dissent. In one strange example of sycophancy , he even seemed to imitate Trump's actions in placing a water bottle on the floor.\n\nAsha Rangappa, a lawyer, CNN analyst and former FBI special agent, wrote on Twitter : \"Pence is not a hero. Pence is a coward. It just so happens that on Jan 6, his fear of displeasing Trump was (fortunately) outweighed by a fear of something else - either being implicated in a failed coup and/or aiding and abetting criminal activity - but he's still a coward.\"\n\nEven now, while stating that Trump was \"wrong\" to seek to overturn the election, Pence also regularly trumpets the achievements of the Trump-Pence administration, pushes rightwing talking points and savages Biden and the \"woke\" left.\n\nA presidential run would presumably try to square the circle by offering a resumption of the \"America first\" agenda but within recognised constitutional and democratic boundaries. \"Look, I'm Donald Trump but without the violence,\" as Michael D'Antonio , a Pence biographer, has put it.\n\nBut Thursday's hearing might just as easily be the breaking, not the making, of a Pence bid for the White House. His defiance of Trump has now been luminously displayed for a national audience and recorded for posterity. He will not be speaking at this week's Faith and Freedom Coalition conference in Nashville after being booed last year; Trump is the star turn on Friday.\n\nIf the Republican party was still \" team normal \", Pence would now be strongly placed to make the case that he was a loyal vice-president who showed his independence when it mattered. This week's primary election results, however, suggest that the party remains \"team Maga\" and some still believe that Pence should hang."

      "text": "Trump said Pence was 'too honest' over January 6 plot, says ex-vice-president in book\n\nPence also seems to blame anti-Trump Lincoln Project for angering former president with political ad, fueling Capitol attack\n\nShortly before the January 6 insurrection, Donald Trump warned Mike Pence he was \"too honest\" when he hesitated to pursue legalistic attempts to stop certification of Joe Biden's 2020 election victory and would make Trump's supporters \"hate his guts\", the former vice-president writes in his memoir.\n\nPence also seems, bizarrely, to blame the anti-Trump Lincoln Project for enraging Trump with a political ad, thereby fueling the anger that incited the Capitol attack.\n\nPence's book, So Help Me God, will be published in the US on Tuesday. An extract was published by the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.\n\nDescribing a conversation on New Year's Day 2021, five days before supporters Trump told to \"fight like hell\" stormed the US Capitol, Pence writes that he and Trump discussed a lawsuit filed by Republicans , asking a judge to declare the vice-president had \"'exclusive authority and sole discretion to decide which electoral votes should count\".\n\nPence says Trump told him that if the suit \"gives you the power, why would you oppose it?\"\n\nPence says he \"told him, as I had many times, that I didn't believe I possessed that power under the constitution\".\n\n\"You're too honest,\" Trump chided. \"Hundreds of thousands are gonna hate your guts ... People are gonna think you're stupid.\"\n\nIn the end, hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, some chanting that Pence should be hanged. Nine deaths, including law enforcement suicides, have been linked to the riot.\n\nPence's book emerges as he seeks to establish himself as an alternative to Trump in the Republican presidential primary for 2024.\n\nTrump has indicated he will announce his third consecutive run soon, a plan possibly delayed by midterm elections on Tuesday in which the GOP did not succeed as expected and high-profile Trump-backed candidates failed to win their races.\n\nRon DeSantis, the Florida governor and a much stronger rival to Trump in polling than Pence, provided a bright spot for Republicans with a landslide win that thrust his name back into the spotlight.\n\nIn hearings held by the House January 6 committee, Pence has been painted as a hero for refusing to attempt to block Biden's win, even after his life was placed in danger.\n\nIn the extract published on Thursday, Pence said the Lincoln Project, a group of anti-Trump conservative operatives, angered Trump with an ad which said Pence would \"put the final nail in the coffin\" of his re-election campaign by certifying Biden's win.\n\nRick Wilson, a Lincoln Project co-founder, told the Guardian: \"It's no secret that the Lincoln Project has lived rent-free in Donald Trump's head since 2019. Mike Pence telling this story is one more powerful testimony to just how our 'audience of one' strategy unfailingly disrupts Trump world.\"\n\nOn Twitter, Wilson linked to the ad.\n\nOn the page, Pence describes events inside the Capitol as Trump's supporters attacked. His account parallels reporting by news outlets and testimony presented by the House committee, to which Pence has not yet testified.\n\nThe devoutly Christian Pence gives his version of a call with Trump on the morning of 6 January in which Trump has widely been described as calling his vice-president a \"pussy\".\n\nPence writes: \"The president laid into me. 'You'll go down as a wimp,' he said. 'If you [don't block certification], I made a big mistake five years ago!'\"\n\nPence describes his refusal, also widely reported, to get in a Secret Service vehicle, lest his protectors drive him away while the attack was in motion.\n\nHe describes meetings with Trump after the riot, when Trump's second impeachment was in train. On 11 January, Pence writes, Trump \"looked tired, and his voice seemed fainter than usual\". He says Trump \"responded with a hint of regret\" when he was told Pence's wife and daughter were also at the Capitol during the deadly attack.\n\n\"He then asked, 'Were you scared?'\n\n\"'No,' I replied, 'I was angry. You and I had our differences that day, Mr President, and seeing those people tearing up the Capitol infuriated me.' He started to bring up the election, saying that people were angry, but his voice trailed off. I told him he had to set that aside, and he responded quietly, 'Yeah.'\"\n\nPence claims the Capitol rioters, more than 900 of whom have now been charged, some with seditious conspiracy, were \"not our movement\". He says Trump spoke with \"genuine sadness in his voice\" as he \"mused: 'What if we hadn't had the rally? What if they hadn't gone to the Capitol? ... It's too terrible to end like this.'\"\n\nPence may risk angering Trump by presenting something approaching presidential contrition. Trump claims to regret nothing about his actions on 6 January, denying wrongdoing in the face of multiple investigations, pursuing the lie that his defeat was the result of electoral fraud and presenting rioters as political prisoners.\n\nPence also describes a meeting on 14 January, \"the day after President Trump was impeached for the second time\".\n\n\"I reminded him that I was praying for him,\" Pence writes. Trump, he says, answered \"Don't bother\" but added: \"It's been fun.\"\n\nPence said he told Trump they would \"just have to disagree on two things\" - January 6 and the fact Pence would \"never stop praying\" for Trump.\n\nPence says Trump smiled and said: \"That's right - don't ever change.\""

      "text": "Mike Pence Emerges As One Of Few Republicans Willing To Challenge Donald Trump 2.0\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - His group spent nearly $1 million on ads opposing Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Donald Trump's pick to lead the nation's health agencies.\n\nHe's delivering speeches urging the president to stand with longstanding foreign allies and lobbying members of Congress while aides write letters and opinion columns.\n\nThis weekend, he posted an article he penned more than a decade ago on the limits of presidential power after Trump claimed that, \"He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.\"\n\nMike Pence is emerging as one of the last Republicans in Washington willing to publicly criticize the new administration.\n\nIt's an especially jarring role for the former vice president, whose refusal to break with Trump defined their time together in office until the two had a falling out over Trump's refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election and his efforts to remain in power .\n\nPence and those who work with him at Advancing American Freedom, his political advocacy group, stress they are not looking to take on the \"Never Trump\" mantle. They intend to praise the administration when they agree with it, while raising concerns when they don't, advocating for longtime conservative principles that have fallen out of favor as Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" brand of populism has taken hold.\n\n\"We're calling balls and strikes here,\" Pence told The Associated Press.\n\nPence opposed Kennedy - who has since been confirmed as secretary of health and human services - due to Kennedy's past comments voicing support for abortion rights. His group is now lobbying against Lori Chavez-DeRemer , Trump's pick for labor secretary, accusing her of being pro-union , and plans to spend the coming months pushing to increase military spending, shrink the deficit, and make permanent 2017 tax cuts, as well as trying to convince Trump to stop slapping tariffs on allies.\n\nThe AP recently sat down with Pence to discuss his efforts and his relationship with Trump - including a closely watched handshake at the funeral of President Jimmy Carter and his wife's lack of reaction as the 45th and 47th president took his seat.\n\nHere is a transcript of that conversation, which has been lightly edited for space and clarity:\n\nQ: What do you see as your role and the role of AAF over the next four years?\n\nPence: \"To be an anchor to windward ... I came across that line I think in a Herman Melville book a long time ago.\"\n\n\"The wind blows in the direction of more government. And I think it's a role of conservatives to anchor the party so that when the wind blows, you put the anchor to windward so you stay grounded and hopefully do some small part to hold, you know, hold the ship of state on the principles that really minted my career in this movement.\"\n\n\"A strong defense, to American leadership of the free world, limited government, fiscal responsibility, growth, the right to life, traditional values - those were the values that drew me to the Republican Party . And I still think that they are the timeless ideals of the party of Lincoln. And so I want to do my part, even as a former elected official, to use whatever remains of my bully pulpit to be a champion for those principles.\"\n\nQ: How are you picking your battles?\n\nPence: \"Well, for me, it's always principles first. It's not personal. I went to the inauguration last month and I was very moved in the outpouring of kind words and expressions of appreciation from former colleagues, including many members of the new administration who I encountered in hallways. And I saw Secretary of State (Marco) Rubio. I gave him a hug, told him how proud I was of him. We had praised him from here when he was selected. I must have seen about or interacted with about half the incoming Cabinet.\"\n\n\"We went to the Carter funeral. And the president and I had a very cordial exchange. You know, he was coming down the row in front of us at the National Cathedral and he said, 'Hi, Mike.' And I was standing up, extended my hand, and I said, 'Congratulations, Mr. President.' And I could see his countenance softened. And he said, 'Thanks.' And Melania reached out and I said, 'Congratulations, Melania.' And it was, you know, the people that know me know it's not personal. I've long since forgiven the president for any differences that we had at the end of our administration. We still have those differences as the president still holds the view that, to my knowledge, that I had some authority that I did not have under the Constitution or laws of the country. But from my heart, I've prayed often for the president.\"\n\n\"And so, to answer your question, I think that the way we want to approach this is with integrity to principle. And I'm very encouraged. I think the Trump administration is off to a great start ... I'm very pleased about the president undoing Biden's border policies and putting back into place the policies that we had negotiated and established that secured the border. But you know, with regard to the nomination of RFK ... for me, it would begin and end with the right to life ... I saw the nomination of an abortion rights supporter to be secretary of HHS to be a dramatic departure from 50 years of strong pro-life leadership at HHS under Republican administrations. So we thought it was important to speak out. And we got a lot of quiet encouragement about that.\"\n\nQ: Quiet encouragement?\n\n\"Well, we got a lot of quiet encouragement from people that, for whatever reason, didn't feel compelled to join us in that chorus. But I thought it was an important point for us to make. And, you know, we'll continue to be a champion.\"\n\nQ: Why are Republicans so reluctant to speak out publicly?\n\nPence: \"I never speculate on motives. You know, I'm not new to town. I've waged lonely battles before.\"\n\n\"But you know, you have to be willing to step out and lead. And my hope is that even in the wake of this fight that, you know, the Senate has worked its will, the president will get his choice at HHS. My hope is that when the next issue of life comes up, that people will have been encouraged, emboldened to know that they're not alone.\"\n\nQ: Is there support in the party for moving back in the direction that you'd like to see versus the populist, MAGA wing of the party that's ascendant?\n\nPence: \"Well now you hit it. Now you're on it. I don't think - look, I think some of the prominent voices in the party have embraced a more populist thinking. I don't believe the overwhelming majority of people that ever vote Republican think any differently than they thought during our administration when we hewed to a conservative agenda or the years before or since.\"\n\n\"Let me give you one anecdote. So I'm at a town hall meeting when I'm running for president. And at the end of the town hall meeting - it was well-attended, it was in Iowa - a farmer walked up to me and he said, 'It was a great town hall meeting. I agree with everything you say.' You know, and I argued for - this was literally in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack. And I argued for strong American support for Israel, strong American leadership in the world, continued support for Ukraine in their fight and limited government and bringing about reforms to put our fiscal house in order and right to life.\n\nAnd this farmer says to me, he said, 'I agree with absolutely everything you said.' So I said, 'Well, can I count on your vote?' And he said, 'No, I got to be for Trump this time.' And he goes, 'But I'll see you in four years. You're going to be a great president someday.' I said, 'Would you mind telling me, you know, why?' And he said words I never forgot, which was in effect: He lamented Biden's failed record. And I saw that he was drawn to the need for a rematch. And then he said, 'Plus, if they can do that to a former president, they can do that to me.' And the 'lawfare' stuff went into higher relief.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

I didn't see that traveling all over the country and I still don't see it. I think there were other factors that gave the former president a decided advantage in the election. He'd earned it. He'd won it. And then he won it in the fall. But I don't think the party's changed.\"\n\nQ: You mentioned the Carter funeral earlier. Tell me about your wife's reaction to the Trumps that day. (At the funeral, former second lady Karen Pence refused to acknowledge the then-president elect or shake Melania Trump 's hands - footage that ended up going viral online.)\n\nPence: \"My wife loves her husband. And I love my wife and I have great respect for her. And so - but I've been really moved at how many people around the country have thanked us both for that day.\n\n\"But again, you know, I want to emphasize, we're eyes forward here. You know, I'd always thought the president was going to come around on the position he took on Jan. 6. If you read the end of my book, which I'd be flattered if you did, you'll read we actually parted on very amicable terms, very good terms. But in the spring, when he returned to the rhetoric about how I could have done something that neither the Constitution nor the law would ever permit any vice president to do, then I just decided it was important to go our separate ways. But hope springs eternal. And we want to be a constructive force for the conservative agenda. I think that's good for the administration. It's good for the Congress. More importantly, it's good for America.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Mike Pence's Notes Helped Trump Get Indicted Over Jan. 6 Attack On Capitol\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nA federal grand jury on Tuesday indicted former President Donald Trump on four felony charges related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, his second federal indictment in recent months.\n\nNewly revealed evidence in the 45-page indictment appears to come directly from Mike Pence , Trump's vice president and now a rival in the 2024 GOP presidential race.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Pence took \"contemporaneous notes\" of several conversations he had with Trump and his aides in the days leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, including during one meeting where Trump asked Pence to reject legitimate electors for Democrat Joe Biden .\n\n\"Bottom line ― won every state by 100,000s of votes,\" Trump falsely said at the time, according to Pence.\n\nTrump also falsely told Pence that the Department of Justice was \"finding major infractions\" with the 2020 election as part of his pressure campaign, according to the indictment.\n\nTrump's public efforts to pressure Pence to overturn the 2020 presidential election are already well known. But according to the indictment, Trump also phoned Pence on Jan. 1, 2021, and told him he was being \"too honest\" for refusing to go along with the scheme to deny Biden the presidency.\n\nPence has criticized Trump over the Jan. 6 riot, saying his former boss was reckless for putting his life and the lives of his family members at risk. But the former vice president has said he's unconvinced that Trump's actions were criminal.\n\n\"I would rather that these issues and the judgment about his conduct on January 6 be left to the American people in the upcoming primaries,\" Pence said last month.\n\nIn a statement released by his campaign on Tuesday, Pence called the indictment \"an important reminder\" that \"anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be President of the United States.\" He also framed it as a reason why GOP voters should pick someone else to take on Biden in 2024.\n\n\"The former president is entitled to the presumption of innocence but with this indictment, his candidacy means more talk about January 6th and more distractions,\" Pence said.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services over his past support for abortion.\n\nWhile public health officials have come out against Kennedy over his spreading of dangerous conspiracy theories and his anti-vaccine stance, conservative advocacy group Advancing American Freedom appears more concerned with Kennedy's previous comments in support of abortion access.\n\n\"While RFK Jr. has made certain overtures to pro-life leaders ... there is little reason for confidence at this time,\" AAF President Tim Chapman and Chairman Marc Short wrote in a statement Wednesday. \"There are hundreds of decisions made every day at HHS that either lead our nation toward a respect for life or away from it-decisions about federal funding for Planned Parenthood , regulations on the abortion pill (currently accounting for three out of every five abortions), insurance coverage of abortion, and more.\"\n\nKennedy has repeatedly flip-flopped on the issue. In June, he said abortion \"should be unrestricted up until a certain point.\"\n\n\"Even in the reddest of red states, voters reject total abortion bans,\" Kennedy said in a video to his supporters. \"And in blue states, almost no one supports third-trimester abortions except to save the life of the mother. And so I support the emerging consensus that abortion should be unrestricted up until a certain point.\"\n\nPence, a Trump critic since the end of the first Trump administration, first urged lawmakers to reject Kennedy's nomination in November following President-elect Donald Trump 's presidential win.\n\n\"I believe the nomination of RFK Jr. to serve as Secretary of HHS is an abrupt departure from the pro-life record of our administration and should be deeply concerning to millions of Pro-Life Americans who have supported the Republican Party and our nominees for decades,\" Pence said in a statement at the time.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Trump, Pence Publicly Meet For First Time Since Trump Nearly Got Pence Killed\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON - President-elect Donald Trump and his former Vice President Mike Pence briefly greeted each other Thursday at former President Jimmy Carter's state funeral, marking the first time they've been together publicly - and possibly at all - since Trump allegedly welcomed calls by his supporters to kill Pence during the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection.\n\nTrump and Pence were among the former presidents and vice presidents attending the National Cathedral service for Carter, who died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100. Former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush were there, as was former Vice President Al Gore.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris sat in the front row with President Joe Biden, who is giving the eulogy.\n\nIt was the quickest of interactions. Trump walked in with his wife, Melania, and shook hands with Gore, who stood up to greet him. Pence was seated next to Gore and similarly stood up to shake Trump's hand. They barely spoke as Pence leaned over and shook Melania's hand. Pence promptly sat back down.\n\nPence's wife, Karen, did not stand up, did not shake either of their hands, and appeared to stare straight ahead the entire time.\n\nA Pence spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether this was the first time the two had seen each other in person since the 2021 Capitol attack.\n\nYou can watch their awkward interaction here:\n\nTrump welcomed chants by his supporters calling for Pence to be hanged as the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection was underway, according to former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who was one of the lead investigators on the former House committee that probed the attack on the Capitol.\n\nDuring a June 2022 committee hearing, Cheney cited testimony by Trump advisers who recalled the president saying, \"Maybe our supporters have the right idea. Mike Pence deserves it.\"\n\nTrump's supporters had built a makeshift gallows outside the Capitol that day. Some were shouting for Pence to be hanged for refusing to stop the certification of Biden's electoral win.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Nearly 3 Years Later, Pence Finally Bragging About Refusing To Enable Trump's Coup\n\nSenior White House Correspondent, HuffPost\n\nThirty-one months after Donald Trump 's mob tried to murder him for refusing to participate in his boss's coup attempt, former Vice President Mike Pence is finally making his fidelity to the Constitution a main feature of his own presidential campaign.\n\n\"Let's be clear on this point. ... The president specifically asked me, and his gaggle of crackpot lawyers asked me, to literally reject votes,\" he told Fox News on Wednesday - a dramatic change in tone from as late as last month, when he was saying he hoped the Justice Department would not indict Trump for his actions leading up to and during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nTrump was arraigned in federal court Thursday on four felony charges on an indictment in which Pence's grand jury testimony played a leading role.\n\n\"The American people deserve to know that President Trump and his advisers didn't just ask me to pause. They asked me to reject votes ... essentially to overturn the [2020] election. And to keep faith with the oath that I made to the American people and to Almighty God, I rejected that out of hand,\" Pence said on Fox .\n\nThe new tone, though, may be too little, too late.\n\nLess than three weeks from the first Republican primary debate, Pence sits at 5% in the polls, compared with 53% for Trump, and still has not collected the necessary 40,000 unique donors to qualify for the event. Even worse, a majority of GOP voters now believe Trump's lie that the 2020 election was \"stolen\" from him, and that his efforts to overturn the results were therefore justified.\n\n\"The simple fact is that a huge majority of GOPers believe that [Joe] Biden didn't win this election. To them, Pence's comments fall on deaf ears,\" said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse.\n\n\"I'm glad he's doing it. It's probably the only thing he can do to stand up for himself, but it's not a path to the nomination,\" said David Kochel, a veteran Republican strategist from Iowa. \"Until you get a much larger group speaking out on this, and really flood conservative media with consistent criticism, you'll never be able to convince the base that Trump isn't a victim.\"\n\nWhile Pence has long said Trump was wrong to claim that his vice president had the unilateral authority to award him a second term despite having lost, only this week - after Trump was indicted for the underlying plot - has Pence put his actions that day front and center.\n\nMarc Short, a top Pence adviser who, as his chief of staff at the White House, also faced physical danger from Trump's mob on Jan. 6, said Pence is not offering any new facts. The much-discussed \"contemporaneous notes\" mentioned in the new indictment, for example, were the basis of Pence's narrative in his recent memoir, \"So Help Me God.\"\n\nShort, though, acknowledged that Pence is now more aggressively defending his own actions from Trump's continued lies. \"He's leaning into this. He's saying, 'Hell no, I did exactly what I was supposed to do,'\" Short stated.\n\nIn a question-and-answer session Wednesday, the day after the indictment was made public, Pence gave his most vociferous defense of his actions to date.\n\n\"While I made my case to what I understood my Constitution to require, the president ultimately continued to demand that I choose him over the Constitution,\" he told reporters at the Indiana State Fair. \"What the president maintained that day, and frankly, has said over and over again over the last two and a half years, is completely false.\"\n\nIndeed, Pence and his campaign decided to turn a line from the indictment, said to him by Trump as a criticism, into a badge of honor. Baseball caps and T-shirts emblazoned with the phrase \"Too honest\" are up for sale on his website - a move that also attempts to draw a contrast with a president famous for his constant lying.\n\nBut if Pence failed to speak up early and loudly enough, other Republican leaders were even more timid.\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, while he blasted Trump on the chamber floor and said the criminal justice system would eventually hold him accountable, within weeks of Jan. 6 persuaded enough of his fellow Senate Republicans not to find Trump guilty after the House had impeached him for inciting the insurrection. Had McConnell, of Kentucky, voted to convict, he would almost certainly have brought along another nine, providing enough to convict Trump and allow a second vote to ban him from federal office for life.\n\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, of California, went even further to avoid getting on Trump's bad side, flying to his South Florida country club to make amends just three weeks after Trump's followers invaded his Capitol office.\n\nAnd at the Republican National Committee, which was holding its winter meeting in Florida on Jan. 6, members gave Trump a long ovation when he called in to a breakfast the following morning. To this day, the RNC chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, has failed to criticize Trump's behavior on and leading up to Jan. 6. According to the new indictment, she even took part in setting up the fake elector scheme that became a key step in Trump's coup plot.\n\nAs a result, when Trump resumed lying about how the 2020 election had been \"stolen\" from him during the Conservative Political Action Conference just seven weeks after Jan. 6, few if any GOP leaders refuted him publicly, effectively letting his false, revisionist history of that day become canon within the Republican Party .\n\n\"That Jan. 6th through 20th period stands out as having been the best opportunity to jettison Trump permanently via collective action,\" said Fergus Cullen, a former New Hampshire state GOP chair. \"And they blew it.\"\n\nKochel puts more of the blame on right-wing media, which remained decidedly pro-Trump through Jan. 6 and remains so today. \"Look, nobody thought Trump would recover from all of that. People assumed he'd done himself in with most Republicans,\" Kochel said. \"Conservative media brought him back. They can't get enough of his ability to drive ratings and attention.\"\n\nDavid Axelrod, the Democratic consultant who helped Barack Obama win the White House in 2008, said he's not sure it would have made a difference, even if party leaders had, in a unified voice, ostracized Trump. \"But they made a judgment that the base was with Trump and it was too risky to defy him,\" Axelrod said.\n\nHe added that Pence trying to turn his actions to his advantage now only makes sense. \"Pence has nothing to lose. Trump branded him as a traitor for doing his duty, and that stigma has stuck,\" Axelrod said. \"If he is going to be savaged for his act of courage, he should at least own it and get whatever upside he can. The cautious, halfway approach only made him look weak and political.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Mike Pence Files Paperwork To Run For President Against Donald Trump\n\nSenior Political Reporter, HuffPost\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence filed paperwork Monday to run for president, setting up a clash for the GOP nomination between Pence and his onetime boss, former President Donald Trump .\n\nPence's entry into the 2024 Republican presidential primary sets up an awkward dynamic with his former running mate and ally Trump, who reportedly cheered on calls for Pence to be hanged as hordes of angry Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to try to stop the certification of the presidential election.\n\nTrump and Pence were aligned throughout nearly all of Trump's presidency but fell out after Trump refused to accept his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Trump disavowed Pence for carrying out the vice president's constitutional duty of certifying the Electoral College count, which contradicted Trump's false claims that the results were fraudulent. A former aide told Congress Trump pressured Pence to overturn the election, calling him a \"wimp.\" Trump also reportedly didn't dissuade a mob from seeking out Pence in the Capitol to execute him: During the Jan. 6 insurrection, rioters displayed a noose and chanted for Pence to be hanged before the mob broke into the Capitol.\n\nDespite all that, Pence has been measured in his critiques of Trump. His most forceful rebuke of the former president came in March at the Gridiron Club's annual dinner in Washington.\n\n\"President Trump was wrong. I had no right to overturn the election, and his reckless words endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day, and I know that history will hold Donald Trump accountable,\" Pence said.\n\nPence has been signaling for some time that he would run, visiting early voting states and promoting a Christianity-themed memoir, \"So Help Me God.\" In May, Pence's allies launched a super PAC to support his candidacy, a vessel for big contributions that's independent from a candidate's formal campaign.\n\nScott Reeves, one of the Republican operatives overseeing the PAC, told CNN in May that Pence \"has the experience, the unparalleled character, communication skills and the conservative credentials to win both the nomination and a general election.\"\n\nPence, 63, is framing himself as a traditional conservative in a field of Republicans focused on emulating Trump's combative style and as the candidate most aligned with the religious wing of the party. Pence's evangelical beliefs have been a defining feature of his public life - the former vice president said in 2017 that he won't eat alone with a woman who isn't his wife, a rule popularized by the late evangelist Billy Graham. He has described himself as \"a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican in that order.\"\n\nUnlike many of the Republicans running for president who have treaded carefully around abortion, Pence has embraced stringent restrictions on abortion rights, pledging to support a deeply unpopular national abortion ban if elected. He praised Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, another 2024 contender, for signing a six-week abortion ban in his state, even though DeSantis himself has shied away from discussing the new law.\n\nPence's refusal to overturn the election in 2020 and the few negative comments he's made against Trump don't seem to have won him any new fans. In April, Pence was booed in his home state of Indiana while speaking at the nation's largest gathering of gun rights enthusiasts.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "'What The Heck?': GOP Senators Stunned That Mike Pence Held Classified Documents\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nRepublican senators were surprised to learn about the discovery of classified material at the Indiana home of former Vice President Mike Pence , in yet another twist involving top U.S. government officials and their handling of sensitive documents.\n\n\"What the heck?\" Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) said to reporters after CNN first broke the news Tuesday.\n\n\"I don't get it,\" added Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who often handles classified information as part of his job serving on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\n\"Anybody that deals with classified materials knows they have to be maintained in a secure place and not be available to our adversaries by putting them into a place that's easily penetrated. So, it's not good,\" Cornyn added.\n\nPence's lawyers discovered \"a small number\" of documents with classification markings that were \"inadvertently boxed and transported\" to his home after his tenure as vice president, according to an attorney for Pence.\n\nPence was unaware of their existence, the attorney said, and his legal team handed them over voluntarily to the National Archives and Records Administration - an approach that stands in sharp contrast to how former President Donald Trump and his team refused for months to return classified material located at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Trump has also compared the FBI agents who conducted a search of his estate to Nazi Germany's secret police.\n\nThe news of Pence's documents comes after the discovery of classified material at President Joe Biden 's home and offices, including from his time as a senator. The Justice Department has appointed a special prosecutor to look into Biden's handling of documents with classified markings, with the White House maintaining that their misplacement was inadvertent.\n\nBut the fact that at least three top U.S. officials of both major parties had apparently mishandled classified information generated astonishment on Capitol Hill ― as well as plenty of jokes.\n\n\"I can understand the president having documents ... but a vice president or a senator? I mean, you're not that important. Come on,\" Tuberville told HuffPost when asked about the Pence revelation.\n\n\"It's either incompetence, not paying enough attention, or you're doing it on purpose,\" he added.\n\n\"What the hell's going on around here?\" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), another Senate Intelligence Committee member, told reporters when asked for his reaction to the news. He cited a \"systemic problem\" within the executive branch over the handling of classified information.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) quipped that his attorneys had \"gone through my files and have found Jimmy Hoffa's remains,\" referring to wild conspiracy theories about the labor union boss's disappearance in 1975.\n\nSen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) suggested former Vice President Dan Quayle may have to do a thorough search of his belongings, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said the \"only thing I think you'll find at my house is a bunch of Chick-fil-A bags on the floor.\"\n\nJests aside, multiple senators also suggested reexamining the government classification process because of a tendency to overclassify information, as well as reviewing the way in which officials interact with sensitive documents.\n\n\"I just can't explain it,\" Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said. \"If it's a shabby staff work, so be it. But ultimately, the elected officials have to be held responsible.\"\n\nThe revelation that Pence kept classified documents at his home has undercut weeks of Republican attacks against Biden. Some House GOP lawmakers had even suggested that the president violated the Espionage Act.\n\nRep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said he planned to seek an intelligence review and damage assessment of the classified documents from Pence's home, as he did for those found in Biden's home and offices, to check for possible national security concerns.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

His third-quarter Federal Election Commission filing showed that he had just $1.2 million in cash heading into the critical final three months before the start of the primary voting season in January, but that did not include more than $600,000 in debt to direct-mail vendors.\n\nPence was distrusted by the bloc of GOP voters who are devoted followers of former President Donald Trump following Pence's refusal to go along with Trump's Jan. 6, 2021, coup attempt. Pence only gradually began defending his actions that day, and only in the past several months did he start saying that Trump's actions disqualified him from the presidency.\n\nPence never rose above single digits in polling and may not have made the stage for the next Republican primary debate in Miami on Nov. 8.\n\nHis announcement at the annual meeting came 12 minutes into his allotted 25 minutes.\n\n\"I was raised to believe that to whom much is given, much will be required. And with everything our country is facing, I just couldn't sit this one out. But the Bible tells us there's a time for every purpose under heaven,\" he said. \"So after much prayer and deliberation, I have decided to suspend my campaign, effective today.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Mike Pence Will Be the Most Powerful Christian Supremacist in U.S. History\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nWhile Trump has flip-flopped on a variety of issues, Pence has been a reliable stalwart in the cause of Christian jihad - never wavering in his commitment to America-First militarism, the criminalizing of abortion, and utter hatred for gay people.\n\nT he election of Donald Trump has sent shockwaves through the souls of compassionate, humane people across the country and the world. Horror that a candidate who ran on a platform of open bigotry, threats against immigrants and Muslims, and blatant misogyny will soon be president is now sinking in. Trump appointed a white nationalist, Steve Bannon, as chief White House strategist - which was promptly celebrated by the American Nazi Party and the Ku Klux Klan. Bannon and other possible extremist Trump appointees, such as John Bolton, a neocon who believes the U.S. should \" bomb Iran ,\" and the authoritarian Rudy Giuliani, are now receiving much deserved public scrutiny.\n\nThe incoming vice president, Mike Pence, has not elicited the same reaction, instead often painted as the reasonable adult on the ticket, a \" counterbalance \" to Trump and a \" bridge to the establishment .\" However, there is every reason to regard him as, if anything, even more terrifying than the president-elect.\n\nPence's ascent to the second most powerful position in the U.S. government is a tremendous coup for the radical religious right. Pence - and his fellow Christian supremacist militants - would not have been able to win the White House on their own. For them, Donald Trump was a godsend. \"This may not be our preferred candidate, but that doesn't mean it may not be God's candidate to do something that we don't see,\" said David Barton, a prominent Christian-right activist and president of Wall Builders , an organization dedicated to making the U.S. government enforce \"biblical values.\" In June, Barton prophesied: \"We may look back in a few years and say, 'Wow, [Trump] really did some things that none of us expected.'\"\n\nTrump is a Trojan horse for a cabal of vicious zealots who have long craved an extremist Christian theocracy, and Pence is one of its most prized warriors. With Republican control of the House and Senate and the prospect of dramatically and decisively tilting the balance of the Supreme Court to the far right, the incoming administration will have a real shot at bringing the fire and brimstone of the second coming to Washington.\n\n\"The enemy, to them, is secularism. They want a God-led government. That's the only legitimate government,\" contends Jeff Sharlet, author of two books on the radical religious right, including \" The Family: The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power .\" \"So when they speak of business, they're speaking not of something separate from God, but they're speaking of what, in Mike Pence's circles, would be called biblical capitalism, the idea that this economic system is God-ordained.\"\n\nOne of Trump's sons, Don Jr., reportedly said that his father's vice president would be in charge of domestic and foreign policy, while Trump would focus on the vague mission of \"Making America Great Again.\" Trump's campaign subsequently claimed the story was \" made up ,\" though Trump has consistently denied saying things he is on record as saying, so who knows? In any case, the implications of a Pence vice presidency are vast. Pence combines the most horrid aspects of Dick Cheney's worldview with a belief that Tim LaHaye's \"Left Behind\" novels are not fiction, but an omniscient crystal ball.\n\nHow the GOP foisted Pence on Trump is undoubtedly a fascinating story that hopefully will some day be revealed. Obviously, Pence gave Trump badly needed credibility with evangelical voters and the GOP establishment, but Pence's selection portends a governing apocalypse. While Trump has flip-flopped on a variety of issues, from abortion to immigration to war and health care, Pence has been a reliable stalwart throughout his public life in the cause of Christian jihad - never wavering in his commitment to America-First militarism, the criminalizing of abortion, and utter hatred for gay people (unless they go into conversion therapy \" to change their sexual behavior ,\" which Pence has suggested the government pay for).\n\nHe supported making the Patriot Act permanent and wants to ban the burning of the U.S. flag. Pence does not believe federal law enforcement agencies should have to get a FISA warrant to conduct domestic surveillance and voted against requiring any warrant for domestic wiretapping. As governor of Indiana, he did quietly sign a bill to limit the use of Stingray devices by local law enforcement, though it was during the early stages of the Snowden revelations and the public concern about government surveillance was intense.\n\nPence supported giving retroactive immunity to telecom companies implicated in warrantless surveillance. He does not want congressional oversight of CIA interrogations - which Trump believes should include waterboarding and other torture \"a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.\" Pence has paid lip service to the illegality of torture but said that \"enhanced interrogation\" has saved lives. He has characterized relationship-building, non-coercive interrogation strategies as \"Oprah Winfrey methods.\" Pence is against whistleblower protections that would prohibit retaliation for reporting crimes or misdeeds. In 2002, the ACLU gave him a 7 percent rating on civil rights.\n\nHe wants the U.S. to resume the practice of holding new prisoners at Guantánamo Bay or, as Trump put it, they plan \"to fill it up.\" Pence also supports expanded use of the military tribunal system.\n\nPence has claimed that he wants to \"economically isolate\" Iran rather than engage in a military attack. But should Israel decide to conduct pre-emptive strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, he said in 2010, \"if the world knows nothing else, let the world know this: that America will stand with Israel.\" He supported a failed legislative effort to make it U.S. policy \"to use all means necessary to confront and eliminate nuclear threats posed by the Islamic Republic of Iran, including the use of military force.\" Both in rhetoric and policy, Pence has compared \"radical Islam\" to the \"evil empire of the Soviet Union\" and said that he and Trump will \"name the enemy\" and \"marshal the resources of our nation and our allies to hunt them down and destroy them before they threaten us.\"\n\nAs has been widely reported, as governor of Indiana, Pence signed a law requiring fetal tissue from abortions to be buried or cremated, making his state one of the most medieval in its approach to reproductive rights. The fetus burial law, which Pence claimed would \"ensure the dignified final treatment of the unborn,\" was suspended at the 11th hour by a federal judge, who said it was likely unconstitutional. Pence has been at the forefront of the movement to defund Planned Parenthood. \"We'll see Roe v. Wade consigned to the ash heap of history where it belongs,\" Pence promised. He has long sought to have 14th Amendment protections applied to fetuses, arguing that they should be declared persons. In Congress, Pence voted to criminally punish doctors who performed late-term abortions, except in cases where the woman's life was in danger. A doctor who \"kills a human fetus\" faces up to two years in prison, according to that law .\n\nPence opposed efforts to widen hate crimes laws to include attacks on LGBT people. He tried to block federal funding of HIV treatments unless they came with a requirement to advocate against gay relationships. Pence opposes non-straight people serving in the military. \"Homosexuality is incompatible with military service because the presence of homosexuals in the ranks weakens unit cohesion,\" he said .\n\nPence believes \"the only truly safe sex ... is no sex\" and once (falsely) claimed on CNN that \"condoms are a very, very poor protection against sexually transmitted diseases.\"\n\nPence supports the \"wall\" Trump has said he will build, believes in self-deportation, and has staked out one of the most virulent positions against the U.S. taking in refugees from Syria. In defending a proposed ban on Syrian refugees entering Indiana, Pence said it was necessary to \"ensure the safety and security of all Hoosiers.\" He has advocated for greater militarization of the so-called war on drugs, including escalated military patrols. Pence denounced activists and others protesting recent police killings of unarmed African-Americans, charging they \"seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings.\" He said he found it offensive to \"use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of implicit bias or institutional racism and that really has got to stop.\" He has said that \"police officers are the best of us.\"\n\nPence is a strong supporter of stop-and-frisk programs, which in New York were used overwhelmingly against people of color. \"It's on a sound constitutional footing,\" said Pence, who added that he wanted the practice expanded nationwide. \"Stop-and-frisk literally saved lives in New York City when it was implemented, and it's been implemented in cities around the country.\"\n\nOne interesting difference between Pence and Trump centers on the First Amendment. Trump has made clear he believes in waging war against a free press and has encouraged hostility toward journalists covering his campaign. While in Congress, Pence was a major force behind trying to get a federal shield law to protect journalists' rights to maintain confidential sources. A former radio talk show host, Pence said he was inspired to act by the case of then-New York Times reporter Judy Miller, who was imprisoned for refusing to answer questions about her sources during the scandal over the outing of undercover CIA operative Valerie Plame. No such law was ever passed and the bill provided wide latitude to nullify the protections of journalists in national security situations.\n\nWhen he joined the ticket with Trump last summer, Pence claimed they were internally reviewing the campaign policy on the treatment of journalists covering Trump events. If anything, the situation worsened as the campaign moved forward.\n\nOn health care, Pence is now on board with repealing the Affordable Care Act, though as governor he did embrace the law in a pretty bold act of hypocrisy. He also supported denying non-emergency care for people who cannot afford a Medicare co-payment and opposed expanding the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n\nPence is what might be termed \"climate change curious,\" though earlier in his political career, he wrote an essay in which he asserted , \"Global warming is a myth. The global warming treaty is a disaster. There, I said it.\" More recently, Pence has kind of acknowledged the fact-based nature of human action contributing to climate change but opposes ending any of the industrial, governmental, or corporate practices responsible. He has consistently advocated withdrawing from climate change agreements and treaties. Pence has an impressively atrocious record on environmental issues and a slavish devotion to big energy and big oil companies.\n\nHe opposed government assistance to U.S. workers who lost their jobs because of free trade agreements and has supported every neoliberal trade program since his time in public office. Pence was a loud proponent of the Trans-Pacific Partnership until he joined Trump on the ticket, and now he claims to be pondering the \"wisdom\" of the agreement.\n\nDonald Trump and Mike Pence sit together during an event at the Pastors Leadership Conference at New Spirit Revival Center on Sept. 21, 2016, in Cleveland, Ohio. Photo: Evan Vucci/AP M ike Pence was raised Catholic, in a Kennedy Democrat household, but he has been a devout evangelical since being converted at a Christian music festival in Kentucky while in college. Pence now describes himself as \"a Christian, a Conservative, and a Republican, in that order.\" Even his political action committee's name gives off a crusader vibe: Principles Exalt a Nation.\n\nDonald Trump and Mike Pence sit together during an event at the Pastors Leadership Conference at New Spirit Revival Center on Sept. 21, 2016, in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nPence opposed imposing restrictions on no-bid contracting, which may help explain his close relationship to Erik Prince, the founder of Blackwater. In December 2007, three months after Blackwater operatives gunned down 17 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad's Nisour Square, Pence and his Republican Study Committee, which served \"the purpose of advancing a conservative social and economic agenda in the House of Representatives,\" organized a gathering to welcome Prince to Washington. But their relationship is not just forged in wars. Prince and his mother, Elsa, have been among the top funders of scores of anti-gay-marriage ballot initiatives across the country and have played a key role in financing efforts to criminalize abortion.\n\nPrince has long given money to Pence's political campaigns, and toward the end of the presidential election, he contributed $100,000 to the pro-Trump/Pence Super PAC Make America Number 1. Prince's mother kicked in another $50,000. Ironically, Erik Prince - who portrays himself as a mix between Indiana Jones, Rambo, Captain America, and Pope Benedict - is now working with the Chinese government through his latest \"private security\" firm.\n\nErik Prince, the founder of Blackwater, participates in a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on Oct. 2, 2007, in Washington, D.C.\n\nErik Prince's father, Edgar, built up a very successful manufacturing business in Holland, Michigan, and became one of the premier bankrollers of what came to be known as the radical religious right. They gave Gary Bauer the seed money to start the Family Research Council and poured money into James Dobson's Focus on the Family. \"Ed Prince was not an empire builder. He was a Kingdom builder,\" Bauer recalled soon after the elder Prince's death. \"For him, personal success took a back seat to spreading the Gospel and fighting for the moral restoration of our society.\" Erik Prince's sister Betsy married Dick DeVos, whose father, Richard, founded the multilevel marketing firm Amway and went on to own the Orlando Magic basketball team. The two families merged together like the monarchies of old Europe and swiftly emerged as platinum-level contributors to far-right Christian causes and political figures.\n\nThe Prince and DeVos families gave the seed money for what came to be known as the Republican Revolution when Newt Gingrich became House speaker in 1994 on a far-right platform known as the Contract with America. The Prince and DeVos clans also invested heavily in a scheme developed by Dobson to engage in back-door lobbying activities by forming \"prayer warrior\" networks of people who would call politicians to advocate for Dobson's religious and political agenda. Instead of lobbying, which the organization would have been prohibited from doing because of its tax and legal status, they would claim they were \"praying\" for particular policies.\n\nThe Princes consistently poured money into criminalizing abortion, privatizing education, blocking gay rights, and other right-wing causes centered around their interpretation of Christianity. The family, especially Erik, was very close to Richard Nixon's \"hatchet man,\" Watergate conspirator Charles \"Chuck\" Colson. The author of Nixon's enemies list, Colson was the first person sentenced in the Watergate scandal, after pleading guilty to obstruction of justice in the investigation of the dirty tricks campaign against Daniel Ellsberg, the whistleblower who leaked the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam War. Colson became a born-again Christian before going to prison, and after his release, he started the Prison Fellowship, which sought to convert prisoners to Christianity to counter what Colson saw as the Islamic menace in U.S. prisons. Erik Prince funded this as well and went on prison visits with Colson.\n\nAll of these figures, bankrolled by the Prince family, are the ideological and theological ascendants of Mike Pence, who called Colson \"a dear friend and mentor.\" Colson and his allies viewed the administration of Bill Clinton as a secular \"regime\" and openly contemplated a faith-based revolution. In the early '90s, Colson teamed up with conservative evangelical minister-turned-Catholic priest Richard Neuhaus and others to build a unified movement. That work ultimately led in 1994 to the controversial document \"Evangelicals and Catholics Together: The Christian Mission in the Third Millennium.\" (Note: I wrote extensively about this in my book \"Blackwater: The Rise of the World's Most Powerful Mercenary Army\" and drew heavily on that for this story.) Pence has described himself as \"a born-again, evangelical Catholic.\"\n\nThe ECT manifesto declared:\n\nThe century now drawing to a close has been the greatest century of missionary expansion in Christian history. We pray and we believe that this expansion has prepared the way for yet greater missionary endeavor in the first century of the Third Millennium. The two communities in world Christianity that are most evangelistically assertive and most rapidly growing are Evangelicals and Catholics.\n\nThe signatories called for a unification of these religions in a common missionary cause, that \"all people will come to faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.\" They asserted that religion is \"privileged and foundational in our legal order\" and spelled out the need to defend \"the moral truths of our constitutional order.\" The document was most passionate in its opposition to abortion, calling abortion on demand \"a massive attack on the dignity, rights, and needs of women. Abortion is the leading edge of an encroaching culture of death.\" It also called for \"moral education\" in schools, advocating for educational institutions \"that transmit to coming generations our cultural heritage, which is inseparable from the formative influence of religion, especially Judaism and Christianity.\"\n\nThe ECT signers, according to author Damon Linker - who worked for Neuhaus for years - \"had not only forged a historic theological and political alliance. They had also provided a vision of America's religious and political future. It would be a religious future in which upholding theological orthodoxy and moral traditionalism overrode doctrinal disagreements. And it would be a political future in which the most orthodox and traditionalist Christians set the public tone and policy agenda for the nation.\"\n\nIn November 1996 - the month Clinton crushed Bob Dole and won re-election - an organ of what Linker termed the theoconservative movement, Richard Neuhaus's journal First Things, published a \"symposium\" titled \"The End of Democracy?\" Acknowledging that it might be viewed as \"irresponsibly provocative and even alarmist,\" the symposium bluntly questioned \"whether we have reached or are reaching the point where conscientious citizens can no longer give moral assent to the existing regime.\" A series of essays raised the prospect of a major confrontation between the church and the \"regime,\" at times seeming to predict a civil-war scenario or Christian insurrection against the government, exploring possibilities \"ranging from noncompliance to resistance to civil disobedience to morally justified revolution.\"\n\nChuck Colson authored one of the five major essays in the issue, as did the extremist judge Robert Bork, whom Reagan had tried unsuccessfully to appoint to the Supreme Court in 1987. Colson's essay was titled \"Kingdoms in Conflict.\" \"Events in America may have reached the point where the only political action believers can take is some kind of direct, extra-political confrontation of the judicially controlled regime,\" Colson wrote, adding that a \"showdown between church and state may be inevitable. This is not something for which Christians should hope. But it is something for which they need to prepare.\"\n\nDobson said the essays \"laid an indisputable case for the illegitimacy of the regime now passing itself off as a democracy,\" adding, \"I stand in a long tradition of Christians who believe that rulers may forfeit their divine mandate when they systematically contravene the divine moral law. ... We may rapidly be approaching the sort of Rubicon that our spiritual forebears faced: Choose Caesar or God. I take no pleasure in this prospect; I pray against it. But it is worth noting that such times have historically been rejuvenating for the faith.\"\n\nMike Pence looks out over the crowd as President Barack Obama answers a question at the Republican GOP House Issues Conference in Baltimore, Maryland, on Jan. 29, 2010.\n\nDonald Trump's grasp of the bible is certainly not up to the standards of Pence and the religious zealots behind him. \"Two Corinthians 3:17, that's the whole ballgame,\" Trump declared - in the same way he spits out \"Make America Great Again\" - in front of an audience at an evangelical college on the campaign trail. People laughed. At him. It is Second Corinthians.\n\nPerhaps that episode is telling. The radical religious right doesn't need to save Trump's soul. As they saw in the campaign, Trump has staked out a hateful agenda - one that tracks quite well with the crusades of Pence and his fellow apostles. Even if elements of Trump's vile rhetoric and his various threats were a psychotic form of performance art, or mere opportunistic political strategy, as some suggest, they have set the stage for the pursuit of a civilizational war that poses a dire threat to vulnerable populations throughout the world. President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and a slew of prominent Democrats have publicly said that Americans should give Trump a chance. With Mike Pence seated at the right hand of the father, running foreign and domestic policy, they will do so at their peril.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have?

      "text": "Unmasked in Iowa: CEOs Who Came to Meet Pence in Masks Were Asked to Remove Them\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBefore Vice President Mike Pence arrived to meet food industry executives in Iowa on Friday, five of them were asked to remove the masks they were wearing.\n\nMike Pence was unmasked in Iowa on Friday, attending two events without covering his face, even though public health officials say masks slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus and one of the vice president's aides tested positive for Covid-19 just before he departed Washington.\n\nTwo days later, the recklessness of that behavior came into sharper focus as Bloomberg News reported that Pence had decided to self-isolate at his home in Washington over the weekend - skipping a White House meeting with military leaders on Saturday - because his press secretary, Katie Miller , had tested positive for the virus on Friday. Miller did not accompany Pence to Iowa, but if his exposure to her before the trip made his self-isolation necessary the next day, that made his decision to spend Friday meeting at least 19 officials, food industry executives and religious leaders in Iowa, unmasked, all the more questionable.\n\nWhat's more, a Des Moines Register live stream of the second event Pence attended on Friday, a roundtable discussion with food industry leaders at Hy-Vee corporate headquarters in West Des Moines, showed that all five of the invited guests arrived wearing masks but were asked to remove them shortly before the vice president joined them on stage.\n\nRon Cameron of Mountaire Farms, Ken Sullivan of Smithfield Foods, Rodney McMullen of Kroger, Noel White of Tyson Foods and Zippy Duvall, the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, were asked to remove their masks before a meeting with Mike Pence in Iowa on Friday.\n\nThe vice president's office declined to tell The Intercept who the woman was, but Brianne Pfannenstiel of the Register reported later that a Trump administration official said the woman was \"an advance staffer,\" who had been dispatched from Washington to manage set-up for the event.\n\nTwo of those executives, Ken Sullivan of Smithfield Foods and Noel White of Tyson Foods, run meatpacking plants where hundreds of workers have contracted Covid-19, including a Tyson plant in Waterloo, Iowa where more than a third of the workforce - 1,031 people - has tested positive and at least three workers have died. The Tyson plant in Waterloo was reopened on Thursday following an executive order from President Donald Trump that designated the meat supply \"critical infrastructure.\"\n\nThe strange request to the executives to remove their masks underscored just how committed the White House is to ignoring federal health advice intended to slow the spread of the pandemic coronavirus.\n\nAlthough the vice president appeared to follow social distancing guidelines during the discussion, he did not wear a mask, nor did any of the officials who accompanied him on Air Force Two from Washington: Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Iowa's two Republican senators, Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst. The Des Moines Register reported that, before the event, \"staffers with gloves and masks took the temperatures of people who entered the building one at a time.\" Video of the hall showed that very few of the people in the audience were wearing masks.\n\nAfter the event, at which the chief executive of Smithfield Foods choked up when mentioning the death of a worker from Covid-19, the union that represents Iowa meat-packers, who have been forced back to work by an executive order from the president despite outbreaks at their plants, suggested that it would have been more useful for Pence, Perdue, Grassley and Ernst to have worked a shift alongside them. \"They should work in the same conditions and under the same fear that our members and their fellow Iowans work under every day,\" the United Food and Commercial Workers union said in a statement .\n\nVideo of the earlier event attended by the vice president, a meeting with Iowa faith leaders to discuss the planned reopening of places of worship, showed that just one participant, Rabbi David Kaufman, wore a mask.\n\n. @VP Pence in Iowa ... Rabbi David Kaufman @RavDK of Temple B'nai Jeshurun in Des Moines ... Westkirk Presbyterian Church in Urbandale pic.twitter.com/hkZFQXn6Px\n\n- Howard Mortman (@HowardMortman) May 8, 2020\n\nKaufman told Pence that his community was not ready to return to in-person services, partly because of the importance of singing in their services, which spreads even more respiratory droplets than speaking.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nWhen he was asked last week why he had refused to wear a mask at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, Pence argued that the precaution was unnecessary for anyone, like him, who is tested so regularly that he can be sure that he is not infected with the virus, and so cannot not spread it to anyone else.\n\nThat, however, relies on the testing being, as the president has claimed, \"perfect,\" which it most definitely is not. In fact, the new rapid-response Abbott ID NOW test kit for Covid-19 used in the White House produced false negatives nearly 15 percent of the time in research conducted in April, as the director of the National Institutes of Health reminded senators on Thursday.\n\nEven more reliable testing that uses invasive nasal swabs and takes longer to get results can produce some false negatives. \"An infected person could get a so-called 'false negative' test result if the swab missed the virus, for example,\" Harvard Medical School's Coronavirus Resource Center notes . \"We also don't yet know at what point during the course of illness a test becomes positive.\" False negatives also appear more likely for people who are carrying the virus but have no symptoms.\n\nThat means that someone like Pence could go out into the world with a false sense of security after testing negative and unwittingly infect someone else by not wearing a mask while speaking loudly enough to spray the virus in salivary droplets on to their face.\n\nThat was theoretically possible last week, when Pence was the only person at the Mayo Clinic not following its mandatory mask-wearing policy, but it was even more obviously so on Friday when his press secretary, Katie Miller , tested positive for the virus just one day after she had tested negative.\n\nNo less an authority on science than President Donald Trump noted on Friday that Miller's different results on consecutive days indicated a problem with \" the whole concept of tests .\" Trump, however, was deeply confused as to what, exactly, the problem was with trying to use testing alone to construct a virtual virus-free bubble around him.\n\nWhile the president suggested, wrongly, that the only possible explanation was that Miller had somehow contracted the virus overnight, the fact is that her positive test, along with that of a White House valet the day before, exposes the absurdity of the president refusing to wear a mask or let anyone around him do so.\n\nBy prioritizing his immense vanity, or a fear of looking weak, or being laughed at, or a desire to downplay the severity of the crisis over his own health and that of his vice president, aides and followers, the president is not just failing to model good behavior, he is actively discouraging it , and so helping the virus that's killed at least 77,000 Americans to threaten the lives of many more.\n\nLast Updated: Tuesday, May 12, 11:26 a.m. PDT This article was updated on Saturday with a new headline; on Sunday, to note that Vice President Mike Pence reportedly entered self-isolation after his trip to Iowa; on Tuesday, with new information on the identity of the woman who instructed executives to remove their masks.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Dear Vice President Mike Pence: Please Use the 25th Amendment to Remove Trump and Save Us From the Coronavirus\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nDonald Trump lacks the mental capacity to manage the Covid-19 crisis. Pence should use the 25th Amendment to remove him from power.\n\nVice President Mike Pence listens as President Donald Trump speaks during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on March 21, 2020.\n\nDear Mr. Vice President,\n\nIt's time. We can't wait any longer. You need to invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nYou know what it says: \"Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.\"\n\nThe truth of the matter is that President Donald Trump does not have the mental capability to \"discharge the powers and duties of his office.\" Amid an unprecedented political, economic, and public health crisis, the commander-in-chief is unwell - and unfit.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nYou know this. On Friday, you were standing next to the president in the White House briefing room when NBC correspondent Peter Alexander asked him what he had to say to Americans who \"are scared right now\" because of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump responded with inexplicable rage , denouncing Alexander as a \"terrible reporter\" for asking a \"nasty\" question, and then mocking the owners of NBC - telecom giant Comcast - as \"Con-cast.\"\n\nIt was an insane response to the simplest of simple questions, but don't take my word for it. \"These are psychiatric symptoms, not simply boorish behaviors,\" tweeted John Talmadge, clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. \"Trump is mentally ill, cognitively compromised, brain impaired. He can't even recognize a softball tossed his way.\"\n\nBut you can, Mr. Vice President. You later went up to the podium and answered Alexander's question: \"I would say, 'Do not be afraid to be vigilant.'\" You seem to be able to do the job of president that Trump is manifestly unable to do. You have won praise for your handling of the crisis from senior Democrats like Washington Gov. Jay Inslee - in stark contrast to your boss, who lashed out at Inslee and called him a \"snake.\" As the New York Times has also reported , some of your former critics at the state level \"have changed their mind about Mr. Pence, who has given near-daily briefings and, they said, has become a reassuring presence even as Mr. Trump has intermittently tried to retake the stage.\"\n\nDon't get me wrong: I'm no fan of you or your far-right politics . I am well aware of your long history of challenging the science on everything from climate change to evolution to cancer . But, this time round, you recognize the scale of the problem, the scope of the crisis, the severity of the threat posed by Covid-19.\n\nThe president, bizarrely, inexcusably, outrageously, does not. He is off in his own demented, fact-free, navel-gazing, alternative universe. Again, don't take my word for it. Listen to Bandy X. Lee, clinical professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine. Trump \"dangerously lacks mental capacity,\" she told me, \"which he exhibits through his inability to take in information and advice, to process critical information, or to consider consequences before making impulsive, unstable, and irrational decisions that are not based in reality but fight reality.\" At press conferences, she added, he pushes \"delusional-level distortion and misinformation\" because he is \"disconnected from reality.\" His leadership, she concluded, is \"more harmful than if we had no president.\"\n\nThis is a president who rambles, rants, and raves; who spent weeks downplaying the spread of the novel coronavirus and ignoring warnings from his own intelligence agencies; who claimed to be unaware that Americans who need tests are unable to get them; who uses press briefings not to inform the public but to regularly attack the press ; who went golfing while health professionals begged for resources and equipment; who has repeatedly contradicted his own top scientists by pushing unproven drugs as a treatment for Covid-19; who tried to buy a vaccine from Germany but only for \" exclusive \" use in the United States; who took a break from crisis management to go on Twitter and complain about Hillary Clinton's emails and Benghazi.\n\nHow is this behavior not utterly unhinged? How does it not justify you invoking the 25th Amendment on behalf of the American people, who are being infected by Covid-19 in rapidly increasing numbers ?\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage The Coronavirus Crisis\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nLook, I get it. You're a sycophant . You're a coward. You're afraid of standing up to a vicious boss and his cultish supporters. But ask yourself this: Are you more afraid of Trump and his MAGA base, or for your own life and the lives of those you love and cherish? This past weekend, you and your wife had to get tested for Covid-19. It is only a matter of time until someone you care about tests positive or - God forbid - dies from the disease. In years to come, do you really want to look back on this historic moment and regret not having stepped in, with the clear authority granted to you under the Constitution, to do a better, saner, more stable job of fighting the pandemic than the current occupant of the Oval Office?\n\nPerhaps you think the supermajority required in both chambers of Congress for you to stay in office if the president resists his removal and formally declares in writing \" that no inability exists ,\" makes it impossible for you to successfully invoke the 25th Amendment.\n\nBut events are moving fast. Nothing is predictable anymore. And, as Adam Gustafson pointed out in the Yale Law & Policy Review in 2008, under the Section 4 process, \"the Acting President can enjoy at least four days of presidential power - four days to advance his own policy goals, to prove himself a capable executive, and to acclimate Congress and the public to his presence in the Oval Office. By the time Congress is allowed to vote, the deck may already be stacked against the President.\"\n\nIt is also worth noting that in 2016, when Trump picked you as his running mate, the New York Times reported that it was because of your \"unimpeachable conservative credentials, warm relationships in Washington and a vast reservoir of good will with the Christian right.\" If anyone can persuade Republicans in Congress that Trump has to go, that he is mentally unable to perform his presidential duties during this historic crisis, it's you.\n\nRemember: The framers of the 25th Amendment deliberately decided against providing a definition of the \"unable to discharge\" phrase. However, the late Birch Bayh, the senator from your state of Indiana who sponsored the 25th Amendment, made it clear that it related to mental, as well as physical, inability. \"It is conceivable,\" Bayh said , \"that a President might be able to walk, for example, and thus, by the definition of some people, might be physically able, but at the same time he might not possess the mental capacity to make a decision and perform the powers and duties of his office.\"\n\nDo you really believe that Trump has the \"mental capacity\" to protect millions of Americans from this pandemic? A president who tried to prevent dozens of infected Americans on a cruise ship from returning to the United States because, he admitted , \"I like the numbers being where they are\"?\n\nRemember also: This is a decision for you to make, based on your own insights and experiences, with or without the assistance of medical professionals. \"What the framers of the 25th Amendment had in mind was a judgment call by the vice president and by the cabinet,\" John D. Feerick, Fordham School of Law's former dean, told me. Feerick, who assisted in the drafting of the amendment in 1965, pointed out that the framers picked the vice president and \"principal officers of the executive departments\" for this task because, as a result of their proximity to the president, they would have the greatest insight into the president's mental health and stability. As high-level political appointees of the president, they would also have the greatest credibility in the eyes of Congress and the public, and could not be automatically dismissed as political opponents or partisans.\n\nYou must act now. Extreme times call for extreme measures. Yes, Section 4 of the 25th Amendment has never before been invoked by a vice president. But, then again, as you yourself probably realized long ago, no vice president has ever before had to deal with a president like Trump.\n\nLast October, after your boss glibly suggested he might \" destroy and obliterate \" the Turkish economy, Daniel Gilbert, professor of psychology at Harvard University, suggested that the president should be detained and examined. \"Am I the only psychologist who finds this claim and this threat truly alarming? Wouldn't these normally trigger a mental health hold? Right and Left must set aside politics and agree that there is a serious problem here,\" Gilbert tweeted .\n\nA \"serious problem\" is an understatement. Millions of American lives are at stake. Yet the American president is out of control, out of touch with reality. You know it. I know it. Anyone with eyes and ears knows it.\n\nSincerely, Mehdi Hasan\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

      "text": "Mike Pence's Egypt Trip Gives Glimmer of Hope to Advocates of American Political Prisoners\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBut the advocates aren't holding their breath.\n\nFor Moustafa Kassem, August 14, 2013 began as just another day in Cairo, where he was spending some time. The 52-year-old auto-parts dealer needed to run a simple errand in the Nasr City neighborhood: trading dollars for Egyptian pounds. Around noon, Kassem left the house where he was staying, about 7 miles from Nasr City, despite an ominous start to the day.\n\nThat morning, Egyptian security forces had started their round-up of demonstrators camped out in Nasr City's Rab'a Square, a protest against the military coup the month before led by Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, now Egypt's president. By 1:30 p.m., around when Kassem left the currency exchange, the crackdown on Rab'a Square had intensified. More police and soldiers were on the streets in Nasr City, according to his brother-in-law, Mustafa Ahmed, who accompanied him on the errand.\n\nAs Kassem and Ahmed tried to go up the street where their car was parked, an army officer stationed there had cut off the route, according to Ahmed. (Ahmed requested that The Intercept refer to him only by that name for fear of retaliation from Egyptian security when he travels back to the country.) Kassem was perturbed, Ahmed told The Intercept, demanding that the army officer allow him to walk up the street to the car. It would be a grave mistake.\n\nThe officer aimed his gun at Kassem and cocked it. Kassem pulled out his American passport. \"I'm an American,\" he said. \"I have the right to go get my car.\" But the officer threw his passport on the ground, stomped on it, and then threw Kassem down. A group of nearby soldiers began to beat him. Kassem was handcuffed and put in an army truck, ensnaring the American in a brutal crackdown in and around Rab'a Square that ultimately resulted in the killings of at least 817 people and the arrests of hundreds more. Kassem has been in jail ever since. Because he has yet to be convicted of any crime, his detention has no end in sight. And as the days of Kassem's imprisonment have ticked by, his own government has given Egypt over $6.8 billion in military and economic aid. Photo of Moustafa Kassem before he was imprisoned. Photo: Courtesy of the Kassem family Kassem, who normally lives in a quiet New York suburb, became one of an estimated 60,000 political prisoners caught in the wide web of Egypt's repressive security forces. Unlike the vast majority of those prisoners, Kassem, along with an estimated 19 others, has American citizenship, which has brought his case to the attention of American diplomats, members of Congress, and Vice President Mike Pence, who met with Sisi on January 20 in Cairo to discuss counterterrorism and U.S. policy in the region.\n\nPhoto of Moustafa Kassem before he was imprisoned.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Pence's visit to Egypt, human rights advocates stepped up their efforts to bring attention to the plight of the imprisoned Americans, holding a press call for journalists, contacting members of Congress, and urging the White House to raise the detainees' cases with Egyptian officials.\n\nKassem also spoke out from his jail cell before Pence arrived. In a handwritten letter smuggled out of prison, Kassem wrote to President Donald Trump that all he longs for is \"to be reunited with my children back in New York\" - a \"dream of reunion that is many times interrupted with the grim reality of my prison cell and screams of torture in a faint distance.\" The letter was sent to the White House on January 18.\n\nTheir efforts seemed to have worked. Pence told reporters that he brought up the cases of Kassem and Ahmed Etiwy, another imprisoned American, during his talk with Sisi. \"Sisi assured me\" that he would give \"very serious attention\" to those cases, Pence said.\n\n\"I told him we'd like to see those American citizens restored to their families and restored to our country,\" the vice president added.\n\nPence's remarks, which marked the first time a White House official has publicly raised the plight of jailed Egyptian-Americans, were a positive sign for the families of Kassem and Etiwy, though Pence did not mention the other 18 Americans in jail, nor did he bring up the plight of two American green card holders being held in solitary confinement.\n\n\"I was very happy,\" said Ahmed, Kassem's brother-in-law. \"The vice president gave me hope.\"\n\nStill, Egypt experts cautioned that more needed to be done to make progress on freeing the Egyptian-Americans.\n\n\"There should be public criticism and explicit statements that we believe those individuals were arrested and imprisoned unjustly on politicized charges, and explicit calls that they be released,\" said Andrew Miller, who handled U.S.-Egypt relations in President Barack Obama's National Security Council and served in Trump's State Department for nine months. \"There has to be some gesture toward the consequences if they don't follow through on our request. At the very least, we should be willing to say how they handle this will have implications for the relationship and the ability of the administration to cooperate with Egypt.\"\n\nPence's remarks in Cairo were a surprising about-face from an administration that had said criticism of Egypt should remain private and ignored pleas from human rights advocates to speak up about the jailed Americans. The U.S.-based lawyers for three current and former American detainees, Praveen Madhiraju and Fred Crombie, and Mohamed Soltan, an American who was imprisoned in Egypt, had contacted the White House over a dozen times about the detainees' cases and received no response.\n\n\"We didn't know they were involved. We hadn't heard directly from them,\" said Madhiraju. \"But clearly, they did know about these cases and got the message that there were real injustices against Americans in Egypt.\"\n\nFor the past four years, the Kassem family has had to learn how to fight for Moustafa without the help of their government. That battle started on August 14, 2013, the last time the Kassem family saw Moustafa for 20 days. After he was arrested, Kassem disappeared into the black hole of Egypt's prison system until his family, after calling Egyptian officials around the country, located him in Abu Zaabal prison, north of Cairo. When Ahmed, his brother-in-law, visited him, he said he could not recognize Kassem because of how badly he had been beaten by jail officers.\n\n\"I couldn't recognize him. His face [was] not a face,\" Ahmed said. \"The face, you cannot see eyes. You cannot see nose. You cannot see lips. It's big, black, blue, green, and no eyes, no nothing. So I told him, at least he's alive.\"\n\nAccording to family members, Kassem has skin cancer and diabetes, and his health is deteriorating.\n\n\"I'm so afraid that he will get worse and worse, and I don't know what's going to happen,\" said Eman Kassem, Moustafa Kassem's sister.\n\nTwo weeks after Kassem's detention, Egyptian prosecutors charged him with protesting with intent to cause chaos and overthrow the government, collaborating with the Muslim Brotherhood - the now-banned Islamist group that led Egypt's first and last democratic government, before the coup - and spreading false news. (Kassem's family denies all the charges.) He is being prosecuted alongside over 700 other defendants in one of a number of mass trials Egyptian officials have overseen since the 2013 military coup as part of an effort to stamp out dissent.\n\nOver four years later, however, Kassem has not been convicted. His trial has been delayed over 40 times. And his lawyer says Egyptian prosecutors have presented no specific evidence tying him to the crimes he is charged with - a common defect of these mass trials.\n\n\"There's no way to prove whether or not they were or weren't there,\" said Brad Youngblood, a research assistant at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, a Washington think tank. \"The state cannot prove it, their lawyer cannot disprove it, and they're in this sort of legal limbo until the executive decides that it's politically useful for them to be let out of prison.\"\n\nMembers of Egyptian security forces stand guard outside one of the gate of the Tora prison on Aug. 21, 2013, in Cairo.\n\nAs Kassem spends his days in Tora prison in southern Cairo, where he was transferred about seven months into his detention, his family and advocates are busy trying to get the attention of lawmakers and, most importantly, the White House.\n\nAccording to Ahmed, Kassem was routinely beaten up in jail during the beginning of his detention in an effort to make him confess to the charges. Even more dangerously for Kassem, his insulin pump was taken away when he was first arrested. Kassem managed to survive for the first few months by eating little and taking sugar control pills that jail officers allowed in.\n\nThe family, however, has managed to stop the abuse and get Kassem medical help, thanks to their communication with Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., Kassem's representative in Congress. As soon as Ahmed got back to New York, in September 2013, he got in touch with King's office. Staffers there, in turn, contacted the U.S. embassy in Cairo about Kassem's situation. About five months after Kassem was arrested, U.S. officials brought Kassem his insulin pump, according to Ahmed. The U.S. embassy's involvement also seems to have halted the beatings.\n\nEmbassy officials have continued to monitor Kassem's case. \"The Department of State takes seriously its responsibilities to assist U.S. citizens abroad,\" a State Department official told The Intercept, speaking anonymously in keeping with department protocol. \"We are aware of media reports on the arrest of Mustafa Kassem in Egypt. When a U.S. citizen is detained overseas, the Department works to provide all appropriate consular assistance.\"\n\nThe State Department, however, can only do so much without a fully staffed embassy in Cairo or Near East Affairs bureau in Washington. Trump has not appointed an ambassador to Egypt, nor has he appointed a permanent assistant secretary for Near East Affairs - a situation that leaves a diminished diplomatic apparatus that can undercut U.S. leverage in meetings with Egyptian counterparts.\n\n\"It's like going to do diplomatic battle with one hand tied behind your back, because most other governments, and this would certainly be true of Egypt, look to those positions as people with some kind of credibility and political standing in the American system that they can do business with and talk to,\" said Thomas Melia, a former senior State Department official who served in the Obama administration.\n\nActing secretaries and ambassadors \"aren't seen by the foreign governments as the serious people that they should be,\" said Melia, and as a result, Egypt will take these officials less seriously when raising the cases of American citizens in jail.\n\nAdvocates for American prisoners in Egypt, in addition to pressing the State Department, have been working the halls of Congress - and have had some success there. Take Mohamed Soltan, an Egyptian-American jailed after the 2013 military coup and released in May 2015.\n\nIn recent months, Soltan worked with the office of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to bring attention to the plight of Kassem and Ahmed Etiwy, another Egyptian-American arrested in August 2013. McCain sent a letter to Trump in August, writing that the imprisonment of Etiwy \"seems to be part of a troubling crackdown on independent voices across Egypt over the past several years.\" McCain, a critic of Egyptian authoritarianism, also raised Kassem's case in an accompanying statement.\n\n\"President Trump must also demand the immediate release of the nearly 20 American citizens wrongly imprisoned in Egypt, including Ahmed Etwiy and Mustafa Kassem, who have been detained on false allegations [and] jailed for four years without sentencing,\" McCain said. (Etiwy was convicted in September on charges of murder and sabotage of public property, among others - charges his family and lawyer reject. He was sentenced to five years, but including time served, will get out next August. Once released, he will have to check in with Egyptian police every day for five years.)\n\nIn addition to McCain's intervention, 71 House members sent a letter to Pence in December, urging him to encourage Egyptian officials to \"release any American citizens or Legal Permanent Residents who have been arbitrarily detained.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Democratic New York Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, who represent Kassem and Etiwy's mothers, have been publically silent on the cases. Praveen Madhiraju, the U.S. lawyer for Kassem and Etiwy, has briefed their staffs, but the senators have not made any statements. (Schumer and Gillibrand's offices did not return requests for comment.)\n\nAya Hijazi, center, a dual U.S.-Egyptian citizen, is acquitted by an Egyptian court after nearly three years of detention over accusations related to running a foundation dedicated to helping street children, Cairo, Sunday, April 16, 2017.\n\nTo get Kassem and the other Egyptian-Americans out of jail now, the families need more than a congressional intervention. They need the White House to intervene on a sustained basis.\n\n\"Public statements from other high-level officials, whether it's the vice president or secretary of state, [is] sufficient to create a public push for releasing them,\" said Andrew Miller, the former State Department official, who is now a deputy director at the Project on Middle East Democracy. But \"unless President Trump personally engages with the Egyptians and makes clear he wants it to happen, the Egyptians won't view it as the high priority as it should be.\"\n\nThe power of White House intervention was demonstrated in April. When Sisi, the Egyptian president, visited Washington, Trump brought up the case of Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American aid worker jailed in May 2014, on what were widely seen as bogus charges of human trafficking and sexual exploitation. Hijazi was freed three weeks after the Sisi-Trump meeting.\n\n\"I really would appreciate it if you would look into this and let her out,\" Trump said he told Sisi.\n\nHijazi's April release initially buoyed the hopes of the families of other Egyptian-American detainees. Those hopes dimmed as the months passed by, and their relatives remained in jail.\n\nHowever, Pence's January 20 comments may mean that the White House, after a year of ignoring calls to raise the plight of the imprisoned Americans in Egypt, is getting serious about the detainees.\n\n\"We really want to thank Vice President Pence,\" said Madhiraju, the lawyer for Etiwy and Kassem, \"but there's still work to be done before they come home. Ahmed and Moustafa are still in jail. And President Sisi didn't guarantee anything; he just said he'll look into the issues. So they're not home. We need to keep pushing until both Ahmed and Moustafa are home.\"\n\nTop photo: Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi meets with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence at the Presidential Palace in the capital Cairo on Jan. 20, 2018.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Let's Be Honest About What Trump Wanted on January 6\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA handful of Republican members of Congress stared into Medusa's face and refused to blink. The rest looked away.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks from a Jumbotron screen as crowds gather for the \"Stop the Steal\" rally in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nDonald Trump heavily promoted the January 6 rally in Washington. He fired up the crowd and urged them to march on the Capitol. That much is undisputed. What's been emerging in the past few days goes much, much further.\n\nAfter Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., told Trump that Vice President Mike Pence had been rushed out of the Senate chamber, his security in question, Trump posted to Twitter, raging at Pence's betrayal. That's according to Tuberville, who stands by his account even as others, including Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee, call it into question.\n\n\"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify,\" Trump posted. \"USA demands the truth!\"\n\nThe mob, meanwhile, was rampaging the building, chanting, \"Hang Mike Pence!\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThat Trump, according to Tuberville, attacked Pence publicly after learning the former vice president was under threat strongly suggests that Trump was eager to see the mob locate Pence and do what they would with him. As the New York Times has reported, Trump also told Pence earlier that day that he'd \"go down in history as a pussy\" if he didn't try to flip the election to Trump. Trump clearly wanted the crowd to grab him. If you're famous, they let you do it.\n\nAdded to that new piece of evidence are the claims of Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, a Washington state Republican, about her conversation with her party's House leader, Kevin McCarthy, after McCarthy got into a shouting match with Trump. McCarthy and his staff were barricaded in an office, McCarthy told Herrera Beutler, fearing for their lives, when McCarthy pleaded with Trump to call off the mob. Trump initially denied that the mob was made up of his people. McCarthy told him he was wrong, and again demanded that he do something, anything - go on TV, post to Twitter - to call them off. \"Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,\" Trump reportedly said, allowing the violence to rage on.\n\n\"I think it speaks to the former President's mindset,\" said Rep. Anthony Gonzalez , another Republican. \"He was not sorry to see his unyieldingly loyal vice president or the Congress under attack by the mob he inspired. In fact, it seems he was happy about it or at the least enjoyed the scenes that were horrifying to most Americans across the country.\"\n\n\"You have to look at what he did during the insurrection to confirm where his mind was at,\" Herrera Beutler told CNN . \"That line right there demonstrates to me that either he didn't care, which is impeachable, because you cannot allow an attack on your soil, or he wanted it to happen and was OK with it, which makes me so angry.\" Republican members of Congress are staring into Medusa's face and refusing to blink.\n\nWe can't look away from this simple set of facts: All the evidence points to the conclusion not just that Trump recklessly whipped up a mob that went on to storm the Capitol, but also that he wanted that mob to succeed in finding and attacking those who stood in the way of his return to the presidency. Of course, nobody can know what exactly went on inside Trump's mind that day, but his conversation with Tuberville, the subsequent tweet, and his conversation with McCarthy point in a very dark direction.\n\nTrump supporters near the U.S Capitol erected gallows and a noose in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nWas there a rational basis for Trump to believe that the insurrection could have succeeded? It's possible to put one together: If Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had been killed or badly injured and the votes not certified, Trump could have declared some sort of state of emergency and - this is the key point - lived to fight another day.\n\nLiving to fight another day is Trump's life philosophy. Just ahead of the 2018 midterms, Trump, at a rally, acknowledged that he might lose the House. \"It could happen. Could happen,\" he said. \"And you know what you do? My whole life, you know what I say? 'Don't worry about it, I'll just figure it out.' Does that make sense? I'll figure it out.\"\n\nThis was Trump's M.O. throughout his business life. Faced with what appeared to be inevitable defeat, his last resort was always to create chaos, not because it would naturally lead to success, but because it would at least reset the situation and give his incredible lucky streak another opportunity to assert itself. Trump didn't know exactly how things would play out if the mob succeeded in its mission, but he knew how things would go if it didn't: He would lose. And he was ready to kill to stave that off.\n\nOn Saturday, the Senate voted to subpoena testimony from witnesses, with House managers saying that they'd like to hear from Herrera Beutler, who likely knows the names of other Republicans McCarthy spoke to. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a House impeachment manager, also said he wanted access to notes Herrera Beutler took of her conversation with McCarthy. There seemed to be no reason not to also call McCarthy, though that wasn't discussed.\n\nThe question of whether to call witnesses had been bedeviling House managers from the beginning, and the team debated the question until past 3 a.m. Saturday morning, according to a Democrat familiar with their discussions, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly. By the time Senate Democrats convened for a caucus meeting at 9 a.m., the House managers still hadn't decided what they'd do, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told his caucus to support whatever decision the House made. During the impeachment proceedings, Raskin pushed for the right to call witnesses. A vote was called, and with the support of Democrats and a handful of Republicans, the Senate approved.\n\nTrump's lawyer responded to this by suggesting that Pelosi be deposed in his law office in Philadelphia, which prompted a round of guffaws from the gathered senators. \"I don't know why you're laughing here,\" said Trump's lawyer. \"There's nothing laughable here.\" As ever with Trump, that's both true and not.\n\nIn the end, there will be no depositions, in Philadelphia or anywhere else. After getting approval to call witnesses from the Senate, the managers decided not to do so after all, resting their case.\n\nSeven Senate Republicans joined all 50 Democrats in voting to convict Trump. That was ten short of the 67 needed. Trump lives to fight another day.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

      "text": "Classified Documents Scandals Point to Larger Culture of Impunity\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe snowballing investigations into Trump, Biden, Pence, and others over their mishandling of classified documents present us with a unique opportunity.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland names an independent special counsel to probe President Joe Biden's alleged mishandling of classified documents at the Justice Department in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 12, 2023.\n\nWe do not yet know if any of the cases involving former presidents and vice presidents improperly retaining classified documents are as incendiary as some partisan commentators would have us believe. The dominant view projected by the liberal media is that Joe Biden and Mike Pence are benign, accidental document hoarders and that Donald Trump is a criminal who absconded with vital national secrets that could destroy the republic as we know it. Pro-Trump outlets have generally run with the narrative that the former president had every right to take the documents because he had magically declassified them in his mind, but Biden took the documents to engage in acts of corruption, including sharing them with his wayward son Hunter. The broader right-wing position is effectively to downplay or ignore Trump's document situation unless it is convenient for hammering on Biden, and to portray the Biden document case as a breathtaking scandal that portends dark secrets that must be exposed.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWe do not have enough information yet to determine if there were malicious motives at play in any of these cases, nor do we know if any actual harm was done. There is no denying, however, that Trump's situation is different from the Pence and Biden affairs - because of Trump's scuttling of the investigation (potentially in a criminal manner), his resistance to returning documents, and the sheer volume of documents he took. There may well be a finding that some or all of these officials violated regulations or laws governing the handling of classified or national defense materials. In the end, what will really matter is the precise nature of the documents they improperly retained. In Trump's case, his actions after he took the documents may prove more problematic for him and his team legally than the act of improperly retaining the materials.\n\nFor good reasons, this story is receiving widespread coverage and will be the focus not only of the special counsel probes, but also congressional investigations. The Republicans, wielding their majority in the House, will certainly zero in on the Biden document case. He is, after all, the sitting president, and lawmakers are right to investigate. However, if the House Republicans elect to ignore Trump's actions or minimize their importance while simultaneously running an aggressive examination of Biden's conduct, that will severely undermine the credibility of the process. Unfortunately, that seems to be a likely scenario.\n\n\"No one's been investigated more than Donald Trump. Who hasn't been investigated? Joe Biden, and that's why we're finally launching an investigation of Joe Biden,\" said Rep. James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee. \"I don't feel like we need to spend a whole lot of time investigating President Trump because the Democrats have done that for the past six years.\" Comer and other Republicans, however, have indicated they intend to question the government on what they allege was a politically motivated raid of Trump's Florida resort home last August. \"My concern is how there's such a discrepancy in how former President Trump was treated by raiding Mar-a-Lago, by getting the security cameras, by taking pictures of documents on the floor,\" he said.\n\nIn recent weeks, Comer has fired off a slew of letters demanding information about the documents as well as details about how they were discovered, who had access to them, and the communications between the Justice Department and Biden's team. He has also asked the White House and the Secret Service for visitor's logs for Biden's home in Delaware. \"President Biden's mishandling of classified materials raises the issue of whether he has jeopardized our national security ,\" Comer wrote in a letter to chief of staff Ron Klain. \"Without a list of individuals who have visited his residence, the American people will never know who had access to these highly sensitive documents.\" In another letter to the University of Pennsylvania, Comer also requested a detailed list of everyone, including members of the Biden family, who may have had access to the Penn Biden Center, where the initial batch of documents was discovered.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, the Republican chair of the Judiciary Committee, has also announced an investigation into Biden's documents with an initial focus on Attorney General Merrick Garland's decision to appoint a special counsel and the communications between Biden's lawyers and the Justice Department about the discoveries of classified materials. \"It is unclear when the Department first came to learn about the existence of these documents, and whether it actively concealed this information from the public on the eve of the 2022 elections,\" Jordan wrote in a January 13 letter to Garland.\n\nBiden and his lawyers have been emphatic in asserting that they followed proper protocol once they discovered classified papers at the Penn Biden Center. The administration has blasted House Speaker Kevin McCarthy for putting \"extreme MAGA members,\" such as Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar, on oversight committees, charging among other things that they have promoted \"dangerous conspiracy theories.\"\n\nSome leading Democrats, including Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, have openly criticized Biden over the documents case, while Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would support bipartisan legislation spearheaded by Michigan Democrat Sen. Gary Peters aimed at preserving presidential and other federal records. Rep. Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat, said he will introduce legislation that would require \"federal officials, within 30 days of leaving office, to certify under oath that they possess no classified documents.\" Most Democrats, when asked about Biden's actions, defer to the special counsel probes, while pointing to the differences between the Biden and Trump situations. Many of those same people over the past year have shown no hesitation to blast Trump and portray his taking of classified documents as a nondebatable threat to national security despite the limited amount of concrete information made public about the specific nature of the materials in question. After Connecticut Democrat Rep. Jim Himes remarked that Biden \"has apparently done what Trump did in retaining classified documents,\" the New York Times reported , \"His response irked some Democrats on the Hill, who said they want to maintain a consistent message that the special prosecutors should be able to conduct their investigations without being influenced by politics.\"\n\nWhile the investigations in the House of Representatives appear to be narrowly aimed at Biden's conduct, there are some indications of bipartisan efforts brewing in the Senate. Sen. Mark Warner, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has expressed frustration that lawmakers never received a briefing on the Trump documents case and has called for one dealing with both the Biden and Trump matters. Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, said that there was unanimous support among both Democrats and Republicans on the Intelligence Committee in demanding a full briefing on the documents recovered from both Trump and Biden. \"We don't want to get into a question of threats at this point,\" Warner said after a closed-door briefing from the Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines on January 25. Senators said that Haines told the committee that they would not receive a briefing while the special counsel investigations are ongoing. \"We have a job to do. It is our job to make sure that the security of our country is protected and that the intelligence that our country depends upon is not compromised,\" Warner said. \"The notion that we have to wait until a special prosecutor blesses the Intelligence Committee's oversight will not stand.\" Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton has threatened to block Biden's nominees \"for any department or agency and take every step I can on every committee on which I serve, to impose consequences on the administration until they provide these documents for Congress to make our own informed judgment about the risk to national security.\"\n\nJeremy Scahill discusses the mistreatment of whistleblowers and Washington's culture of secrecy on Democracy Now!, Jan. 24, 2023.\n\nIt would be indefensible for the Biden administration to stonewall a bipartisan effort from the Democrat-led Senate Intelligence Committee to conduct a classified investigation of these matters. It is worth remembering that in 1976, then-Sen. Biden was a co-sponsor of the legislation that established the permanent intelligence committees, following the widespread abuses committed during the Nixon administration. Biden was an original member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and criticized various administrations for failing to comply with its oversight mandates.\n\nEven if such briefings on the Biden and Trump documents happen, the public would be kept largely in the dark, save for some inevitable leaks to the media, for the foreseeable future. As the Justice Department investigations unfold, one of the most valuable public responses from Congress would be to convene a thorough, independent, bipartisan investigation of the entire bureaucracy of secrecy that exists throughout the federal government. It should interrogate the pervasive practice of overclassification, the uneven legal treatment - depending on their status or positions of power - of individuals who mishandle classified materials, as well as the abuse of the Espionage Act by both Democratic and Republican administrations to target whistleblowers and journalistic sources.\n\nRelated The Secrets Presidents Keep in Their Garages and Luxury Resorts\n\nThere is another aspect to these scandals that we should not lose sight of: the general climate of impunity that exists among the powerful when it comes to secrecy and abuse of power. Under President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, the U.S. was operating a global kidnap and torture regime after 9/11. Senior CIA personnel destroyed videotapes of their torture of detainees. The CIA, under John Brennan, spied on U.S. Senate investigators and hacked into their computer systems. In the lead up to the 2003 Iraq invasion, Cheney and other officials abused the system of classified intelligence, cherry-picking unverified data to fabricate a justification for war. James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence under Barack Obama, perjured himself in front of the U.S. Senate when he lied about the National Security Agency's bulk collection of the communications of Americans. Modern U.S. history is rife with such malignant actions on the part of senior officials. No one has ever faced any real consequences for these abuses of power - and in fact, many people involved, such as Gina Haspel , who served as CIA director under Trump, continued to be promoted in government or received lucrative deals in the private sector.\n\nIt is a disservice to the public to exploit the Trump, Biden, and Pence cases for solely partisan purposes. Each case should be investigated on its merits and the public informed of the extent of the misconduct. At the same time, this moment should serve as an opportunity to launch a serious and wide-ranging investigation into the broader culture of secrecy in Washington, D.C., that leads to such cases.\n\nBut the investigation shouldn't stop there. Any meaningful inquiry must include an accounting of a wider range of abuses, including the secret torture program, and must develop a system of meaningful consequences for the perpetrators regardless of their prominence or the powerful positions they hold.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

Joseph Dunford : We owe the families as much information as we can find out about what happened, and we owe the American people an explanation of what their men and women were doing at this particular time. And, when I say that, I mean the men and women in harm's way anywhere in the world, that they should know what the mission is and what we're trying to accomplish when we're there.\n\nJS: Over the past week, there's been an intense focus on what exactly happened to four U.S. soldiers in the African nation of Niger on October 4th. What we have been told is very little and what we've been told is based on information provided by the military and by the Trump Administration.\n\nAnd what that picture looks like, as of now, is that a small group of Special Operations forces were on a sensitive mission in Niger. That they were traveling in so-called soft vehicles, meaning non-armored vehicles and that they were ambushed.\n\nAnd during this ambush, three U.S. soldiers were killed, two others were seriously wounded and another soldier, Sergeant La David Johnson, went missing and his body was not recovered until a couple of days later.\n\nNow, what the exact nature of that mission was, or why they were in an armored vehicle, we do not know yet.\n\nSecretary of Defense Jim Mattis : And the loss of our troops is under investigation. We, in the Department of Defense, like to know what we're talking about before we talk. And so, we do not have all the accurate information yet.\n\nJS: In classic Donald Trump form, he has made the story about something other than \"what were they doing there?\"\n\nDonald J. Trump: I was -Look I've called many people, and I would think that every one of them appreciated it. I was very surprised to see this, to be honest.\n\nJS: He has attacked the widow of Sergeant Johnson after she publicly said that she was shocked when Trump appeared to not know her husband's name when he called her to offer his condolences. The president, she said:\n\nMyeshia Johnson: He knew what he signed up for. But it hurts anyways. And I was - it made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he said it. He couldn't remember my husband name. The only way he remembered my husband name because he told me he had my husband's report in front of him. And that's when he actually said, La David.\n\nJS: Which, on the surface, sounds like a very callous thing to say to a widow. Trump, for his part says that he meant nothing but respect, and that it was a dignified conversation.\n\nTrump and his allies have cast aspersions on Johnson's widow as well as on her Congresswoman Frederica Wilson of Florida. Some of the attacks on the congresswoman have been vile, with one of Trump's sons saying on Twitter that she looks like a stripper. Real classy.\n\nBut aside from the horrible attacks on a Gold Star widow or these grotesque attacks on the appearance of Congresswoman Frederica Wilson that have been emanating from the administration or from the president's family or from his prominent supporters, this episode, meaning what happened in Niger and then the way that it has been covered in the media and discussed by politicians, it's actually a classic example of how covert U.S. operations are dealt with in general in the United States, both in the media and on Capitol Hill.\n\nYou have senators and congressmen rushing to microphones to question what were we doing in Niger? Why with the troops there? If you're a Democrat, it's: What was Donald Trump doing sending U.S. troops into Niger? And these congressmen feign ignorance as to the extent of the U.S. military footprint across the globe, particularly those Congress members that are on military committees or intelligence committees or oversight committees. They know exactly how extended U.S. military operations are across this world. So, this level of feigned ignorance: it's either a symbol of total incompetence as lawmakers, or it's a despicable act of partisan or political theater.\n\nSince 9/11, the United States has embraced the concept that Donald Rumsfeld famously sketched out in one of his snowflake memos that the world is a battlefield, and that the U.S. has the right to send its commandos wherever, whenever, to kill whomever.\n\nDonald Rumsfeld: We are in a sense, seeing the definition of a new battlefield in the world. The 20th, 21st century battlefield.\n\nJS: and the US has been doing this since George W. Bush, but through Barack Obama and through Donald Trump, with essentially no meaningful oversight or investigation from the U.S. Congress except when something goes wrong.\n\nListen to this: in 2009, the U.S. Special Operations Command had its forces deployed in sixty countries around the world. By the time Donald Trump was elected president, that number had swelled to 138 countries. That was under Barack Obama. And the number continues to rise under Donald Trump.\n\nU.S. commandos were doing covert operations in Niger under Barack Obama and they were there under Donald Trump. In some countries, these commandos are categorized as trainers or advisers - that's what the U.S. called its troops that were deployed in the early stages of the Vietnam War, too, so take that phrase with a grain of salt. But these forces also conduct raids, drone strikes, assassinations, kidnappings - all manner of covert operations. And the only time we ever really hear about it is when U.S. personnel die, when journalists or human rights groups document civilian deaths, or as in the case of the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound, the U.S. wants to declare victory and celebrate the awesomeness of its commandos or its covert actions.\n\nSome Democrats right now want to portray this situation in Niger as Trump's Benghazi. But I think that's a very bad comparison. In fact, Benghazi should not even be viewed as Obama or Hillary's Benghazi. The real scandal here is that the U.S. does these operations all the time, all over the world, and we never pay any attention to it until something goes wrong, or, unless it's valuable for propaganda purposes. The family of the four soldiers killed in Niger have a right to know why their loved ones died.\n\nSergeant La David Johnson's widow has a right to know where her husband's body was for two days and why it wasn't recovered until then. In fact, all of us have a right to know the answer to that. But we also have a right to know why on earth the U.S. has commandos in a majority of the world's countries. By just chasing each incident, where the CIA or the Joint Special Operations Command conducts an operation that we hear about instead of actually investigating the entire program, nothing's ever going to change.\n\nIt's the same bad apple theory from Abu Ghraib. \"Oh, it was an anomaly. Just a few soldiers did it. We'll prosecute the lowest ranking people and move on.\" It's the same thing. It's like a cat chasing a ball of yarn in the room: you're just focused on this one thing, but you're losing sight of the big picture.\n\nThere's a direct arc that stretches from George W. Bush through Barack Obama to Donald Trump of covert actions done in secrecy with little-to-no oversight by the U.S. Congress or the courts.\n\nThis entire system - the night raids, the drone strikes, the secret prisons, the snatching of people - all of it needs to be investigated and explained to the people. Niger won't be the last of these. Not by a long shot. And part of the reason why is that the public is being taught to view these incidents as one-off disasters: Niger for Trump, Benghazi for Obama, and on, and on. This is now the American way of waging wars. There are U.S. troops positioned in 138-plus countries right now. What are they doing there? Who's going to explain that? No one ever wants to touch that because then you need to ask questions about the fallacy of American exceptionalism and our nation's addiction to militarism.\n\nSo, the outrage is often episodic and it's used, particularly by politicians, to make short-term political points. Until Congress actually does its job and conducts an open, meaning public, and wide-ranging inquiry into what the hell the U.S. special operations forces are doing in 138 countries, or what the CIA is doing across the globe, then they're not doing their jobs.\n\nAnd that's been the reality for a long, long time, under both Democrats and Republicans.\n\n[Musical interlude]\n\nJS: We're going to kick off today's show by taking a deep dive into the world of Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe great investigative journalist Jane Mayer has a fascinating exposé on Pence in the recent issue of The New Yorker magazine. The title of it is, \"The Danger of President Mike Pence.\"\n\nJane is one of the best journalists of our time and she was one of the first reporters to crack open the CIA torture and extraordinary rendition program under Bush and Cheney. She has written a number of books. Her latest work has focused on investigating the Koch brothers and other shady right-wing or Republican financiers. Her most recent book is called \"Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right.\" Jane Mayer joins me now.\n\nJane, welcome to Intercepted.\n\nJane Mayer: Thank you so much for having me.\n\nJS: What I really found extraordinary about your piece is this notion of Mike Pence, not really as a principled conservative Christian, but as a real opportunist willing to set aside what he claimed were his bedrock principles in favor of whatever his kind of corporate paymasters or political expediency dictates he should do. Is that your sense?\n\nJM: Yeah. And that was a surprise to me too. I mean, I think everybody had thought of him as kind of defining social conservatism and evangelical Christianity, and, in fact, what the reporting showed was that he's very ambitious and he's made his deals when he needs to.\n\nAnd, in fact, his whole career really has been nurtured, supported, and sponsored by huge right-wing corporate interests. And I hadn't realized that myself until I dug into it.\n\nJS: There was a sense that Mike Pence was kind of this like shitty-magic-penny to buy the Christian right, sort of like calm with the idea of Trump being president.\n\nJM: He definitely was. He was the bridge. He was the seal of good housekeeping that enabled the Christian right to come on board.\n\nAnd, you know, but to go into your first question about the surprise of how ambitious he was and how willing he was to cut deals when he needed to, I mean it shouldn't have been a surprise because the biggest deal and the biggest sort of Faustian bargain that he's made was getting on the ticket with Donald Trump, who, of course, defines everything that Christian evangelicals say that they dislike, you know? His willingness to make that deal should have tipped everybody off.\n\nJS: You were able to get some pretty powerful quotes or assertions from Senator Sheldon Whitehouse. He, of course, is the Democratic senator from Rhode Island and one of the things that he said to you was that if Mike Pence were to become president, that the government would be run by the Koch brothers. Maybe you can unpack that and explain the connection between - because the Koch brothers aren't known as fanatical Christian supremacists.\n\nJM: No, I mean and, so, isn't that interesting? The Koch's are libertarians, or you could call them neoliberals. They are supposedly people who believe in kind of social liberalism. But there they are having sponsored the career of Mike Pence. And I think it's a real tip off to what the Koch's really care about.\n\nThe issue that matters to them is not any of the social issues, no matter what they're saying. What matters to them is allowing business to take over the power in the country, and particularly their own business. So, they're pushing back on regulations, and they're pushing back on taxes and trying to shrink the power of the government and replace it with their own power.\n\nAnd Mike Pence has been willing to carry their water on that. I hadn't realized, despite writing \"Dark Money,\" a book about the Kochs, I hadn't realized the extent to which they were working hand-in-glove with Pence and vice versa and how it began.\n\nAnd it really goes back to 2009 in earnest. I mean it starts before then, in his working for think tanks that are funded by corporations and huge right-wing donors such as the Kochs.\n\nBut in 2009, there was a piece of legislation moving forward in Congress that was a huge threat to Koch Industries. And that was a tax on carbon pollution, something that would make the fossil fuel companies like Koch Industries pay for what they were doing to the environment.\n\nAnd Pence really took up their cause in 2009, and he echoed their talking points. He took a petition that was created by the Koch's main political group, Americans for Prosperity, and he got tons of signatures on it in Congress and eventually managed to help kill that bill in the Senate so it never happened. And also to kind of permanently align the Republican Party against doing anything to try to deal with climate change. That was a gift of major proportions to Koch Industries. That cemented his relationship with the Kochs, and they then started just pouring money into him.\n\nThey sponsored the next phases of his career and they really began to push for the idea of Pence himself becoming a presidential candidate and they were hoping it would come out that way. But Pence kind of screwed it up. He goes back to Indiana, becomes governor and he's really a failure. And he makes decisions and takes positions that hurt him so much that he can't run for president right away.\n\nJS: You point out that Mike Pence was in Congress for twelve years and never, never once authored a successful bill. That's kind of astonishing when you realize like this guy was basically a failure in getting any legislation passed. However, he used every platform he had, not to be good at that job, but to be kind of a shock troop for whoever his funders were or wherever the support was coming from that he thought would most put him in a prime position to gain national recognition or national power.\n\nJM: He actually rose to a pretty high position in the leadership, the number three position of the Republican house, and he used that position also to push the Republican Party far, far, to the right.\n\nSo, you find him very early on supporting the rise of the Tea Party and speaking out at Tea Party rallies and talking about defunding the whole government. He wanted to defund Planned Parenthood or he was going to shut down the government, he said.\n\nMike Pence: We repealed Obamacare, lock, stock, and barrel on the floor of the House of Representatives. And we voted to cut spending to pre-stimulus, pre-bailout levels, defunding Obamacare and ending all public funding for Planned Parenthood of America. [audience cheers and applause] That's what we voted.\n\nJM: So, he's taking these radical positions that, at the time, were considered shocking. But he's part of this whole effort to push the Republican Party in line with its far-right economic interests and push it further and further to the right.\n\nJS: I read your piece and I get the sense that he's kind of this far-right wing, almost Manchurian Candidate, where it's like they've programmed someone, you know, that can pass as kind of a Christian for the needs of convincing people that he's with them. But really he seems to do whatever the Koch brothers tell him to right now, or whoever else is paying the bills.\n\nJM: Well there is an economic, fiscal side of the conservatism he espouses and people hadn't paid that much attention to it. And it's just as radical as his views are on social issues.\n\nYou know, many of the people that work for him are people who come directly out of the Koch world. So, which to me was very interesting in part because I really believe that the reason that Trump was elected was because he broke with the orthodoxy of the far-right donors. They had moved so far away from the base that I think there was an opening for Trump to run on, to be more of a populist and to say things like \"you need Social Security, you need Medicare.\" These things were ideas that really appealed to the base of the Republican Party, and to many Americans who weren't even that political.\n\nAnd he also talked about the corruption of the government and how he was going to stick it to the big donors, and specifically stick it to the Kochs.\n\nBut he hasn't done that. So I was interested in why. And, in particular, I think part of the reason is that he's naive about government he has no experience in government, he's bored by the details. And who is at his side who really does understand it? It's Mike Pence.\n\nAnd so, Mike Pence runs the transition and fills the Trump Administration with people who are really Koch people. And so even though Trump has run a campaign that's populist, he's running a government that is Koch-ian in its nature, and more, and more so. I mean we see it with the so-called tax reform plan.\n\nBecause you really got an infiltration going on in the Trump Administration by the big old-donor interests that have been trying to grab control for decades now.\n\nJS: Talk about how Mike Pompeo ends up as CIA director and his connections to Pence and the Koch brothers.\n\nJM: The reporting on this comes partly from a number of people I interviewed who were inside the transition team. And, one of them in particular was saying to me, \"Mike Pompeo was not even on the radar for Trump. He wouldn't have known him from anybody else.\" Until like a couple days before he actually appointed him to be running the CIA. He came in, he had a nice interview with Trump, and like a day or two later was named to run the CIA.\n\nHe didn't know - you know Trump wouldn't have known where he came from. But where did he come from? He was the congressman from Wichita, Kansas. He was the Koch's Congressman, someone whose business the Koch's had helped support.\n\nWithin the Administration he and Mike Pence are very close. And Pence has hosted an evangelical Bible study group that's for cabinet members and Pompeo often comes to it. And it's led by a preacher named Ralph Drollinger who has been incredibly controversial. In California, he wrote some essays that suggested that women who served in the state legislature were sinners if they had children because they were leaving their children at home to do public service and that that was literally a sin.\n\nYeah, I mean, talk about someone who's got sort of anti-female, old fashioned and almost dark age ideas of women, that would be Ralph Drollinger. And there he is because Pence sponsored him, running a Bible study group.\n\nThough it's interesting, there is a female member of it, too, someone who you've written about, Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, and she attends these sessions but presumably her children are not little and at home.\n\nJS: You talked to Steve Bannon for this piece, which I thought was quite interesting that Bannon agreed to talk to you, although in some ways maybe not surprising because Bannon now is threatening to try to run Senate candidates against everybody except Ted Cruz. He's his own particular kind of force. But Bannon was the big one who was saying, you know, the globalists inside the administration are the ones that Trump has to worry about and the globalists in the deep state. What were the insights you gained from Steve Bannon about everything that's happened in the nine or ten months of Trump?\n\nJM: Well I mean specifically what Bannon said to me I thought was just amazing which was: He feared that Pence would be a president who would be owned by the Kochs. The thing is that Bannon has long been a critic of the Koch brothers because Bannon sees himself as a new kind of nationalist populist and he sees the Kochs as hurting middle class people. And so, he's in a different place. It's not to say that he doesn't have his own corporate sponsors - in fact, his biggest backer is Robert Mercer, the hedge fund magnate. But Mercer is more of a nationalist and a populist - I guess, to some extent, it's hard to know.\n\nBut at any rate, Bannon comes out is as a critic of the sort of big corporate donors who he sees as pulling the party away from his people, the kind of working class and middle class white guys of the country.\n\nJS: You know, one of the people that I've written a lot about, Erik Prince, is one of the names, the founder of the Blackwater mercenary company, one of the names that has been floated as a potential candidate on Bannon's slate, if you will - possibly in Michigan, but it looks more likely in in Wyoming. And Erik Prince would regularly call into Steve Bannon's radio show on Breitbart and pontificate on all sorts of issues.\n\nSteve Bannon: Turn to Erik Prince. Give us, Erik, a professional in this area. If you want to take the fight to ISIS, if we want to destroy ISIS, if they're the existential threat that they say they are to us, what do we do?\n\nErik Prince: Well, here's what the Trump administration needs to do because I can't imagine the Clinton administration contemplating actually ending the ISIS scourge. It's not just a matter of cutting off the head of the snake, it's about chewing up and destroying the entire snake.\n\nJS: It's sort of was like akin to like Bin Laden's guys are dropping a tape off with Al Jazeera. Erik Prince would like call into Steve Bannon's show. And I would imagine that Erik Prince fully has bought into Bannon's kind of world view, you know, particularly when it comes to kind of right-wing, libertarian, populist nationalist tendencies. What's your sense overall of what Bannon is doing right now, given that he's become such a prominent figure and clearly has his own following?\n\nJM: One of the things that Bannon has been fighting is what he calls the Empire Project and when he was in the White House, he was pushing back against the idea of sort of the endless war in endless number of countries, which he sees as taking the lives of too many of the kinds of people who he is championing. And he was trying to privatize some of these conflicts and reduce the defense spending, supposedly - I mean this was the idea.\n\nAnd he so he was pushing the idea that is friend Erik Prince would use his private mercenary company to take over at least security in some of these projects, and the military was dead set against it and created huge fights, but that's one place where the two of them are allied.\n\nJS: Erik Prince also was a financier of Mike Pence's political career. And, in fact, in 2004, in the aftermath of the Blackwater operatives being killed in Fallujah and strung up from the bridge, Mike Pence organized the welcome reception for Erik Prince on to Capitol Hill and that's really when Erik Prince's mercenary business took off. And it was Mike Pence that welcomed him there, which is interesting given that Pence and Bannon seemed to have been on the opposite ends of the spectrum ideologically within the Trump Administration. I would have thought that Pence would have also sort of, on this issue, joined forces with Bannon to say, \"Hey, General Mattis, you should consider our buddy Erik Prince here and what he's proposing.\" So, that to me is fascinating -\n\nJM: I actually don't think, I think you're on to something there. Because I don't think that Pence was dead-set against Prince's idea. Pence attends the principals committee meetings which are where, you know, that the most important foreign policy arguments take place within the White House. And my sense was, and I think Bannon said to me at some point, that Pence was no fan of what he called the \"empire project,\" meaning the sort of endless expansion of these wars, and that Pence was asking some tough questions about it.\n\nThat's not to say that Pence was backing Prince particularly, either. I mean the thing about going back to the very beginning of the questions you raised, the thing about Pence is that he's kind of weasel-y about many positions. You know he's not someone who you see an incredibly strong backbone, who gets out front and tells, for instance, president Trump when he's wrong. He's very careful and very behind the scenes.\n\nBut anyway, so they may have had more common ground on that than people realize.\n\nJS: Who brought Pence and Trump together and how did Pence end up on that ticket? JM: Well, to some extent, it was the Trump kids who really created that shotgun marriage, and according to the people that I was interviewing, Jared Kushner in particular had a longstanding family grievance against Chris Christie, who had prosecuted his father when Chris Christie was the U.S. attorney in New Jersey. And so there was kind of a personal beef there. But yet, Trump, it seems, really liked Christie and was kind of leaning that way. I actually interviewed Trump during that period and he sounded very torn and it turns out that even after Trump had had a sort of, what was supposed to have been the big coming together with Pence - they'd had dinner and then they'd had a family breakfast together and the Trump family kids came in and everybody was sort of on the same playbook and word came out that Pence was going to take the job, as he said, \"in a heartbeat\" - that very night, apparently, Trump called Chris Christie and continued sort of the romance and was saying, you know, \"Are you ready?\" And Christie said, \"Ready for what?\" And Trump said, \"To do this thing with me.\" And Christie said, \"Are you asking?\" And Trump sort of said, \"Well, are you ready?\" And, you know it was this kind of endless flirtation, and, \"Stay by your phone,\" Trump said to Christie.\n\nIt was like he couldn't quite get himself to be comfortable with Pence. And even after they named to Pence publicly, Trump was still asking his advisers, you know, \"Can I get out of this? Can I back out of it?\" Now I got to be fair, though, to say since then, you know, Trump has been fully on board with Pence and considers it one of his best decisions, apparently, according to many people who I interviewed.\n\nAnd the description he's given about why he thinks Pence is so great what Pence was speaking at the Republican National Convention. And I talked to Newt Gingrich who was behind the scenes talking to Trump when Pence was speaking, and Trump turned to him and said, \"Isn't he perfect? He looks like he was sent by central casting.\" So, Trump loves the way Pence looks like a vice president.\n\nJS: Well that sounds like the thing you're really looking for, someone that just looks like a vice president. However, it underscores something that another historian you interviewed said that Pence is basically the sycophant-in-chief. He really is used by Trump on a regular basis. I don't think I've ever seen a vice president carted out as though he's at a pep rally to introduce the president anywhere near the numbers that Trump has carted Pence out. It's almost like he puts him in this position that's intended to say, \"Here's my carnival barker or here's my hype man that's going to come out for a couple minutes and then the real king shows up.\"\n\nJM: You know, one of the people I talked to, I tried to speak to some former vice presidents, and one in particular, Walter Mondale, found it so demeaning because Mondale actually tried to negotiate a contract when he became vice president with Jimmy Carter to make the role into a more substantial role, and something that's more dignified. But he's watching Pence, and he said to me, \"You know: what's he doing? I ask myself every day.\" And he was, he looks at Pence as sort of acting like an emcee for the president, you know?\n\nAnd it's not stupid; it's shrewd. He is the member of the White House team that has not gotten in trouble, as far as we know, with the president. He knows that the president likes to be flattered, and you know, you can see, probably biding his time. And that's why I ended the piece with the quote from the Bible that Pence keeps over his mantle in the vice-presidential residence, which talks about how God has his future in mind.\n\nJS: Mike Pence seems to have also been put in a position, particularly with the General Flynn situation, where either he was being lied to and then was sent to the wolves, basically, to repeat the lie in public, or he did know and took a bullet essentially for the president's reputation, or the reputation of the Administration. Is that your sense?\n\nJM: I mean it's hard to know for sure. There's one meeting that would clarify the answer to that and we don't know exactly what happened there. But Pence was in a meeting at the White House when Trump announced that he wanted to get rid of James Comey, as the head of the FBI and he was angry about Comey doing an investigation into him, and the Russian ties. And they cooked up the idea that they would get the Justice Department to go out front and recommend that he get rid of Comey, and that would give him some cover to do it. And it wouldn't just look like obstruction of justice.\n\nAnd Pence was in that meeting, but until we really know what he said, what he heard, what the conversation was like, it's very hard to know for sure whether he was, you know, party to obstruction or whether somehow he absented himself at the right moments. It's just really hard to know.\n\nBut any rate he came out and said:\n\nMP: Let me be very clear that the president's decision to accept the recommendation of the Deputy Attorney General and the Attorney General to remove Director Comey as the head of the FBI was based solely and exclusively on his commitment to the best interest of the American people.\n\nJM: There were a few little weasel words there that give him some outs, but he basically spread the party line that gave the president cover and then of course the president came out just a few hours later and said:\n\nDonald J. Trump: He's a showboat. He's a grandstander. I was going to fire Comey. My decision. There's no good time to do it, by the way.\n\nJM: Which left Pence out there looking like a, you know, complete chump, or a liar, and I think you have to know more before you can really say for sure, and I think we may know more at some point because I think Mueller's going to go into that meeting very carefully and hopefully it will be more transparent and then we'll see.\n\nJM: There's a level of arrogance about the Russia investigation, specifically on Trump's part that he you know he himself has this arrogance about it, where either he knows that there's nothing there that's going to stick or he just seems to believe that he'll be able to weather it with his Twitter account and by lying - I mean what's your sense of what's going to happen there. I mean are they going to get something to stick to Trump himself?\n\nJM: Who knows? I mean I'm not like in the prediction business. But I did interview Tony Schwartz who wrote \"The Art of the Deal\" for Trump, and one of the things he talks about is how for Trump, truth is so malleable. You know, he doesn't care really, what's true, what's not true, what should be true - it's all kind of the same for him.\n\nJS: Well, that's not how the courts work, though.\n\nJM: No, it's not. It seems like at the moment you know Mueller is pushing very hard against Paul Manafort, and probably against General Mike Flynn, that seems to be where he's most likely to find sort of legal violations. But there is the possibility of an obstruction case here: obstruction by Trump, and potentially obstruction by Pence, neither of them are off the hook.\n\nI mean, one thing I can say about being a Washington reporter for The New Yorker is there's not been a single uninteresting day these days.\n\nJS: Jane Mayer we're going to leave it there. Thank you very much for joining us on Intercepted.\n\nJM: Great to be with you. Thanks so much, Jeremy.\n\nJS: Jane Mayer is an investigative journalist at the New Yorker Magazine. Her latest piece is called The Danger of President Mike Pence, and her most recent book is \"Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right.\"\n\nYou are listening to Intercepted. When we come back, we're going to talk to the famed Chinese dissident Ai Weiwei. He has an incredible new documentary film called Human Flow.\n\nAnd we're also going to be talking to the drummer of the band Deerhoof, and we're going to hear some new music from them. Stay with us.\n\n[Musical interlude]\n\nJS: Hey, everybody, this is Jeremy again. And I am not going to take up much of your time. I just want to remind you that we are in the midst of our fundraising drive here, our membership support drive for this podcast, for Intercepted. And we would be honored if you'd join the ranks of the 1,600 or so people who have already become sustaining members of Intercepted. You can do that by going to the intercept.com/join. Our goal is to try to get over 2,000 members this year that have become sustaining supporters of this program.\n\nWe are just blown away by the level of support that we've already been offered and we are so close to that goal that we've set for ourselves of 2,000 members, sustaining members, of Intercepted by the end of this calendar year.\n\nIf you're out there and you appreciate the show, when you are in a financial position to support this program, particularly for someone or some people who aren't in a financial position to support it, your donation to this show keeps it free for everyone to listen to. Maybe you want to send a pledge note on behalf of a person in your life, or a group that is engaged in a social justice struggle in your local community. Maybe you want to do a challenge grant where you pool together with some friends and you pool your resources and you say, \"We'll match dollar for dollar any contributions under this mission, up to $2,000 dollars or up to $5,000.\" Whatever level you can pledge, we really appreciate it.\n\nOnce again, I'll shut up. Back to the show.\n\n[Musical interlude]\n\nJS: And we are back here on Intercepted. When the refugee crisis on Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere is discussed in the U.S. media, it's often portrayed simply as masses of people fleeing the violence of groups like ISIS or al Qaeda or al Shabaab.\n\nBut U.S. military actions, including the intense bombings that have taken place in a number of countries, under both president Obama and president Trump have played a major role in creating the conditions that have forced so many people to flee. Not just ISIS, not just al Qaeda, but the United States government. So, too, has the U.S. government and corporate support for dictators around the world. Support for repressive security forces and this massive flow of arms sales, both illicit and perfectly legal.\n\nAdd to this, then, the increasingly deadly role that Russian forces are playing, particularly in Syria, and the world is witnessing a horrifying spike in the number of people documented to have been forcibly displaced from their homes. More than 65 million people according to the United Nations. From Syria, to South Sudan and Central America's northern triangle, more people than ever are fleeing violence, persecution, human rights abuses that are caused by their own governments, by terror groups and by outside forces. Like the United States, or Iran, or Russia. They're also escaping the sometimes-lethal impact of climate change.\n\nAt the same time, political powers across the world, including in the United States and Europe, are building more walls or proposing the building of more walls, implementing harsh anti-immigrant and anti-refugee policies.\n\nAt the same time, far-right politicians are using the refugee crisis to incite xenophobic fears which then can lead to hate crimes.\n\nChinese artist and human rights activist Ai Weiwei has spent his entire adult life under the watch of Chinese intelligence and security forces. And he's widely viewed as one of the most well-known dissidents in China.\n\nAi Weiwei has a new film out that paints a harrowing portrait of the scale of these mass migrations that we're witnessing. The film is called Human Flow. And he timed the film's release with a gigantic public installation of his artworks throughout New York City. It's called \"Good Fences Make Good Neighbors.\" From a golden cage in New York's Central Park, to fences erected at bus stops, and two hundred photographs from refugee camps, Ai Weiwei's migrant-themed works around New York City forced their way into high traffic areas to disrupt the flow of people.\n\nWell, Intercepted's production assistant Elise Swain spoke to onlookers at one of those installations in Washington Square Park. Here's what people had to say about what they saw and felt being next to the artwork.\n\nBystander 1: So, it looks like a giant bird cage in the middle of the Washington Square Park arch, and at the bottom of the bird cage, about halfway through in the center, is a cutout mirrored on the inside.\n\nBystander 2: It's really beautiful. I think when you stand back, it does look like two people, for me personally.\n\nBystander 3: To me, it looks like maybe two people, or maybe one person with a backpack on.\n\nBystander 4: Like, this nice silhouette, if you were a human being, or more of one human being, walking like in a tunnel all together, we were all like squeezing, coming through.\n\nBystander 5: When you go inside it, you see your reflection, but you're like - you're distorted.\n\nBystander 6: But I think that reflection is pretty cool in terms of not only us feeling like there's other people who are going through hell in their countries -\n\nBystander 7: This is the age of people like putting fences to prevent people from like crossing borders.\n\nBystander 6: And have to be in a cage for some reason as a protection of this crazy world we live in.\n\nBystander 8: Confinement. That's what I think the cage is. Because I've been in cages before. So -\n\nElise Swain: It's not a good feeling.\n\nBystander 8: Hell no!\n\nJS: Ai Weiwei's new film, Human Flow, is playing in cities across the United States and soon will be launching globally. And he joins us now. Ai Weiwei, welcome to Intercepted.\n\nAi Weiwei: Thank you.\n\nJS: This is such an important film. I don't think I've ever seen a film that has portrayed, in a human way, the idea of numbers and mass forced migration. When you set out to make this film, was that part of what you were trying to make real to people who are not there?\n\nAW: At the very beginning, I was very frustrated by the situation and have almost no knowledge about what the refugees were about, so I jumped in and started with my iPhone to shooting the people getting off the shore from the Syrian war. And I realize this is going to be a large task to take, and, you know, it is always such a complexity.\n\nHuman Flow: This extraordinary event that has unfolded has also impacted Europe in many ways. We're here right now on Lesbos Island. This is the point when 1/2 a million people, most of them refugees, set foot and entered Europe, an extraordinary way that people have been coming through. In just the last year alone, over 1 million have come to Europe through the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nAnd although these are movements that we haven't seen in decades, in fact, it hasn't been since the Second World War that so many have fled and come to Europe. It's still something that we need to consider in the global context, where so many millions are actually displaced.\n\nAW: So, it ended up we travelled in 23 nations, 40 camps, and interviewed 600 people. And come with 900 hours of footage. And the situation grows very dramatically. You have to do several locations at the same time.\n\nJS: Now the film doesn't really have recurring characters. You return to the scene, for instance, on the Macedonian border. How did you decide how to tell that story?\n\nAW: I guess most refugee films are really focused on an individual character or a family or, you know, a story. As artists, you can have a painting or you can have a photograph or you can have something, you know, more abstract, or in between. Sometimes it gets very large scale, and sometimes very intimate details. So, it's a collage. It's - I would say it's like a broken mirror. You have a lot of fragmentary flecks, angles about the reality.\n\nJS: On a human level, how did it affect you? Not just what you showed on camera, because you're filming with your phone and you're also being filmed, but if you ignore the cameras, just as a human being, what was it like for you to witness what you saw and to be among these people that are forced from their homes?\n\nAW: I was also a kind-of refugee. My father was exiled as an anti-revolutionary poet.\n\nAnd I grew up with him in 20 years in very hard conditions. So, when I met those people, they're so familiar, whatever they do there. You know, their condition. They're, they're both physically and mentally can see myself in them or see them in myself. So, it's easy for me to communicate and to take part of this whole production.\n\nJS: One of the, the lighter moments in the film. You're buying mandarins, or oranges, on the back of the - from a guy on the back of a truck, it looks like, or at a table. And my perception of it was that you were, you knew that he was overcharging you kind of, in a very interesting way, negotiated with him. I used that sort of as a metaphor for how these people are being ripped off, in general. Was that at all what you were doing with that?\n\nAW: Yeah. I think we carefully selected a part, and to have myself in my interaction with them is always serving some purpose, like, I try to pick up this fruit, rather than the other one, he's trying to give me some of what he wants to give to me. And it's very much like selections of refugees in the European process, and also he kind of thought my money could be fake, he look at the - to examine the money. So, all of those instances, it's very little, but it shows a quality or intention about this kind of distrust, or selectively to always chose in those situations.\n\nJS: You portray, in a very strong way, by using the Macedonian border when the European Union countries started shutting it down. Talk about that particular camp that you were in on the Macedonian border and the fate of the people that were there. Why did they come there and what happened?\n\nAW: Most refugees when they landed on Greece, Greece is not a country they want to be in. They want to go to Germany or Sweden or, you know, all those nations already have more open attitude, or maybe better conditions for working.\n\nSo they have look, walking across this so-called Balkan Road. So, the Macedonian border, between Greece, is the place where they're being stopped. You know, they suddenly shut off the fence, the door, and all people, the flow stops there.\n\nSo, accumulated about 13-14,000 people for months without an explanation, or even, it's very limited life support. So that's why we paid a lot of attention to the condition.\n\nHuman Flow Clip: The officials came here. And told them, \"Look, there's no way you're going to get papers to continue, so you're going to be deported. Either you go voluntarily or we arrest you.\" And yesterday it started with police coming here and actively arresting people. There are very afraid of being brought back. I mean there's a reason why these people are here.\n\nJS: You know the president of the United States, he's a big fan of building walls and fences.\n\nAW: And also, not only building walls, but also going to push away many immigrants that have been living in the United States for decades, or even born here. Many of them even contributed to the U.S. economy. You know, they do jobs nobody wants to do. And so those people are going to be pushed away by the new policy, and he has this travelling ban also.\n\nDJT: Donald J. Trumps is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.\n\nAW: And also, the U.S. accepts very little amount of refugees. You really think, it's kind of shameful for such a big nation, powerful nation, the most powerful nation on the earth, but rather not bear the responsibility - do not have the vision, do not have the leadership in dealing with a humanitarian crisis.\n\nJS: What's your biggest concern in China right now when it comes to basic liberties?\n\nAW: China has been establishing this new government for sixty-eight years. But still, they never trust it's own people they never let them vote. They don't have independent judicial system, and the Army doesn't belong to the country, but it belongs to the party. And also they don't have an independent media, you know, it's always under very heavy censorship, every aspect. And I don't know how long they can survive that way, but they have always been like that.\n\nJS: Are you personally still facing surveillance and monitoring when you're inside China?\n\nAW: Oh yes, when I'm inside China, I should be the most watched person, or under the most surveillance, strongest surveillance possible, because that's what they do. And they still see me as a potential dangerous person.\n\nJS: When you just think about it on a basic level, why are they so afraid of you?\n\nAW: I think I present or reflect this notion of freedom. Individual freedom, and the freedom of speech, and also about creativity, are really questionable in this totalitarian society which really threatens the fundamental possibility for them to stay.\n\nJS: What were your thoughts when it became clear that Donald Trump had won the election and was going to be president of the United States. What was your immediate sort of thought about him?\n\nAW: It's the kind of natural outcome of long years, giving up a political consciousness in a general sense. You know, the U.S. has been - or, not only the U.S., but also Europe has been in peaceful time for decades. And they enjoyed this kind of huge prosperity. But at the same time, intellectually, had given up true ideas or thinking about what globalization is about. So, then, it's very easy to be used by politicians. For me, it's not a surprise. Because you can see many, many places in Europe, also, have this kind of trend or tendency to have a far-right moment and come to power.\n\nJS: When you think about the Chinese government, do you think of it in terms of left wing or right wing?\n\nAW: I think they are all the time right wing. There's no left wing. Also, there's no left-wing movement in the society, because, yes, there's a few figures, which reflect this kind of fight, but it can never be a movement in terms of thinking or argument. You know, there's no arguing. Whoever comes out is going to be immediately put in jail, or, you know, has no chance.\n\nJS: China is such a powerful capitalist economy and is making so much of the goods for the United States and no one ever talks about the human rights in China. Trump just talks about, \"China is ripping us off financially.\" But the U.S. economy, in large part, runs because of cheap Chinese labor that has at its center no workers' rights and terrible working conditions. But, in this country, when no one is talking about that, except here and there sometimes you have it. But artists sometimes talk about it, occasionally an article is written, but the main focus on China and the United States is: China's becoming very powerful and they're ripping us off financially.\n\nAW: I think this is since not only this administration, but the previous ones. They enjoy the deals that are made in China, and the profit, and they benefit is huge, because it exploits those nations who don't have human rights, you know? In many senses, it only can be done when the people as in this kind of situation, they ruin partially by doing this kind of business here ruins the human rights condition and also the environmental pollution is everywhere in China. Food, water, and education is pretty bag, and the government is completely corrupted.\n\nSo, of course, the U.S. very clearly knows that, and they enjoy that, you know?\n\nJS: Right and it's part of why the United States is able to do what it does in the world, is because they don't care about those issues.\n\nAW: Yeah. It's true. It survives because those nations function like that.\n\nJS: As I've followed your work over the years, and I always find it so fascinating that you're perceived as a threat because it feels like the reaction of the Chinese state to you is like from a different era. Like, they're making you more powerful, more influential because they're targeting you. And it's like: why don't they get that? That their action against you elevates your platform? Are you that big of a threat to them?\n\nAW: I think fundamentally I'm a big threat to any power because I'm questioning the essence of why they're there, and it's a very harsh argument and a threat to their existence. But they also sense it because I represent, it's not me, but I represent the new intention to make a change.\n\nJS: Why do you like working with your phone as vehicle for shooting video?\n\nAW: It's just coming into - I think for artists, you conceptually are always very clear what kind of image you want, and also, you know, you think anything can make an image which can be powerful. That doesn't have to be super-high quality cameras, which exist everywhere now, but it also can be a simple gesture, or close-range shooting, because filming is almost like a street fight. If you really street fight, you don't need some powerful weapons. You maybe - you grab a sand, you use sand you have a brick, you use a brick. It's really about the moment, and that little thing you have to capture, you know?\n\nJS: When you're in the United States and you're traveling around, what's the vibe that you feel? I'm sure it's different in different places but how does it feel in this country?\n\nAW: After being back to China from the United States for 20-some years, 24 years, then come back to Europe and the United States, I think this world is really, we are living in different worlds. And, if you go to South America, if you go to Africa, if you go the Middle East, it is really - we are really living in several different kinds of worlds.\n\nAnd generally speaking, the people living here are quite spoiled, because of longtime lacking of any kind of challenge, and I think challenge is necessary for, for a nation or an individual. Without challenge, we all become spoiled.\n\nJS: What do you think should be done with all of these people that have had to flee their homes in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia? What would a human response look like to any of this?\n\nAW: I think there are several levels that need to be done. One, is at the top, political level, globally, those leaderships, the powerful nations, they should make a decision to stop the war. You know? To stop the famine, which is not difficult. All those wars, represents the interests from others. As we all know, if we look at the top lists of who is selling those weapons and to whom, you know? It's just, like, if you follow the money, then you see how this world is moving.\n\nSo, the U.S. certainly bears major responsibility in this matter, if you talk about the Iraq war, still, after decades, still Iraq is such a broken state, and they're still fighting.\n\nJS: And Turkey. I mean the United States sold enormous quantities of weapons and military to Turkey to massacre and expel Kurds.\n\nAW: Yes, Turkey also is a very unstable situation. And many, many nations, it's not just one or two. And, also in Syria, has all foreign involvement in there, so makes that well, 100,000 people as casualties, and pushes a few million people out. So, if we can't stop those wars, and continuously build arms and we're selling arms, what do you expect? All of those are made for killing people. I think the U.S. has been pulling down the bombs, larger than ever.\n\nJS: Yeah, Trump just used this huge bomb, that they called the MOAB, in Afghanistan. They were bragging about how great this big bomb was.\n\nAW : Yeah. So, you can see people celebrating those killings, and also not talk about nuclear warfare. Those potential dangerous threats to humanities are always there, if they have any sincerity or care, they should just dismiss all those nuclear bombs. Now, why we need to have it - who do they want to kill with those devastating weapons?\n\nJS: Whose work right now do you respect or do you pay attention to, either artists or writers, musicians?\n\nAW: Sorry to say, I am very much interested in the artist, his name is Ai Weiwei, that's who I pay full attention to.\n\nJS: Alright. Fair enough. Ai Weiwei, thank you very much for joining us.\n\nAW: Thank you.\n\nJS: Ai Weiwei is a Chinese artist and political dissident. His documentary, human flow, is out now, and his installations in New York City will be up until February 11th of 2018.\n\n[Musical interlude]\n\nJS: After more than two decades of being a band, the veteran indie rock quartet Deerhoof thought they'd try something different. Two weeks before their fourteenth LP, Mountain Moves, was set to drop, they surprise released it on their website at a pay-what-you-want price. The entirety of the proceeds were then donated to the Emergent Fund, a nonprofit that benefits campaigns whose missions are to defend the rights of vulnerable communities.\n\nIt could be said that the unpredictability of Deerhoof is both an ode to their solidly leftist do-it-yourself principles and idiosyncratic music, which seems to joyfully gallop between art pop and punk, and is something entirely of their own vibrant creation.\n\n[\"Mountain Moves\" by Deerhoof]\n\nJS: Our producer Jack D'Isidoro spoke with Deerhoof's Greg Saunier about the songs of Mountain Moves, and the power of creativity during the Trump moment.\n\nGreg Saunier: This is Greg, the drummer from Deerhoof. Yes, I would say that on Mountain Moves, maybe we were trying to be political with the songs. But we've had a lot of songs about war, a lot of songs about immigration. Our singer Satomi Matsuzaki is a first-generation immigrant from Japan to the U.S.\n\nIt's like we'd like to make music that would make a person want to sit up straight, and like give them some energy, give them some strength, when there are many things in their day-to-day existence that are not only sapping their energy, but meant to sap their energy. There's an economy of hopelessness, of producing hopelessness, that people are making money by creating hopelessness, creating a feeling of being overwhelmed and feeling that to even envision something better than what we have is completely preposterous and unrealistic and should be abandoned immediately.\n\n[\"Your Dystopic Creation Doesn't Fear You\" by Deerhoof]\n\n\"Your Dystopic Creation Doesn't Fear You\" is kind of, I don't know, I just remember how much fear-mongering was the strategy of both parties. Both candidates were simply trying to scare people into voting for them by saying how scary it's going to be if the other person is president.\n\nAnd I felt that our intelligence was being insulted 24 hours a day, for months, and being projected at maximum volume by the corporate media.\n\n[\"Your Dystopic Creation Doesn't Fear You\" by Deerhoof]\n\nGS: \"I Will Spite Survive.\" You know, obviously it's kind of a joke on the, \"I Will Survive,\" the disco-era hit. I mean that song was chorus like a kind of anthem about surviving a bad breakup. This one is more like meant to be a kind of anthem about surviving a government, that, depending on who you are, would prefer you to be dead. If you're someone who's sick or injured, it'd be better if you would die. If you are the wrong race or wrong religion, it would be better if you were dead. And if you can survive long enough for the people currently flush with wealth and power to, themselves, pass away, then there's some hope that the future may be better.\n\nAnd so, it's kind of a message to them to please stay strong and stay alive if you can. So, anyway, here's that song: \"I Will Spite Survive.\"\n\n[\"I Will Spite Survive\" by Deerhoof]\n\nYou could outlive your executioners\n\nYou could outlive your executioners\n\nYou could outlive your executioners\n\nYou could outlive your executioners\n\nBut you're on TV, you're expendable\n\nBut you're on TV, you're expendable\n\nSleep at night, if you can stay alive\n\nSleep at night, if you can stay alive\n\nStay alive, if you can sleep at night\n\nStay alive, if you can sleep at night\n\nCity breaks, if you can stay awake\n\nLet her dance, all night long!\n\nYou could outlive your executioners\n\nYou could outlive your executioners\n\nBut you're on TV, you're expendable\n\nBut you're on TV, you're expendable\n\nSleep at night, if you can stay alive\n\nSleep at night, if you can stay alive\n\nStay alive, if you can sleep at night\n\nStay alive, if you can sleep at night\n\nCity breaks, if you can stay awake\n\nOutlive your executioners\n\nOutlive your executioners\n\nOutlive your executioners\n\nJS: That was \"I Will Spite Survive\" by the band Deerhoof and if you go to our episode page, we have an exclusive first look at their music video for the song.

      "text": "Mike Pence Speaks to Religious Group. Next Day, They Banquet at Trump Hotel.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe president's intermingling of private business interests and official duties now appears to involve a religious group that hosted the vice president.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT'S intermingling of his family's business interests and his official duties now appears to involve a prominent religious group that hosted the vice president as a speaker.\n\nLast Friday, hundreds of conference-goers wearing red lanyards strolled through the lobby of the Trump International Hotel on their way to the \"Presidential Ballroom,\" a 13,000 square-foot private banquet facility located just a few blocks from the White House. A few of them were priests wearing vestments of the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox churches. They had come to Washington for a four-day event - the World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians - organized by Franklin Graham, Billy Graham's son.\n\nThe day before, Vice President Mike Pence had addressed their summit at the Mayflower Hotel, not far away. \"I'm here on behalf of the President as a tangible sign of his commitment to defending Christians,\" Pence said. \"The Christian faith is under siege. Throughout the world, no people of faith today face greater hostility or hatred than the followers of Christ.\" The vice president's speech was broadcast live on whitehouse.gov, and Pence promoted it with seven tweets from his personal account .\n\nLess than thirty-six hours later, conference-goers were bussed over to Trump's hotel for a lavish dinner of filet mignon, potatoes au gratin, and asparagus - with revenues from the banquet paid to Trump Old Post Office LLC, adding to the Trump family's personal fortunes.\n\nSummit organizers said that they booked the dinner two months prior to the event, and that Pence agreed to speak at the Mayflower several weeks later. They said the decision to hold the event at the Trump hotel's Presidential Ballroom was driven by its capacity, which is significantly larger than the Mayflower's 7,600 square-foot Grand Ballroom.\n\n\"I've got no information that we knew anything about a banquet at the Trump hotel,\" said an official from the vice president's office. According to Marc E. Lotter, Pence's press secretary, \"The vice president spoke to the group on Thursday at the Mayflower Hotel as he has long been focused on religious persecution in the world.\"\n\nSummit organizers told The Intercept that \"800-plus\" people attended the dinner. An estimate provided by Trump hotel event planners put the average cost of food at roughly $105 per plate, not including audio-visual and room rental fees. The total cost of a similar event held at the Trump hotel by the Kuwaiti government was $40,000 to $60,000, according to Reuters .\n\nNorman Eisen, a former U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic who is currently affiliated with the Brookings Institution, has been a vocal critic of Trump's conflicts of interest. \"There's this pattern,\" Eisen said, regarding last week's summit events. \"The unsavory intersection of special interest influence in the Trump administration, proximity, and access, mingled with the utilization of Trump's properties. Because he's retained an ownership interest, there's cash going into his pocket.\"\n\nTrump Old Post Office LLC is leasing the hotel building from the federal government. A March letter from the General Services Administration found that the lease is still valid despite a clause prohibiting elected officials from being \"admitted ... to any benefit.\" According to the letter, the hotel's LLC is owned by several other Trump family corporations, including the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust and Ivanka OPO LLC. The president used its ballroom for one large press conference during the campaign. He has promised to donate hotel profits from foreign governments back to the U.S. Treasury, though a Trump Organization spokeswoman told USA Today that he will hang onto the money until the end of the year.\n\nA spokesperson for last week's summit said the event was funded by a large number of small donors. While declining to provide a list of the names to The Intercept, the spokesperson said that none of the backers were foreign governments. If true, this means Trump family corporations would pocket the profits from the event.\n\nA security guard standing outside the presidential ballroom on Friday stopped a reporter from entering, saying it was a \"private event.\" According to Patricia Tang,  a spokesperson for the hotel, \"We never comment on anybody who had an event or who may have had an event, for the privacy of guests.\"\n\nThe total cost of the summit was $4 million, according to the organizers. As reported by Time Magazine, Pence met with Metropolitan Hilarion, a cleric who leads the external relations department of the Russian Orthodox Church. The two men discussed how Russia and the U.S. could cooperate on Middle Eastern counter-terrorism efforts. Photos posted to an official church homepage show Hilarion meeting Pence on Thursday , Franklin Graham on Friday , and Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, on Monday . Kislyak is at the center of a multiple investigations into the Trump administration's contacts with the Russian government during the campaign and transition.\n\nTrump has had a long and mutually beneficial relationship with the Graham family that predates last week's dinner. He attended Billy Graham's 95th birthday party in 2013. Days before the 2016 election, Franklin Graham said that at the birthday party, Trump was one of \"many people\" who \"gave their hearts to Christ.\" Trump gave $135,000 from his own foundation to Graham family charities beginning in 2012. Franklin Graham backed him through the rocky election, urging his evangelical followers to \"hold your nose and vote.\" Graham was one of six clergy members - the final one - to deliver prayers from the Capitol at Trump's inauguration.\n\nTrump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. on March 3, 2017.\n\nEisen said that the dinner was \"unsavory but legal, unless there were foreign government donors, in which case this would be a potential violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution.\" He added, \"I think the American people have a right to know who those donors are.\"\n\nThe Washington hotel is the subject of a lawsuit alleging that Trump is in violation of the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits federal officials from accepting \"any present, Emolument, Office, or Title\" from foreign governments. Trump's personal attorneys have said that the clause does not cover \"routine business transactions,\" including payments for hotel rooms. On Monday night, the artist and journalist Robin Bell projected the full text of the Emoluments Clause onto the entrance of Trump's Washington hotel, along with the words \"Emoluments Welcome\" and \"Pay Trump Bribes Here.\"\n\nProjections of #EmolumentsWelcome at Trump Hotel in Washington, DC 5-15-17 #resist pic.twitter.com/8gkucztYOm\n\n- Robin Bell (@bellvisuals) May 16, 2017\n\nTop photo: Franklin Graham, right, prays for Vice President Mike Pence during the World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians hosted by Graham, and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association on May 11, 2017 in Washington.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "The Cult of Donald Trump\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nOn January 6, Trump was not much different from Jim Jones, as he urged his rabid followers to kill American democracy.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a \"Save America Rally\" near the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nDonald Trump is a murderous cult leader who incited the mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, hoping that his supporters would kill his own vice president, Mike Pence, and as many members of Congress as possible so that he could become a dictator.\n\nThat was the inescapable conclusion from Thursday night's chilling prime-time, nationally televised hearing of the House January 6 committee. The committee combined a wide range of evidence and testimony to reveal a timeline of the insurrection, showing how Trump eagerly sent his mob to the Capitol and then refused for hours to call them off when they broke into the building. Instead, he wanted to join and lead them.\n\nOn January 6, Trump was not much different from Jim Jones at Jonestown, as he urged his rabid followers to kill American democracy.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nTrump controlled the insurrection, and he could easily have stopped his cult members from attacking the Capitol, the hearing revealed. But he didn't want to stop them. For months, he had tried everything to overturn the 2020 election and failed, so now he was willing to try assassination.\n\nSome of the most damning evidence presented during the hearing was audio of insurrectionist leaders and video from inside the Capitol, showing how the rioters were keyed into every Trump tweet in real time and were eager to do his bidding. The evidence showed that the insurrectionists believed - indeed, knew - that they were following Trump's orders.\n\nAs soon as the insurrection began, Trump's family members and White House aides, along with leading members of Congress, tried to get him to call off the mob - because they all knew that it was his mob and that he could call them off if he chose to do so. That fact alone is damning evidence that should be used to prove his leadership of the insurrection in a criminal investigation by the Justice Department.\n\nBut Trump refused to listen to any of them. \"The mob was accomplishing [Trump's] purpose,\" Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican, said during Thursday's hearing.\n\nIn fact, Trump did not lift a finger to try to stop the insurrection during its most critical hours, the committee revealed. He didn't call anyone in the government - not at the Pentagon, or the Justice Department, or the Department of Homeland Security - for help gaining control over the violent crisis at the Capitol. Testimony by former Trump aides and others, including Gen. Mark Milley, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, showed that Trump did nothing except call Republican senators to try to get them to refuse to certify the election. \"You're the commander in chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol of the United States of America, and there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero?\" Milley told the committee in disbelief.\n\nIt was finally Pence, not Trump, who ordered the military to send the National Guard to the Capitol, Milley said in audio of his testimony played during Thursday night's hearing.\n\nPence's role as the presiding officer during the congressional certification of the election on January 6 made him a target for Trump and the mob, and his Secret Service detail feared for their own lives, the committee revealed. An unidentified White House aide who was listening to radio traffic from the Secret Service told the committee that agents were calling their families to say goodbye. Trump showed no remorse for the danger in which he had put his own vice president, telling a White House staffer later that day that Pence had let him down by refusing to block the congressional certification.\n\nIt was hours after the insurrection began - and only after it was clearly starting to lose momentum - that Trump grudgingly made a half-hearted statement urging his supporters to go home.\n\nThe next day, the president showed no remorse. The committee played previously unseen video outtakes from the public statement he made on January 7, showing that he refused to say that the election was over and struggled about whether to say his followers had done anything wrong.\n\nThere was just one light moment in the hearing about the darkest day in modern American history: The committee showed video footage of Sen. Josh Hawley running for his life through the halls of Congress just after he was photographed outside the Capitol raising his fist in support of the mob.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

The placards signaled dissent from the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move the U.S. embassy there next year, despite international consensus that the Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem in 1967 was illegal.\n\n???? ???? ????? ???- ???? ?????? ?????? ????? ?????: ???? ???????, ???? ?????? pic.twitter.com/niVrRm2riB\n\n- ???? ??????

It's a little late for him to be posing now as a defender of democracy and a counter to Trump's authoritarianism.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence at the White House in April. (Drew Angerer / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen Mike Pence announced Wednesday morning that he did not have the power to stop the transfer of presidential power from loser to victor, many outside the QAnon community rightly breathed a sigh of relief. The vice president had reached his limit; like most Americans, he'd had it with Donald Trump's nonsense. By afternoon, Trump's rage over Pence's refusal to aid his anti-democratic plot led him to incite his fans to storm the Capitol, which they did. The day ended with Pence cowering in a secret location and phoning the Pentagon.\n\nNews outlets are reporting that Pence is \"angry\" at Trump. Good grief. Now he's angry, just because his own narcissism has been injured by Trump's taunts? These two have deserved each other along.\n\nYesterday, Newt Gingrich called the eerily blank-eyed Ken Doll of a VP a \"profile in courage.\" Is he kidding?\n\nActually, Wednesday was a fitting coda to Mike Pence's disgraceful career: hiding from armed fascists and feigning shock at the authoritarian antics of the clown he's been faithfully serving for four years like a well-trained dog. No doubt he (reasonably) fears for his life, with the wrath of Trump's militias and random crazies upon him. He deserves whatever distress he's suffering right now and more. Mike Pence has spent his life enabling the rise of the far right and these remarkably unappealing chickens have now come home to roost, as Malcolm X would have noted. Or, to put it in language that the evangelical Pence might find more relatable: a man reaps what he sows.\n\nAfter all, Pence has been a dedicated enemy of democracy for even longer than Trump. Before he became Donald J. Trump's loyal silent butler, Mike Pence was a supporter of the Tea Party movement and a fully owned subsidiary of the Koch brothers. As Jane Mayer of the New Yorker has reported, the billionaire Koch family, highly organized in waging a conservative class war from above - specifically through policy, has been funding foot soldier Pence since he was in Congress. He did their bidding there, organizing other lawmakers to sign onto their \"No Climate Tax\" pledge. Even Steve Bannon reportedly expressed worry about Pence being so close in the presidential succession: \"I'd be concerned he'd be a president the Kochs would own.\"\n\nThis is surely true, and yet another reason to cheer the passing of the Trump/Pence administration. As governor of Indiana, a job he held from 2013 to 2017, Pence presided over the largest tax cut in Indiana's history, and the austerity that followed. While in Congress, he passionately opposed raising the minimum wage and even opposed rescuing the auto industry.\n\nMike Pence is one of those American conservatives who sees no contradiction between extreme \"economic freedom\" and social repression. Their brand of Christianity is harsh; they like the free market because it is punitive. Some might read the Bible and see Jesus as a peaceful, gentle, and forgiving hippy, but people like Pence dislike that version of Jesus. They want our lives to be an unending Book of Job, a hell on earth: no sex without procreation and no moment's rest from the struggle to make ends meet.\n\nWomen's rights are a cornerstone of civilization. Without gender equality, there is no real democracy, and every private home is a potential dictatorship. As governor of Indiana, Pence did his best to realize this dystopian vision, among other things by signing bills restricting abortion. He even attracted criticism from moderate Republicans by approving a religious freedom law that enables a wide range of bigoted corporate behavior. The law was rightly seen as giving carte blanche to companies to discriminate against LGBT workers, and objections from the business world (and, especially, from the National Collegiate Athletic Association) forced Pence to sign another bill strengthening protections for LGBT rights.\n\nPence may have tried to look like the adult in the room Wednesday, but the debacle was entirely his own fault. He may find these rioting chuds distasteful, but he's not much better than they are and has been helping out their cause for years. Even if he does end up using the 25th Amendment to prevent Trump from serving the remaining days of his term, it will be too little, too late, and won't make him any less complicit in Trump's latest assault on democracy.\n\nLiza Featherstone is a columnist for Jacobin , a freelance journalist, and the author of Selling Women Short: The Landmark Battle for Workers' Rights at Wal-Mart .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn the halcyon days of 2016, when something like the conventional and pundit-sanctioned laws of politics still seemed to apply, the official gatekeepers of American conservatism mounted a multipronged strategy designed to neutralize Donald Trump. In a trial run of the tactic that would so badly fail Hillary Clinton that November, some fixated on his indecency and inexperience.\n\n\"Both parties have been infested by candidates who have treated the presidency as an entry-level position,\" bleated a January editorial in the National Review . \"The burdens and intricacies of leadership are special; experience in other fields is not transferable.\" Elsewhere, the same tract attempted to situate Trump as an unreliable tribune of conservatism, darkly intoning that his past comments on abortion, gun control, health care policy, and \"punitive taxes on the wealthy\" suggested \"he and Bernie Sanders . . . shared more than funky outer-borough accents.\"\n\nIn light of what happened next, these lines of attack now feel quaint. Having strong-armed his way past a cadre of donor-vetted suits like Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Jeb Bush en route to the presidency, Trump quickly made his bizarre demagogic style the lingua franca of the American right. For reasons of ideology, opportunism, or some combination of both, many erstwhile opponents obligingly hopped aboard the Trump train, leaving the handful who maintained a critical posture firmly on the margins of Republican politics. Appeals to decency, honor, and Trump's unreliable conservative bona fides fell on deaf ears.\n\nWith all of this in mind, it was somewhat surreal to witness the respective campaign launches of former New Jersey governor Chris Christie (incidentally a minor character in the Republican crackup of 2016) and former vice president Mike Pence this week. Where Ron DeSantis has hitherto done his best to triangulate on the question of Donald Trump, both Pence and Christie are evidently planning to run more directly against him.\n\n\"Different times call for different leadership,\" declared Pence in a three-minute launch video yesterday that also channeled the typical grievances of the evangelical right. \"Today our party and our country need a leader that will appeal, as Lincoln said, to 'the better angels of our nature.'\" Though Pence did not mention Trump by name or allude to the events of January 6, 2021, the mere fact of his candidacy makes having to do both inevitable - and there's no reason to think the Republican primary electorate will be receptive.\n\nIf Pence's launch resembled a Republican version of Bidenism with an evangelical twist, Christie's was more like a garbled transmission beamed across time from a distant galaxy where the name \"Dick Cheney\" still commands respect. Unlike Pence, Christie seized the occasion on Tuesday to aim his tired tough-guy routine squarely at Trump.\n\nOpening with a roughly twenty-minute spiel that mentioned the Greeks, George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and Abraham Lincoln, the former governor made a series of cliched appeals to \"character\" and compared Trump to \"Lord Voldemort.\" \"Governing is about compromise. . . . When did 'compromise' become such a dirty word?\" asked Christie, who apparently suffers from a rare form of amnesia in which the events of 2016 have been entirely erased.\n\nBarring some completely unexpected turn of events, both these men are going to lose. Their respective campaigns' animating premise - that the same messaging and tactics that have failed to dethrone Trump in the past will suddenly work on the thousandth try - is absurd on its face.\n\nChristie quite literally sold his soul to Trump in 2016, becoming one of his most prominent establishment endorsers upon leaving the race, while Pence served as his vice president. Much as it's already done with Ron DeSantis, the Trump campaign will be able to pull from a vast arsenal of clips and sound bites showing Christie and Pence praising the man they now deem unsuitable to lead the Republican Party.\n\nWhy would anyone buy it? And what in God's name makes either of these men believe the same playbook that failed to stop Trump in 2016 will somehow be effective seven years later?\n\nOne possible explanation, certainly applicable to numerous primary candidates in 2020, is that neither is actually trying to win. For many a presidential also-ran, a plush media gig, a book deal, or a perch in an administration can make even a quixotic campaign an attractive prospect. This, however, seems unlikely. Pence and Christie are already known quantities, and it's clear neither is auditioning for another job in the administration. Some of the motivation might be personal: after dropping out in 2016, Christie repeatedly kissed the ring to no avail, while Pence became the target of MAGA ire for not falling into line on January 6. In the latter case, a former vice president would normally be a de facto front-runner for the top job, and Pence may be under the impression that the same will apply in 2024.\n\nThe most plausible explanation, though, is that the machinery of traditional Republican politics has yet to fully accommodate itself to the realities of the post-2016 world. After Trump's defeat in 2020, many institutional conservatives apparently concluded the fever dream would pass and that something like normalcy would soon reassert itself. The electoral anticlimax of last November's midterms, albeit momentarily, again made this idea almost believable. Never having dropped below any of his rivals to begin with, Trump's poll numbers have since gone up and entrenched him as the race's clear front-runner.\n\nIf there's a lesson here, it's that Trumpism is less a passing fancy than a structural shift in the politics of the Right. More than any other figure in modern history, Trump has fused his personality and affectations with the grievances and prejudices of his party's base. Unable to process this reality, more traditional Republican politicians are intent on clinging to the idea that the Trumpian albatross can still be cast off through conventional means. Over the next several months, that premise will be tested. And if 2016's debates are any indication, the likes of Pence and Christie will live to regret having believed it.\n\nLuke Savage is a staff writer at Jacobin .

(Alex Wong / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOne of the most powerful ideas of the Trump era has been a liberal yearning for a return to \"normal,\" the impulse to get rid of Donald Trump, get back to brunch, and simply stop paying attention to politics for another four years. It's what helped give the Democratic nomination to Joe Biden, who promised that, while \"nothing will fundamentally change\" under him, and the national and global crises that led to Trump will be allowed to fester, you at least \"won't have to worry about my tweets when I'm president.\"\n\nWednesday's vice presidential debate showed exactly why that idea has always been so dangerous.\n\nFor many commentators, Wednesday's debate , coming after a Trump-Biden matchup near-universally derided as a national embarrassment , was not just a preview of what could be the race in 2024, but the closest we've gotten in four years to a simpler, better time. And it's true that the contest between California senator Kamala Harris - a corporate fundraising machine and prosecutor of the poor who postures as a born-again progressive - and vice president Mike Pence - a hard-right, fundamentalist zealot who presents himself as sober and serious - felt like a trip to a world before Trump's election ruptured the status quo.\n\nThat seems to be exactly how a cohort of the obsessively anti-Trump crowd saw it once it was done.\n\n\"It was like a visit to Normal-Politics Land,\" said MSNBC's Rachel Maddow. Sure, there was some rule-breaking, said her fellow anchor Ari Melber afterward, but it was not the \"norm-busting\" spectacle of the presidential debate.\n\n\"Compared to Donald Trump, Mike Pence is a prince of gentility,\" marveled Lawrence O'Donnell on the network. \"People who . . . endured that Trump debate, watching this tonight, you have to wonder, are they watching this and thinking, 'Oh, so it could be like this instead of the insanity, the brawling, stumbling crazy insanity that they saw at the other debate'?\"\n\nIt wasn't just MSNBC. \"Over the course of a 90-minute debate that was mostly pro-forma, occasionally illuminating and fundamentally normal compared with the ill-tempered shouting match that was last week's presidential encounter, both [candidates] projected professionalism and competence,\" wrote the Economist .\n\nThe debate was \"weirdly normal\" and \"came as something of a relief,\" wrote Yahoo! News . It was \"far closer to a normal presidential contest,\" wrote Politico , a \"kind of normal [that] isn't on the ballot right now\" and has little to do with the Trump-driven political reality of the day, but was \"welcome\" right now - and, by implication, will be welcome in 2024. In one of its post-debate write-ups, the New York Times contrasted against Trump's belligerent showmanship Pence's \"reserved and dutiful approach\" and his seeming \"to embody what the party thought it needed in a nominee before Mr. Trump came along.\"\n\n\"The question for more traditional Republicans like Mr. Pence is whether their relatively restrained styles will seem like a comfort to voters who are eager to return to something more normal and familiar,\" it concluded.\n\nUnsurprisingly, some of the most noxious voices on the Right echoed this same sentiment. \"See, what Pence is doing tonight is what the Trump administration would look like without Twitter,\" a giddy Ben Shapiro wrote . \"And it is GOOD. VERY GOOD.\" Over on Fox, Brit Hume remarked that Pence did a better job of selling Trump's supposed accomplishments than Trump himself did.\n\nIt's not hard to see why figures like Shapiro are excited. A post-debate FiveThirtyEight-Ipsos poll found that, while respondents generally thought Harris did better, nearly 60 percent thought Pence had a \"good\" performance, compared to only 33 percent who thought the same of Trump last week, and Pence even marginally improved his \"favorable\" numbers.\n\nAnd yet it's difficult to understand what debate these members of the press were watching. Pence cleared the nearly subterranean bar of not being as obnoxiously belligerent as Trump, sure, but for anyone worried about Trump and the country's \"norms,\" they had plenty of material. Pence often ignored both the moderator and her questions, repeatedly flouting the rules and talking over both his opponent and the moderator's attempts to control the debate. He simply sidestepped a question about what he would do if Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power should he lose the election. And, just as in 2016 , he coldly and calmly lied his way through the debate.\n\nThis has always been the problem with the myopic brand of anti-Trumpism led by the establishment \"Resistance.\" It has always been clear that a large portion of whatever cross-party dislike for Trump existed was rooted in stylistic disgust at his personal behavior and tweeting, rather than anything of substance. Instead of viewing Trump as an unvarnished personification of the often crude and ugly politics of the US right, this form of anti-Trumpism has cast him as something unique and exceptional, in the process rehabilitating the \"mainstream\" US conservatism that supposedly rebels against Trump - but that, in reality, leaves little daylight between itself and him on the things that matter.\n\nIf Wednesday's debate really was a peek into the future, it was a singularly bleak one. This is the \"normal\" that outlets like MSNBC pine for, and that Joe Biden promises to restore: Trumpism without Trump, packaged and sold in the form of a seemingly competent, sober, \"normal\" Republican like Pence, a dead-eyed religious extremist who is better positioned to bring the country on board with Trump's monstrous agenda without inciting the kind of media and public backlash that Trump's erratic, offensive behavior has.\n\nFor Trump's entire presidency, outlets like the one you're reading have chided the establishment gatekeepers of US politics. They've warned that, rather than using the uniquely reviled figure of Trump to inform the public about why he was really dangerous - that is, his pursuit of the conventional Republican program of nativism and ruling-class warfare that every GOP president has amped up since Ronald Reagan first got the ball rolling - establishment pundits were instead ginning up a ratings-and-sales-driven panic around Trump as something unprecedented and unique that stands apart from everything else on the US spectrum. And that rather than focusing people's attention on urgent problems like climate change or ballooning wealth inequality and how they led to Trump's rise, these gatekeepers were herding people's understandable concerns about his presidency into a misguided desire to go back to an idyllic time that never really existed.\n\nWe may be getting a taste of the role Trump will play for years to come, as a laughably low benchmark by which all past and future politicians will be judged, no matter how fundamentally aligned they are with his politics. The warm response to Pence's performance may very well be the future. And for anyone who opposes Trump for what he actually does, and not what he tweets, that's a scary thought.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

(While Pence spoke, a fly landed on his head, suggesting, in case it wasn't clear, that he is full of shit.)\n\nDonald Trump and the Republican Party have made opposition to the movement against police violence a signature theme of the 2020 presidential election.

Indeed, Pence brought Flora Westbrook, whose nail salon was burned down in the days of unrest that followed George Floyd's murder by a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, as a guest to the debate, mentioning her in response to the question about Taylor.\n\nIn contrast to Pence's emphasis on supporting law enforcement, Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris began her response to the question of whether justice was served in the case of Taylor's murder by stating, \"I do not believe so.\" \"I believe strongly that, first of all, we are never going to condone violence, but we always must fight for the values that we hold dear,\" she continued, stating that a Biden administration would ban chokeholds, require a national registry for officers who break the law, get rid of cash bail and private prisons, and decriminalize marijuana while expunging the records of those convicted of marijuana possession.\n\nNext to Pence's police worship and feigned incredulity that Harris, a former prosecutor, would question the findings of the grand jury that investigated Taylor's case - one member of the grand jury is currently in revolt , it should be noted, accusing Kentucky's attorney general of preventing them from bringing charges against the officers for Taylor's death - it was a substantive answer.\n\nBut the spectrum of political possibility between the Democratic and Republican parties remains too narrow, and neither party shows any indication that this will change anytime soon. The movement that swept the country this summer is demanding the diversion of money now lavished on police into communities, a vision no one on the debate stage will go anywhere near.\n\nAt the debate, Harris called her prosecutorial record a \"model\" of what a Biden administration could accomplish on criminal justice reform. While that record contains a few progressive stances, it also includes several causes for concern : in particular, her support for prosecuting the parents of truant children, and her denial of health care for trans inmates. She only came around on legalizing marijuana in 2018 .\n\nBiden, for his part, opposes defunding the police. When asked about the subject at a town hall earlier this week, he said that he's going to bring together \"peaceful protestors, police chiefs, police officers, the police unions, as well as the civil rights groups, in the White House and sit down and decide what are the things that need to be done to improve and help police officers.\" He continued by reiterating that he is \"the one who is talking about increasing police budgets.\"\n\nThat isn't to say that the Biden-Harris ticket is worse than Trump-Pence on criminal justice reform; it's not. The latter's agenda, insofar as they can be said to have one, is atrocious . But despite the GOP's insistence that Biden is nothing but a stalking horse for the Left, he and his campaign are opponents, not allies, of socialists (if you don't believe me, believe Biden, who doesn't shy away from making this point himself). In other words, the movement still has a long way to go.\n\nAlex N. Press is an assistant editor at Jacobin .

In a trial run of the tactic that would so badly fail Hillary Clinton that November, some fixated on his indecency and inexperience.\n\n\"Both parties have been infested by candidates who have treated the presidency as an entry-level position,\" bleated a January editorial in the National Review . \"The burdens and intricacies of leadership are special; experience in other fields is not transferable.\" Elsewhere, the same tract attempted to situate Trump as an unreliable tribune of conservatism, darkly intoning that his past comments on abortion, gun control, health care policy, and \"punitive taxes on the wealthy\" suggested \"he and Bernie Sanders . . . shared more than funky outer-borough accents.\"\n\nIn light of what happened next, these lines of attack now feel quaint. Having strong-armed his way past a cadre of donor-vetted suits like Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Jeb Bush en route to the presidency, Trump quickly made his bizarre demagogic style the lingua franca of the American right. For reasons of ideology, opportunism, or some combination of both, many erstwhile opponents obligingly hopped aboard the Trump train, leaving the handful who maintained a critical posture firmly on the margins of Republican politics. Appeals to decency, honor, and Trump's unreliable conservative bona fides fell on deaf ears.\n\nWith all of this in mind, it was somewhat surreal to witness the respective campaign launches of former New Jersey governor Chris Christie (incidentally a minor character in the Republican crackup of 2016) and former vice president Mike Pence this week. Where Ron DeSantis has hitherto done his best to triangulate on the question of Donald Trump, both Pence and Christie are evidently planning to run more directly against him.\n\n\"Different times call for different leadership,\" declared Pence in a three-minute launch video yesterday that also channeled the typical grievances of the evangelical right. \"Today our party and our country need a leader that will appeal, as Lincoln said, to 'the better angels of our nature.'\" Though Pence did not mention Trump by name or allude to the events of January 6, 2021, the mere fact of his candidacy makes having to do both inevitable - and there's no reason to think the Republican primary electorate will be receptive.\n\nIf Pence's launch resembled a Republican version of Bidenism with an evangelical twist, Christie's was more like a garbled transmission beamed across time from a distant galaxy where the name \"Dick Cheney\" still commands respect. Unlike Pence, Christie seized the occasion on Tuesday to aim his tired tough-guy routine squarely at Trump.\n\nOpening with a roughly twenty-minute spiel that mentioned the Greeks, George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and Abraham Lincoln, the former governor made a series of cliched appeals to \"character\" and compared Trump to \"Lord Voldemort.\" \"Governing is about compromise. . . . When did 'compromise' become such a dirty word?\" asked Christie, who apparently suffers from a rare form of amnesia in which the events of 2016 have been entirely erased.\n\nBarring some completely unexpected turn of events, both these men are going to lose. Their respective campaigns' animating premise - that the same messaging and tactics that have failed to dethrone Trump in the past will suddenly work on the thousandth try - is absurd on its face.\n\nChristie quite literally sold his soul to Trump in 2016, becoming one of his most prominent establishment endorsers upon leaving the race, while Pence served as his vice president. Much as it's already done with Ron DeSantis, the Trump campaign will be able to pull from a vast arsenal of clips and sound bites showing Christie and Pence praising the man they now deem unsuitable to lead the Republican Party.\n\nWhy would anyone buy it? And what in God's name makes either of these men believe the same playbook that failed to stop Trump in 2016 will somehow be effective seven years later?\n\nOne possible explanation, certainly applicable to numerous primary candidates in 2020, is that neither is actually trying to win. For many a presidential also-ran, a plush media gig, a book deal, or a perch in an administration can make even a quixotic campaign an attractive prospect. This, however, seems unlikely. Pence and Christie are already known quantities, and it's clear neither is auditioning for another job in the administration. Some of the motivation might be personal: after dropping out in 2016, Christie repeatedly kissed the ring to no avail, while Pence became the target of MAGA ire for not falling into line on January 6. In the latter case, a former vice president would normally be a de facto front-runner for the top job, and Pence may be under the impression that the same will apply in 2024.\n\nThe most plausible explanation, though, is that the machinery of traditional Republican politics has yet to fully accommodate itself to the realities of the post-2016 world. After Trump's defeat in 2020, many institutional conservatives apparently concluded the fever dream would pass and that something like normalcy would soon reassert itself. The electoral anticlimax of last November's midterms, albeit momentarily, again made this idea almost believable. Never having dropped below any of his rivals to begin with, Trump's poll numbers have since gone up and entrenched him as the race's clear front-runner.\n\nIf there's a lesson here, it's that Trumpism is less a passing fancy than a structural shift in the politics of the Right. More than any other figure in modern history, Trump has fused his personality and affectations with the grievances and prejudices of his party's base. Unable to process this reality, more traditional Republican politicians are intent on clinging to the idea that the Trumpian albatross can still be cast off through conventional means. Over the next several months, that premise will be tested. And if 2016's debates are any indication, the likes of Pence and Christie will live to regret having believed it.\n\nLuke Savage is a staff writer at Jacobin .

It's a little late for him to be posing now as a defender of democracy and a counter to Trump's authoritarianism.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence at the White House in April.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen Mike Pence announced Wednesday morning that he did not have the power to stop the transfer of presidential power from loser to victor, many outside the QAnon community rightly breathed a sigh of relief. The vice president had reached his limit; like most Americans, he'd had it with Donald Trump's nonsense. By afternoon, Trump's rage over Pence's refusal to aid his anti-democratic plot led him to incite his fans to storm the Capitol, which they did. The day ended with Pence cowering in a secret location and phoning the Pentagon.\n\nNews outlets are reporting that Pence is \"angry\" at Trump. Good grief. Now he's angry, just because his own narcissism has been injured by Trump's taunts? These two have deserved each other along.\n\nYesterday, Newt Gingrich called the eerily blank-eyed Ken Doll of a VP a \"profile in courage.\" Is he kidding?\n\nActually, Wednesday was a fitting coda to Mike Pence's disgraceful career: hiding from armed fascists and feigning shock at the authoritarian antics of the clown he's been faithfully serving for four years like a well-trained dog. No doubt he (reasonably) fears for his life, with the wrath of Trump's militias and random crazies upon him. He deserves whatever distress he's suffering right now and more. Mike Pence has spent his life enabling the rise of the far right and these remarkably unappealing chickens have now come home to roost, as Malcolm X would have noted. Or, to put it in language that the evangelical Pence might find more relatable: a man reaps what he sows.\n\nAfter all, Pence has been a dedicated enemy of democracy for even longer than Trump. Before he became Donald J. Trump's loyal silent butler, Mike Pence was a supporter of the Tea Party movement and a fully owned subsidiary of the Koch brothers. As Jane Mayer of the New Yorker has reported, the billionaire Koch family, highly organized in waging a conservative class war from above - specifically through policy, has been funding foot soldier Pence since he was in Congress. He did their bidding there, organizing other lawmakers to sign onto their \"No Climate Tax\" pledge. Even Steve Bannon reportedly expressed worry about Pence being so close in the presidential succession: \"I'd be concerned he'd be a president the Kochs would own.\"\n\nThis is surely true, and yet another reason to cheer the passing of the Trump/Pence administration. As governor of Indiana, a job he held from 2013 to 2017, Pence presided over the largest tax cut in Indiana's history, and the austerity that followed. While in Congress, he passionately opposed raising the minimum wage and even opposed rescuing the auto industry.\n\nMike Pence is one of those American conservatives who sees no contradiction between extreme \"economic freedom\" and social repression. Their brand of Christianity is harsh; they like the free market because it is punitive. Some might read the Bible and see Jesus as a peaceful, gentle, and forgiving hippy, but people like Pence dislike that version of Jesus. They want our lives to be an unending Book of Job, a hell on earth: no sex without procreation and no moment's rest from the struggle to make ends meet.\n\nWomen's rights are a cornerstone of civilization. Without gender equality, there is no real democracy, and every private home is a potential dictatorship. As governor of Indiana, Pence did his best to realize this dystopian vision, among other things by signing bills restricting abortion. He even attracted criticism from moderate Republicans by approving a religious freedom law that enables a wide range of bigoted corporate behavior. The law was rightly seen as giving carte blanche to companies to discriminate against LGBT workers, and objections from the business world (and, especially, from the National Collegiate Athletic Association) forced Pence to sign another bill strengthening protections for LGBT rights.\n\nPence may have tried to look like the adult in the room Wednesday, but the debacle was entirely his own fault. He may find these rioting chuds distasteful, but he's not much better than they are and has been helping out their cause for years. Even if he does end up using the 25th Amendment to prevent Trump from serving the remaining days of his term, it will be too little, too late, and won't make him any less complicit in Trump's latest assault on democracy.\n\nLiza Featherstone is a columnist for Jacobin , a freelance journalist, and the author of Selling Women Short: The Landmark Battle for Workers' Rights at Wal-Mart .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But the measures to deal with the crisis risk spurring an authoritarian controlled capitalism - one that protects corporate interests while offloading the costs onto the rest of us.\n\nUS president Donald Trump speaks as Vice President Mike Pence looks on during a briefing on the coronavirus pandemic in the press briefing room of the White House on March 26, 2020 in Washington, DC.\nDrew Angerer / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe COVID-19 public health emergency has rapidly turned into a crisis at the core of the world economy, which also threatens developing countries in the periphery. It has changed the balance between state and market, once again exposing the emptiness of neoliberal ideology. This economic crisis casts a harsh light on contemporary capitalism - and is likely to prove even more important than the blow to public health.\n\nIndeed, this crisis has deeper roots , in the diseased workings of financialized and globalized capitalism over the past decade. The Great Crisis of 2007-9 brought an end to the 1990s-2000s \"golden era\" of finance, and the years that followed were marked by poor growth at the core of the world economy. Profitability was weak, productivity growth was low, and investment showed no dynamism at all. Finance was also in trouble, exhibiting lower profitability and none of the extraordinary dynamism of the previous decade. Where the historically unprecedented crisis of 2007-9 marked the peak of financialization, the equally novel coronavirus crisis crystallizes its deterioration.\n\nOf course, the immediate spur for the crisis owed to nation-states' actions faced with the epidemic. Having initially ignored the medical emergency, several states then frantically locked down entire countries and geographical areas, restricting travel, closing schools and universities, and so on. This hit hard the already weakened core economies by inducing a wholesale collapse of demand, disruption of supply chains, falling production, millions of worker layoffs and loss of corporate revenue. All this spurred an unprecedented nosedive of major stock markets and panic conditions in the money markets.\n\nIt is as if the Black Death of the fourteenth century had staged a return, and twenty-first century societies responded with a similar mix of blind fear and isolation of communities. Yet the plague killed a third of Europe's population back when its states were poor and backward feudal monarchies. In contrast, the coronavirus appears to have a low mortality rate and has struck advanced capitalist states of peerless technological accomplishments. There is already an intense debate among epidemiologists on whether wholesale lockdown was an appropriate and sustainable response, or if states should instead have focused on intensive testing of the population .\n\nIt is not for political economists to assess epidemiological policies. But there is little doubt that several states' reactions and the ensuing collapse of economic activity are of a piece with the fundamentally flawed nature of neoliberal financialized capitalism. An economic system based on competition and naked profit-seeking - both guaranteed by a powerful state - proved incapable of dealing calmly and effectively with a public health shock of unknown severity.\n\nSeveral advanced countries lacked the basic health infrastructure to treat those who became seriously ill, while also being short of equipment to test the population on a large scale and to protect those most likely to catch the disease. The lockdown and wholesale isolation of huge sections of society are, moreover, likely to have very severe implications for wage workers as well as the poorest, the weakest, and the most marginal layers. The mental and psychological repercussions will also be devastating. The social organization of contemporary capitalism was shown to be dysfunctional even from an engineering point of view.\n\nEqually striking, however, have been even powerful states' actions after the magnitude of the unfolding economic collapse became clear. In March, the central banks of the United States, the European Union, and Japan engaged in massive liquidity injections and brought interest rates down to zero, attempting to stabilize stock markets and assuage the shortage of liquidity. The US Federal Reserve, for instance, announced that it would buy unlimited volumes of government bonds and even freshly issued private corporate bonds. Governments in the United States, the European Union, and elsewhere, meanwhile, planned massive fiscal expansions, taking the form of loan and credit guarantees for companies, income subsidies for affected workers, tax deferrals, social security deferrals or subsidies, debt repayment holidays, and so on.\n\nIn an extraordinary move, the Trump administration announced plans to provide $1,200 per adult, or $2,400 per couple, with additional payments for children, starting with the poorest families. This disbursement was part of a package which could exceed $2 trillion - roughly 10 percent of US GDP - further providing $500 billion of loans to stricken businesses, $150 billion to hospitals and health care workers, and $370 billion of loans and grants to small and medium enterprises. In an equally extraordinary move, Britain's Tory government declared its intention effectively to become the employer of last resort by paying up to 80 percent of workers' salaries, if companies kept them on their payroll. These payments would be worth up to a maximum of £2,500 per month - just above the median income. Not content with this, the British government also effectively nationalized the railways for six months and there was talk of nationalizing airlines.\n\nJust days earlier, even left-wing academics would have considered these measures to be radical . The shibboleths of the neoliberal ideology of the last four decades were rapidly swept aside, and the state emerged as the regulator of the economy commanding enormous power. It was not difficult for many on the Left to welcome such state action, thinking that it indicated the \"return of Keynesianism\" and the death knell of neoliberalism. But it would be rash to come to such conclusions.\n\nFor one thing, the nation-state has always been at the heart of neoliberal capitalism, guaranteeing the class rule of the dominant corporate and financial bloc through selective interventions at critical moments. Moreover, these interventions were accompanied by strongly authoritarian measures, shutting people inside their homes en masse and locking down enormous metropoles. The state has also demonstrated its vast power to police society by collecting information through big data. For instance, Israel's right-wing government approved the tracking of cell phones by the security police with the aim of messaging people who had unwittingly come into contact with confirmed coronavirus patients. Not only do we know where you are, but we know better than you whom you have met.\n\nThis authoritarianism is fully in line with the dominant neoliberal ideology of the last four decades. State fiat is combined with the fragmentation of society as people are shut in their own homes and huge stress is placed on the \"individual responsibility\" to maintain social distancing. At the same time, large numbers of people are still required to go to work using public transport, while working rights are demolished, not least as layoffs rocket without concern for due process and as remote working destroys all limits to the working week.\n\nIt thus remains unclear what direction global capitalism will take as it reels under the shock of coronavirus - even as we still endure the long aftermath of the Great Crisis of 2007-9. The colossal power of the state and its ability to intervene in both economy and society could result, for instance, in a more authoritarian form of controlled capitalism in which the interests of the corporate and financial elite would be paramount. This demands that socialists assess carefully and critically the actions that states are taking to deal with the coronavirus crisis.\n\nThe first step is to have a simple analytical summary of the course of the crisis so far. Crises are always highly concrete historical events reflecting the institutional development of capitalism. The major steps in the coronavirus crisis can be gleaned from a raft of (sometimes rapidly outdated) publications by multilateral organizations , the press, and elsewhere. Thus:\n\nThis chain of crisis phenomena makes analytical sense only within the aftermath of the Great Crisis of 2007-9. In the wake of that crisis, financialized capitalism lost dynamism in core countries, though it continued in subordinate form in developing countries. Our estimates based on World Bank data suggest that average growth rates in 2010-19 were at their lowest for forty years: 1.4 percent in Japan, 1.8 percent in the European Union, 2.5 percent in the United States, and 8.5 percent in China (where growth weakened strikingly in the second half of the decade). These rates point to the exhaustion of the driving forces of capitalist accumulation particularly during the last decade. To gain insight into the deeper roots of the crisis, therefore, it suffices to consider some key aspects of the performance of the US economy - the mother lode of globalization and financialization.\n\nThe simplest way to sum up the underlying performance of US capitalism is to consider the profit rate of nonfinancial enterprises, shown in Figure 1:\n\nFig. 1   Profit rate of nonfinancial enterprises, US, 1980-2018\n\nThe trajectory of the profit rate was strongly cyclical and broadly in line with the overall fluctuations of the US economy. After the Great Crisis of 2007-9, the profit rate recovered weakly, peaking in 2014, and then declining. Clearly, the coronavirus shock hit the US economy at a time when it was already weak, and accumulation showed signs of exhaustion. The underlying weakness is also apparent from a variety of other data. Thus, after 2007-9, labor productivity grew at barely 1 percent per annum; investment remained flat and low at around 18 percent of GDP; and the real capital stock shrunk.\n\nInstructive, here, is a comparison with China, the world's second-largest economy. After the 2007-9 crisis the estimated average profit rate in China rose for several years but began to decline in 2014. The underlying weakness of accumulation also appears in other data, though China's performance remained substantially stronger than that of the United States. Thus, after 2007-9, labor productivity rose at around 7-8 percent per annum, investment was broadly flat at 45 percent of GDP, and industrial-capacity utilization fell rapidly. The coronavirus hit the Chinese economy at one of its weakest moments since the start of its capitalist transformation.\n\nComparison with the European Union, which is collectively larger than China but smaller than the United States, adds further insight. After 2007-9 productivity growth was worse than in the United States, particularly for states in the European Monetary Union (EMU), with the leading countries hovering below 1 percent per annum (Poland, which is not in the EMU, stood out with productivity growth above 3 percent). Industrial production increased substantially in Germany, despite its weak productivity growth, as capitalists continued to take advantage of the competitive edge gained from a long period of wage suppression. However, in 2019 it fell, revealing Germany's underlying weakness.\n\nThe European Union, weighed down by the austerity framework of the euro, was lodged in stagnation during the last decade. During the same period a new industrial complex began to emerge in Eastern Europe, as in Poland, closely associated with German industry. The labor share of GDP remained stagnant as capital defended its interests, except for Germany, where wage growth was significant for the first time in decades. Given the absence of sustained productivity growth, German competitiveness declined. All in all, coronavirus has thus hit the European Union at a time of great economic weakness.\n\nThe roots of the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus lie in the weakening of capitalist accumulation in the preceding period, which is evident in the United States, China, and the European Union. The impact of the crisis will, moreover, probably be very different in these economies because of their different structures. China has become the workshop of the world, with value added in manufacturing accounting for roughly 30 percent of GDP - the corresponding figure for the United States is just over 10 percent. Value added in services has risen substantially in China as the economy has become more mature, but it is still only at 50 percent of GDP, while in the United States it is above 75 percent. Since the shock of the lockdown falls disproportionately on services, it is likely that the United States will be worse affected than China, at least in the first instance.\n\nThe same holds broadly for the European Union, whose economy is heavily based on services, particularly in southern-periphery countries like Spain, Portugal, and Greece which have weak industry and are dependent on tourism. The shock will probably be even greater for Italy, which has been stagnant for two decades, and since 2010 never far from defaulting on its debt. The EU leadership are thus right to perceive the coronavirus crisis as an existential threat. That is the reason for the European Central Bank's (ECB) massive intervention, but also the actions of several nation-states, whose crisis expenditure has in practice lifted the iron cage of austerity over Europe.\n\nThe weakness of financialized capitalism in the United States can be further gauged by considering the profit rate of US commercial banks in Fig. 2:\n\nFig. 2 Rate of profit of commercial banks (return on equity), US, 1980 - 2018\n\nThe profitability of US commercial banks - the pivot of the financial system - reached historic highs from the early 1990s until shortly before the crisis of 2007-9 . This was the \"golden era\" of US financialization. Two factors explain the banks' exceptional profits: first, their ability to secure a sizeable spread between the interest rate on loans and the interest rate on deposits, and second, their ability to earn large fees and commissions by mediating financial transactions among enterprises, households, and other financial firms. After 2007-9, bank profitability never reached the same heights. This was because the Federal Reserve drove interest rates close to zero, thus compressing bank spreads, and also because income from fees and comissions declined as the volume of financial transactions declined. Bank profitability had a brief spurt in 2018 but that was mostly due to the Federal Reserve gently raising interest rates in 2017-8.\n\nFurther light can be cast on the decade after 2007-9 by considering the trajectory of debt in the United States in Fig. 3, split into the debt of i) nonfinancial enterprises, ii) households, iii) government, and iv) domestic financial enterprises, all relative to GDP:\n\nFig. 3 US Sectoral Debt to GDP\n\nUS private debt (in proportion to GDP) fell after 2007-9, contrary to much breathless commentary about a \"debt explosion.\" Mortgage debt declined substantially as households were badly hit during the Great Crisis. Debt among domestic financial enterprises also declined, thus leaving less scope for banks to earn fees and commissions. In contrast, the debt of nonfinancial corporations began to rise in 2015, eventually exceeding its previous peak before the Great Crisis. The rise in corporate debt has facilitated the survival of a multitude of weak enterprises with low profitability which are very vulnerable to shocks. These \"zombie firms\" were estimated in 2017 to represent 12 percent of all companies in fourteen developed economies. It remains to be seen how the coronavirus crisis will affect their ability to service their debts, bearing in mind that zero interest rates bring down servicing costs.\n\nThe real increase during this period, however, was in state debt, leaving the US government more indebted than at any time since World War II. Financialization after the Great Crisis, insofar as it showed any dynamism at all, became a process of exploding state indebtedness that was also connected to enterprise indebtedness in open financial markets - including the stock market.\n\nAfter the Great Crisis, the US government stepped into the breach and used its massive strength to defend financialized and globalized capitalism. Above all, it run a large fiscal deficit throughout the decade - but especially in 2009-2012 and again in 2018-19 - thus supporting GDP growth, while enormously increasing its debt. The rise in public debt made it possible for the Federal Reserve to sustain a tremendous bout of money creation, while keeping interest rates close to zero. The money supply (M3) increased from 50 percent of GDP in 2007 to 70 percent in 2017-19.\n\nLow-interest rates and abundant liquidity allowed non-financial enterprises to borrow cheaply in open markets and engage in the classic financialization game of \"share buy-backs,\" securing high profits for shareholders and pushing up stock prices. With money easily available, other stock-market operators, above all, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Hedge Funds, also expanded their activities. The result was a sustained and gradual rise in the stock market, with the Standard and Poor's (S&P) index rising from 735 in February 2009 to 3,337 in February 2020. In short, after 2007-9, the US state's intervention to buttress financialized capitalism led to a stock-market bubble that bore no relation to the underlying weakness of profitability, growth rates, productivity growth, and so on.\n\nAll this makes the financial shock caused by coronavirus easier to understand. It was apparent already in 2017-18 that the stock-market bubble would not last, as the Fed began to raise interest rates slowly above zero, attempting to retrieve more normal conditions in financial markets. In December 2018 the S&P index collapsed briefly to 2,416, but the Fed rapidly reversed the increase in interest rates, and the bubble resumed. For reasons already explained, however, the coronavirus struck a blow of a quite different order and the stock market collapsed spectacularly, dropping to 2,237 on March 23 2020. The Trump administration's subsequent announcement of a huge fiscal intervention led the S&P to bounce back, though volatility remains very high.\n\nThe stock-market collapse revealed further speculative operations that dramatically worsened conditions in the financial markets. Plummeting prices put enormous pressure on exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Investment Funds, forcing them to seek hard cash to meet their obligations. It then transpired that speculative chains had been set up whereby these Funds borrowed in the repo market (the main market for liquidity among financial institutions) by selling US Treasury Bills and then used the money to buy Treasury Bills in the futures markets, thus profiting from minor price discrepancies. The sums were huge. As stock prices collapsed, the Funds sold Treasury Bills increasingly desperately, and in effect drove up interest rates.\n\nThe Federal Reserve was thus confronted with the bizarre situation of a rapidly developing shortage of liquidity and rising interest rates in money markets, even though the US economy had been flooded with dollars for more than a decade. Capitalist absurdity has rarely been more vividly demonstrated. The Fed had to intervene urgently by promising to buy unlimited volumes of public bonds and even private bonds, thus further increasing the supply of money. Its massive intervention was soon matched by the equally massive fiscal package of the US government. Once again, the US state put props under collapsing financialized capitalism.\n\nIt is important, in this connection, to note the difference between the USA and the EU. The Commission has tacitly allowed member states to ignore the Stability and Growth Pact, while the ECB has abandoned its bond buying rules in an effort to avoid an Italian default, which would immediately catalyze a new crisis for the euro. These are important actions which have allowed EU nation-states to operate without unnecessary hindrances. But there has not been any coordinated fiscal intervention by EU institutions that is remotely comparable to the USA, or even the UK.\n\nIn effect, the crisis has forced the EU to engage in economic policy that side-steps its own rule book. Nation-states have been doing the running so far, with very little cooperation or mutual discipline. The long-standing problem of conflicts and hierarchy among them has not gone away, and that is why proposals to issue EU \"coronabonds\" to fund fiscal expenditure are meeting with strong resistance. If money is to be made available to stricken states, it might be through the European Stability Mechanism, with various conditions attached. There is simply no comparison with the response by the US state.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis represents a critical moment in the development of contemporary capitalism. To be sure, the crisis has longer to run - and its full impact on the USA, the EU, China, Japan and developing countries remains to be seen. But there is no doubt that it has posed the threat of a massive depression across the world economy. The systemic failures of financialization and globalization were starkly revealed by the public health emergency, and the state has become ever more implicated in sustaining this failing system. However, the character of its interventions give no reason to think that there will be a transformation at the top of the political and social hierarchy resulting in policies that favor the interests of working people.\n\nThe US government's decision massively to augment its deficit - and thus its borrowing - while simultaneously expanding the supply of money and driving interest rates to zero, is essentially the same as after 2007-9. Even if a depression is avoided, the medium-term results are also likely to be the same, since the underlying weakness of capitalist accumulation is not confronted. But there will certainly be political contradictions arising from defending the neoliberal order, not least given the demonstration of nation states' power to intervene in the economy. These will be particularly important in the EU, where the fiscal and health-emergency response to the crisis has so far come from individual nation-states rather than the collective institutions.\n\nCasting a harsh light on the inadequacies of neoliberal capitalism, this crisis has directly posed the issue of democratic reorganization of both economy and society in the interests of workers.  There is an urgent need to confront the chaos of globalization and financialization by putting forth concrete radical proposals. That also requires forms of organization capable of altering the social and political balance in favor of working people.\n\nThe pandemic has brought to the fore vital issues of social transformation.   It has vividly illustrated the imperative of having a public health system that is rationally organized and capable of dealing with epidemic shocks. It has also posed the urgent need for solidarity, communal action, and public policies to support workers and the poorest faced with lockdowns, unemployment, and economic collapse.\n\nMore broadly, it has reasserted the historic need to confront a declining system that is locked in its own absurdities. Unable rationally to transform itself, globalized and financialized capitalism instead keeps resorting to ever-greater doses of the same, disastrous, palliatives. The first requirement, in this respect, is to defend democratic rights from a threatening state and insist that working people have a powerful say in all decision making. Only on this basis could radical alternatives be proposed, including large-scale measures such as designing industrial policy to address the weakness of production, facilitating a green transition, dealing with income and wealth inequalities, and confronting financialization by creating public financial institutions. The coronavirus crisis has already transformed the terms of political struggle - and socialists must urgently respond.\n\nThis article relies on some of the work of the research team established by EReNSEP-Ekona to examine the longer-term implications of the current crisis.

But Democrats haven't been much better on industrial policy recent decades. Socialists need to fight for a real industrial policy.\n\nFlanked by Vice President Mike Pence and United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, President Donald Trump speaks during a signing ceremony for the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement at the White House in January. (Drew Angerer / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOne of the most striking features of the 2016 presidential race was Trump's ability to outflank Hillary Clinton on economics. Say what you will about him, but Trump made the return of manufacturing jobs a central component of his political identity. His rallies were filled with lines like this: \"If I'm elected, you won't lose one plant, you'll have plants coming into this country. You're gonna have jobs again. You won't lose one plant again, I promise you.\"\n\nLike so much of Trump's presidency, the rhetoric is dramatically out of step with his ability to chart a new industrial policy for the country. A damning report titled \"Promises Unfulfilled: Manufacturing in the Midwest,\" authored by Policy Matters Ohio and the Century Foundation, reveals the utter failure of the Trump administration to bring back good paying manufacturing jobs.\n\nHighlighting Trump's dismal record on jobs is important for convincing workers who may still be taken in by his pro-labor rhetoric. But this goes beyond just dunking on Trump. The mainstream of the Democratic Party shares Trump's enthusiasm for offering massive tax breaks to the wealthiest companies in the desperate hope they will create jobs. Numerous case studies from the last four years alone disprove this myth, and subbing in Democrats to pursue the same failed strategy will lead to more disaster for working people.\n\nThe Left needs to get serious about an industrial strategy that can actually create massive amounts of high quality jobs. The mistakes from the first Trump term need to be learned - or else a potential Biden administration could just be a warm-up act for an even more dangerous and emboldened far-right.\n\nThe report focuses on four states in the Great Lakes region: Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan. These states are iconic for their role in powering the country's manufacturing economy. Voters in these states have felt the decline in US manufacturing most sharply and helped tipped the balance toward Trump in 2016.\n\nThe economic pain affecting the region is not new. From 1990-2007, these states lost a total of 800,000 manufacturing jobs. Another 500,000 jobs were lost during the Great Recession of 2007-8 alone.\n\nDespite boasts about the Trump economy before COVID-19, a modest recovery was already taking place in the Great Lakes region during the Obama years. Between 2010 and 2016, 294,000 jobs returned at a higher rate than the first two years of the Trump administration. Some of this recovery was stimulated by federal policies like the bailout of the auto industry.\n\nThough the first three years of the Trump presidency saw economic growth, manufacturing wages dropped during this time. By summer 2019, well before COVID-19, US manufacturing had already entered into a recession. In some states like Ohio and Michigan, the recession had begun even before that. The COVID-19 recession led to 381,000 more manufacturing workers in the Great Lakes region being fired or furloughed.\n\nWhile there were some modest economic gains during Trump's first term, they proved to be too limited and short-lived to spark a broader economic transformation. The roots of this failure lie in an economic philosophy and policy agenda that puts workers last.\n\nA serious plan to revive US manufacturing would involve directing massive amounts of public revenue toward investments in critical areas like infrastructure and education. Trump's tax cuts, which mainly benefit the rich while leaving crumbs for everyone else, is a step in the wrong direction. The tax cuts are estimated to cut public revenue by $1.5 trillion over ten years.\n\nThe Trump tax plan also literally gives corporations more incentives to move production to other countries. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy , Trump's plan \"taxes the offshore profits of American corporations at a rate of zero percent or, sometimes, at half the rate imposed on domestic profits. [...] This can also encourage corporations to transfer real investments and jobs offshore.\"\n\nThe results of the often-touted trade war with China are also dismal for US workers. Trump has had no coherent plan besides lashing out with tariffs every so often. The most substantive element of the trade war were a series of tariffs on Chinese goods that rose from a 10 percent to a 25 percent duty between September 2018 and May 2019. China has retaliated with tariffs of their own, and a study by Moody's found that the trade war had cost 300,000 US jobs by 2019 across a range of sectors.\n\nOne has to look hard to find substantial differences between trade deals like NAFTA and Trump's United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The administration has made a big deal out of new rules that require 45 percent of automobiles within USMCA to be produced by workers earning $16/hour. However, US and Canadian auto workers usually already make more than $16/hour.\n\nIn effect, the Trump trade war will not lead to any measurable growth in wages or jobs for the workers that were supposed to benefit.\n\nThe phrase \"socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor,\" first uttered by Dr Martin Luther King Jr in 1968, is becoming popular again. The case studies of corporate welfare included in the Policy Matters Ohio study will make you see why. It is yet more proof that the long-standing bipartisan effort to attract private investment through tax incentives is a sure loser.\n\nOn July 26, 2017 a White House ceremony was held with Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. They celebrated the announcement that Foxconn would build a display panel factory in Wisconsin, after the state promised the company a record $4 billion in taxpayer subsidies; 2,080 jobs were promised to in-state workers by the end of 2019.\n\nAs it turned out, Foxconn only created 520 jobs. Most of these jobs are in the research and development sector, and won't actually go to working-class people. Foxconn leased office space in multiple cities, supposedly to serve as manufacturing innovation centers. These offices are still empty. Billions of dollars that could've been used for direct federal employment were wasted on another fruitless corporate subsidy.\n\nIn 2008, General Motors made a thirty-year commitment to keep its Lordstown Chevy Cruze plant in Ohio. They were given $82 million in state subsidies. General Motors reneged on this agreement and closed down in March 2019. Trump didn't try to take any executive action or even whip up public shame against the company in order to save this once iconic plant.\n\nUnfortunately, examples like these are not unique. Each year countless states, towns, and municipalities across the country are reduced to beggars, giving up critical revenue in the hope that corporations move to their backyard. Decades of experience have shown us that the costs of this approach far outweigh the benefits.\n\nTrump's inability to revive manufacturing, along with his war on labor unions and attack on the National Labor Relations Board , make clear he is an enemy of working people. But the Left can't stop at the easy part of denouncing Trump.\n\nJoe Biden's previous support of anti-worker trade deals like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) should leave no doubt as to what his policies on trade and manufacturing will look like if he wins the presidency. Democratic socialists need to craft an approach to job creation at the federal and state level that puts workers front and center.\n\nClearly the private sector cannot be relied upon to create enough high-quality jobs, no matter how many tax incentives are given. The federal government needs to forcefully intervene to create good-paying, long-term, union jobs. As we face the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression and an accelerating climate crisis, we need millions of jobs that can contribute toward environmental sustainability.\n\nBy working directly with unions, the revival of US industry can go hand in hand with the revival of the labor movement. Proposals like those drawn up by unions in New York state as part of the New York Climate Jobs program are an inspirational model, and will form the backbone of a true revival in US industrial policy.\n\nWhile Trump's actual policies have been a disaster, the success of his rhetoric clearly demonstrates that developing a coherent industrial strategy will be crucial for political success. Though we should be cautious with historical analogies, we can use them to confirm at least one thing: If we don't address the jobs crisis, right-wing populists will.\n\nPaul Prescod is a high school social studies teacher and member of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But we should all agree on one thing: the US has no business intervening.\n\nVice President Mike Pence speaks about Venezuela at Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church on August 23, 2017 in Doral, Florida.\nJoe Raedle / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOver the past year, left-wing writers have debated the crisis in Venezuela, focusing on some basic questions: how responsible is the Maduro government for the country's economic malaise? How justifiable are its political moves over the last two years? And what chance is there that the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) will take the necessary steps to win back the popular support it previously enjoyed?\n\nYou can find a sample of this debate in articles by Gabriel Hetland and Mike Gonzalez , who put forward a critical perspective, and George Ciccariello-Maher and Gregory Wilpert , who take a more sympathetic line. It's also a discussion that has been taking place among Venezuelan socialists: Marea Socialista , previously organized as a current within the PSUV, has now divided into two groups, with sharply contrasting analyses of the Venezuelan crisis.\n\nWe can expect those polemics to continue, especially now that Maduro has announced presidential elections will be held in April.\n\nHowever, some things should never be open to discussion. Above all, nobody should give a shred of legitimacy to efforts by the US and its allies to interfere in Venezuelan politics and impose their own preferred solution to its crisis, whether that means military aggression or economic sanctions.\n\nFor many people, all too familiar with the history of US intervention in Latin America, this will go without saying. But it's a message that can't be repeated too often, as some of the recent commentary on Venezuela shows.\n\nThe New York Times began the year with an op-ed from foreign policy analyst David Smilde asking, \"Should the United States Attack Venezuela?\" His answer, in brief, was \"no\": \"A military strike against Venezuela would be folly . . . Venezuela in 2018 is not 1989 Panama, and an invasion would not be a surgical strike.\"\n\nBut the fact that such a question can even be raised speaks volumes about the foreign policy conversation in elite circles. Just imagine a New York Times column with the headline \"Should Russia Attack Turkey?\", weighing the merits of a Russian invasion to depose Erdoğan and protect the country's Kurdish population from his army. No such article would ever see the light of day, even if it came down firmly against Russian intervention.\n\nStill, Smilde's perspective deserves critical scrutiny precisely because he is not a reactionary blowhard in the mold of Jackson Diehl or Mary Anastasia O'Grady , whose fact-free diatribes about Latin America still clog the opinion pages. He is an academic whose research has focused on Venezuela and who moderates a blog on the country for the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA).\n\nWhile rejecting the idea of military action, Smilde calls for intervention of a different kind through \"deepening the current sanctions regime.\" Who will decide the nature of this \"deepening\"? Smilde taps Washington for the honors, anointing \"the United States and its partners\" as the relevant actors in applying pressure to Caracas.\n\nAgain, a little thought experiment should help clarify things. If anyone suggested that Russia must take the lead in \"deepening sanctions\" on the unsavory, ultranationalist governments in Hungary and Poland, they would immediately be reminded of Moscow's record in Eastern Europe, which disqualifies it from acting as the self-appointed champion of democracy and the rule of law.\n\nThere are two clear differences between that invented scenario and the real-life one Smilde is proposing: the United States and its regional proxies have killed far more people than the Soviet Union and its satellite regimes, and there was no \"1989 moment\" in the Western hemisphere comparable to the Soviet withdrawal from Eastern Europe. US interference in Latin American affairs has not let up for so much as a week.\n\nJust a couple of weeks ago, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson invoked the spirits of Pinochet and Videla as one model for \"transition\" in Venezuela. These are the people who will decide what kind of sanctions the US should impose, and when.\n\nSmilde declares his preference for \"multilateral\" sanctions imposed by a coalition of states. Nine times out of ten, when pundits urge the \"international community\" to do something, they really mean the US and a select group of like-minded countries, and this is no exception. Canada, the European Union, and the so-called Lima Group are all name-checked in Smilde's article.\n\nCanada and European countries like Britain and Spain have this much in common with the United States: their leading corporations have major investments in the region, and bitterly oppose any government or social movement that threatens the flow of profits . They also have a record of colluding with authoritarian regimes in Latin America. They have no more credibility than the US as champions of human rights.\n\nApart from Canada, the Lima Group consists of Latin American countries whose governments appear to have been selected because they are guilty of every sin Maduro's administration has been accused of: rigged elections ( Mexico , Honduras ), politicians barred from office on dubious pretexts ( Brazil ), and brutal repression of protests ( Colombia still leads the way in this macabre competition ). The hypocrisy of their proclamations about Venezuela's future speaks for itself.\n\nIt requires the most extraordinary naivete to imagine that pressure from this quarter is likely to promote democracy in Venezuela or anywhere else.\n\nIn a follow-up to his Times op-ed for WOLA's blog, Smilde argues that \"the sanctions [on Venezuela] rolled out by the Obama administration in March 2015 were counterproductive. By any measure they did not reinforce democracy, rule of law or human rights.\"\n\nThis argument only makes sense if you assume that sanctions were imposed because the US government cared about the liberties and well-being of the Venezuelan people.\n\nHowever, it is useful to be reminded of those sanctions, because they were applied just two years after Maduro won the 2013 presidential election . Maduro beat his opponent by a narrow margin in the presidential poll, but the PSUV extended its lead in the municipal elections of December 2013. As Smilde and Hugo Pérez Hernáiz wrote for WOLA at the time: \"The opposition framed the December elections as a plebiscite on Maduro's government, and lost.\"\n\nIn other words, Obama's sanctions - justified under the absurd claim that Venezuela represented an \"extraordinary threat\" to US national security - were imposed well before the opposition victory in the 2015 National Assembly elections and the events that followed (a bitter standoff between the executive and legislature, protests demanding Maduro's resignation in the early months of 2017, and the disputed Constituent Assembly election that the opposition parties boycotted). US hostility to the PSUV was already entrenched at a time when it won elections handsomely by, in Smilde's words, \"running circles around an opposition that fail[ed] to engage the broader public with a plausible platform.\"\n\nIf Venezuela held an election that met every reasonable standard for a fair vote, which still resulted in a PSUV victory, Washington would remain bitterly hostile to the Venezuelan government, and would keep applying pressure for a \"transition\" until it got its way.\n\nA very different perspective on the sanctions question can be found in a recent Foreign Policy article by the Venezuelan economist Francisco Rodríguez. Rodríguez is a staunch opponent of the PSUV - \"I, as much as anyone else, would like to see Maduro go\" - who accuses the Venezuelan president of \"gross mismanagement\" and \"serious human rights abuses.\" He can certainly not be dismissed as a booster for the current administration in Caracas.\n\nRodríguez argues that the sanctions regime is based on a false picture of Venezuelan political life that denies the enduring popular base for Chavismo. About one-quarter of the population still supports Maduro - \"a remarkably high number given the state of the economy\" - and last year's regional elections showed that the PSUV could mobilize almost 6 million voters to support its candidates: \"nearly one-third of the country's adult population, and more than enough to win a low-turnout election.\"\n\nIn contrast to Smilde, who describes the financial sanctions imposed by Trump last year as \"pretty well thought out,\" Rodríguez dismisses the idea that such measures \"can hurt the Venezuelan government without causing serious harm to ordinary Venezuelans.\" The sanctions have already inflicted real economic damage and made it harder to alleviate the crisis. Rodríguez also brings up something that Smilde omitted entirely from his Times article: the attitude of the Venezuelan people: \"56 percent of Venezuelans oppose US financial sanctions; only 32 percent support them.\"\n\nRodríguez argues that \"instead of undermining Maduro, sanctions are making it increasingly difficult for the country's opposition to convince voters that the welfare of Venezuelans - rather than driving Maduro from power - is its real priority.\" In truth, if the main opposition leaders have trouble convincing people that the welfare of Venezuelans is their priority, that is because it plainly isn't and never has been. Their willingness to endorse sanctions is further proof of that.\n\nAt some point in the near future - whether that is when the presidential election is held in April, or at a later date - there will be renewed clamor for \"something to be done\" about Venezuela.\n\nThere was no such clamor for action when elections were stolen in Mexico or Honduras, when democratically elected presidents were ousted in Paraguay or Brazil, or when the Uribe regime presided over wholesale butchery in Colombia. In all of those cases, \"doing something\" would simply have meant withdrawing active support from the fraudsters, coup plotters, and war criminals - but that was never on the agenda as far as respectable opinion was concerned.\n\nAnyone who cares about the future of Venezuela should resist the moral blackmail of \"something must be done\" - and the related idea that if you oppose one form of intervention (military aggression), you have to propose another in its place (sanctions). The United States and its allies have no legitimate role to play in resolving the Venezuelan crisis, and their attempts to do so should not be given any rhetorical cover.\n\nDaniel Finn is the features editor at Jacobin .

Alex Brandon/AP\n\nDonald Trump is going after his former vice president and fellow 2024 presidential contender, Mike Pence. On Saturday, the embattled frontrunner took to Truth Social to attack his former ally. \"WOW, it's finally happened! Liddle' Mike Pence, a man who was about to be ousted as Governor Indiana until I came along and made him V.P., has gone to the Dark Side,\" Trump posted . \"I never told a newly emboldened (not based on his 2% poll numbers!) Pence to put me above the Constitution, or that Mike was 'too honest.' He's delusional, and now he wants to show he's a tough guy.\"\n\nThe latest round of attacks follow false claims by Trump earlier this week suggesting the vice president \"had power that Mike didn't understand\" to reject the electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election. \"I feel badly for Mike Pence, who is attracting no crowds, enthusiasm, or loyalty from people who, as a member of the Trump Administration, should be loving him,\" Trump wrote on Wednesday. \"He didn't fight against Election Fraud.\" Just the day before, Trump had been indicted for attempting to subvert the election on charges of defrauding the United States, obstructing an official government proceeding, and depriving people of civil rights provided by federal law or the Constitution.\n\nThe federal indictment mentions a January 1, 2021 call during which Trump allegedly called Pence \"too honest\" over his objection to reject contested electoral votes during the certification process. \"Today's indictment serves as an important reminder: anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be President of the United States,\" Pence said in a statement at the time. Trying to capitalize on Pence's prominent role in the indictment, the former vice president's campaign has started selling merchandise featuring the \"too honest\" phrase.\n\nPence's escalating condemnation of Trump's Big Lie doesn't seem to be earning him any points with the former president's supporters, some of whom called him a \"traitor\" and \"a sellout\" outside a campaign event in New Hampshire this week. \"Why didn't you uphold the constitution?\" one man said . \"I upheld the constitution,\" Pence shot back, before adding, \"Read it!\" The former vice-president is currently polling at 3 percent, while Trump is crushing the GOP 2024 competition at 54 percent.\n\n\"President Trump was wrong then and he is wrong now,\" Pence told Dana Bash on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday morning. \"I had no right to overturn the election.\" Pence went on: \"The American people deserve to know that President Trump asked me to put him over my oath to the Constitution but I kept my oath and always will.\" When asked if Trump asked him to pause the certification of the election result or to overturn it, Pence said, \"the day before January 6, if memory serves, they came back-his lawyers did-and said we want you to reject votes outright. They were asking me to overturn the election.\" Pence also said he didn't recall Trump ever acknowledging to him that he had lost the election.\n\nPressed by Bash, Pence didn't rule out supporting Trump if he becomes the Republican nominee. \"I don't think we'll have to make that decision,\" he said. \"I'm confident I'll be able to support the Republican nominee, especially if it's me... Republican primary voters are going to choose new leadership for a new time in the life of our nation. They simply have got to move our country forward.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Has Anyone Seen Mike Pence?\n\nMother Jones illustration; Chip Somodevilla/Getty\n\nThe Republican National Convention , which kicked off Monday in Milwaukee, is a super-powerful magnet for anyone with even a passing connection to conservative politics. To enter the Fiserv Forum downtown, I first had to pass by Erik Prince and Kari Lake. Ron Johnson flits about, fending off fans. As I spoke with delegates in the concourse during the afternoon session, Jason Chaffetz periodically passed by, like a small piece of space junk orbiting the Earth. I've seen conservative influencers and candidates I've forgotten about. I just saw Mike Lindell. But one person is conspicuously missing. Has anyone seen Mike Pence?\n\nOn Monday, as Republicans awaited Trump's announcement of J.D. Vance as his next running mate, the man who had joined him on the ticket twice and served alongside him as vice president for four years was very conspicuously not there. Not inside the beefed-up security perimeter. Not in Wisconsin, so far as I can tell. And very much not endorsing Trump. If the biggest story among convention-goers was Trump's hunt for a running mate, then the defining story of his candidacy, as Matt Gertz recently wrote at Media Matters , is what happened to his old one.\n\nThe short of it, as you'll recall, was that Trump pressured Pence to refuse to certify the Electoral College results on January 6, 2021. After Pence refused, Trump sent a mob to the Capitol to physically stop the certification. Some members of the mob shouted \"Hang Mike Pence!\" Interestingly, that was not the final straw for Pence-who said this spring that he had \"forgiven\" the former president, but that he could not endorse his campaign, in part, because of his recently declared opposition to banning TikTok. But it was the final straw for Trump.\n\nThis falling-out over whether the last vice presidential nominee should have accepted the election results was why we were spending our Monday waiting for the white smoke that would portend a new vice presidential nominee. And Pence's legacy was shaping how Trump's followers viewed the job itself. When I spoke with supporters of the Republican nominee on Monday, the takeaway from that episode, and the first administration as a whole, was clear: Trump needed someone who would stand by him no matter what.\n\n\"I don't even want to say,\" said Rose Roque, a Florida Republican, making a face, when I asked her about the party's previous next-in-line.\n\nBut her daughter, Rose Rodriguez, was willing to go further. \"He betrayed his country,\" she said, referring to Pence's decision to certify the Electoral College results on January 6. \"Although he thought he was doing the correct thing, according to him, he let himself be poisoned. And I think he already was poisoned-he came in already being that way.\"\n\n\"If Gen. Flynn would have been vice president,\" Rodriguez continued, referring to Trump's short-lived national security advisor Michael Flynn, who had suggested after the 2020 election that Trump could order the military to seize voting machines. \"Gen. Flynn would have done things by the constitution, he would have upheld the constitution and done the right thing and we wouldn't be in the mess we are.\"\n\nPence \"seemed to be trying to do a balancing act and it never really worked,\" said Michael Rosen, a New Jersey Republican who was standing by a big Trump 2024 sign outside the arena. Trump needed \"Someone who's gonna work with him and not gonna leave him in a lurch at the end. [Pence] should have worked with Trump when he was going through all that stuff instead of throwing his hands up and saying 'I've got no control.' We were kind of left with nothing.\"\n\n\"He was a great vice president until he wasn't,\" said Mike Bassett, a Nevada Republican. One of his top requirements for a vice president was \"loyalty to Trump.\"\n\nI did talk to delegates who wanted governing or managerial experience, strong communication skills, and even a bit of gender or racial diversity from their VP. Republicans floated Byron Donalds and Tulsi Gabbard. More than one person pined for Glenn Youngkin. But Pence had cast a shadow over the search. So much so, that after I finished talking with Rosen, another New Jersey Republican, Rimma Yakobovich, piped up with her own suggestion.\n\nThere was one clear way to get a Republican running mater who absolutely wouldn't \"stab him in the back,\" she said. Her idea? \"Don Jr.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Mike Pence Fled for His Life on January 6. He Still Won't Call Trump's Actions Criminal.\n\nAlex Wong/Getty\n\nOn CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday, former Vice President and Republican presidential candidate Mike Pence said he's not sure Donald Trump's actions on January 6 were criminal.\n\n\"While his words were reckless,\" Pence said of his former boss' actions before and during the pro-Trump mob's ransacking of the Capitol, \"based on what I know, I am not yet convinced that they were criminal.\"\n\n\"I don't honestly know what his intention was that day,\" Pence added, and \"I believe that history will hold him accountable.\"\n\nPerhaps. Earlier this week, Trump announced that he'd received a letter notifying him he was a target of Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation into the former president's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. If true, this indicates that Trump may soon face his third criminal indictment since leaving office. As my colleague Dan Friedman writes :\n\nThe letter, according to Trump, offered him a chance to appear before a grand jury meeting in Washington, DC, this week. Prosecutors typically send such letters when they are close to seeking the indictment of a target of their probe.\n\nTrump received a separate target letter from Smith's office in June prior to his indictment for allegedly violating the Espionage Act, along with other charges, related to his efforts to retain White House documents, many of them highly classified, at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Trump has also been charged in New York with falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels. Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis is also expected to decide soon whether to charge Trump and associates over their attempts to interfere with the 2020 election results in that state.\n\nPence, of course, was a key target of the January 6 mob. As rioters stormed the Capitol building, toppling barricades, smashing windows, and attacking police officers with various weapons, and the VP and his family were whisked away to a secure location, some of the attackers yelled , \"Hang Pence.\" Amid all this mayhem, Trump, who appeared to be aware that his vice president was in danger, tweeted, \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.\"\n\nHe did, actually, by certifying the 2020 election results. But judging from the CNN interview, Pence doesn't have the courage to stand up to a bully who might literally have gotten him killed.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Mitt Romney unloaded on former Vice President Mike Pence, who has attempted to distance himself from Donald Trump since the January 6 insurrection.\n\nNo one has been \"more loyal, more willing to smile when he saw absurdities, more willing to ascribe God's will to things that were ungodly than Mike Pence,\" Romney said.\n\nPence responded to Romney in a decidedly Penceian way during an interview with CNN on Sunday.\n\n\"Look, Mitt Romney has no idea what I was doing in the administration,\" Pence said. \"I haven't talked to Mitt Romney for years. He can go off into retirement.\"\n\nAs The Daily Beast notes , Pence didn't always feel that way about Romney. He praised him in a book last year as \"good, public-spirited man with a servant's heart.\"\n\nPence has attempted a difficult balancing act with Trump, criticizing his boss for pressuring him to overturn the 2020 election while saying he was \"incredibly proud\" of the Trump administration's record.

      "text": "How Mike Pence Helped the Coronavirus at the Veep Debate\n\nJustin Sullivan/AP\n\nVice President Mike Pence, the guy in charge of the White House coronavirus task force, boosted the spread of the killer virus on Wednesday night when he debated Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for vice president. Sure, this sounds strange. He's supposed to be doing all that can be done to counter the deadly pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than 210,000 Americans. But it's clear that his task force has failed miserably. (The United States has one of the highest coronavirus death tolls of all wealthy nations.) And during the debate, Pence essentially winked at the anti-maskers, whose opposition to wearing face coverings has contributed to the ongoing and out-of-control transmission of deadly COVID-19.\n\nThe first question at the debate predictably focused on the pandemic. USA Today 's Susan Page, the moderator, asked Harris how she and Joe Biden would combat the killer virus, should they win. Harris began with an opening shot at Trump and Pence: \"The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country.\" She noted that Biden had a plan for testing, contract tracing, and vaccine distribution. And she slammed Trump for downplaying the pandemic and for not encouraging mask-wearing: \"The president said, 'You're on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask. You're on the other side of his ledger if you don't.'\"\n\nAccording to Dr. Anthony Fauci and other public health experts, mask-wearing and social distancing are the two most important steps to take to beat back the pandemic. But Trump and his crew have constantly denigrated masks and turned mask-wearing into an us-versus-them political controversy in which Trumpers perversely oppose masks as an act of freedom and a sign of loyalty to Trump. Pence directly fueled those sentiments at the debate.\n\nPage questioned Pence about the recent Rose Garden event for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, which may have been a superspreader event. As Page noted, there were few masks and no social distancing at this shindig. \"How can you expect Americans to follow the administration's safety guidelines to protect themselves from COVID when you at the White House have not been doing so?\" she asked Pence (steering clear of Trump's own infection).\n\nPence replied:\n\nMany of the people who were at that event, Susan, actually were tested for coronavirus, and it was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advise. The difference here is President Trump and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interest of their health. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris consistently talk about mandates...We're about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people.\n\nPence was supporting the argument of the anti-maskers: don't tell us what to do, we should be free to wear a mask or not. Not at this point in the debate or any other did the vice president encourage Americans to wear masks and practice social-distancing. In fact, he didn't even use the word \"mask\" once. On the national stage, as thousands of Americans continue to die weekly, the head of the White House pandemic task force said absolutely nothing to the American people about what they can do to arrest the continuing spread of COVID-19. This was profound negligence. But it was in keeping with his boss's conduct. When Trump returned to the White House after being hospitalized, he quickly and irresponsibly whipped off his mask, though he remained contagious and people were in his vicinity.\n\nNot only did Pence not engage in the most basic act of leadership at the debate; he belittled Biden and Harris for considering a mask mandate. He depicted a sound and easy-to-implement public health policy that could save lives (and help revive the economy) as an assault on freedom. This was a continuation of Trump's not-too-silent war on masks. For the fools who gather at Trump rallies without wearing masks or who cause scenes at big box stores when asked to put one on, Trump and Pence are on their side. The anti-maskers can view the words and actions of these two men as reasons to continue their pandemic-fueling conduct.\n\nThere was so much that Pence did wrong at the debate. In a scoundrel's move, he equated criticism of the Trump administration's response to the pandemic with criticism of \"the American people\" and \"the sacrifices the American people have made.\" He interrupted Harris repeatedly (yet not as much as Trump interrupted Biden). He told multiple lies , including claiming that Trump has \"always\" been truthful about the pandemic. He insisted Trump has a plan to protect pre-existing conditions for health insurance, though no plan has been released and the Trump-Pence administration is suing in federal court to strike down the law that does protect patients with preexisting conditions. He slavishly defended Trump, at one point proclaiming, \"This is a president who respects and cherishes all of the American people.\" Does anyone believe that?\n\nMuch of Pence's malfeasance at the debate was the usual political spin. But his great sin was failing to use the event to help the nation combat the pandemic. Instead, the vice president provided ammo to those Trump supporters who believe the pandemic is a hoax and masks are not necessary. In this way, he gave aid and comfort to the virus. Pence was a traitor to his own task force.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Mike Pence's Presidential Campaign Is in Debt...\n\nBye bye? Robert Hanashiro/USA Today/Zuma\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence is reportedly facing an \"existential cash squeeze\" that could bring an end to his 2024 run for the White House.\n\nPence's campaign told NBC News that filings due at the Federal Election Commission by the end of Sunday will reflect some $620,000 in debt, and that Pence has resorted to putting $150,000 in personal funds to the low-polling effort. While the GOP candidate raised $3.3 million in the third quarter and has $1.2 million cash on hand, NBC notes that taking on debt \"has long been a sign of presidential campaigns in trouble-and potentially on the verge of ending.\"\n\nDonald Trump's former number two is struggling in the GOP primary, currently standing in fifth place in the FiveThirtyEight average of national polls, behind Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and his former boss, who remains the runaway front runner.\n\nPence is also trailing his competitors in fundraising, according to figures released ahead of the third-quarter deadline. Haley's campaign said it has raised $11 million, with $9.1 in cash on hand; DeSantis, whose campaign appears to be spiraling downwards, announced bringing in $15 million in the third quarter-but only a third of that can be used in the primary. Trump's campaign said it raised $45 million between July and September, with $36 million on hand for the primary race. (Ramaswamy has yet to announce his haul.)\n\nAmid his discouraging fundraising, Pence has decided to skip the GOP-run Nevada caucuses and instead file for the state-run primary-a so-called \"beauty contest\" that won't award any delegates involved in selecting the party's nominee. \"We'll probably have to be a little bit more selective in where we invest resources, and that was the basis of that,\" he said on Friday. \"But we love Nevada and we look forward to tell our story there in the primary.\"\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden's reelection campaign and the Democratic National Committee have reportedly raised more than $71 million this quarter. That amount brings his funds on hand to $91 million, which the campaign claimed is a record high for any Democratic presidential candidate at this point in the cycle. More than 493,000 donors reportedly contributed to the campaign.\n\n\"This quarter's fundraising haul and historic cash on hand speak to the very real enthusiasm and support,\" Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden's reelection campaign manager, said in a statement. \"These numbers are a testament to one of our core objectives early in this campaign: raise the resources needed to run an aggressive campaign that will win in November 2024.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Mike Pence's Harshest Critique of January 6 Comes Too Late\n\nMike Pence signing his book in San Antonio in January. Robin Jerstad/Zuma\n\nMike Pence is fighting to avoid testifying before a grand jury investigating January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. He blew off the congressional committee that looked into the matter, too. But the former vice president was willing to talk about the attack Saturday night at a white-tie dinner for politicians and journalists in Washington.\n\n\"President Trump was wrong,\" Pence said at the annual Gridiron Dinner. \"I had no right to overturn the election. And his reckless words endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day, and I know history will hold Donald Trump accountable.\"\n\nTrump invited backers to the Capitol on January 6 as part of a bid to pressure Pence to overturn the 2020 election by rejecting President Joe Biden's electors and allowing alternatives who would back Trump. Trump's afternoon tweet attacking Pence for not doing so incited the crowd to attack Congress to try to stop them from certifying Biden's win.\n\nPence sided against Republicans, like Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who are downplaying the significance of the attack. \"What happened that day was a disgrace,\" Pence said. \"And it mocks decency to portray it any other way. For as long as I live, I will never, ever diminish the injuries sustained, the lives lost, or the heroism of law enforcement on that tragic day.\"\n\nFor two years, Pence-famous for toeing the president's erratic line during the Trump administration-has tried to distance himself from the coup attempt that he correctly, if belatedly , resisted on the day, while also not making Trump fans too mad. The former vice president wants to be anti-coup, but not so much that he alienates the pro-coup crowd. Pence's maybe impossible effort to thread that needle is obviously self-serving. He's trying to find a lane for a 2024 presidential bid.\n\nBut if he really wanted to stand up against Trump's actions on January 6, there are tons of people to talk to outside the Gridiron Club. Pence, remember, was personally pressured by Trump to refuse to certify the 2020 results. According to the January 6 committee and a federal judge , Trump's effort to stop Congress from doing its job was a crime. Pence was the only witness to much of this. But he has refused to detail those interactions for the January 6 committee, claiming a legislative panel has \"no right\" to his testimony. Pence is fighting a subpoena from prosecutors working under working Special Counsel Jack Smith, by asserting the vice president's limited role as senate president made him a legislator. \"The executive branch cannot summon officials in the legislative branch into a court in any other place,\" Pence says.\n\nHistory will judge Trump. But if Pence really wants the guy who endangered his family to face accountability in the nearer term, he has an easy way to do that. Want to honor law enforcement?

      "text": "Why Those Documents at Mike Pence's Place Should Be Bad for Trump\n\nDocuments with classified markings were discovered last week in the Indiana home of former Vice President Mike Pence, seen here in November. John Minchillo/AP\n\nHas the FBI checked Dick Cheney's house?\n\nOn Tuesday, a lawyer for former Vice President Mike Pence announced that classified documents at Pence's Indiana home had been recently found. The news offers a chance to pause for a moment and consider just how far off the rails the general discourse about former officials' possession of government materials has gone.\n\nIn December, lawyers for President Joe Biden found classified documents stored at his Wilmington, Delaware home. That followed the discovery in November of classified material at the Penn Biden Center, a think tank where Biden stored papers. In August, the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched Mar-a-Lago for documents held by former President Donald Trump.\n\nThere is an easy equivalency here. And as more politicians' lawyers root around their homes for documents, more disclosures may follow, only fueling claims that Trump was not alone in hanging onto classified material. But there is a big distinction: Pence and Biden say they inadvertently kept some documents marked classified. Trump deliberately evaded extensive federal efforts to get him to return government property that he took.\n\nThe primary problem with the material Trump held was not that some of it was \"classified.\" The problem was the documents weren't his . Trump allegedly stole government property-if not when he decamped Washington, then at least when he refused to comply with requests by the National Archives and the Justice Department to return it, as the Department of Justice has detailed .\n\nThe Trump scandal is not about over-classification: It's about a former president still acting like he is above the law, and correctly expecting partisans to help him get away with it.\n\nPence's discovery was reported the same day that federal prosecutors trying five Proud Boys for seditious conspiracy announced they had found that a witness in the case-also a member of the neo-facist organization-possessed a document with classification markings on it. The Justice Department prosecutors said that the document was available online but had not received an answer from the intelligence community about whether the document remains classified.\n\nThat a random Proud Boy and Mike Pence were revealed on the same day to possess classified material is a pretty good indication that too much stuff is classified. It is also a reminder that \"classified,\" like \"weapons of mass destruction,\" is not a particularly meaningful term. An innocuous email that a federal bureaucrat hasn't gotten around to declassifying can be \"classified.\" Super-secret material on intelligence gathering aimed at China can also be \"classified.\"\n\nPence, who has repeatedly denied possessing classified documents, appears guilty of hypocrisy and sloppiness. Ditto Biden, who called Trump hanging onto material \"irresponsible.\" But both former VPs admitted to having material and then agreed to give it back. Trump refused to return documents, and lied about having them, until the FBI had to execute a search warrant to seize them.\n\nAfter the FBI's August search, they said they had found documents with markings indicating they were only supposed to be stored in a secure government facility. The documents also reportedly included material related to nuclear weapons and highly sensitive material related to Iran and China.\n\nThese findings caused much coverage of the issue to focus, with reason, on the national security risk created by Trump storing material in a nonsecure closet and, reportedly, in his desk. Online speculation also veered, with less support, toward whether Trump held onto the material to give it, or even sell it, to Saudi Arabia. That combination of real reporting and dicey speculation left many Americans with the impression that the national security risk Trump created-not his apparently willful violation of straightforward laws-was the main problem with the hoarding.\n\nIn the wake of such concerns, right-wing commentators have argued that Biden's possession of classified material also created a national security risk. This speculation has occurred even without evidence that Biden had particularly sensitive material.\n\nIn recent days, on the right, such conjecture has fused with the GOP's interest in Hunter Biden's past work overseas. It has veered toward inanity. A breathless report showed that (shock) Hunter Biden had been photographed at his own father's home. This was followed by a freakout over a Daily Mail article that claimed boxes of Biden's classified material were once stored in an office in Washington D.C.'s  \"Chinatown.\" Fox News' Maria Bartiromo and Trump himself seized on the detail-along with the fact that an aide involved with overseeing the shipping of the boxes has an Asian surname. They made racist leaps, suggesting Biden might have allowed China's government to steal state secrets. Bartiromo said she did not know if the aide \"was ultimately reporting back to the Chinese Communist Party.\"  House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) appeared on Bartiromo's show and did not dispute her insinuations. \"This has gone from being irresponsible to downright scary,\" Comer said.\n\nPreviously, Comer has argued his investigation of Hunter Biden is an earnest oversight effort. Yet, here it is, the kind of bad-faith bullshit that no one is required to take seriously. Proximity to dim sum is not a national security risk.\n\nTrump and his enablers would have made silly arguments regardless. But the treatment of his own document hoarding as primarily a national security matter among many commenters helped deepen the stupidity of the current discourse. Here is the real gist: Neither President Joe Biden nor former Vice President Mike Pence has claimed that they own documents they received as part of their public service. They say they have documents that are classified accidentally. Trump, according to the New York Times , told associates about his documents held at Mar-a-Lago: \"They're mine.\"\n\nThis is sort of like Trump's treating the Attorney General as his personal lawyer or attempting while no longer president to assert \"executive privilege\" in order to refuse to return material to the current executive branch. Laws don't apply equally to him, he says. And he keeps finding stooges to agree .\n\nThe Mar-a-Lago scandal has little to do with Biden or Pence or even national security. It's about whether Trump will keep getting away with doing whatever he wants.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Though American conservatives have long made common cause with the Unification Church, the head of the outfit that pulled together this event declared not too long ago that the \"Christian era has ended\"-which means Pence and Pompeo, whose self-professed religious devotion is a prominent part of their respective political profiles, were (knowingly or not) collaborating with and bolstering a group that says it is supplanting the Christianity they embrace.\n\nThe event-called the \" Rally of Hope\" -was hosted by Hak Ja Han Moon, the head of the Unification Church (whose members consider her and her late husband, Sun Myung Moon, the messiahs), and sponsored by the Universal Peace Federation, a group co-founded by the Moons in 2005 and affiliated with the Unification Church (which now refers to itself as the Unification movement). According to the UPF, the gathering, put on before a socially distanced audience and supposedly streamed to 1 million people in 194 nations, was held to launch a project called Think Tank 2022, which aims to reunify the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe UPF says this new outfit is a \"global multi-sector network of more than 2,000 experts\" in business, academia, and other fields, though Think Tank 2022 does not yet have much (or any) online presence. Still, Hak Ja Han Moon was able to draw an impressive amount of star power for this kick-off, with the event featuring speeches from Pence, Pompeo, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, past UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, former Republic of Korea Prime Minister Chung Sye-Kyun, and Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi. Also among the speakers were Jonathan Falwell, a pastor at Thomas Road Baptist Church in Virginia and a son of Jerry Falwell, the founder of the Moral Majority. Another featured participant was Hun Sen, the dictatorial, longtime leader of Cambodia, who has amassed a horrific human rights record .\n\nThe three-hour-long event was a celebration of both Moons, with Hak Ja Han Moon referred to as the \"mother of Peace\" and \"Heavenly Parent.\" During his videotaped speech, Pence claimed that Think Tank 2022 is \"bringing the wisdom of leaders in government, business, religion, civil society\" and that thanks to this new endeavor, \"the dream of peaceful cooperation and unity will be closer to reality than ever before.\" (Pence spoke at a previous and similar Rally of Hope in March.) Pompeo, who was introduced as a \"devout Christian,\" hailed former President Donald Trump's assorted engagements with Kim Jong Un, the tyrannical and murderous leader of North Korea. \"We tried something different,\" Pompeo said. (Foreign policy specialists have tended to note Trump's overly palsy overtures to Kim yielded no true progress.) Gingrich praised the Moons, the Universal Peace Federation, Think Tank 2022, and the Washington Times , the conservative paper Sun Myung Moon founded. Esper noted that Hak Ja Han Moon has been \"working to help strengthen America's role in the world.\" He didn't elaborate on what he meant by that.\n\nThe rally ended with a ceremony that was staged to look like an official act. A color guard brandishing the flags of nations from around the world marched about. Then Hak Ja Han Moon came out to \"receive\" the \"historic resolution\" establishing Think Tank 2022. She signed this document and then struck a gong to declare the project launched.\n\nIt's unclear what Think Tank 2022 is actually doing. The group does not seem to have a website. A week after the rally, the project was not mentioned on the home page of the Universal Peace Federation. Mother Jones sent Larry Moffitt, a spokesperson for UPF, an email with a list of questions regarding Think Tank 2022-who are its 2,000 experts, who is running this operation, how much funding does it have? The email also asked if Pence, Pompeo, Esper, Gingrich, and the other speakers at the Rally for Hope were paid for their participation. Reached by phone, Moffitt said he would look at that email \"and get back to you.\" He did not.\n\nPence, Pompeo, Gingrich, and Esper did not respond to questions about their appearances at the event.\n\nThe Unification movement has long sought to cultivate allies among Washington powerbrokers, particularly on the right. That was presumably one motivation for Sun Myung Moon in 1982 to establish the Washington Times , which has long been a mouthpiece for Republicans and conservatives. In 2004, he managed to hold a bizarre crowning ceremony for himself and his wife within a Senate office building, during which he declared in Korean that he was the Messiah. (Presidents and kings, he said, had \"declared to all heaven and earth that Reverend Sun Myung Moon is none other than humanity's Savior, Messiah, Returning Lord and True Parent.\") Some members of Congress who attended the event-which was sponsored by the Washington Times Foundation-insisted they had been duped.\n\nThe relationship between the right and the Unification movement has long been curious. Much of it has likely been influenced by the Washington Times and its standing as a dependable conservative outlet. But the theology pushed by the Moons and their devotees challenges the basic Christianity embraced by so many conservatives. The Moons' claim to be the messiahs, of course, runs counter to mainstream Christianity. And one Unification tenet promoted by a senior person in the movement is that Christianity is essentially over.\n\nIn a 2017 video , Michael Jenkins, a main player in the Unification movement's cosmos of nonprofits and businesses, said, \"The Christian era has ended.\" Jenkins is the president of the Universal Peace Federation, which hosted the Rally for Hope and created Think Tank 2022. He is also president of the Washington Times Foundation. (According to its latest tax filing , that foundation raised $242,303 in 2019 and only handed out $2,595 in contributions. It spent $256,005 on salaries and other administrative expenses, including $93,400 in salary for Moffitt, the UPF spokesperson, who is also the vice president of the foundation.)\n\nThis video recorded Jenkins giving a talk at a Unification Church in Columbus, Ohio, in which he quoted \"Mother\"-Hak Ja Han Moon-saying \"Christianity failed.\" He noted that she had proclaimed, \"the New Testament era is over. The Christian era has concluded.\" He suggested that the Unification Church is in the process of replacing Christianity. Consequently, Pence and Pompeo contributed their celebrity to an effort mounted by a movement that appears to consider Christianity kaput. (The video was originally obtained by Warren Throckmorton , a professor at Grove City College in Pennsylvania who writes a blog that covers religious issues.)\n\nMoffitt also did not respond to a Mother Jones request for a comment from Jenkins.\n\nPence's and Pompeo's appearances at the rally were much appreciated by the Universal Peace Federation, which released a celebratory press release noting that \"world-class leaders\" had \"affirmed and enhanced the concept of Think Tank 2022.\" But if one goal was to garner media attention in the United States for this venture through the participation of Pence, Pompeo, Gingrich, and others, the Universal Peace Federation fell short. It seems the only major American media outlet that covered the event was the Washington Times .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Wade in 2022, highlighting his role in nominating three Supreme Court justices who voted to end the precedent that held there was a constitutional right to abortion.\n\nEarlier this week, the former president also reversed course on legislation that would ban TikTok unless it cuts ties with ByteDance, an arrangement that has drawn national security concerns on Capitol Hill. Trump said on Monday he now opposes a ban on the video-sharing social media platform \"because there are a lot of people who talk that love it.\"\n\nDuring his presidential campaign last year, Pence suggested during an interview on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that Trump is \"walking away\" from conservative principles , including \"a clear commitment to the right to life,\" and accused Trump of holding a position on the national debt that \"is identical to Joe Biden's.\"\n\nMany former 2024 rivals have endorsed Trump since ending their own bids. After ending his bid following the Iowa caucuses in January, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy endorsed Trump. Days later, after suspending his own presidential bid, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis endorsed the former president.\n\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., a former presidential candidate and potential vice presidential pick , also backed Trump's presidential bid.\n\nBut others have not lined up behind the presumptive nominee. Former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, who ended her presidential bid this month, hasn't endorsed Trump and told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" earlier this month that she's no longer bound by a pledge made to the Republican National Committee to support the GOP presidential nominee. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has ruled out voting for Trump, though he added that he \"can't imagine\" voting for President Joe Biden.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's re-election campaign seized on Pence's comments, and pointed at other former senior administration officials who served in Trump's administration but haven't endorse him , including former Attorney General Bill Barr.\n\n\"Those who worked with Donald Trump at the most senior levels of his administration believe he is too dangerous, too selfish, and too extreme to ever lead our country again - we agree,\" Ammar Moussa, a campaign spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nI am a journalist covering breaking political news for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Newsday reported :\n\nDespite having voted for Democrats when he was younger, former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told a Long Island audience on Tuesday he could \"never support\" Kamala Harris and Tim Walz but declined to say whether he would be casting a ballot for the president he once served, Donald Trump. Pence, 65, in an hourlong appearance one week before Election Day, spoke about his Christian faith, civility in politics and parting ways with Trump after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"I haven't endorsed our ticket,\" the former vice president said at the gathering. \"I have real concerns about the direction of the Republican Party today.\"\n\nAsked specifically whether he'd cast a vote for his party's nominee, Pence added : \"I said all I'm going to say today.\"\n\nThis comes on the heels of the Indiana Republican publicly urging Republicans to reject \"protectionist tariffs\" and \"isolationism,\" which was generally seen as a rebuke of his former partner's agenda.\n\nIf Trump hoped that Pence would eventually come around, put party over country, and grudgingly throw his support behind the Republican ticket, those hopes have been dashed.\n\nThe Bulwark's Jonathan V. Last made a compelling case in the spring that Pence's non-endorsement deserved to be seen as among the year's most important electoral developments.\n\n\"No vice president has ever said that his former boss is unfit to serve,\" Last wrote. \"It is the most devastating possible observation from the most credible source in existence. This should be part of the context of every single story about this campaign.\"\n\nI mention this because, nearly eight months later, Pence's announcement no longer seems to be a major part of the 2024 conversation, and that strikes me as unfortunate. Pence ran with Trump in 2016, before serving at Trump's side for four years. Pence saw how Trump thought, how he led, how he processed information, how he prioritized and how he tried to govern.\n\nIt's against that backdrop that the former vice president has refused to endorse the president with whom he served - an unprecedented dynamic in the nation's history. It's hardly unjust for Trump's critics to ask, \"If his own vice president isn't supporting him, why should you?\"\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage .\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

As The Hill noted , Trump apparently thought it'd be a good idea to bring Pence back up over the Labor Day weekend.\n\nFormer President Trump in an interview broadcast late Sunday slammed Vice President Harris as \"vicious\" and claimed her treatment of former Vice President Mike Pence during a debate was \"horrible.\" Trump, speaking on Fox News's \"Life, Liberty and Levin,\" pointed to the viral moment during the 2020 vice presidential debate when Harris rebuked Pence's interruption with the phrase, \"Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking.\"\n\nThe Republican candidate, referring to Harris, specifically said, \"[S]he's a nasty person. The way she treated Mike Pence was horrible.\"\n\nDuring the same interview, Trump went on to point to the 2020 vice presidential debate as evidence of Harris being \" vicious .\"\n\nTo the extent that reality still has any meaning, it's true that when Pence and Harris participated in an October 2020 debate, the two traded some barbs , as is usually the case. At one point, when the then-Republican incumbent tried to interrupt the then-Democratic senator, she replied, \"Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking.\"\n\nYour mileage might vary, but to characterize the exchange as \"horrible\" and \"vicious\" seems rather ridiculous.\n\nIf, on the other hand, Trump is looking for someone who was actually \"horrible\" toward Pence, I might hand the former president a mirror.\n\nIn case anyone's forgotten, it was Trump who lobbied Pence to participate in a scheme to overturn the election. When those efforts didn't work, it was Trump, during a pre-riot rally on Jan. 6, who added unscripted comments about the then-vice president's reluctance to show \"courage.\"\n\nSoon after, during the insurrectionist assault on the Capitol , the then-president had an opportunity to urge the insurrectionists to end the attack. Instead, Trump published a tweet again insisting that Pence lacked the \"courage\" to overturn the election, which necessarily put the Hoosier in greater danger.\n\nIn the months that followed, Trump defended rioters' \" hang Mike Pence \" chants, blamed Pence for the violence at the Capitol and taunted his former vice president as a \"delusional\" coward and a bad person .\n\nBut sure, tell us another one about how Harris was a big meanie toward Pence, whose life Trump put in danger on Jan. 6.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

      "text": "Mike Pence's refusal to endorse Trump wasn't a 'bombshell.' It was a whimper.\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence told Fox News on Friday that he \"cannot in good conscience endorse Donald Trump in this campaign.\" His statement has been received as a momentous development in Republican politics. Analysts and commentators have called it a \"bombshell,\" a \"surprise\" and a \"major statement.\" My sharp colleague Steve Benen called it \"extraordinary.\"\n\nAllow me to strike a dissenting note. Pence's statement - if you listen to all of it - is the weakest possible non-endorsement of Trump he could have articulated. It hardly represents a sharp rejection of Trump, and to the extent that it does, it does so for reasons that shouldn't comfort us. It's not a bombshell but a whimper, and a signpost of complicity in Trump's assault on the republic.\n\nPence's announcement that he won't endorse Trump is particularly weak because he refuses to rule out voting for him.\n\nPence's announcement that he won't endorse Trump is particularly weak because he refuses to rule out voting for him. When Fox News host Martha MacCallum asked whether he'd vote for President Joe Biden, Pence replied that was going to \"keep my vote to myself\" and pledged that he would \"never vote for Joe Biden.\" That means, if he casts a ballot, he'll vote either for a third-party candidate or for Trump. By publicly refusing to rule out a vote for Trump, his non-endorsement looks more like performative piety than it does a punch at his former boss - and a far cry from fomenting resistance within the GOP.\n\nPence's rationale for his non-endorsement sheds light on why he took such a soft position. The former vice president isn't drawing a line in the sand over protecting democracy, but, rather, he's mewling about how Trump has moved away from the mainstream conservatism that predated Trump. Pence discusses how he was \"incredibly proud\" of the work he and Trump did. In his list of reasons for describing his move away from Trump he briefly mentions \"our difference on my constitutional duties that I exercised on Jan. 6,\" framing Trump's attempts to overturn the election as negotiable, a subjective interpretation. A firmer criticism would've characterized Trump as attempting to pressure Pence to renege on his constitutional duties, and as recruiting him to participate in a coup against his own government. But most of what Pence lists are complaints about Trump's deviation from Pence's own vision of conservatism, which includes attention to reducing the national debt and taking the most radical position possible on prohibiting abortion. He also disapproved of Trump's odd flip-flop on banning TikTok.\n\nPence's mealy-mouthed criticism of Trump tracks with his catastrophic 2024 campaign . More than any other candidate, he had the most visceral basis for laying into Trump - on Jan. 6, 2021, as rioters were calling out \"hang Mike Pence,\" Trump tweeted , \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done.\" (And Trump aides claim that behind the scenes Trump supported those chanting for Pence to be hanged.) To be fair, Pence has in the past used more forceful language to call out Trump over Jan. 6 .  But he's hardly been a champion of preserving bedrock institutions and the rule of law. He initially declined to criticize Trump as the former president was slammed with criminal charges and Pence called into question the legitimacy of the legal system . Pence's criticism of Trump often focused on Trump's departure from Reaganite conservatism (his policies on social spending or Russia , for example), rather than on Trump's assault on the very foundation of multicultural democracy.\n\nDuring his Fox interview, Pence expressed no concern over Trump's promises that his presidency would symbolize \"revenge,\" his open ambitions to be a dictator , or his fascistic rhetoric about migrants' not being human.\n\nPence's remarks would have been a bombshell if he had said something like \"Despite my disagreement with him on almost every policy issue, I feel compelled to vote for President Biden out of my continued duty to protect the Constitution of the United States. I encourage my fellow Republicans to do the same - and fight for renewing American conservatism at the presidential level after this emergency passes.\" But Pence doesn't appear to consider the specter of a slide into autocracy an emergency. At least not a bigger one than another Democratic presidential term.\n\nWhat is Pence's conscience telling him, exactly? It doesn't allow him to publicly back Trump. But it might allow for him to vote for the man threatening to wreck the Constitution that Pence purports to hold dear. Sounds more like a public relations dial than a moral compass to me.\n\nZeeshan Aleem is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily.

Mostly dad-joke funny, but still funny. Did you know he wrote a comic strip during law school, \"Law School Daze\"? I didn't either. It was awful. Sorry: As a journalist, when you have more quotes from people saying your subject is funny than examples of his actually being funny, you should probably bail on the piece. As a reader, I did, about halfway through. That's because we were just a day away from proof of concept: the Gridiron Dinner. Would Pence slay? He did not. He got the most attention for his hypocritical but bold insistence that Donald Trump is to blame for the January 6 insurrection. That is a statement of fact, but Pence has not said it with such clarity before. \"History will hold Donald Trump accountable for January 6,\" Pence told hundreds of mostly journalists at what is normally a lighthearted event. \"Make no mistake about it: What happened that day was a disgrace, and it mocks decency to portray it in any other way. President Trump was wrong. His reckless words endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day.\" More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely. April 24, 2025 Chris Van Hollen Shows Us One Person Can Make a Difference April 21, 2025 Trump Could Bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia Home if He Wanted To April 16, 2025 The problem is, Pence has resisted a subpoena from special counsel Jack Smith to testify about what he knows of Trump's role before and during that day of carnage. If he cares so much that Trump be held accountable, he should share what he knows in a deposition, not at a friendly bipartisan dinner. Then there was the homophobia. Hilarious! He made fun of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for taking time off when he adopted twins. \"He took two months 'maternity' leave, whereupon thousands of travelers were stranded in airports, the air traffic system shut down, and airplanes nearly collided on our runways. Pete is the only person in human history to have a child and everyone else gets postpartum depression.\" First, Mike: Everyone calls it parental leave now. Fathers commonly take it. You didn't have to feminize the gay transportation secretary-the man your creepy former boss loves to call \"Pete Butt.\" (Get it?) Also: Buttigieg's twins, born prematurely, developed RSV ; one endured a long hospital stay and spent a week on a ventilator. What Christian charity you showed there, Mike. Current Issue View our current issue Still, Beltway journalists gave Pence a decent grade on his speech. There were a couple of funny jokes. He poked fun at his religious faith: \"I'm really not as uptight as many people think. There's this idea that I'm some kind of religious nut. I'm really not. Just ask my sons, Jedediah, Obadiah, or Zechariah.... In fact, my preferred pronouns are 'thou' and 'thine.'\" A pronoun joke that doesn't explicitly mock trans folks? Wow. But the point of the exercise seemed to be to find Pence a lane in what is becoming a surprisingly crowded 2024 Republican primary race. We have Trump, who's already declared, and Ron DeSantis, who hasn't, at the top. Much further down there is South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, also declared, plus Pence, former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, and a half dozen other undeclared folks who like having their names mentioned but barely poll above 2 percent at this point. Is pretending to be funny going to break Pence out of the single-digit pack? I doubt it. His only play, if you believe he has one, which I do not, is to try to recapture the Christian evangelical vote that has strangely gone to the godless Trump. I doubt that will work either. Evangelical voters don't like the fact that, though he refuses to cooperate with those investigating Trump's actions on and around January 6, he nonetheless criticizes his former boss. Pence is too loyal for the anti-Trumpers and not loyal enough for the Trump base. For the rest of us, he's the same odd cipher he has always been, with his religious zealotry and his strange lack of compassion for those in need. Is his alleged humor going to make it feel better when he tries to take away what's left of abortion rights, invalidate Buttigieg's marriage, cut Social Security and Medicare, and slash the social safety net? I don't think so. A Mike Pence presidency is not going to happen. Maybe he should go back to cartooning.\n\nSorry: As a journalist, when you have more quotes from people saying your subject is funny than examples of his actually being funny, you should probably bail on the piece.

It was, after all, the sole basis for Richard Nixon's claim to Serious Leader status and the only conceivable explanation for George H.W. Bush's election. Even Bush's own achievement-challenged second in command, Dan Quayle, felt more or less obliged to half-heartedly launch his own presidential bid in 2000. But Quayle's Hoosier successor to the vice presidency, Mike Pence, seems to be pointedly glossing over his most prominent political role. On the website touting his newly announced presidential campaign, Pence's lengthy biography devotes a scant two sentences to his vice-presidential tenure, even then expending more words on his pre-White House political life: \"It was Indiana's success story, Vice President Pence's record of legislative and executive experience, and his strong family values that prompted Donald Trump to select Mike Pence as his running mate in July 2016.\" Pence's campaign launch video , released yesterday, supplies a similarly bowdlerized account of his time at the White House. The Big Man is never named or pictured, and Pence refers to his Trump administration service in the most generic terms imaginable, referencing \"the progress we made together toward a stronger, more prosperous America.\" This long-studied silence is roughly what you'd expect from a management trainee glossing over a four-year gap in his résumé. You'd never guess that Mike Pence was Donald Trump's all-purpose liaison to the religious right, his surrogate of choice in culture war set-tos like the phony uproar over Black NFL players taking a knee to protest police killing of unarmed Black men in police custody, and the leader of the Trump White House's Covid response efforts. On the other hand, you might also miss the fact that the Trump insurrectionists at the US Capitol on January 6 had called for Pence to be hanged as a traitor for refusing to go along with the defeated president's attempt to engineer a coup-a notion that Trump himself reportedly deemed a pretty good idea . This isn't the first time that a former vice president has run against his erstwhile boss for a major-party presidential nomination; John Nance Garner challenged Franklin Roosevelt's bid for a third term in 1940. But it is the first time that a former veep has tried to defeat his onetime superior by wishing away both men's term in office. To judge by this initial flurry of campaign agitprop, Mike Pence, even more than Ron DeSantis , wishes to lead a Republican Party where Donald Trump never happened.

Trump remains the xenophobic, law-breaking, election-denying, racist, and misogynistic center of Republican politics today. Polls show him ahead of DeSantis-an aspirationally competent model of MAGA governance-by a consistent 30-point margin, while Pence brings up the rear of the field in single digits. Pence's amnesiac campaign materials amount to a tacit acknowledgment of Trump's unrivaled power: best simply not to disturb the beast rather than to send him on another feeding frenzy. Even when Pence did deign to name-check Trump and explain the reasoning behind his 2024 challenge, at his singularly awkward in-person campaign launch in Iowa, he rushed to invoke abstract platitudes rather than contrasting political visions. Referencing Trump's appeal to overturn the 2020 election results and throw the vote over to the House of Representatives, Pence said, \"I prayed for him... I hoped that he'd come around and see that he was misled about my role. But this was not to be. The Republican Party must be the party of the Constitution of the United States.\" This is a bit like characterizing the Tate-LaBianca murders as an argument over the place of the White Album in the Beatles canon. What's more, to hold out hope in the efficacy of prayer to change Donald Trump's character-let alone to provoke a crisis of conscience culminating in an admission of error-is tantamount to a confession that Pence paid zero attention in every cabinet meeting and political event he took part in. Undecided Republican voters would be entirely justified in questioning why they should entrust Pence with the power to negotiate with other unhinged authoritarian leaders as president. In any event, Pence's whole problem is that the conservative movement base wants rule by unhinged strongman leaders-the Constitution be damned. That's why Trump's poll numbers have increased in the wake of his criminal arraignment in New York, and after a jury held him civilly liable for the sexual assault of E. Jean Carroll. And it's why Pence desperately wants to change the subject-preferably to the simpler, homespun heyday of the Reagan coalition on the right. \"As soon as I heard the voice of the 40th president of the United States, I joined the Reagan revolution and never looked back,\" Pence said at his Iowa event. His launch video twice invokes Reagan's characterization of America as \"a shining city on a hill\"-itself a complete bastardization of the language of John Winthrop's 1630 sermon aboard the Arbella -and culminates in a revival-style invocation of St. Gipper: \"Above all, he called on Americans to renew optimism and to believe in themselves again, to believe in each other. Every time our nation has produced leadership that has called on this country to do hard things, the American people have always risen to the challenge, and we will again.\" Reagan, of course, never called on the nation to make serious sacrifices of any kind-unless, that is, you count the S&L and junk bond pillaging of the country's productive interior . But the shaky image of Reagan-led comity on the right is pretty much all that self-styled conservatives have left in Donald Trump's GOP. The electoral coalition Reagan oversaw was designed to bring true-believing culture warriors like the young Mike Pence in line with a tax-slashing and labor-soaking economic agenda. Now, the true believers are decamping from the pieties of small-government conservatism and calling for Pence's head in a tumbril.

What's more, to hold out hope in the efficacy of prayer to change Donald Trump's character-let alone to provoke a crisis of conscience culminating in an admission of error-is tantamount to a confession that Pence paid zero attention in every cabinet meeting and political event he took part in. Undecided Republican voters would be entirely justified in questioning why they should entrust Pence with the power to negotiate with other unhinged authoritarian leaders as president. In any event, Pence's whole problem is that the conservative movement base wants rule by unhinged strongman leaders-the Constitution be damned. That's why Trump's poll numbers have increased in the wake of his criminal arraignment in New York, and after a jury held him civilly liable for the sexual assault of E. Jean Carroll. And it's why Pence desperately wants to change the subject-preferably to the simpler, homespun heyday of the Reagan coalition on the right. \"As soon as I heard the voice of the 40th president of the United States, I joined the Reagan revolution and never looked back,\" Pence said at his Iowa event. His launch video twice invokes Reagan's characterization of America as \"a shining city on a hill\"-itself a complete bastardization of the language of John Winthrop's 1630 sermon aboard the Arbella -and culminates in a revival-style invocation of St. Gipper: \"Above all, he called on Americans to renew optimism and to believe in themselves again, to believe in each other. Every time our nation has produced leadership that has called on this country to do hard things, the American people have always risen to the challenge, and we will again.\" Reagan, of course, never called on the nation to make serious sacrifices of any kind-unless, that is, you count the S&L and junk bond pillaging of the country's productive interior . But the shaky image of Reagan-led comity on the right is pretty much all that self-styled conservatives have left in Donald Trump's GOP. The electoral coalition Reagan oversaw was designed to bring true-believing culture warriors like the young Mike Pence in line with a tax-slashing and labor-soaking economic agenda. Now, the true believers are decamping from the pieties of small-government conservatism and calling for Pence's head in a tumbril.

No wonder the guy is supplementing his bouts of self-administered amnesia with little more than warmed-over nostalgia.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

But former vice president Mike Pence's belated declaration , before the Federalist Society on Friday, that \"President Trump is wrong. I had no right to overturn the election\" has some hailing him as a hero nonetheless. \"Bravo Mike Pence,\" George Conway tweeted almost immediately. Federalist stalwart Conway is (not that it matters?) the husband of Kellyanne Conway, who's about to make bank on a book about her years fluffing Trump. Mr. Conway was a leader of the petty and partisan push to impeach President Bill Clinton for you-know-what. But he turned Never Trump, and I respect him for that, but I worry that Never Trumpers are turning into Maybe Pencers... and that would be wrong. The Wall Street Journal editorial page called it Pence's \"finest hour.\" \"Look, I understand the disappointment many feel about the last election. I was on the ballot,\" Pence joked Friday. \"But whatever the future holds, I know we did our duty that day.\" A few hours earlier, the Republican National Committee voted not only to censure Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger-both of whom voted to impeach Trump after the January 6 insurrection, and joined the House Select Committee to investigate that scandal-but to name the insurrection \"legitimate political discourse.\" That's why Pence's 13-months-late weak-sauce rebuke to Trump was kinda brave... but also pathetic. It nonetheless won plaudits from pundits and some Never Trumpers and even some supposed Democrats-but most importantly, it inflamed the debate over whether Republicans are maybe, finally, belatedly or just-in-time pulling away from Trump and going... home. Maybe Pence is home? Current Issue View our current issue The anti-choice Slinky-spined theocrat should be nobody's idea of a solid home, let alone someone who should hope to occupy the Oval Office. Whether he did something good on Friday or not, he is terrible. According to records compiled by the House January 6 Select Committee and many journalists, Pence knew pretty much everything Trump was planning-and said nothing about the treason he saw at the time. And very little afterward, when he came into direct danger. (Believe me, I did think about whether that constituted courage. I decided it constituted loyalty to his tribe.)

According to records compiled by the House January 6 Select Committee and many journalists, Pence knew pretty much everything Trump was planning-and said nothing about the treason he saw at the time. And very little afterward, when he came into direct danger. (Believe me, I did think about whether that constituted courage. I decided it constituted loyalty to his tribe.)

Stirring. It's true that Trump recently upped the stakes in a recent speech to admirers.

It nonetheless won plaudits from pundits and some Never Trumpers and even some supposed Democrats-but most importantly, it inflamed the debate over whether Republicans are maybe, finally, belatedly or just-in-time pulling away from Trump and going... home.

Pence is essentially siding with the people who wanted to kill him. First, recall, Pence said he would talk to investigators-just not those from the congressional January 6 committee. It was partisan , y'know. Then he said he wouldn't comply with Smith's subpoena, because of his own contested legal status on January 6, as he presided over Congress as vice president to certify the Electoral College votes, supposedly making him a member of Congress? Back on January 6, Pence was doing the right thing. Now, he's absolutely not. On Tuesday a judge backed Smith's subpoena, and unless Pence successfully appeals, he will have to testify. It's very hard to be Mike Pence right now. Pence's display has been pathetic. He tried to plead politics. \"I'm going to fight the Biden DOJ subpoena for me to appear before the grand jury because I believe it's unconstitutional and it's unprecedented,\" Pence told reporters in February. It's true that Pence's situation is unprecedented: A president who lost his reelection bid has never before tried to get his vice president to overturn the election. Current Issue View our current issue Or as his former adviser J. Michael Luttig wrote in The New York Times last week: \"Inasmuch as Mr. Pence's claim is novel and an unsettled question in constitutional law , it is only novel and unsettled because there has never been a time in our country's history where it was thought imperative for someone in a vice president's position, or his lawyer, to conjure the argument.\" Pence can't win. Does he know that? I'm not sure. I don't think Pence is stupid. But maybe his place in the world-Trump aside, he is a far-right Christian, anti-choice and anti-LGBTQ rights, wants to cut Social Security and Medicare, just about the worst agenda there is-makes him oblivious. To be fair, anyone who wants to be president can imaginably be president. Few of us thought Trump could win. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, the leading presumptive Trump challenger, has plunged in the polls. Who knows? Maybe Pence can do it. It's offensive to have a man who thinks he could or should be president play politics like this. Mike, you really should try to care about how you look to the world. I guess it won't matter to the Republican primary base. I mean, it won't.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025. But we can't do this without you. As a reader-supported publication, we rely on the support of generous donors.

But former vice president Mike Pence's belated declaration , before the Federalist Society on Friday, that \"President Trump is wrong. I had no right to overturn the election\" has some hailing him as a hero nonetheless. \"Bravo Mike Pence,\" George Conway tweeted almost immediately. Federalist stalwart Conway is (not that it matters?) the husband of Kellyanne Conway, who's about to make bank on a book about her years fluffing Trump. Mr. Conway was a leader of the petty and partisan push to impeach President Bill Clinton for you-know-what. But he turned Never Trump, and I respect him for that, but I worry that Never Trumpers are turning into Maybe Pencers... and that would be wrong. The Wall Street Journal editorial page called it Pence's \"finest hour.\" \"Look, I understand the disappointment many feel about the last election. I was on the ballot,\" Pence joked Friday. \"But whatever the future holds, I know we did our duty that day.\" A few hours earlier, the Republican National Committee voted not only to censure Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger-both of whom voted to impeach Trump after the January 6 insurrection, and joined the House Select Committee to investigate that scandal-but to name the insurrection \"legitimate political discourse.\" That's why Pence's 13-months-late weak-sauce rebuke to Trump was kinda brave... but also pathetic. It nonetheless won plaudits from pundits and some Never Trumpers and even some supposed Democrats-but most importantly, it inflamed the debate over whether Republicans are maybe, finally, belatedly or just-in-time pulling away from Trump and going... home. Maybe Pence is home? Current Issue View our current issue The anti-choice Slinky-spined theocrat should be nobody's idea of a solid home, let alone someone who should hope to occupy the Oval Office. Whether he did something good on Friday or not, he is terrible. According to records compiled by the House January 6 Select Committee and many journalists, Pence knew pretty much everything Trump was planning-and said nothing about the treason he saw at the time. And very little afterward, when he came into direct danger. (Believe me, I did think about whether that constituted courage. I decided it constituted loyalty to his tribe.)

Explaining why a bipartisan group of members of Congress is trying to clean up the messy 1887 Electoral Count Act, Trump claimed they're essentially proving he won in 2020. \"Actually, what they are saying, is that Mike Pence did have the right to change the outcome, and they now want to take that right away. Unfortunately, he didn't exercise that power. He could have overturned the election!\" The Electoral Count Act says no such thing, though its wording is clumsy. Trump quickly issued a statement rebuking Pence. \"I was right and everyone knows it. If there is fraud or large scale irregularities, it would have been appropriate to send those votes back to the legislatures to figure it out,\" the delusional former president said. P ence's bold-for-a-coward statement is taken as just more evidence of at least one of two things mainstream media wags care about: That Pence plans to run for president in 2024, and that Trump's hold on the GOP is weakening.

But then there are guys like Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley. God bless him-at 87 you'd think he has the freedom not to run, or to run whatever way he'd like. But no, he's clinging to Trump: \"I may have been born at night, but I wasn't born last night,\" Grassley said in a recent Iowa appearance with Trump. \"So if I didn't accept the endorsement of a person that's got 91 percent of the Republican voters in Iowa, I wouldn't be too smart.\" Pence is talking, and traveling around the country, like a man who's running for president. In the unlikely event that Trump himself doesn't run, he pretty clearly won't endorse Pence. Support from institutional players like the Federalist Society and the WSJ editorial board make Pence's moves worth watching. Somebody will lead the GOP ticket in 2024.

It nonetheless won plaudits from pundits and some Never Trumpers and even some supposed Democrats-but most importantly, it inflamed the debate over whether Republicans are maybe, finally, belatedly or just-in-time pulling away from Trump and going... home.

Whether he did something good on Friday or not, he is terrible. According to records compiled by the House January 6 Select Committee and many journalists, Pence knew pretty much everything Trump was planning-and said nothing about the treason he saw at the time.

In her opening remarks during the prime-time hearing, Representative Liz Cheney, the Wyoming Republican who effectively cochairs the committee, recounted how, \"aware of the rioters' chants to 'hang Mike Pence,' the President responded with this sentiment: 'Maybe our supporters have the right idea.' Mike Pence 'deserves it.'\" Previous reports had hinted at the idea that, as his supporters were engaged in their deadly assault on the Capitol, Trump responded approvingly with calls for stringing up Pence. Trump's record of violent disdain for associates who fail to do his bidding is well documented. But still, the notion that the president of the United States was so comfortable with the prospect of having a crowd he incited murder his vice president had a very \" Night of the Long Knives \" feel to it. The committee will dig into the matter more deeply Thursday, in a hearing that Cheney has said \"will focus on President Trump's efforts to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes on January 6th.\" The hearing, which is expected to feature testimony from Greg Jacob, the former chief counsel to the vice president, will focus on the behind-the-scenes maneuvering of lawyer John Eastman, a Trump associate who had hatched the scheme to have Pence make a series of rulings that would reject votes from battleground states that had backed Joe Biden. Cheney relates that, in an e-mail exchange during the time when the Capitol was under assault, an outraged Jacob told Eastman , \"And thanks to your bullshit, we are under siege.\" That comment will undoubtedly be reviewed Thursday. So, too, will Pence's carefully worded speech at a February 4 Federalist Society event , in which he said: Our Founders were deeply suspicious of consolidated power in the nation's capital and were rightly concerned with foreign interference if presidential elections were decided in the capital. But there are those in our party who believe that as the presiding officer over the joint session of Congress, I possessed unilateral authority to reject electoral college votes. And I heard this week, President Trump said I had the right to \"overturn the election.\" President Trump is wrong. I had no right to overturn the election. And frankly, there is no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president.

The former vice president has given no indication that he wants to engage with the inquiry into a coup in which his life was threatened, despite the fact that committee chair Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) has said , \"We've always had the effort to reach out and get the vice president's participation.\" Indeed, Pence will travel to Washington during the course of the hearings to appear at an gathering the House Republican Study Committee, which is chaired by Representative Jim Banks (R-Ind.), who after the first hearing dismissed the select committee's work as \"truly a political witch-hunt that was focused more on the Democrats' obsession with Donald Trump than anything at all about Capitol security or investigating the events that led up to January 6.\" Banks is a lying Trump apologist. So why is Pence keeping company with this particular congressman, rather than testifying before the committee? Why isn't the former vice president testifying not just about his belief that Trump's assessment of the vice president's power to overturn an election was wrong but, more importantly, about the fact that what Trump did before and during the January 6 coup attempt was wrong? The answer to that question is all too obvious. Pence is a craven political careerist who is always looking out for what is best for Pence. He did the right thing on January 6, 2021, and for that he deserves credit. But his appropriate action on that day-when even House minority leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) was rebuking Trump -was less a matter of political heroism than political positioning. Remember that Pence was so desperately afraid of crossing Trump that he turned to former vice president Dan Quayle for advice on whether he might do Trump's bidding. According to the book Peril , by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, Pence asked Quayle if there was anything he could do. \"Mike, you have no flexibility on this. None. Zero. Forget it. Put it away,\" said Quayle. But Pence kept pushing : \"You don't know the position I'm in,\" Pence said. Quayle replied, \"I do know the position you're in. I also know what the law is. You listen to the parliamentarian. That's all you do. You have no power.\" Ultimately, that's what Pence did.

As Kurt Bardella, a former senior adviser for Republicans on the House Oversight Committee who has since become a Democrat, observed after reading the book, \"Think about it. The vice president of the United States was calling around looking for someone who would give him permission to preside over the complete collapse of our democratic process.\" The fact is that Pence was, is, and will always be a political hack. He's a perennial candidate, constantly on the watch for a way to pursue his ambition for higher office. He's already campaigning for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination- visiting key early caucus and primary states , campaigning for fellow Republicans, and begging for money. It's a failed mission. The dominant figure in the Republican Party, Donald Trump, actively despises Pence, as do Trump's backers, who make up the defining faction in most state parties. But Pence can't help himself. The career politician who has rarely let an election cycle pass without positioning for another bid for another high office will keep trying to have it both ways. He wants to be seen by Trump critics as the patriot who stood up to the former president, and he wants to be seen by Trump allies as a loyal vice president who did almost everything the boss asked. Testifying before the January 6 Committee would force Pence to take a side. He would, undoubtedly, be asked to accept the argument made by Cheney : \"What President Trump demanded that Mike Pence do wasn't just wrong, it was illegal and it was unconstitutional.\" Pence is not going to call Trump a crook. He is not going to describe Trump's January 6 project as \"an attempted coup.\" Doing so would doom Pence's presidential prospects. Yes, those prospects are dismal. But Pence is not prepared to face the truth that his political career is over. The former vice president will not testify because, when all is said and done, Mike Pence lacks the courage to sacrifice his own ambition for the cause of assuring that there is never another insurrection like the one that occurred on January 6, 2021. He doesn't even have the guts to demand accountability for the thug who suggested that hanging Mike Pence might be \"the right idea.\"\n\nIn her opening remarks during the prime-time hearing, Representative Liz Cheney, the Wyoming Republican who effectively cochairs the committee, recounted how, \"aware of the rioters' chants to 'hang Mike Pence,' the President responded with this sentiment: 'Maybe our supporters have the right idea.'

He doesn't even have the guts to demand accountability for the thug who suggested that hanging Mike Pence might be \"the right idea.\"\n\nThe committee will dig into the matter more deeply Thursday, in a hearing that Cheney has said \"will focus on President Trump's efforts to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes on January 6th.\" The hearing, which is expected to feature testimony from Greg Jacob, the former chief counsel to the vice president, will focus on the behind-the-scenes maneuvering of lawyer John Eastman, a Trump associate who had hatched the scheme to have Pence make a series of rulings that would reject votes from battleground states that had backed Joe Biden. Cheney relates that, in an e-mail exchange during the time when the Capitol was under assault, an outraged Jacob told Eastman , \"And thanks to your bullshit, we are under siege.\" That comment will undoubtedly be reviewed Thursday. So, too, will Pence's carefully worded speech at a February 4 Federalist Society event , in which he said: Our Founders were deeply suspicious of consolidated power in the nation's capital and were rightly concerned with foreign interference if presidential elections were decided in the capital. But there are those in our party who believe that as the presiding officer over the joint session of Congress, I possessed unilateral authority to reject electoral college votes. And I heard this week, President Trump said I had the right to \"overturn the election.\" President Trump is wrong. I had no right to overturn the election. And frankly, there is no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president.

Why isn't the former vice president testifying not just about his belief that Trump's assessment of the vice president's power to overturn an election was wrong but, more importantly, about the fact that what Trump did before and during the January 6 coup attempt was wrong? The answer to that question is all too obvious. Pence is a craven political careerist who is always looking out for what is best for Pence. He did the right thing on January 6, 2021, and for that he deserves credit. But his appropriate action on that day-when even House minority leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) was rebuking Trump -was less a matter of political heroism than political positioning. Remember that Pence was so desperately afraid of crossing Trump that he turned to former vice president Dan Quayle for advice on whether he might do Trump's bidding. According to the book Peril , by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, Pence asked Quayle if there was anything he could do. \"Mike, you have no flexibility on this. None. Zero. Forget it. Put it away,\" said Quayle. But Pence kept pushing : \"You don't know the position I'm in,\" Pence said. Quayle replied, \"I do know the position you're in. I also know what the law is.

But Pence is not prepared to face the truth that his political career is over. The former vice president will not testify because, when all is said and done, Mike Pence lacks the courage to sacrifice his own ambition for the cause of assuring that there is never another insurrection like the one that occurred on January 6, 2021. He doesn't even have the guts to demand accountability for the thug who suggested that hanging Mike Pence might be \"the right idea.\"\n\nSo why is Pence keeping company with this particular congressman, rather than testifying before the committee? Why isn't the former vice president testifying not just about his belief that Trump's assessment of the vice president's power to overturn an election was wrong but, more importantly, about the fact that what Trump did before and during the January 6 coup attempt was wrong? The answer to that question is all too obvious. Pence is a craven political careerist who is always looking out for what is best for Pence. He did the right thing on January 6, 2021, and for that he deserves credit. But his appropriate action on that day-when even House minority leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) was rebuking Trump -was less a matter of political heroism than political positioning. Remember that Pence was so desperately afraid of crossing Trump that he turned to former vice president Dan Quayle for advice on whether he might do Trump's bidding. According to the book Peril , by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, Pence asked Quayle if there was anything he could do. \"Mike, you have no flexibility on this. None. Zero. Forget it. Put it away,\" said Quayle. But Pence kept pushing : \"You don't know the position I'm in,\" Pence said. Quayle replied, \"I do know the position you're in. I also know what the law is. You listen to the parliamentarian. That's all you do. You have no power.\" Ultimately, that's what Pence did.

As Kurt Bardella, a former senior adviser for Republicans on the House Oversight Committee who has since become a Democrat, observed after reading the book, \"Think about it. The vice president of the United States was calling around looking for someone who would give him permission to preside over the complete collapse of our democratic process.\" The fact is that Pence was, is, and will always be a political hack. He's a perennial candidate, constantly on the watch for a way to pursue his ambition for higher office. He's already campaigning for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination- visiting key early caucus and primary states , campaigning for fellow Republicans, and begging for money. It's a failed mission. The dominant figure in the Republican Party, Donald Trump, actively despises Pence, as do Trump's backers, who make up the defining faction in most state parties. But Pence can't help himself. The career politician who has rarely let an election cycle pass without positioning for another bid for another high office will keep trying to have it both ways. He wants to be seen by Trump critics as the patriot who stood up to the former president, and he wants to be seen by Trump allies as a loyal vice president who did almost everything the boss asked.

Trump and his advisers had tried to get him \"essentially to overturn the election\" and that the American people needed to know it.\n\nThe remarks, made in an interview with Fox News , are some of Mr. Pence's most pointed to date about what he experienced in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, when he presided over the congressional certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory.\n\nAnd they came as Mr. Pence, who is trailing his former boss, the G.O.P. front-runner, in the Republican primary, has faced a slog in his attempt to get enough small-donor donations to qualify for the first Republican debate on Aug. 23. An adviser to Mr. Pence said he got more than 7,000 donations on Wednesday, the day after Mr. Trump's indictment on charges of conspiring to overthrow the 2020 election.\n\nThe new remarks are less of a pivot than a subtle shift in Mr. Pence's language on a topic over which he has long walked a delicate tightrope - condemning Mr. Trump's behavior while saying he hoped an indictment would not be in the offing, describing it as divisive for the country.\n\nBut in the hours after the indictment, Mr. Pence became somewhat more explicit publicly about some of the pressure campaign tactics that Mr. Trump and his allies engaged in while attempting to persuade Mr. Pence to use his ceremonial role overseeing the certification of Electoral College votes to toss out the results.\n\nIn a campaign speech earlier Wednesday at the Indiana State Fair, Mr. Pence reiterated his stance that \"anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be president of the United States.\" Mr. Trump, in a post on his social media site, Truth Social, said he feels \"badly\" for Mr. Pence as he struggles to gain traction in his presidential bid.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

And that on that day, President Trump asked me to put him over the Constitution. But I chose the Constitution, and I always will. And I, I really do believe that anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be president of the United States. What the president maintained that day and frankly has said over and over again over the last two and a half years is completely false. And it's contrary to what our Constitution and the laws of this country provide. I dismissed it out of hand, but sadly, the president was surrounded by a group of crackpot lawyers that kept telling him what his itching ears wanted to hear. And while I made my case to him of what I understood my oath of the Constitution to require the president ultimately, ultimately, you know, continued to demand that I choose him over the Constitution. And so in this moment, irrespective of how this case plays out, I want the American people to know that I believe with all my heart that by God's grace I did my duty that day.\n\nBy Shane Goldmacher Maggie Astor and Luke Broadwater\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence's remarkable transformation from Donald J. Trump's most loyal lieutenant to an indispensable, if reluctant, witness for his prosecution became clear this week, when he emerged as perhaps the central character in a stinging indictment accusing the former president of a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nFrom a tense Christmas Day phone call between the two men to the fresh revelation that Mr. Pence kept \"contemporaneous notes\" on the tumultuous period leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, the indictment detailed Mr. Pence's efforts to block his former boss's schemes and laid bare the rupture in their relationship.\n\n\"You're too honest,\" Mr. Trump berated Mr. Pence as he refused to go along with the election plot, according to the indictment.\n\nYet Mr. Pence has been loath to embrace the role of Trump antagonist, even as he has repeatedly suggested that Mr. Trump's push to overturn the 2020 vote is disqualifying. He casts Mr. Trump as more a victim of unfortunate circumstances than the mastermind of an election-stealing conspiracy.\n\n\"Anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be president of the United States,\" Mr. Pence said in a statement on Tuesday night. But by Wednesday, he was blaming Mr. Trump's \"crackpot lawyers\" during a stop at the Indiana state fair and lamenting the indictment in a private call with donors, saying, \"I had hoped it wouldn't come to this.\"\n\nIn a Wednesday evening interview on Fox News , Mr. Pence gave a more direct version of events, sharpening his rebuke of his former boss.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Lisa Lerer and Rebecca Davis O'Brien reported from Las Vegas.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, who spent four years dutifully serving President Donald J.

      "text": "Mike Pence's Rickety Revival\n\nMike Pence was having a hard week. The second fund-raising quarter for Presidential candidates had ended on July 15th, and he'd only brought in about a million dollars. In the prediction markets, he had sunk to the least likely of all declared Republican candidates to win the nomination. In Iowa, he was booed onstage by two thousand Christian conservatives and mocked by Tucker Carlson , who compared interviewing him to beating a five-year-old at Ping-Pong. A video of the former Vice-President being hit in the back of the head with a water balloon thrown by a child was going viral online; when it turned out to be someone else, it didn't seem to matter. Bob Klaus, who hosts Iowa's annual Good Friday Prayer Breakfast, at which Pence had offered to appear, told me, \"I wouldn't even want him to do it at this point.\" We were at the Family Leadership Summit, in Des Moines, a mix of megachurch service and political convention where Presidential candidates are trotted out to a crowd of pastors, religious leaders, and staunch evangelicals. In the ballroom, a contemporary-Christian vocal trio performed; then the audience cheered as Iowa's governor signed a six-week abortion ban into law at the podium. \"If Pence can't get this Christian crowd to rally around him, he has no chance,\" a financial adviser attending the event told me. How had Pence lost them-and without them what did he have?\n\nThe night before the summit, I sat in on a focus group where a political pollster wearing red-white-and-blue striped sneakers told a group of twenty self-identified evangelical and born-again Christian voters, \"You get heard only around election time, only in Iowa, and then no one else pays attention to you anymore.\" What was the phrase they'd use to describe the United States today? \"Revival or bust,\" one said. Pence might like to imagine himself as the natural candidate for this Christian revival; faith is his constant antidote to American decline. The first Vice-President in history to run against the President who put him on the ticket, he hopes that his godliness and pro-life reverence can pull evangelical voters back from Trump.\n\nIt's a sensible plan, at least in theory. In 1978, at the end of Pence's freshman year of college, he was born again at a Christian music festival in central Kentucky. \"One journey ended for me and another began,\" he wrote. \"From that day forward I felt that my life was not my own.\" Two years before, Jimmy Carter had launched a successful run for President as a born-again Christian. (He was the most popular candidate at the Iowa caucus.) Jerry Falwell , during a service that same year, said that the separation of religion from politics \"was invented by the Devil to keep Christians from running their own country.\" Thus began the perpetual call for spiritual renewal when politicians come to Iowa. In 2016, Ted Cruz, a Southern Baptist, tailored his Presidential campaign to court evangelical voters. When he won the Iowa caucus, he declared that he wanted to \"awaken the body of Christ, that we might pull back from the abyss.\" Trump, meanwhile, didn't really bother with the pretense of serious religiosity, though he did say that he felt cleansed when \"I drink my little wine\" and \"have my little cracker.\"\n\nNevertheless, Cruz fizzled, and support for Trump among Christian conservatives kept ticking up; about eighty per cent of white evangelicals voted for him (and Pence) in 2016 and 2020. Both times around, pundits and researchers asked, of this alignment with Trump, How could they? The Christian leader Russell Moore announced that he'd stopped using the word evangelical to describe himself because Trump had so thoroughly polluted it.\n\nIn 2024, Pence offers a more traditional Christian politics. He has frequently described looking to God-to the spiritual truth of Scripture-for guidance in his political decisions. (When he prayed with his wife, Karen, over whether to enter his first congressional race, at twenty-eight, she said, \"Let's go. Let's run until the Lord closes the door.\") As Vice-President, he hosted a weekly Bible study at the White House, led by an evangelical pastor. He has proposed teaching creationism in schools and, more recently, a national six-week abortion ban. At the Family Leadership Summit, before candidates took the stage, Greg Baker, the head of the organization's church ambassador network, reminded the audience, \"Romans 13 teaches us that God instituted governance. Jesus is the shepherd of government and church. We don't need more conservatives or Republicans or liberals-we need more shepherds who, at the expense of their own lives, lead the sheep to what they need, not what they want.\"\n\nIn the lead-up to the summit, other Republican candidates had been punching up their faith-based pitches to the Iowa electorate. In a TV ad, Tim Scott said, \"Our rights don't come from a government. They're inalienable. They come from a creator.\" Vivek Ramaswamy insisted that his strong Hindu faith could resonate with Christians who worried about an increasingly secular culture. On a campaign stop in Pella, Ron DeSantis testified about the importance of prayer when his wife had breast cancer. \"God has given us a front-row seat in Iowa,\" Bob Vander Plaats, who runs the Family Leader and is often referred to as the state's evangelical kingmaker, told me. Trump didn't show up to the summit, but Kari Lake , an Iowa native and MAGA surrogate, came as his envoy, appearing throughout the day on Glenn Beck's digital network, BlazeTV, referring to the non-Trump candidates as the B-team. Mike Lindell, the MyPillow C.E.O. and Trump acolyte, lingered outside the auditorium wearing a cross pin and taking selfies. (\"God will be coming back. God is upset with everything,\" Lindell told me, handing out cards for his election-platform convention that he had cut from printer paper.)\n\n\"What we're seeing today is light versus dark-it's spiritual warfare,\" Vander Plaats announced, as Tucker Carlson joined him onstage.\n\n\"There are unseen forces acting on us,\" Carlson responded, in his traditional khakis and blue-and-yellow tie. He went on, \"People aren't really in charge of the arc of history. You are being acted upon. It's important to approach politics with this in mind.\"\n\nHe told the audience he was in the middle of finally reading the Bible on his own, now that he had more free time. \"I can't wait to finish,\" he said.\n\n\"I'll tell you how it ends!\" Vander Plaats said. \"We win.\"\n\nCarlson commenced a series of interviews with the candidates. Pence was introduced as \"the unwavering champion of the unborn,\" but he quickly got derailed. After a few minutes of relitigating whether January 6th was an insurrection or a riot, and whether electronic voting machines could be done away with, Carlson asked Pence about the trip he'd just made to Kyiv to affirm U.S. support for Ukraine. \"You recently met with Zelensky,\" Carlson said. \"Ukraine is persecuting Christians, and I'm wondering if you raised that with him.\" (The notion that Ukraine is corrupt and hostile to Christians has become an America First talking point.) Pence said that an Orthodox priest had reassured him that Zelensky was respecting religious liberty. Carlson put on his confused face. Pence, buffering, offered a platitude about there being no greater priority than religious freedom-other than the sanctity of life. \"It's very clear that the Zelensky government has arrested priests for having views they disagree with,\" Carlson said. \"That's not consistent with religious liberty. It's an attack on it, and we're funding it. I sincerely wonder how a Christian leader could support the arrest of Christians for having different views.\" The crowd booed Pence, and the conversation ended ten minutes early.\n\nPence emerged from the greenroom into a press gaggle waiting outside. Asked why his faith hasn't translated to stronger support in the polls, he said, \"Well, I just announced a month ago-give me some time.\" He went on: \"And I'm actually not making my faith a centerpiece of my campaign. It's the centerpiece of my life, my family.\"\n\n\"Mr. Vice-President, you were just booed at an Evangelical Christian conference,\" a reporter called out at him.\n\n\"Was I?\" Pence said. It wasn't clear whether he was joking or oblivious.\n\nThe group vigorously nodded yes. The reporter said, \"You were, a couple of times. And I just need to ask you, do you find it concerning that maybe the support that you have garnered and counted on over the years from evangelical Christians may be eroding?\"\n\n\"I believe in leadership, not followership,\" Pence said, then headed to a donor brunch with a pro-life doctor.\n\nThe day after the summit, I visited Fort Des Moines Church of Christ to meet Pastor Mike Demastus. A two-year-old's birthday party was happening in the next room, and children with frosting all over their faces came in and out of the church. \"I think we saw the end of a campaign there,\" he told me, of Pence's performance. Demastus has long been part of an effort, led by groups such as Faith Wins, to draw evangelical pastors into right-wing politics, framing elections as spiritual battles. Demastus showed me selfies he'd taken that morning with Ron and Casey DeSantis, and earlier in the year with Trump. \"Every four years they come whispering sweet nothings in our ear,\" he told me. \"I know I'm a tool-I'm the nerd hired to do the jock's homework because they need the evangelical vote. That's their only path through Iowa.\" He texts candidates Scripture while they campaign.\n\nDemastus was unpersuaded by Pence's born-again narrative. \"I don't need Jesus Christ in the Oval Office,\" he said. He was more interested in Vivek Ramaswamy. \"You can be pro-life without being an evangelical,\" he told me. \"Plus, he happened to have hired plenty of evangelical staff.\" Demastus had other doubts.  Pence has been plagued by the view that he didn't step up when he was asked not to certify the 2020 election. \"Some of the evangelical community feels he betrayed his duty by certifying that election for Biden,\" Demastus said. Thomas Kinley, a law student at the summit, told me that a lot of people believed that had Pence made more of an attempt to halt the certification process, \"He'd have a pretty good shot.\" He went on,  \"He doesn't have that dog in him.\"\n\nPence had been accused of wishy-washiness long before January 6th. In 2015, flanked by nuns, monks, and anti-gay activists, Pence, then the governor of Indiana, signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, making it basically legal for businesses to discriminate against L.G.B.T. people. When companies threatened to boycott the state, he signed a less discriminatory version of the bill, a great disappointment to conservative Christians, who saw him as a pushover, more of a frictionless and deferential conduit for the corporate right than a real Christian warrior. \"He backpedalled as soon as he got pushback,\" Demastus said.\n\nIn Pence's telling, his political raison d'être is \"for the babies\"; he wed himself to \"the cause of the unborn\" from the moment that he first ran for office. But all the candidates in Iowa embraced the idea that, as one summit-goer, Debi, who has sixteen children, told me, \"preserving life is not a policy issue for evangelicals. It's a matter of absolute truth.\" Does it matter that Pence, perhaps unlike other candidates, would push for a national ban? Not really, it turns out, especially in a milieu in which many want power to be taken back to the state level. \"The states are capable of handling it,\" the financial adviser told me. Demastus was among many who mentioned that Trump was the only President ever to attend the March for Life. \"Trump gets to wear the mantle of the most pro-life President in our history,\" he said.\n\nMany attendees seemed to have come away with the impression that, although Pence is a man of faith, he lacks a certain resolve-a willingness to fight-which, in their eyes, may be more important than personal piety. \"We are all fallen individuals,\" Vander Plaats told me. \"God has used fallen individuals all the time to accomplish his will. Is President Trump fallen? Of course, but we all are.\" He went on, \"The Scriptures say to be wise as a serpent but innocent as a dove, O.K.? There's a lot of evangelicals who would like to be President, but it doesn't mean that they have the capacity, or that this is their time. Because at the end of the day you also want to win.\"\n\nIn other words, Trump's alliance with evangelicals was secure. The morning after the Family Leadership Summit, Kari Lake hosted a Save America Breakfast for the Marion County G.O.P., in Otley, Iowa. At a clearing in the middle of several cornfields, she made her entrance to a song titled \"81 Million Votes, My Ass,\" referring to the number of votes Joe Biden got in 2020. (Lake released the single, in June, with a group called the Truth Bombers.) \"Pence has done too many things against the faith community,\" Steven Everly, the Republican Party county chairman, wearing a red MAGA cap, told me. \"He talks Christianity, but he doesn't have any courage. I respect liberals with conviction more than him.\" (Everly, too, mentioned Pence's backtrack on the religious-freedom legislation in Indiana.)\n\nGolf carts shuttled people to a tent where the Knights of Columbus were serving pancakes and sausage and handing out Tootsie Rolls. Red Solo cups on each table held sticks of butter. The sheriff, in a polo shirt, went around shaking hands. Emily Peterson, a Christian motivational speaker and the Iowa liaison for Moms for America, wore a tank top that read \"God's children are not for sale\" as she presented a slideshow on Chairman Mao. Helena Hayes, a newly elected Iowa state representative, wearing turquoise earrings, said, \"Straight up, the Lord told me to oppose evil. That's why I ran. We've been weak as Christians for a long time. You can weaponize empathy and compassion. We know that. Trump understands that about Christians, but he doesn't rape them in the process. He follows through.\"\n\nOn Sunday, I went to the Lutheran Church of Hope, in West Des Moines, where the services offered noise-cancelling headphones and took place in front of a beach-themed \"Paradise Awaits\" stage set, hosted by a senior pastor who has a popular podcast called \"Pastor Mike Drop.\" Their worship center, surrounded by a sprawling area of cafes and shops, holds four services every morning. Speakers outside blasted a remix of \"Thunder\" by Imagine Dragons, but with the lyric \"thunder\" changed to \"Jesus\"; teen-agers showed up together in sweatpants.\n\nPence's stiff and sombre pitch of traditional faith can seem archaic at such gatherings, especially when compared with the revival-like energy of a Trump event. \"I've been to eight Trump rallies, and they're more fun than a barrel of monkeys,\" Bob Klaus, of the Good Friday Prayer Breakfast, told me. \"One time, I hauled my motorcycle all the way to Ohio, with the Bikers for Trump. When Trump comes onstage, it's like Elvis.\" It didn't matter to Bob that when Trump was at the Family Leadership Summit in 2015, he said that he's never repented or asked God for forgiveness.\n\nSamuel Perry, a professor at the University of Oklahoma who studies conservative Christianity, told me that \"politics is now driving our religious behaviors,\" not the other way around, which is how \"evangelicals have been able to rationalize strong support for the least religious person you can think of.\" Almost half of white evangelical Christians now attend church only a few times a year. The label is, to Perry's mind, \"becoming emptied of theological conviction, of the assumption of faithful religious practice and devotion.\" Some establishment Republicans might support Pence, but the base of the Republican Party is now composed of populist reactionaries; these voters want \"somebody who fights for Christians, not somebody who fights like a Christian,\" Perry said. \"There is an unending perception that they are being persecuted and that their religious freedom is being attacked and taken away. They see the left as persecutors. The through line is: they will eventually come after you. It's not about your Christian faith. It's 'Can I fight for people like you against the terrifying woke left?' \"\n\nAt the focus group, before the summit began, everyone was, as ever, in agreement that \"the spiritual foundation of the country is crumbling; the morals are sliding.\" Vander Plaats told me, \"The war will be won when Jesus returns, so spiritual warfare will go on till the end of time.\" In the meantime, Pence has much to do to convince his constituency that he can lead this fight. When he ran and lost his first congressional race, the one that he had prayed over with Karen, he writes, in his book, \" So Help Me God ,\" that he had betrayed his own values and let his ambition get the better of him. \"There's a saying in politics: When you're out, you're out. And I was out,\" he wrote. \"The Lord had closed the door.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Danger of President Pence\n\nOn September 14th, the right-wing pundit Ann Coulter, who last year published a book titled \"In Trump We Trust,\" expressed what a growing number of Americans, including conservatives, have been feeling since the 2016 election. The previous day, President Trump had dined with Democratic leaders at the White House, and had impetuously agreed to a major policy reversal, granting provisional residency to undocumented immigrants who came to America as children. Republican legislators were blindsided. Within hours, Trump disavowed the deal, then reaffirmed it. Coulter tweeted, \"At this point, who doesn't want Trump impeached?\" She soon added, \"If we're not getting a wall, I'd prefer President Pence.\"\n\nTrump's swerve did the unthinkable-uniting Coulter and liberal commentators. After Trump threatened to \"totally destroy\" North Korea, Gail Collins, the Times columnist, praised Vice-President Mike Pence as someone who at least \"seems less likely to get the planet blown up.\" This summer, an opinion column by Dana Milbank, of the Washington Post , appeared under the headline \" ' President Pence' is Sounding Better and Better .\"\n\nPence, who has dutifully stood by the President, mustering a devotional gaze rarely seen since the days of Nancy Reagan, serves as a daily reminder that the Constitution offers an alternative to Trump. The worse the President looks, the more desirable his understudy seems. The more Trump is mired in scandal, the more likely Pence's elevation to the Oval Office becomes, unless he ends up legally entangled as well.\n\nPence's odds of becoming President are long but not prohibitive. Of his forty-seven predecessors, nine eventually assumed the Presidency, because of a death or a resignation. After Lyndon Johnson decided to join the ticket with John F. Kennedy, he calculated his odds of ascension to be approximately one in four, and is said to have told Clare Boothe Luce, \"I'm a gambling man, darling, and this is the only chance I've got.\"\n\nIf the job is a gamble for Pence, he himself is something of a gamble for the country. During the tumultuous 2016 Presidential campaign, relatively little attention was paid to how Pence was chosen, or to his political record. And, with all the infighting in the new Administration, few have focussed on Pence's power within the White House. Newt Gingrich told me recently that the three people with the most policy influence in the Administration are Trump, Chief of Staff John Kelly, and Pence. Gingrich went on, \"Others have some influence, such as Jared Kushner and Gary Cohn. But look at the schedule. Pence has lunches with the President. He's in the national-security briefings.\" Moreover, and crucially, Pence is the only official in the White House who can't be fired.\n\nPence, who declined requests for an interview, is also one of the few with whom Trump hasn't overtly feuded. \"The President considers him one of his best decisions,\" Tony Fabrizio, a pollster for Trump, told me. Even so, they are almost comically mismatched. \"You end up with an odd pair of throwbacks from fifties casting,\" the former White House strategist Stephen Bannon joked, comparing them to Dean Martin, the bad boy of the Rat Pack, and \"the dad on 'Leave It to Beaver.' \"\n\nTrump and Pence are misaligned politically, too. Trump campaigned as an unorthodox outsider, but Pence is a doctrinaire ideologue. Kellyanne Conway, the White House counsellor, who became a pollster for Pence in 2009, describes him as \"a full-spectrum conservative\" on social, moral, economic, and defense issues. Pence leans so far to the right that he has occasionally echoed A.C.L.U. arguments against government overreach; he has, for instance, supported a federal shield law that would protect journalists from having to identify whistle-blowers. According to Bannon, Pence is \"the outreach guy, the connective tissue\" between the Trump Administration and the most conservative wing of the Republican establishment. \"Trump's got the populist nationalists,\" Bannon said. \"But Pence is the base. Without Pence, you don't win.\"\n\nPence has taken care to appear extraordinarily loyal to Trump, so much so that Joel K. Goldstein, a historian and an expert on Vice-Presidents who teaches law at St. Louis University, refers to him as the \"Sycophant-in-Chief.\" But Pence has the political experience, the connections, the discipline, and the ideological mooring that Trump lacks. He also has a close relationship with the conservative billionaire donors who have captured the Republican Party's agenda in recent years.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump characterized the Republican Party's big spenders as \"highly sophisticated killers\" whose donations allowed them to control politicians. When he declared his candidacy, he claimed that, because of his real-estate fortune, he did not need support from \"rich donors,\" and he denounced super pac s, their depositories of unlimited campaign contributions, as \"corrupt.\" Pence's political career, though, has been sponsored at almost every turn by the donors whom Trump has assailed. Pence is the inside man of the conservative money machine.\n\nOn Election Night, the dissonance between Trump's populist supporters and Pence's billionaire sponsors was quietly evident. When Trump gave his acceptance speech, in the ballroom of the Hilton Hotel in midtown Manhattan, he vowed to serve \"the forgotten men and women of our country,\" and promised to \"rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, and hospitals.\" Upstairs, in a room reserved for Party élites, several of the richest and most conservative donors, all of whom support drastic reductions in government spending, were celebrating. Doug Deason, a Texas businessman and a political donor, recalled to me, \"It was amazing. In the V.I.P. reception area, there was an even more V.I.P. room, and I counted at least eight or nine billionaires.\"\n\nDeason's father, Darwin, founded a data-processing company, Affiliated Computer Services, and in 2010 he sold it to Xerox for $6.4 billion. A.C.S. was notorious for outsourcing U.S. office work to cheaper foreign-labor markets. Trump campaigned against outsourcing, but the Deasons became Trump backers nonetheless, donating a million dollars to his campaign. Doug Deason was enlisted, in part, by Pence, whom he had known and supported for years. \"Mike and I are pretty good friends,\" Deason said, adding, \"He's really the contact to the big donors.\" Since the election, Deason has attended two dinners for wealthy backers at the Vice-Presidential residence.\n\nLink copied\n\nAmong the billionaires who gathered in the room at the Hilton, Deason recalled, were the financier Wilbur Ross, whom Trump later appointed his Secretary of Commerce; the corporate investor Carl Icahn, who became a top adviser to Trump but resigned eight months later, when allegations of financial impropriety were published by The New Yorker ; Harold Hamm, the founder and chairman of Continental Resources, an Oklahoma-based oil-and-gas company that has made billions of dollars through fracking; and David Koch, the richest resident of New York City.\n\nKoch's presence was especially unexpected. He and his brother Charles are libertarians who object to most government spending, including investments in infrastructure. They co-own virtually all of Koch Industries, the second-largest private company in the United States, and have long tapped their combined fortune-currently ninety billion dollars-to finance candidates, think tanks, pressure groups, and political operatives who support an anti-tax and anti-regulatory agenda, which dovetails with their financial interests.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump said that Republican rivals who attended secretive donor summits sponsored by the Kochs were \"puppets.\" The Kochs, along with several hundred allied donors, had amassed nearly nine hundred million dollars to spend on the Presidential election, but declined to support Trump's candidacy. At one point, Charles Koch described the choice between Trump and Hillary Clinton as one between \"cancer or heart attack.\"\n\nMarc Short, the head of legislative affairs in the Trump White House, credits Pence for the Kochs' rapprochement with Trump. \"The Kochs were very excited about the Vice-Presidential pick,\" Short told me. \"There are areas where they differ from the Administration, but now there are many areas they're partnering with us on.\" Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, who has accused the Kochs of buying undue influence, particularly on environmental policy-Koch Industries has a long history of pollution-is less enthusiastic about their alliance with Pence. \"If Pence were to become President for any reason, the government would be run by the Koch brothers-period. He's been their tool for years,\" he said. Bannon is equally alarmed at the prospect of a Pence Presidency. He told me, \"I'm concerned he'd be a President that the Kochs would own.\"\n\nThis summer, I visited Pence's home town of Columbus, Indiana. Harry McCawley, a retired editor at the Republic , the local newspaper, told me, \"Mike Pence wanted to be President practically since he popped out of the womb.\" Pence exudes a low-key humility, but, McCawley told me, \"he's very ambitious, even calculating, about the steps he'll take toward that goal.\"\n\nMcCawley, who died, of cancer, in September, knew the Pence family well, in part because the Vice-President's mother, Nancy Pence Fritsch, wrote a chatty column for the newspaper for several years (\" memories blossom with arrival of spring \"). Eighty-four and energetic, Fritsch met me for coffee this summer, along with her eldest son, Gregory, who is in the antiques business in the Columbus area. Like the Vice-President, they are good-looking, with chiselled features, and have an unpretentious, amiable manner. They ribbed each other as they reminisced about the years when the Pences' six children lived with their parents in a series of modest houses. There was so little to do in the way of entertainment, Gregory Pence recalled, that \"we sometimes got in the car with our parents on Friday nights and followed after the fire truck.\" All the boys had nicknames. \"My name was General Harassment,\" Gregory said. \"Michael's was Bubbles, because he was chubby and funny.\"\n\n\"Michael's hilarious,\" his mother agreed. \"I attribute it to the Irish. We're faith-filled, and have a good sense of humor.\" The family identifies as Catholic, and Mike was an altar boy. \"Religion is the most important thing in our lives,\" she said. \"But we don't take it seriously. I don't proselytize.\"\n\nPence's maternal grandfather was from Ireland, but his paternal grandfather, Edward Joseph Pence, Sr., came from a German family. Brief mentions of Edward in the press have described him as having worked in the Chicago stockyards, leaving the impression that he was poor. But Gregory told me that Edward was well off, with a seat on the Chicago Stock Exchange. \"Grandfather Pence was a very hard man,\" Gregory said. Edward refused to provide financial support when Gregory and Mike's father, Edward, Jr., went to college; an aunt loaned him the tuition, but he had to leave law school when he ran out of money. \"Grampa Pence was a gambler!\" Fritsch chimed in. \"He played cards and went to Las Vegas.\"\n\nFritsch went to secretarial school. With a laugh, she recalled that she met her first husband \"in a club-in other words, a tavern.\" A Korean War veteran, Edward Pence, Jr., was in uniform that night. (He had won a Bronze Star, which the Vice-President keeps in his office.) In 1959, after leaving law school, he moved with Fritsch from Chicago to Columbus, where he sold fuel to gas stations, farms, and convenience stores. Shortly after their arrival, Michael Pence, the couple's third child, was born.\n\nFritsch said of life in Indiana, \"I hated it. I always looked forward to going back to Chicago.\" But the family stayed, gradually moving into the upper middle class-Edward became part owner of an oil distributorship-and switching from the Democratic to the Republican Party. Fritsch had worshipped the Kennedys, but, she said, \"I guess I became a Republican because my husband was one. I was a Stepford wife.\"\n\n\"She was like the Scarecrow in ' The Wizard of Oz ,' \" Gregory said at one point.\n\n\"You see what I have to put up with?\" she shot back. Growing more serious, she explained that, until she went back to school, at sixty-five, to get a college degree in psychology, she \"didn't have much self-esteem.\"\n\n\" That's when she got her brain,\" Gregory said.\n\nEdward, Jr., like his father, was a tough disciplinarian. Gregory recalled, \"If you lied to him, you'd be taken upstairs, have a conversation, and then he'd whack you with a belt.\" He expected his children to stand up whenever an adult entered the room. \"He'd grab you if you didn't,\" Gregory said. At dinner, the kids were forbidden to speak.\n\nWhile Gregory was in college, he was sleeping late on a visit home when his father pulled the covers off him and told him to get up for church. \"I said he couldn't tell me what to do anymore, because he was only paying half my college tuition,\" Gregory said. His father stopped paying his tuition altogether. \"He was black and white,\" Gregory said. \"You were never confused where you stood. My brother's a lot like him.\"\n\nColumbus, which has a population of forty-five thousand, was dominated by a major engine manufacturer, Cummins, and escaped the economic woes that afflicted many other parts of the region. But McCawley, the newspaper editor, told me that, while Pence was growing up, Columbus, \"like many Indiana communities, still had vestiges of the Ku Klux Klan.\" The group had ruled the state's government in the twenties, and then gone underground. In Columbus, landlords refused to rent or sell homes to African-Americans until Cummins's owners demanded that they do so. Gregory Pence insisted that the town \"was not racist,\" but contended that there had been anti-Catholic prejudice. Protestant kids had thrown stones at him, he recalled. \"We were discriminated against,\" Pence's mother added.\n\nThe Pence children attended St. Columba Catholic School through eighth grade. Mike discovered a talent for public speaking that made him a favorite with the nuns. In fifth grade, he won a local oratory contest, defeating kids several years older. \"When it came his turn, his voice just boomed out over the audience,\" his mother told the newspaper. \"He just blew everybody away.\" In high school, Pence won third place in a national contest. When his mother recalled Mike as \"a good student,\" Gregory said, \"Not a fabulous one. I don't think he stood out. He was class president, but that wasn't cool.\" Nonetheless, by senior year, Mike was talking to classmates about becoming President of the United States.\n\nMike Pence attended Hanover College, a liberal-arts school in southeast Indiana. On a visit home, he told his father that he was thinking of either joining the priesthood or attending law school. His father suggested he start with law; he could always join the priesthood later. Shortly thereafter, to his family's surprise, Pence became an evangelical Christian. His mother said that \"college gave him a different viewpoint.\" The story Pence tells is that he was in a fraternity, and when he admired another member's gold cross he was told, \"You have to wear it in your heart before you wear it around your neck.\" Soon afterward, Pence has said, he attended a Christian music festival in Kentucky and \"gave my life to Jesus.\"\n\nHis conversion was part of a larger movement. In 1979, during Pence's junior year in college, Jerry Falwell founded the Moral Majority, to mobilize Christian voters as a political force. Pence voted for Jimmy Carter in 1980, but he soon joined the march of many Christians toward the Republican Party. The Moral Majority's co-founder, Paul Weyrich, a Midwestern Catholic, established numerous institutions of the conservative movement, including the Heritage Foundation and the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of far-right congressional members, which Pence eventually led. Weyrich condemned homosexuality, feminism, abortion, and government-imposed racial integration, and he partnered with some controversial figures, including Laszlo Pasztor, a former member of a pro-Nazi party in Hungary. When Weyrich died, in 2008, Pence praised him as a \"friend and mentor\" and a \"founding father of the modern conservative movement,\" from whom he had \"benefitted immeasurably.\"\n\nWhile in law school, at Indiana University, Pence met and married Karen Batten, a schoolteacher whom he had noticed playing guitar in a church service. A friend at the time, Dan LeClerc, told me, \"He was head over heels.\" Pence took her ice-skating; she made him taco salad for dinner. Soon, anticipating a proposal, she began carrying in her purse a gold cross with the inscription \"Yes.\" Eight months after they began dating, he asked her to marry him, having buried a ring box in a loaf of bread that he'd brought on a walk, ostensibly to feed ducks. They shellacked the loaf. Pence's friends have called Karen his \"prayer warrior.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nThe couple became almost inseparable. One Christmas, she gave him an antique red phone, connected to a \"hotline\" whose number only she knew. As the Washington Post reported , he kept it on his office desk long after the advent of cell phones. At home, they worked out on twin treadmills. And, as Rolling Stone reported in January , he referred to her in front of guests as \"Mother.\" Pence's office has disputed the account, but a former Indiana Democratic Party official told me, \"I've heard him call her Mother myself.\" Pence also began observing what's known as the Billy Graham rule, meaning that he never dined alone with another woman, or attended an event in mixed company where alcohol was served unless his wife was present. Critics have argued that this approach reduces women to sexual temptresses and precludes men from working with women on an equal basis. A Trump campaign official said that he found the Pences' dynamic \"a little creepy.\" But Kellyanne Conway defended him vigorously, telling me, \"I've been a female top adviser of his for years, and never felt excluded or dismissed.\" She went on, \"Most wives would appreciate a loyal husband who puts them first. People are trying to bloody and muddy him, but talk about narrow-minded-to judge his marriage!\"\n\nIn 1987, a year after Pence graduated from law school, LeClerc, his old friend, was asked by a mutual acquaintance, \"Guess who's running for Congress?\" He drew a blank. Pence's decision, at the age of twenty-nine, to challenge a popular incumbent Democratic congressman surprised many people, including his father, Edward, who thought that it was silly, given that Mike was a young newlywed with no steady job. But after Mike entered the race Edward became his biggest booster, helping him raise money and put up lawn signs. Then, just a few weeks before the Republican primary, Edward, who was fifty-eight, had a heart attack and died. Mike won the primary, but the Democratic incumbent, Phil Sharp, was reëlected.\n\nIn 1990, Pence tried and failed again to unseat Sharp, waging a campaign that is remembered as especially nasty. One ad featured an actor dressed in Middle Eastern garb and sunglasses, who accused Sharp, falsely, of being a tool of Arab oil interests. But Pence's campaign foundered after the press revealed that he had used donations toward personal expenses, such as his mortgage and groceries. It wasn't technically illegal, but it violated the trust of his supporters and sullied his pious image. \"Mike burned a lot of bridges,\" Gregory recalled. \"He upset a lot of his backers. It was partly because of immaturity, but he really was kind of full of shit.\"\n\nThe following year, Mike Pence wrote an essay, carried by local newspapers, titled \"Confessions of a Negative Campaigner,\" in which he said, \"A campaign ought to demonstrate the basic human decency of the candidate.\" He admitted to reporters that he had violated this standard, and said that he had no \"interest in running for elected office in the foreseeable future,\" but added that if he ever did he would not wage a negative campaign. \"I think he realized he'd besmirched himself,\" Sharp told me. \"He comes across as Midwestern nice, but it was mean and shallow.\" Sharp, who after two more terms joined the faculty at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, and is now semi-retired, remains unimpressed by Pence. \"This is not a person, in my limited exposure, about whom I'd ever say, 'Wow, he should be President!' \"\n\nPence took a job at a law firm in Indianapolis, where he handled mainly small-claims and family cases, and started each day by praying with colleagues. An Indiana attorney recalled, \"He was a big, jocular, friendly guy who would put his arm around you at the local pub. He probably weighed a hundred pounds more than today.\" There was a clear hierarchy in the Indianapolis legal world, and Pence was far from its top rungs, relying on referrals for work. \"There were dozens of guys like that,\" the lawyer said. \"But the great American story is that a guy like Mike Pence is now Vice-President.\"\n\nGregory said of his brother, \"Law wasn't really his thing,\" adding, \"He's completely unmotivated by money. I don't think he would think for one second about it, if it weren't for Karen.\"\n\n\"Service is his motivation,\" Pence's mother said.\n\n\"And, of course, popularity,\" his brother added. \"He had ambitions.\"\n\nPence was thrown a lifeline in 1991, when he was offered a job as president of the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, a tiny new think tank that promoted free-market policies. Pence joked that some people called the foundation \"an old-folks home for unsuccessful candidates,\" but it gave him a steady paycheck and valuable exposure to the burgeoning universe of business-funded conservative nonprofit groups. The foundation was part of the State Policy Network, a national web of organizations that had been launched at Ronald Reagan's suggestion. It was designed to replicate at a more local level the Heritage Foundation's successful promotion of conservative policies. One of the State Policy Network's founders, Thomas Roe, a construction magnate with strong anti-union views, was said to have told a Heritage board member, \"You capture the Soviet Union-I'm going to capture the states.\"\n\nIn a 2008 speech, Pence described himself as \"part of what we called the seed corn Heritage Foundation was spreading around the country in the state think-tank movement.\" It isn't fully clear whose money was behind the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, because think tanks, as nonprofits, don't have to disclose their donors. But the early funders of the Heritage Foundation included some Fortune 500 companies, in fields such as oil, chemicals, and tobacco, that opposed health, safety, and environmental regulations.\n\nCecil Bohanon, one of two adjunct scholars at Pence's think tank, had a history of financial ties to tobacco-company front groups, and in 2000 Pence echoed industry talking points in an essay that argued, \"Smoking doesn't kill. In fact, two out of every three smokers doesn't die from a smoking-related illness.\" A greater \"scourge\" than cigarettes, he argued, was \"big government disguised as do-gooder, healthcare rhetoric.\" Bohanon, who still writes for the think tank's publication, also has ties to the Kochs. Last year, John Hardin, the head of university relations for the Charles Koch Foundation, told an Indiana newspaper that the Kochs had been funding Bohanon's work as a professor of free-market economics at Ball State University \"for years.\"\n\nEven as Pence argued for less government interference in business, he pushed for policies that intruded on people's private lives. In the early nineties, he joined the board of the Indiana Family Institute, a far-right group that supported the criminalization of abortion and campaigned against equal rights for homosexuals. And, while Pence ran the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, it published an essay arguing that unmarried women should be denied access to birth control. \"What these people are really after is contraceptives,\" Vi Simpson, the former Democratic minority leader of the Indiana State Senate, told me. In 2012, after serving twenty-eight years in the legislature, she ran for lieutenant governor on a ticket with the gubernatorial candidate John R. Gregg, who lost the election to Pence. Simpson believes that Pence wants to reverse women's economic and political advances. \"He's on a mission,\" she said.\n\nPence's true gift was not as a thinker but as a talker. In 1992, he became a host on conservative talk radio, which had been booming since the F.C.C., in 1987, repealed the Fairness Doctrine and stopped requiring broadcasters to provide all sides of controversial issues. At a time when bombastic, angry voices proliferated, Pence was different. Like Reagan, who had become his political hero, he could present even extreme positions in genial, nonthreatening terms. \"I'm a conservative, but I'm not mad about it,\" he liked to say. He welcomed guests of all political stripes, and called himself \"Rush Limbaugh on decaf.\"\n\n\"His radio career gave him great statewide name recognition,\" Jeff Smulyan, the C.E.O. of Emmis Communications, on whose radio stations Pence's program aired, said. \"He's likable, and a great self-promoter.\" Smulyan, a Democrat, added, \"I'm not sure how he'd fare in a detailed policy debate, but Mike knows what Mike believes.\" In 1994, Pence was on eighteen Emmis stations, five days a week. By then, he'd lost weight and had three children; he'd also amassed a Rolodex full of conservative connections and established a national network of wealthy funders. In 2000, when a Republican congressman in northern Indiana vacated his seat, Pence ran as the Party favorite, on a platform that included a promise to oppose \"any effort to recognize homosexuals as a discrete and insular minority entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws.\" He won, by a twelve-point margin.\n\nOnce Pence got to Washington, Conway said, his background \"in the think-tank-slash-media axis really equipped him to defend and explain an argument in a full-throated way.\" Pence was in demand on the conservative speaking circuit, and frequently appeared on Sunday talk shows. \"He was invited to Heritage, gun owners' groups, property-rights groups, pro-life groups, and pro-Israel groups,\" Conway recalled. \"People started to see an authentic, affable conservative who was not in a bad mood about it.\" Michael Leppert, a Democratic lobbyist in Indiana, saw Pence differently. \"His politics were always way outside the mainstream,\" Leppert said. \"He just does it with a smile on his face instead of a snarl.\"\n\nPence served twelve years in Congress, but never authored a single successful bill. His sights, according to Leppert, were always \"on the national ticket.\" He gained attention by challenging his own party's leaders, both in Congress and in the George W. Bush Administration, from the right. He broke with the vast majority of his Republican peers by opposing Bush's expansion of Medicaid coverage for prescription drugs, along with the No Child Left Behind initiative and the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the government's emergency bailout of banks. Conway calls him \"a rebel with a cause.\" In 2004, the House's most conservative members elected him to head their caucus, the Republican Study Committee. Pence joked that the group was so alien to the Party's mainstream that running it was like leading a \"Star Trek\" convention. \"He was as far right as you could go without falling off the earth,\" Mike Lofgren, a former Republican congressional staff member, who has become a Trump critic, told me. \"But he never really put a foot wrong politically. Beneath the Bible-thumping earnestness was a calculating and ambitious pol.\"\n\nIn 2006, Pence boldly challenged the House Minority Leader at the time, John Boehner , a more centrist Republican from Ohio, for his post. Pence got wiped out, but in 2008 Boehner-perhaps trying to contain Pence's ambition-asked him to serve as the Republican Conference chair, the Party's third-highest-ranking post in the House. The chair presides over weekly meetings in which Republican House members discuss policy and legislative goals. Pence used the platform to set the Party's message on a rightward course, raise money, and raise his profile.\n\nAfter Barack Obama was elected President, Pence became an early voice of the Tea Party movement, which opposed taxes and government spending with an angry edge. Pence's tone grew more militant, too. In 2011, he made the evening news by threatening to shut down the federal government unless it defunded Planned Parenthood. Some Hoosiers were unnerved to see footage of Pence standing amid rowdy protesters at a Tea Party rally and yelling, \"Shut it down!\" His radicalism, however, only boosted his national profile. Pence became best known for fiercely opposing abortion. He backed \"personhood\" legislation that would ban it under all circumstances, including rape and incest, unless a woman's life was at stake. He sponsored an unsuccessful amendment to the Affordable Care Act that would have made it legal for government-funded hospitals to turn away a dying woman who needed an abortion. (Later, as governor of Indiana, he signed a bill barring women from aborting a physically abnormal fetus; the bill also required fetal burial or cremation, including after a miscarriage. A federal judge recently found the law unconstitutional.)\n\nPence's close relationship with dozens of conservative groups, including Americans for Prosperity, the Kochs' top political organization, was crucial to his rise. A key link to these groups was provided by Marc Short, the current White House official, who in 2008 became Pence's chief of staff at the Republican Conference. Short had grown up in moneyed conservative circles in Virginia, where his father had helped finance the growth of the Republican Party, and he had run a group for conservative students, Young America's Foundation, and spent several years as a Republican Senate aide before joining Pence's staff. His wife, as it happened, worked for the Charles Koch Foundation, and he admired the brothers' anti-government ideology. A former White House colleague described Short to me as \"a pod person\" who \"really delivered Pence to the Kochs.\"\n\nIn June, 2009, Short brokered Pence's first invitation to address a Koch \"seminar,\" as the brothers call their secretive semi-annual fund-raising sessions for top conservative donors. The theme of the gathering, in Aspen, Colorado, was \"Understanding and Addressing Threats to American Free Enterprise and Prosperity.\" Pence's speech was a hit. Short told me, \"I've never seen someone who can take a complex subject and distill it in a heartbeat like he can.\" He'd also never seen \"anyone who is as dedicated a public servant, and lives their faith as Mike does.\" Short, who is a devout Christian, said, \"People often profess faith that's not lived out, but with him it's lived out each and every day. It guides him. It's his core.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nThe Kochs, who are not religious, may have been focussed more on pocketbook issues than on Pence's faith. According to Scott Peterson, the executive director of the Checks & Balances Project, a watchdog group that monitors attempts to influence environmental policy, Pence was invited to the Koch seminar only after he did the brothers a major political favor. By the spring of 2009, Koch Industries, like other fossil-fuel companies, felt threatened by growing support in Congress for curbing carbon emissions, the primary cause of climate change. Americans for Prosperity devised a \"No Climate Tax\" pledge for candidates to sign, promising not to spend any government funds on limiting carbon pollution. At first, the campaign languished, attracting only fourteen signatures. The House, meanwhile, was moving toward passage of a \"cap and trade\" bill, which would charge companies for carbon pollution. If the bill were enacted, the costs could be catastrophic to Koch Industries, which releases some twenty-four million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere a year, and owns millions of acres of untapped oil reserves in Canada, plus coal-fired power plants and oil refineries.\n\nPence, who had called global warming \"a myth\" created by environmentalists in their \"latest Chicken Little attempt to raise taxes,\" took up the Kochs' cause. He not only signed their pledge but urged others to do so as well. He gave speeches denouncing the cap-and-trade bill-which passed the House but got held up in the Senate-as a \"declaration of war on the Midwest.\" His language echoed that of the Koch groups. Americans for Prosperity called the bill \"the largest excise tax in history,\" and Pence called it \"the largest tax increase in American history.\" (Neither statement was true.) He used a map created by the Heritage Foundation, which the Kochs supported, to make his case, and he urged House Republicans to hold \"energy summits\" opposing the legislation in their districts, sending them home over the summer recess with kits to bolster their presentations.\n\nAccording to the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University, after Pence began promoting the Kochs' pledge the number of signatories in the House soared, reaching a hundred and fifty-six. James Valvo, the policy director for Americans for Prosperity, who spearheaded the pledge, told the Reporting Workshop that support from Pence and other Republicans helped \"a scrappy outlier\" become \"the established position.\" The cap-and-trade bill died in the Senate.\n\nShort said that he \"didn't recall the Kochs ever asking for help on the issue,\" adding, \"The Republican Conference believed it was a winning issue because of the impact that the bill would have had on jobs.\" In any event, the pledge marked a pivotal turn in the climate-change debate, cementing Republican opposition to addressing the environmental crisis.\n\nPeterson said that the Checks & Balances Project hadn't detected \"much money going from the Kochs to Pence before he promoted the 'No Climate Tax' pledge.\" Afterward, \"he was the Kochs' guy, and they've been showering him with money ever since.\" Peterson went on, \"He could see a pathway to the Presidency with them behind him.\"\n\nIndeed, by 2011 Pence had reportedly become Charles Koch's favorite potential candidate for President in 2012. Andrew Downs, a political scientist who directs the nonpartisan Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics, in Fort Wayne, said, \"People thought Pence was gearing up for a Presidential run.\" Downs pointed out that when Pence was in Congress \"he probably had a shot at becoming Speaker of the House.\" Downs continued, \"Instead, he spoke at a lot of engagements with a national focus, and visited places like Iowa and New Hampshire. Running for President isn't an idea that just occurred to Mike Pence when he joined the ticket in 2016. It goes back a long way.\"\n\nBut the House of Representatives is a tough platform from which to get elected President. And so, in 2012, after mulling over his national prospects, Pence ran instead for governor of Indiana. \"The conventional wisdom is that he ran for governor so he could check that box, get some executive experience, and then run for President,\" Downs said. Pence won the governor's race, but with only forty-nine per cent of the vote. \"He was scary to the center,\" Bill Oesterle, a co-founder of Angie's List, an Indiana company that collates user reviews of local contractors, said. Oesterle, a Republican, contributed a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to Pence's campaign. David Koch contributed two hundred thousand dollars.\n\nPence's commitment to the Kochs was now ironclad. Short, his former chief of staff, had become a top operative for the Kochs, earning upward of a million dollars a year as president of the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the brothers' Virginia-based membership group for big conservative donors. It served as a dark-money bank, enabling donors to stay anonymous while distributing funds to favored campaigns and political organizations. (During the past decade, the group has pooled an estimated billion and a half dollars in contributions.) The Kochs' national political network, which had offices in nearly every state, became the most powerful and best-financed private political machine in the country. At least four other former Pence staffers followed Short's lead and joined the Koch network, including Emily Seidel, who joined Freedom Partners, and Matt Lloyd, who became a Koch Industries spokesman. In 2014, a Republican strategist told Politico that \"the whole Koch operation\" had become \"the shadow headquarters of Pence for President.\"\n\nPence's tenure as governor nearly destroyed his political career. He had promised Oesterle and other members of the state's Republican business establishment that he would continue in the path of his predecessor, Mitch Daniels, a well-liked fiscal conservative who had called for a \"truce\" on divisive social issues. \"Pence was very accommodating,\" Oesterle said. But after he was elected he began taking controversial far-right stands that, critics believed, were geared more toward building his national profile than toward serving Indiana voters.\n\nAt first, Pence highlighted fiscal conservatism. In 2013, he proposed cutting the state income tax. An internal report by Americans for Prosperity described the proposal as an example of the Kochs' \"model states\" program \"in action.\" Indiana Republicans, who had majorities in both legislative chambers, initially balked at the tax cut, deeming it irresponsible. But Americans for Prosperity acted as a force multiplier for Pence, much as it is now promising to do for Trump's proposed federal tax cuts. The group mounted an expensive campaign that included fifty rallies, two six-figure television-ad blitzes, and phone-bank calls and door-to-door advocacy in fifty-three of Indiana's ninety-two counties. Eventually, the legislature went along with what Pence often describes as \"the largest income-tax cut in the state's history,\" even though Indiana already had one of the lowest income taxes in the country, and had cut it only once before. Trump has recently described Pence's record as a template for the White House's tax plan, saying, \"Indiana is a tremendous example of the prosperity that is unleashed when we cut taxes.\" But, in the view of Andrew Downs, the Indiana political scientist, \"the tax cuts were fairly meaningless.\" Residents earning fifty thousand dollars a year received a tax cut of about $3.50 per month. Pence claimed that the cut stimulated the economy, but John Zody, the chairman of the state's Democratic Party, told me, \"Our per-capita income is thirty-eighth in the nation, and not climbing.\" The state recently had to increase its gas tax by ten cents per gallon, to repair its crumbling infrastructure.\n\nIn a few surprising instances, Pence veered from conservative orthodoxy. In 2014, he broke with many other Republican governors and agreed to expand Medicaid in Indiana. He declared that his proposal was \"the kind of health-care reform that puts working Hoosiers in the driver's seat.\" He was no fan of Obamacare: when it passed, he likened the blow to 9/11. Nevertheless, Pence negotiated with the Obama Administration and established waivers that made the expansion acceptable to him. Among other things, all Indiana residents were required to demonstrate \"personal responsibility\" by paying something toward the cost of their medical services. Critics argued that such measures were needlessly punitive toward poor residents. Americans for Prosperity, which objects to any form of government health care, gently reproached Pence for \"meeting Washington's demands.\" But the Medicaid-expansion plan was, and remains, popular in the state.\n\nAfter this apostasy, Pence tilted back toward the right. At the last minute, he killed an application for an eighty-million-dollar federal grant to start a statewide preschool program. Education officials in Pence's own administration favored the grant, but conservative opponents of secular public education had complained. When reporters asked Pence about his decision, he said only that the federal government had attached \"too many strings.\" But, as Matthew Tully, a columnist at the Indianapolis Star , wrote , \"he could not name one.\" Eventually, after widespread criticism, Pence reapplied for the grant. Tully concluded that Pence had a \"fatal flaw\"-he was \"too political and ideological\" to be a good governor. \"His focus was on the next step up, not the job at hand,\" Tully wrote.\n\nPolitical handicappers noticed that Pence was spending a lot of time taking trips to states with important Presidential primaries and mingling with big out-of-state donors. In the summer of 2014, Pence spoke at an Americans for Prosperity summit in Dallas. At the event, he stood by Short's side and declared himself \"grateful to have enjoyed\" David Koch's support. That fall, Pence reached out to Nick Ayers, a young, sharp-elbowed political consultant, to see if he would help him in a 2016 Presidential run. Nothing came of it, but Pence clearly had White House ambitions.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, Pence signed a bill called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which he presented as innocuous. \"He said it protected religious freedom, and who's against that?\" Oesterle recalled. But then a photograph of the closed signing session surfaced. It showed Pence surrounded by monks and nuns, along with three of the most virulently anti-gay activists in the state. The image went viral. Indiana residents began examining the law more closely, and discovered that it essentially legalized discrimination against homosexuals by businesses in the state.\n\n\"The No. 1 challenge we face in Indiana is the ability to attract and retain talented people,\" Oesterle said. \"If the state is seen as bigoted to certain members of the community, it makes the job monumentally harder.\" The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Oesterle said, \"was not an issue of Pence's creation\"-it had \"gurgled out\" of the far-right fringe of the Indiana legislature. But, he added, \"there was a lack of leadership.\" In his view, Pence should have prevented it and other extreme bills from moving forward. \"You can see it happening in Washington now,\" Oesterle said. \"He's not that effective a leader, or administrator. Extremists grabbed the initiative.\"\n\nThe outcry over the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was enormous. Gay-rights groups condemned the bill and urged boycotts of the state. Pete Buttigieg, the young gay mayor of South Bend, who is a rising figure in the Democratic Party, told me that he tried to talk to Pence about the legislation, which he felt would cause major economic damage to Indiana. \"But he got this look in his eye,\" Buttigieg recalled. \"He just inhabits a different reality. It's very difficult for him to lay aside the social agenda. He's a zealot.\"\n\nIn an effort to quell criticism, Pence consented, against the advice of his staff, to be interviewed by George Stephanopoulos on his Sunday-morning show on ABC. Stephanopoulos asked him five times if it was now legal in Indiana for businesses to discriminate against homosexuals, and each time Pence was evasive. Pence also sidestepped when Stephanopoulos asked him if he personally supported discrimination against gays. \"What killed him was his unwillingness to take a clear position,\" Oesterle said. \"You saw the conflict between his ideology and his ambition. If he'd just said, 'Look, I think people should have the right to fire gay people,' he would have been labelled a rigid ideologue, but he wouldn't have been mocked.\"\n\nSmulyan, the broadcasting executive, began getting calls from acquaintances all over the country, asking what was wrong with Indiana. The hashtag #BoycottIndiana appeared on Twitter's list of trending topics, and remained there for days. Alarmed business executives from many of the state's most prominent companies, including Cummins, Eli Lilly, Salesforce, and Anthem, joined civic leaders in expressing disapproval. Companies began cancelling conventions, and threatening to reverse plans to expand in the state. The Indiana business community foresaw millions of dollars in losses. When the N.C.A.A., which is based in Indianapolis, declared its opposition to the legislation, the pressure became intolerable. Even the Republican establishment turned on Pence. A headline in the Star , published the Tuesday after the Stephanopoulos interview, demanded, \" fix this now .\"\n\nWithin days, the legislature had pushed through a less discriminatory version of the bill, and Pence signed it, before hastily leaving town for the weekend. But he clearly had not anticipated the outrage he'd triggered, and then he had tried to save his career at the expense of his professed principles. Steve Deace, an influential conservative radio host, told me that Pence's reversal was \"almost the worst conservative betrayal I've witnessed in my career.\" He added, \"He had no chance at national office after that, other than getting on the Trump ticket.\" Similarly, Michael Maurer, the owner of the Indianapolis Business Journal , who is a Republican but not a hard-line social conservative, said, \"It just exploded in his face. His polls were terrible. I bet he'd never get elected again in Indiana. But he went from being a likely loser as an incumbent governor to Vice-President of the United States. We're still reeling!\"\n\nPence loyalists rushed in to help. Matt Lloyd, Pence's former congressional staffer, left his communications job with Koch Industries to work with him in Indiana. Ayers, the political operative whom Pence had consulted in 2011 about a Presidential run, became an outside adviser. The state also signed a seven-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-dollar contract with a public-relations firm, Porter Novelli, which proposed running ads featuring gay and lesbian couples posing in front of Indiana landmarks. But Pence's mistake could not be airbrushed away. Lawn signs saying \"Fire Pence!\" began appearing across the state.\n\nLink copied\n\n\"His tenure in Indiana was characterized by a lot of missteps,\" Buttigieg said. \"He was always decent to me, but over all there was a sense that every few months something got bungled. He's definitely not the mastermind behind the curtain that some people suspect.\"\n\nIn 2015, Ed Clere, a Republican state legislator who chaired the House Committee on Public Health, became aware of a spike in the number of H.I.V. cases in southern Indiana. The problem appeared to be caused by the sharing of needles among opioid abusers in Scott County, which sits across the Ohio River from Louisville, Kentucky. In a place like Scott County, Clere said, \"typically you'd have no cases, or maybe one a year.\" Now they were getting up to twenty a week. The area was poor, and woefully unprepared for a health crisis. (Pence's campaign against Planned Parenthood had contributed to the closure of five clinics in the region; none had performed abortions, but all had offered H.I.V. testing.) That same year, the state health commissioner called Indiana's H.I.V. outbreak a public-health emergency.\n\nClere came of age during the AIDS crisis, and had read Randy Shilts's best-selling account, \"And the Band Played On.\" He tried to get the legislature to study the possibility of legalizing a syringe exchange, which he felt \"was a matter of life and death,\" and could \"save lives quickly and inexpensively.\"\n\nBut conservatives blocked the idea, and Pence threatened to veto any such legislation. \"With Pence, you need to look at the framework, which is abstinence,\" Clere said. \"It's the same as with giving teen-agers condoms. Conservatives think it promotes the behavior, even though it's a scientifically proven harm-reduction strategy.\" In March, 2015, Clere staged a huge public hearing, in which dozens of experts and sufferers testified about the crisis. Caught flat-footed, Pence scheduled his own event, where he announced that he would pray about the syringe-exchange issue. The next day, he said that he supported allowing an exchange program as an emergency measure, but only on a temporary basis and only in Scott County, with no state funding. Clere told me that he spent \"every last dime of my political capital\" to get the bill through. After Scott County implemented the syringe exchange, the number of new H.I.V. cases fell. But Republican leaders later stripped Clere of his committee chairmanship, a highly unusual event. \"I commend Representative Clere for the efforts to help the state deal with this,\" Kevin Burke, the health officer in neighboring Clark County, told me. \"But he paid a price for it.\"\n\nClere remains bitter about Pence. \"It was all part of his pattern of political expediency,\" he said. \"He was stridently against it until it became politically expedient to support it.\" Clere, a Christian who opposes abortion, told me that he now finds Pence's piety hypocritical. \"He says he's 'pro-life,' \" Clere said. \"But people were dying.\" When Clere was asked whom he would rather have as President-Trump or Pence-he replied, \"I'd take Trump every day of the week, and twice on Sunday.\"\n\nPence likes to say of himself, \"I am a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order.\" But Clere is not alone in questioning Pence's political purity. After the November, 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris, Pence, like several other U.S. governors, issued a controversial executive order barring the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the state. The Archdiocese of Indiana had long been deeply involved in resettling refugees, including Syrians, and was about to welcome a new Syrian family. In the hope of reversing Pence's ban, Joseph Tobin, the bishop of Indianapolis, requested a meeting.\n\nTobin, who has since been elevated to cardinal and become the archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, told me that he emphasized to Pence that the Syrian family was fleeing violence and terror, and had been vetted for nearly two years while living in a Jordanian refugee camp. He also explained that the family had relatives in the area. Tobin brought along a former refugee who now had a good job at an Indiana hotel, as an example of how successful the resettlement process was. Tobin is revered in the Catholic community of Indiana in which Pence grew up. \"I really think he thought it over,\" Tobin said. \"There was some anguish.\" But in the end Pence told him, \"I need to protect the people of the state.\"\n\n\"I respect that,\" Tobin replied. \"But this isn't a threat.\" Pence didn't change his mind. Later that week, the Syrian family was sent to Connecticut. Eventually, federal courts struck down Pence's executive order as discriminatory. I asked Cardinal Tobin if there was a Christian argument in support of turning the refugees away. After a pause, he quietly said, \"No.\"\n\nPence has also been criticized for his treatment of Keith Cooper, a former resident of Elkhart, Indiana, who spent nine years in prison for an armed robbery that he didn't commit. He was released in 2006, but on the condition that he admit guilt, which made it impossible for him to get a decent job. The prosecutor and the Indiana Parole Board, citing DNA evidence and victim recantations, urged Governor Pence to pardon him immediately. But Pence dragged out the process for years. \"He didn't do a thing to help me,\" Cooper told me. Pence finally left the decision to his successor, Governor Eric Holcomb, who is also a Republican. Holcomb granted Cooper a pardon within weeks of taking office. It was the first time in Indiana that a pardon was granted on the basis of innocence, rather than clemency.\n\n\"It was all about Pence's political career,\" Cooper said. \"As a Christian, he's a hypocrite. He wouldn't see me or speak with me. God doesn't turn his back on the truth, but Pence just walked away from the truth. I couldn't move forward in life. I was stuck in a dead-end job.\" Cooper, who was operating a forklift at the time, now cares for his grandchildren. He has become friendly with the robbery victims who mistakenly identified him in a police lineup; they supported his bid for a pardon. \"I forgive them,\" he said. \"They stood up for me.\" He went on, \"I forgive the prosecutor. He wrote a letter. And the parole board? They saw that justice happened. But I don't forgive Mike Pence, and never will. He talks all this God stuff, but he's biased. He hates Muslims, he hates gay people, and he hates minorities. He didn't want to be the first white man in Indiana to pardon an innocent black man.\"\n\nA spokesman for Pence, who declined to be quoted, said Pence believed that Cooper needed to go back to court and face a retrial, instead of seeking a pardon.\n\nPence, seeing his poll numbers plummet, gave up on running for President, and decided to seek a second term as governor. Victory was far from assured. Once again, he faced John Gregg, a folksy Democratic lawyer. In the spring of 2016, polls showed the two in a dead heat.\n\nThe national election, meanwhile, was confounding expectations. As Trump picked up momentum in the Republican primaries, the Koch network became unexpectedly paralyzed. Marc Short pressed the brothers to dedicate their resources to stopping Trump and promoting his rivals. But executives at Koch Industries considered the strategy risky, and the brothers stayed out of the Presidential race. Frustrated, Short quit his job at Freedom Partners and signed on to Marco Rubio's campaign.\n\nThe Indiana primary was on May 3rd. The previous month, Ted Cruz had trounced Trump in Wisconsin, but if Trump could win decisively in Indiana he was virtually certain to secure the nomination. The brain trust behind Trump's Indiana campaign included people whose public images were very different from Pence's. Among them were Roderick Ratcliff, the C.E.O. of Centaur Gaming, the state's largest gaming-and-racetrack business, and Steve Hilbert, a flamboyant entrepreneur who had been a business partner of Trump's. Hilbert had built an insurance empire, Conseco, which had been valued at fifty-two billion dollars before collapsing into bankruptcy. He is currently married to his sixth wife, and has denied reports that they met when she popped out of a cake, topless, at his stepson's bachelor party. In 1998, Hilbert loaned Trump money to buy the General Motors Building, and they had remained friends. In 2013, when Hilbert needed cash, Trump bought Hilbert's Caribbean estate, and Hilbert and Melania Trump made a deal to sell skin-care products.\n\nDespite Pence's straitlaced reputation, he had closer ties with these figures than most people knew. As governor, he proclaimed his opposition to any expansion of the gaming industry, but, though the state had banned political contributions from casino operators, cash had flowed generously to him from such sources, through indirect paths. The state's gaming companies, including Centaur, routed donations to \"soft money\" groups like the Republican Governors Association, which then transferred the money to Pence and other candidates. Pence, meanwhile, used executive orders to quietly grant several of the gambling industry's wishes, such as allowing riverboat casinos to expand onshore.\n\nIn 2016, the largest donor to Pence's gubernatorial campaign was the Republican Governors Association, and some of its major donors were casino companies. An L.L.C. connected to Centaur contributed two hundred thousand dollars to the R.G.A. that year. The casino operator Sheldon Adelson contributed a million dollars. But the single largest donor to the R.G.A. in 2016 was Koch Industries, which contributed more than two million dollars. Nearly all this cash, and much more, was divided between just two gubernatorial races that year, one of which was Indiana's. That spring, David Koch also invited Pence to be a featured guest at a fund-raiser at his Palm Beach mansion, attended by about seventy of the Republican Party's biggest donors.\n\nTrump handily won the Indiana primary. Pence, who had tepidly endorsed Ted Cruz , switched to Trump. Pence's history with Trump, however, was strained. In 2011, Pence had gone to Trump Tower in Manhattan, seeking a campaign donation. Trump brought up some gossip-the wife of Mitch Daniels, the outgoing governor of Indiana, had reportedly left him for another man, then reunited with her husband. According to the Times , Trump announced that he'd never take back a wife who had been unfaithful. Pence reacted stiffly, and their conversation grew awkward. Trump gave Pence a small contribution, but the coarse New York billionaire and the prim Indiana evangelical appeared to be on different wavelengths.\n\nNevertheless, in 2016, political insiders in Indiana began hearing that Pence would welcome a spot on the Trump ticket. \"There was no doubt he'd say yes,\" Tony Samuel, the vice-chair of the Trump campaign in the state, who was a lobbyist for Centaur and other companies, told me. Paul Manafort, who was Trump's campaign chairman at that point, arranged for Trump to meet Pence, and urged Trump to pick him. Pence was seen as a bridge to Christian conservatives, an asset in the Midwest, and a connection to the powerful Koch network. Kellyanne Conway, who had done polling work for the Kochs, pushed for Pence, too, as did Stephen Bannon, although private e-mails recently obtained by BuzzFeed indicate that he considered the choice a Faustian bargain-\"an unfortunate necessity.\"\n\nStill, Trump remained wary. According to a former campaign aide, he was disapproving when he learned how little money Pence had. In 2004, the oil firm that Pence's father had partly owned had filed for bankruptcy. Mike Pence's shares of the company's stock, which he had valued at up to a quarter of a million dollars, became worthless. In 2016, according to a campaign-finance disclosure form, Pence had one bank account, which held less than fifteen thousand dollars.\n\nBut in July Pence found a way to please Trump when he played golf with him at Trump's club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Recognizing that Trump was susceptible to flattery, he told the media that Trump \"beat me like a drum.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nYet, in a phone conversation that I had with Trump during this period, he told me that he was torn about the choice. He noted repeatedly that Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, had been \"loyal\" to him. When I asked Trump if he shared Pence's deeply conservative social views, he became uncharacteristically silent.\n\nTrump came closer to picking Christie than is generally known. On July 11th, Christie appeared at a campaign event with Trump. Afterward, the Trump campaign informed him that the choice was down to him or Pence, so he needed to \"get ready.\" The next day, Trump flew to Indiana to do a campaign event with Pence. A tire on Trump's plane developed a flat, so he and his son Eric, who had accompanied him, decided to stay the night. They joined the Pences for dinner at an Indianapolis restaurant. The foursome emerged looking happy. (Samuel, who was at the restaurant, told me that Trump tipped the chef a couple hundred dollars.)\n\nAt dawn on July 13th, Ivanka and Don, Jr., flew to Indianapolis to join their father for breakfast with the Pences at the governor's mansion. The Times soon reported that Trump had asked Pence if he would accept the job, and that Pence had responded, \"In a heartbeat.\"\n\nBut the next night, according to someone familiar with the details, Trump called Christie and said, \"I've got a question for you. Are you ready?\"\n\n\"Ready for what?\" Christie responded.\n\n\"Ready to do this with me,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Are you offering?\" Christie said.\n\n\"I'm asking you-but you've got to make sure you're ready,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I'm as tough as they come,\" Christie said.\n\n\"O.K.,\" Trump said. \"I'm making the decision tomorrow. Stay by your phone.\"\n\nBut Christie was left hanging for the next three days. He suspected that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner had intervened and turned Trump against him, because years earlier, as a U.S. Attorney, he had prosecuted Kushner's father for tax fraud and other crimes. Conway told me that this theory was wrong, but acknowledged, \"It truly was a tie-almost a jump ball.\"\n\nHoping to break the tie, Christie's detractors made the case that he was politically toxic because of the Bridgegate scandal, in which officials had caused traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge in an act of reprisal against the mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey. Trump began leaning toward Pence. \"I wouldn't say Trump was pushed into it,\" a top Trump campaign aide told me. \"He was led into it. Pence was made the most palatable choice by those around him.\"\n\nBefore Pence's trip to Bedminster, he had asked his brother Gregory to meet him at a Burger King. \"He said, 'Donald Trump wants to talk to me,' \" Gregory recalled. They both knew what it was about. \"I told him, 'You have to go, you have no choice,' \" Gregory said. As he saw it, his brother also had no choice about saying yes, if picked: \"When your party's nominee asks you to be the running mate, you have to do it.\" But it was a gamble. As Gregory put it to me, \"If he lost, he had no money, and he had three kids in college. He took out student loans for the kids. He's got a retirement account, but I was afraid he'd run out of money in just a couple of weeks. He'd have to get a job. He was rolling the dice.\" Some politicians in Indiana were surprised that Trump wanted to pick Pence, who was flailing as governor, and that Pence wanted to run with Trump. \"The one thing you could count on with Pence was interpersonal decency, which made it strange that he joined the Trump ticket, the most indecent ticket any party's ever put together,\" Pete Buttigieg said. \"But, really, he had nowhere else to go. His chances of getting reëlected were fifty-fifty at best.\"\n\nBy July 14th, Trump's aides had leaked that he was about to pick Pence, who had flown to New York for the announcement. But that night, as CNN reported, Trump called his aides to see if he could back out of his decision. The next morning, Trump called Christie and said, \"They're telling me I have to pick him. It's central casting. He looks like a Vice-President.\" A few hours later, Trump announced Pence as his running mate.\n\nSeveral days later, at the Republican National Convention, Newt Gingrich, who had also been passed over for the Vice-Presidency, found himself backstage next to Trump while Pence was giving his acceptance speech. \"Isn't he just perfect?\" Trump asked Gingrich. \"Straight from central casting.\"\n\nThe awkwardness between Pence and Trump didn't entirely dissipate. When the \"Access Hollywood\" tape surfaced, revealing Trump's boast about grabbing women \"by the pussy,\" Karen Pence was horrified. According to a former campaign aide, Pence refused to take Trump's calls and sent him a letter saying that he and Karen, as Christians, were deeply offended by his actions and needed to make an \"assessment\" about whether to remain with the campaign. They urged Trump to pray. When Trump and Pence finally did talk, Pence told him that his wife still had \"huge problems\" with his behavior. But in public Pence was forgiving, saying, \"I am grateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people.\" (A Pence spokesman has denied that there was any friction over the incident.)\n\nPence exceeded expectations in the Vice-Presidential debate, and traversed the Midwest tirelessly. \"He did an amazing job,\" Bannon said. \"Lots of conservative groups had questions about Trump. He answered those questions.\" The Kochs were delighted that one of their favorite politicians had joined the ticket, although, because of Trump's stance against wealthy donors, Pence and the Kochs agreed to cancel a speech that he had been scheduled to give at their donor summit that August. The Kochs continued to withhold financial support from Trump, but Short, the former Koch operative, became a top adviser to Pence on the campaign. Some billionaires in the Kochs' donor network-such as the hedge-fund manager Robert Mercer, who has also financed Bannon's ventures-began backing Trump.\n\nThe Koch network gained even further sway after Trump won the Presidency. Three days after the election, Trump pushed aside Christie, who had been overseeing his transition team, and put Pence in charge, with Short as a top deputy. Trump had promised to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington, but he had no experience governing, and few political contacts. He was also superstitious, and during his campaign he had deflected discussions about post-election staffing, fearing that it would bring bad luck. Christie's team had been quietly gathering résumés and making plans for months, but Pence's team threw out the research, dumping thirty binders of material into the trash. \"Donald Trump ran against the establishment, but there was a vacuum,\" a member of the earlier transition team said. \"Movement conservatives jumped in. There was strong think-tank participation from Heritage and others who saw the opportunity.\"\n\nTrump began to appoint an extraordinary number of officials with ties to the Kochs and to Pence, especially in positions that affected Koch Industries financially, such as those dealing with regulatory, environmental, and fiscal policy. Short, who a few months earlier had tried to enlist the Kochs to stop Trump, joined the White House as its director of legislative affairs. Scott Pruitt, the militantly anti-regulatory attorney general of Oklahoma, who had been heavily supported by the Kochs, was appointed director of the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt, in turn, placed Patrick Traylor, a lawyer for Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies, in charge of the E.P.A.'s enforcement of key anti-pollution laws. As the Times has reported , a document called \"A Roadmap to Repeal,\" written by Koch operatives, has guided the E.P.A.'s reversal of Obama Administration clean-air and climate regulations. Don McGahn, who had done legal work for Freedom Partners, became White House counsel. Betsy DeVos, a billionaire heiress, who had been a major member of the Kochs' donor network and a supporter of Pence, was named Secretary of Education. The new director of the C.I.A. was Mike Pompeo, the congressman who represented Charles Koch's district, in Wichita, Kansas; before Pompeo ran for office, the Kochs had invested in his aerospace business. Pompeo, the former transition-team member said, \"wasn't even on Trump's radar, but he was brought in to meet him and got appointed, like, the next day.\" A recent analysis by the Checks & Balances Project found that sixteen high-ranking officials in the Trump White House had ties to the Kochs. The pattern continued among lower-level political appointees, including in Pence's office, which was stocked with Koch alumni. Pence reportedly consulted with Charles Koch before hiring his speechwriter, Stephen Ford, who previously worked at Freedom Partners.\n\nSenator Whitehouse, the Rhode Island Democrat, believes that the Kochs \"will stick one hundred of their own people into the government-and Trump will never notice.\" As a result, he said, \"the signs of a rapprochement are everywhere.\" Whitehouse continued, \"One by one, all the things that Trump campaigned on that annoyed the Koch brothers are being thrown overboard. And one by one the Koch brothers' priorities are moving up the list.\" Trump's populist, nationalist agenda has largely been replaced by the agenda of the corporate right. Trump has made little effort at infrastructure reform, and he abandoned his support for a \"border-adjustment tax\" after the Koch network spent months campaigning against it, and after Pence and Short discussed it privately with Charles Koch at a meeting in Colorado Springs this summer. Bannon's proposal to create a higher tax bracket for citizens earning upward of five million dollars was dropped. The Kochs enthusiastically support the White House's proposed tax-cut package, which, according to most nonpartisan analyses, will disproportionately benefit the super-rich. (The proposed elimination of the estate tax alone would give the Koch brothers' heirs a windfall of billions of dollars.)\n\nLink copied\n\nAmericans for Prosperity recently announced plans to spend four and a half million dollars on ads that will press three Democratic senators in red states to support the tax cuts. On September 25th, Trump dined at the White House with Tim Phillips, the head of Americans for Prosperity, along with Short and a handful of other conservative activists. After keeping a careful distance from one another during the campaign, Pence and the Kochs reunited openly for the first time on October 13th, when Pence attended a summit of Koch donors in New York. \"They're aligned on tax reform,\" Bannon said. \"The Kochs are a hundred per cent with you, so long as it means cutting taxes for the Kochs. Anything that will help the middle-class people? Forget it.\"\n\nAnother consequence of Trump's choice for Vice-President may be the widening federal investigation into possible connections between his campaign and the Russian government. Before Pence took over the transition team, Christie had warned Trump not to give a high-level job to the retired general Michael Flynn, whose financial ties to foreign interests triggered the investigation. Flynn, whom Obama had fired as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was not on any of the original transition team's long lists for government appointments. Christie considered him too risky.\n\nOn November 11, 2016, Christie was chairing a transition meeting, when, according to four sources, Flynn walked in with an ally, General Keith Kellogg. \"Gentlemen, can I help you?\" Christie asked. Ivanka Trump, who was a member of the transition team's executive council, announced that she had invited them. Christie tried to reclaim control of the meeting, but Ivanka took over. Praising Flynn's \"amazing loyalty to my father,\" she turned to him and asked, \"General, what job do you want?\" A participant at the meeting said, \"It was like Princess Ivanka had laid the sword on Flynn's shoulders and said, 'Rise and go forth.' \" (A source close to Ivanka didn't deny the account, but said that it exaggerated her role, and that she was merely trying to show appreciation for Flynn's support.)\n\nFlynn expressed interest in becoming Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense. Eric Trump, who was also on the team, asked Flynn if he had been out of uniform long enough to head the Pentagon. Flynn said that he could probably get a congressional waiver, but if not he'd settle for national-security adviser.\n\nA few hours later, Christie was deposed. Kushner, he felt, had humiliated him a second time. Bannon, who was given the job of dismissing him, admitted to Christie that Kushner had been against him all along, for personal reasons. In any event, when Pence replaced Christie, the door of the White House was opened to Flynn. On November 17th, after little vetting, Flynn was named Trump's national-security adviser, one of the most sensitive posts in the U.S. government. There is no indication that Pence raised any objections about Flynn to Trump, even after Representative Elijah Cummings, the ranking member on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent Pence a letter warning him about Flynn's questionable ethics: Flynn had failed to disclose that, during the campaign, he had done paid lobbying work for Turkish interests. A member of the original transition team told me, \"Pence left his backbone in Indiana, if he ever had one.\"\n\nWhen reporters later asked Pence why he hadn't heeded Cummings's letter, he said that he'd never seen it. But Cummings produced an e-mail from the transition staff acknowledging his letter and promising to review it carefully. \"Either he read it and ignored our warnings or someone on his team did so,\" Cummings told me. \"Either way, the outcome was horrendous, because President Trump should never have given General Flynn access to our nation's most sensitive and classified information.\"\n\nIt undoubtedly would have cost Pence to take a political stand against the worst instincts of Trump and his family. But had Pence stopped Flynn's appointment Trump might not have become the object of a sprawling special investigation. Phil Sharp, the former Indiana representative, said, \"There's a leadership test here. There are real issues, and a failure to do something he was legally, ethically, and politically responsible for.\" Sharp added, \"It also failed the basic Washington litmus test of self-preservation.\"\n\nPence soon delivered a series of misleading statements about Flynn. On January 15th, as questions about Russian manipulation of the election were mounting, Pence went on CBS and assured the public that, during the transition, Flynn had not discussed the topic of sanctions with the Russian Ambassador. But then the Washington Post reported that the Justice Department had wiretaps of Flynn doing just that. The Justice Department had informed the White House counsel about this well before Pence made his statement. On February 13th, Trump fired Flynn, ostensibly for deceiving Pence, who looked like either a liar or a chump.\n\nThree months later, Trump fired James Comey, the F.B.I. director, who had opened the federal investigation into the Trump campaign's Russian ties. Pence declared that Comey's firing had nothing to do with Trump's displeasure at the Russia investigation. Trump, he said, had merely followed the Justice Department's recommendation. But Trump contradicted Pence within hours, telling NBC's Lester Holt that his anger over the Russia probe led him to dismiss Comey. Further damaging Pence's credibility, the Times revealed that, before Comey's dismissal, Pence had attended a White House meeting where Trump discussed his intention to fire Comey and devised a plan to get the Justice Department to support the move.\n\nSeveral law professors have argued that the Vice-President could be vulnerable to charges of obstructing justice, or \"misprision of a felony,\" for participating in a meeting about shutting down the federal investigation and then providing a false cover story to the public. Pence has hired an outside lawyer, Richard Cullen, and has further strengthened his political armor by hiring Nick Ayers as his chief of staff. Laurence Tribe, a law professor at Harvard, tweeted, \"The VP appears to me to be in what we lawyers have been known to call deep doo-doo.\"\n\nUnlike most Vice-Presidents, Pence has been given no particular portfolio of issues or projects. He's continued to serve as the key contact for conservative groups and campaign donors, and he has tried to help Trump contend with Congress. But Pence was publicly humiliated in July when John McCain, the Republican senator from Arizona, stood on the floor of the Senate, where Pence had been pleading for his vote, and gave a thumbs-down, killing Trump's health-care plan. White House officials had miscalculated, believing that McCain was on their side.\n\n\"What's Pence doing?\" Walter Mondale, who served as Vice-President to Jimmy Carter, asked me recently. \"I ask myself that every day.\" Before taking the job, Mondale got Carter to agree, in writing, that he could attend every meeting and see every memo that the President did. Mondale also requested that his office be moved from the Old Executive Office Building to the West Wing. Subsequent Vice-Presidents have inherited these upgrades, but Mondale felt that all Pence was doing was \"trying not to make an enemy of the President.\" Trump is known to humiliate subordinates, and Mondale noted that Trump often asks Pence to act as a master of ceremonies and introduce him at events, which Mondale finds demeaning. Dan Quayle, who was Vice-President in George H. W. Bush's Administration, praised Pence, whom he has known for many years, for fulfilling the two major duties of a Vice-President: to be supportive and to be prepared. But when I asked Quayle if President Bush had ever asked him to leave the room-as Trump reportedly asked Pence to do, so that he could privately ask Comey to ease up on Flynn-he said, \"Never.\"\n\nMark Knoller, who has covered the White House for CBS since Gerald Ford's Presidency, said of Pence, \"He's the most publicly deferential to his President of any V.P. I can remember.\" At Trump's first full Cabinet meeting, Pence said, \"This is the greatest privilege of my life, to serve as Vice-President to a President who's keeping his word to the American people.\" Pence readily complied when Trump asked him to stage a protest at an N.F.L. game in Indianapolis on October 8th, by leaving the stadium when some players refused to stand for the national anthem. (Pence's trip reportedly cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars.)\n\nIn private, however, Pence has become a back channel for government figures who are frustrated by the impulsiveness and inattention of a President who won't read more than a page or two of bullet points. Erick Erickson, a conservative commentator who admires Pence, told me, \"Everyone knows that Mike Pence can get the job done, and the President can't, but no one can say it.\" According to NBC, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently became so enraged by the President's incompetence that he called him \"a fucking moron\" in front of others, and threatened to quit. In an effort to calm Tillerson, and prevent yet another high-level resignation, Pence reportedly \"counselled\" the Secretary of State on how to manage Trump, suggesting that he criticize him only privately.\n\n\"Trump thinks Pence is great,\" Bannon told me. But, according to a longtime associate, Trump also likes to \"let Pence know who's boss.\" A staff member from Trump's campaign recalls him mocking Pence's religiosity. He said that, when people met with Trump after stopping by Pence's office, Trump would ask them, \"Did Mike make you pray?\" Two sources also recalled Trump needling Pence about his views on abortion and homosexuality. During a meeting with a legal scholar, Trump belittled Pence's determination to overturn Roe v. Wade. The legal scholar had said that, if the Supreme Court did so, many states would likely legalize abortion on their own. \"You see?\" Trump asked Pence. \"You've wasted all this time and energy on it, and it's not going to end abortion anyway.\" When the conversation turned to gay rights, Trump motioned toward Pence and joked, \"Don't ask that guy-he wants to hang them all!\"\n\nThere have been other evangelical Christians in the White House, including Carter and George W. Bush, but Pence's fundamentalism exceeds theirs. In 2002, he declared that \"educators around America must teach evolution not as fact but as theory,\" alongside such theories as intelligent design, which argues that life on Earth is too complex to have emerged through random mutation. Pence has described intelligent design as the only \"remotely rational explanation for the known universe.\" At the White House, Pence has been hosting a Bible-study group for Cabinet officers, led by an evangelical pastor named Ralph Drollinger. In 2004, Drollinger, whose organization, Capitol Ministries, specializes in proselytizing to elected officials, stirred protests from female legislators in California, where he was then preaching, after he wrote, \"Women with children at home, who either serve in public office, or are employed on the outside, pursue a path that contradicts God's revealed design for them. It is a sin.\" Drollinger describes Catholicism as \"a false religion,\" calls homosexuality \"a sin,\" and believes that a wife must \"submit\" to her husband. Several Trump Cabinet officials have reportedly attended the Bible-study group, including DeVos, Pompeo, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. In a recent interview with the Christian Broadcast Network, Drollinger said that Pence \"has uncompromising Biblical tenacity\" and \"brings real value to the head of the nation.\"\n\nMany Americans have debated whether the country would be better off with Pence as President. From a purely partisan viewpoint, Harold Ickes, a longtime Democratic operative, argues that-putting aside the fear that Trump might start a nuclear war-\"Democrats should hope Trump stays in office,\" because he makes a better foil, and because Pence might work more effectively with Congress and be more successful at advancing the far right's agenda. Newt Gingrich predicts that Pence will probably get a chance to do so. \"I think he's the most likely Republican nominee in 2024,\" he said. Ron Klain, who was chief of staff to the former Vice-President Joe Biden, is skeptical of this, given Trump's accumulating baggage. \"There is no success for Mike Pence unless Trump works-he cannot run far enough or fast enough to not get hit by the falling tree,\" Klain said. \"But he may think he can.\" Evidently, the next chapter is on Pence's mind. Over the fireplace in the Vice-President's residence, he has hung a plaque with a passage from the Bible: \" 'For I know the plans I have for you,' declares the lord , 'Plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.' \" ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the date, in October, 2017, when Pence attended a summit of Koch donors.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "What Kind of Witness Will Mike Pence Be?\n\nThe day after Donald Trump was arraigned in Washington, D.C., on four counts related to an alleged conspiracy to prevent the electoral votes in the 2020 Presidential election from being counted, his former Vice-President, Mike Pence, was campaigning for the Republican Presidential nomination in Londonderry, New Hampshire. There he was interrupted by hecklers, some of them carrying Trump signs. \"Why didn't you uphold the Constitution?\" a man shouted. \"I upheld the Constitution. Read it,\" Pence replied, as he shook hands with some young people. The heckler wasn't satisfied. \"You sold the people out,\" he said. \"You sold all these kids out, too.\" A woman yelled, \"Traitor!\"\n\nPence had heard it all before. At 2:24 P.M. on January 6, 2021, Trump tweeted, \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.\" What he should have done, according to Trump, was to reject, while ceremonially presiding over a joint session of Congress, the electoral votes from states that Joe Biden had won. A minute after Trump tweeted, the Secret Service decided to move Pence to a more secure location in the Capitol; on the way, he came within forty feet of rioters. Some in the crowd that day were chanting, \"Hang Mike Pence!,\" \"Traitor Pence!,\" and \"Bring him out!\"\n\nThe chanting has never really stopped, for reasons that go beyond the resentments of Trumpists. Trump is seeking the Presidency again; this time, Pence is running against him. Trump has finally been brought into court to answer for his actions in the lead-up to January 6th; Pence may take the stand to testify about what Trump asked him to do. If Trump was once convinced that Pence could save him from the ignominy of leaving the White House in defeat, he now seems to realize that Pence could help send him to jail. Soon after the indictment was made public, Trump posted on Truth Social that \"Liddle' Mike Pence\" is \"delusional\" and has gone over to \"the Dark Side.\"\n\nIn a hearing on Friday, John Lauro, Trump's lawyer in the January 6th case, cited Pence's status as a rival candidate when arguing that Trump deserved leeway in what he could say about evidence in the case. The judge, Tanya Chutkan, disagreed, saying that Trump was still a criminal defendant bound by restrictions on intimidating and tampering with witnesses. That fight will continue.\n\nThe latest indictment is the second from the special counsel Jack Smith. It follows charges he brought in Florida related to Trump's stashing of sensitive national-security documents at Mar-a-Lago; the former President is also facing a criminal indictment in New York, on charges related to hush money and to falsified business records. (Trump has pleaded not guilty in all cases.) And, this week, Fani Willis, the Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney, is expected to bring another set of charges, centered on an alleged attempt by Trump to overturn that state's 2020 election results. But it is the January 6th case that has turned the focus onto Pence.\n\nA section of Smith's indictment, on Trump's \"Attempts to Enlist the Vice President\" to change the election results, offers a seven-page catalogue of meetings, calls, and memos in which Trump \"directly pressured\" Pence. One revelation is that Pence kept contemporaneous notes of certain key meetings. Trump's plan depended on inducing would-be Trump electors in various states to sign false certifications that they were the real electors, which Pence would then brandish at the joint session and declare either that Trump was the winner or that there was so much uncertainty that the count had to stop. (Willis appears to be focussing on the fake-electors scheme, as well.) In essence, Pence was being asked to endorse a stack of forgeries and then use them as pretext for a coup.\n\nYet, last Sunday, when Lauro made the rounds of the morning talk shows, he referred to Pence as \"our best witness,\" and claimed that his testimony would acquit Trump. He stuck to that position even as his interviewers expressed skepticism. On \"Meet the Press,\" after the host, Chuck Todd, played a clip from that morning of Pence saying, \"The President specifically asked me, and his gaggle of crackpot lawyers asked me, to literally reject votes\"-not exactly a line one would like to hear from one's star witness-Lauro said that Pence was, in fact, \"substantiating\" Trump's story. If so, that story doesn't sound good for Trump.\n\nStill, Lauro is right that Pence will be a complicated figure for both the prosecution and the defense. For one thing, he is a reluctant witness. He refused to appear before the House's January 6th committee, and when Smith issued him a subpoena he fought it in court, and succeeded in somewhat limiting its scope. On \"Face the Nation,\" when asked whether Trump had ever admitted to him that he had lost, Pence said that he didn't \"know what was in his mind.\" He continues to suggest that there was something not quite right about the 2020 election. Lauro emphasized that Pence had also encouraged members of Congress to contest various states' electoral votes on January 6th. Thankfully, Pence stopped there.\n\nEven after that day, though, Pence seemed to yearn for a reconciliation with Trump (and Trumpists). Only recently has he become open in his criticism. The question is whether the ways in which Pence abased himself in Trump's efforts to hold on to power will make his testimony seem weaker or more credible. After all, he can't be dismissed as someone who is speaking against Trump because he is a Democratic partisan. But neither side can be sure what kind of witness Pence will be.\n\nIf the Republican Party, or Pence, were different, he might be positioned to engineer a real split between those drawn to Trumpist proto-authoritarian populism and those who adhere to other conservative ideological strains. So far, he hasn't managed it. At present, he is polling at just above five per cent, in a crowded Republican primary field, while Trump's share is above fifty per cent. But that five per cent, along with Pence's tally of small donors, is enough to qualify him to participate in the first Republican debate, on August 23rd.\n\nThere would be few more acute examples of the collision of the legal and the political calendars than Trump's confronting his former Vice-President-and future witness against him-on the debate stage. Other candidates might want to try out a cross-examination, too. Then again, Trump has suggested that he might skip the debates; he doesn't have to go to any of them. But he and Pence will still have a date in court. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "What We Learned About Trump, Pence, and the January 6th Mob\n\nIt's been hard, these last couple of weeks, to watch and rewatch the horrifying events of January 6, 2021. As the House select committee investigating the attack on the Capitol has conducted its televised hearings, they have played video clips of the violence over and over again. No image is more memorable-and more disturbing-than that of the wooden gallows Donald Trump's supporters erected on the Capitol lawn as rioters chanted \"Hang Mike Pence! Hang Mike Pence!\" The committee documented that those threats were real. According to an F.B.I. affidavit the panel highlighted on Thursday, a government informant said that members of the far-right militant group the Proud Boys told him they would have killed Pence \"if given the chance.\" The rioters on January 6th almost had that chance, coming within forty feet of the Vice-President as he fled to safety.\n\nThe malice of those in the crowd toward Pence, the holier-than-thou evangelical Christian who had spent the previous four years as Donald Trump's slavishly loyal sidekick, was remarkable.\n\n\"If Pence caved we're going to drag motherfuckers through the streets,\" one rioter was captured on video saying. \"He deserves to burn with the rest of them,\" another said. A man with a bullhorn agitated the crowd. \"Mike Pence has betrayed the United States of America,\" he informed the already agitated mob. \"Mike Pence has betrayed this President.\" He finished with a threat and a promise: \"We will never, ever forget.\"\n\nThe explosive ending of the Trump Presidency has always been a story about the rift between Trump and Pence-two of the most mismatched figures ever to be thrown into a marriage of political convenience. For four years, Trump had tested and tried his sanctimonious No. 2, but Pence never broke. Not in public, not, as far as we can tell, in private, either. He was famous during the Trump years for doing and saying almost nothing that would make news. When he debated Kamala Harris during the 2020 campaign, his most memorable moment was when a fly landed on his impeccably coiffed white hair and he did not react for the full two minutes that it sat on his head.\n\nBut on January 6th, Pence finally did break with Trump, refusing to go along with the President's absurd, illegal, and unconstitutional plot to have his Vice-President single-handedly overturn the will of the American people and block Congress's confirmation of Joe Biden's victory. On Thursday, the House committee devoted its hearing to attempting to explain Trump's scheme to pressure Pence-which unfolded in a series of inflammatory Presidential tweets, angry phone calls, and bizarre White House meetings that were a mix of constitutional-law seminars and live reënactments of \"The Godfather.\" The committee introduced a new villain to a national television audience: John Eastman, the former law professor who concocted the absurd legal theory that Pence could unilaterally overturn the election-a concocted counterpart to what U.S. District Judge David Carter recently skewered as \"a coup in search of a legal theory.\"\n\nIf the hearing was designed to eviscerate the professional standing of Eastman, it succeeded blisteringly well. He was shown to be inconsistent, not on the level, and legally and historically shoddy in his work. Greg Jacob, Pence's former counsel, testified that Eastman even acknowledged, at one point, that he knew his theory was unconstitutional and would likely be unanimously rejected by the Supreme Court-if it ever got there. The committee's biggest reveal of the day was an e-mail from Eastman to Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, asking for a Presidential pardon for himself. \"I've decided that I should be on the pardon list, if that is still in the works,\" Eastman wrote. Lawyers who don't think they did anything wrong are not in the habit of asking for pardons. When called for a deposition by the panel, Eastman cited his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination a hundred times, Representative Pete Aguilar of Texas revealed.\n\nBut, of course, Americans don't really care about John Eastman. Nor should they. It was President Trump who desperately seized on Eastman's absurd argument that the Vice-President determines the winner of Presidential elections. It was Trump who brought this buffoon into the White House, Trump who demanded that Pence attend repeated meetings with him, and Trump who charged ahead with the plot.\n\nTrump did not care what Eastman's legal theories were. He just wanted him to provide one. His goal was to keep power by whatever means necessary. Once again, the January 6th panel presented compelling evidence that Trump personally orchestrated the campaign-inflaming the mob when Pence did not cave in, as Trump apparently expected, after four years of caving in. In a dramatic phone call from the Oval Office on the morning of January 6th, with his family arrayed around him listening, the President berated and castigated his Vice-President. Trump called him a \"wimp,\" according to one witness. A former aide to Trump's own daughter Ivanka recalled Ivanka telling her that Trump had called Pence a \"pussy.\" When Pence rebuffed him anyway, Trump, a few hours later, tweeted his anger at Pence's lack of \"courage\"-even as the mob stormed the Capitol. \"It felt like he was pouring gasoline on the fire,\" one of his White House officials, Sarah Matthews, testified regarding the tweet.\n\nPurely by coincidence, I'm sure, Thursday's hearing took place on the seventh anniversary of the day when Trump kicked off his Presidential campaign with that famous escalator ride down to the lobby of Trump Tower. Soon after the hearing ended, I received a fund-raising e-mail from Trump asking, \"Do you remember this day 7 years ago?\" and promising that if I sent him money by 11:59 P.M. I would both get my name on \"the 2022 Trump Donor Wall\" and have my gift \"INCREASED by 600%.\" (How, exactly, was not clear.) The Trump grift continues.\n\nAnd that, really, was the bigger point of Thursday's debates about the language of the Electoral Count Act of 1887 and the powers vested in the Vice-Presidency. Trump remains not only an e-mail-fund-raising huckster but also the subject of historical inquiry. He continues to be what the retired federal judge Michael Luttig, a conservative legal icon who advised Pence, called him at Thursday's hearing: a \"clear and present danger\" to the nation. ♦\n\nWhen the Capitol was breached, a New Yorker reporter became the sole journalist in the Senate chamber to witness its desecration .\n\nInside the chamber, Luke Mogelson captured raw, visceral footage of the siege .\n\nShould Americans refer to the Sixth of January as a protest, an act of treason, or something else ?\n\nWhat the January 6th papers reveal .\n\nHow a mother of eight became one of the riot's biggest mysteries, and a fugitive from the F.B.I.\n\nThe violence was what Donald Trump wanted .\n\nIf America is to remain a democracy, Trump must be held accountable .\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker .\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "website": "https://www.newyorker.com",
      "text": "Mike Pence's Big Lie About Trump and the Coronavirus at the Republican National Convention\n\nFrom the opening of their Convention on Monday, the Republicans have been propagating a huge falsehood about the coronavirus pandemic . Amy Ford, a nurse from West Virginia, got things going when she said , \"As a health-care professional, I can tell you without hesitation, Donald Trump's quick action and leadership saved thousands of lives during COVID -19.\" Carefully edited videos and other testimonials have been used to reinforce this bogus narrative, but the ultimate rewriting of history was left to Vice-President Mike Pence , whose speech on Wednesday night from Fort McHenry, in Baltimore, amounted to a travesty of the truth.\n\nA good deal of Pence's speech was devoted to over-the-top attacks on Joe Biden, whom he described as \"a Trojan horse for the radical left,\" a supporter of \"open borders,\" and \"a cheerleader for Communist China.\" But he also defended Trump's response to the coronavirus, claiming he has overseen \"the greatest national mobilization since World War Two.\" In Pence's telling, \"President Trump marshalled the full resources of our federal government from the outset. He directed us to forge a seamless partnership with governors across America in both political parties.\" Under his leadership, the Administration reinvented testing, coördinated the delivery of billions of pieces of personal protective equipment, and \"enacted an economic rescue package that saved fifty million American jobs.\"\n\nThe great irony, and outrage, of Pence's speech is that, as the head of the White House's coronavirus task force since February, he's had a unique and closeup view of Trump's actual response to the pandemic: the constant belittling of the virus's threat; the claims that it would go away of its own accord; the quack remedies , including injecting disinfectant into stricken patients; the squabbling with governors, even Republican ones, who called out the inadequacy of his actions; the urging of states to reopen their economies even as they failed to meet the guidelines that Pence's task force had laid down; the months of defiant refusal to wear a mask; and, in the end, the decision to effectively give up on the whole thing and move on.\n\nPence didn't mention any of these things, of course. He focussed on the one significant policy decision Trump made early-to ban travel from China. Of course, the Vice-President didn't point out that the ban was only a partial one-more than forty thousand people subsequently entered the United States on flights from China. And the first confirmed cases in New York, where the virus has killed more than thirty-two thousand people, arrived from Europe, not Asia. Nevertheless, throughout his speech, Pence presented Trump as everything he isn't: engaged, diligent, and dedicated solely to acting in the interests of the American people. \"In a city known for talkers, President Trump is a doer,\" he said with an impressively straight face. \"Few Presidents have brought more independence, energy, or determination to that office.\"\n\nWith the national death toll approaching a hundred and eighty thousand, it seems unlikely that Pence's speech will have much impact on public opinion. Americans can see reality with their own eyes. One poll published earlier this week showed that Trump's approval rating for his handling of the pandemic has dropped to thirty-one per cent. Still, Wednesday's address will go down in history as a memorable example of how establishment Republicans like Pence have utterly capitulated to Trump, debasing themselves and their party in the process, and, ultimately, betraying the country, which, in its hour of crisis, deserved honesty rather than pro-Trump spin.\n\nSadly, Pence's performance was predictable. Behind the scenes at the White House, according to an extensively reported article that Politico published on Wednesday, he has sometimes been \"a force for moderation and fact-based decision making\" on the coronavirus. In mid-March, for instance, he and other members of the task force went to Trump in the Oval Office and pressed him to approve nationwide guidelines for social distancing. However, the Politico piece also detailed how Pence slowed down the Administration's response by allowing officials with no health expertise to play a role in the task force's deliberations, and how he \"felt pressure to appease Trump.\" \"Mike is the ultimate good soldier,\" one Administration official was quoted as saying. \"He's not going to be pounding his fist on the table demanding change. . . . That's not Mike Pence.\"\n\nIn public, Pence continued to exalt Trump even as it became clear that a public-health catastrophe was unfolding. \"Mr. President, with your leadership, the American people are beginning to step forward,\" he said at a White House ceremony in April. In June, as case numbers were surging in California, Florida, and Texas, he claimed on \"Face the Nation\" that the country was \"in a much better place to respond\" because of \"the leadership that President Trump has provided.\" Last week, as the death toll passed a hundred and seventy thousand, he told \"Good Morning America,\" \"I couldn't be more proud of the leadership President Trump has provided from the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.\"\n\nWednesday night's speech represented merely a continuation of this theme. After repeatedly praising Trump's leadership, Pence dismissed Biden's statement last week that there was no miracle in the offing to end the pandemic. \"America is a nation of miracles,\" Pence said. \"We're on track to have the world's first safe, effective coronavirus vaccine by the end of this year. After all the sacrifice in this year like no other-all the hardship-we are finding our way forward again.\"\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable thing about Pence's bowing and scraping to Trump is that he seems to revel in it. In an interview with the Times , his chief of staff, Marc Short, said Pence has studied previous Vice-Presidencies, and he \"exemplifies servant leadership.\" Even in these twisted days, when Trump's takeover of the G.O.P. seems virtually complete, it isn't every elected Republican who would like to go in the history books as the forty-fifth President's most loyal and obsequious servant. As he demonstrated on Wednesday night, when he once again acted as Trump's lickspittle, Pence seems to fill the role naturally.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Mike Pence and the Farce of Trusting Donald Trump on the Coronavirus\n\nThe weakness of Donald Trump 's response to the COVID -19 crisis-the weakness of Trump's character-was captured in a response that Vice-President Mike Pence gave, on Thursday, to CNN's Alisyn Camerota . She noted that, within hours of Trump's address to the nation the previous night, the Administration had to issue \"clarifications\": that the travel ban he had announced, which he said would apply to \"Europe\" except for the United Kingdom, cover a \"tremendous amount of trade and cargo,\" and have exemptions only for \"Americans\" who had undergone screening, would, in fact, not apply to cargo, cover only countries in the Schengen zone (a subset of European countries with limited border checks between them), and would also have exemptions for permanent residents and citizens' immediate family members. Those are big clarifications. It was bad enough that Trump's actions were entirely inadequate-he didn't address problems with testing, for example. But it was stunning that he seemingly could not accurately explain his bad ideas. International financial markets began dropping as he spoke, and the inadequacy of his words and his Presidency became manifest. And so, Camerota asked Pence, \"Why the confusion?\"\n\n\"I don't think there was confusion,\" Pence replied, blankly, loyally, absurdly. \"The President took another historic step, just like he did in January with China, to suspend all travel from Europe, Alisyn, for the next thirty days.\" Instead of explaining the President's confused remarks, Pence echoed them, adding to the muddle. Pence, it should be remembered, is not only the Vice-President but the nation's dedicated coronavirus point man-his function is to coördinate and clarify and at least give the illusion of leadership. And yet it took another few sentences before he mentioned that there would be \"Americans coming home\"-so not a suspension of all travel-after being screened, followed by a reference to every returning \"American and legal resident,\" with a note that they would be asked to self-quarantine for fourteen days. But, a couple of minutes later, Pence again referred to \"suspending all travel for thirty days from Europe.\" Who coming from where is allowed or required to do what? The main thing to remember is that the President did something \"historic.\"\n\nThe incompetence and the sycophancy are connected. Pence delivers what Trump demands, even when Trump demands the pretense that COVID -19 will simply go away if people stop worrying about it. It won't. It is not just that Trump doesn't always have the very best people around him; he has too many people who seem to care only whether he is happy. Even people with great expertise spend too much time, at almost every public briefing, ritually noting his leadership. Such words are not confidence-inspiring. There have been reports that Pence at various points suggested that Trump take some practical actions-for example, in managing the plight of a cruise ship-and that Trump said no. Other officials have reportedly had similar experiences. But, as long as they do not publicly confront their boss or pressure him to take real action on a growing crisis, that only means so much. And Pence, for one, is not doing so; instead, he kept telling Camerota that what looked like haphazard moves were \"all part of the President's strategy,\" extolling him as a leader who \"took action.\" But someone very prominent in the Administration or the Republican leadership has to get angry, in a way that is demonstrative, dramatic, and even, for whoever it is, out of character.\n\nInstead, Pence is not alone. He is behaving in a way that Republicans have come to regard as normal. They must engage in the increasingly farcical exercise of praise for Trump. Sometimes, as when they join him onstage at a rally, the main immediate damage may be to their self-respect. At others, as in the impeachment hearings, when Republican after Republican claimed that the President was an innocent victim of the deep state, the damage was to their duty to the Constitution. During a pandemic, the harm is not only to public health but to the country's structure, as fissures in the health and social-welfare systems widen, exposing just how vulnerable many Americans are-the hundred thousand homeless children in New York City's public schools, for example-and a larger order breaks apart. (The damage may even be to their own health: Senators Lindsey Graham and Rick Scott are under self-quarantine, after mingling at a Mar-a-Lago event that included a Brazilian official who has now been confirmed as having COVID -19; Trump was also present but has so far neither been tested nor quarantined himself.) On Thursday, Senator Mitch McConnell, who has praised what he decided to call Trump's \"early, bold action\" on COVID -19, reportedly had to be pressured to delay a Senate recess until a COVID -19 relief bill was passed. And among Fox News commentators, as Dylan Byers notes , there is still outrage that some virus has the nerve to undermine Trump. Pence, speaking to Camerota, tried to pin the blame on Europe, which he said was the site of most new cases. What will he say when America wins that title?\n\nOne of the most mangled sections of Pence's interview had to do with testing. He suggested that anyone who needed a test could get one just by going to a doctor, who would arrange one-or maybe that would happen soon, if not yet. When Camerota showed him figures suggesting that the number of tests completed was still just in the thousands, he said he thought that the information was wrong. But he refused to even estimate the right number. The mismanagement of testing, particularly as coronavirus was just reaching the United States, appears to have triggered a disaster. It remains shockingly hard for people to get tested-test kits and the chemical reagents needed for them are a scarce resource-even when they have symptoms and known contact with COVID -19 patients. According to the COVID Tracking Project , in which The Atlantic is a partner, the tally of tests completed was nearing sixteen thousand five hundred on Friday; South Korea has conducted more than ten times as many . \"It is a failing. Let's admit it,\" Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said, of the U.S.'s testing system, at a hearing of the House Oversight Committee. Trump will never admit it.\n\nThe testing situation is such a shambles that even some Republicans have begun to acknowledge it. Senator Lamar Alexander called it \"a serious deficiency,\" according to Politico , and Senator James Lankford said that the idea that people could simply go and get tested-which Trump has pushed-was just wrong. Senator Mitt Romney (who might actually be good at managing this sort of thing) said that the situation is \"frustrating.\" The question is whether that consciousness of failure will lead to a breaking point in the Republicans' system of obedience to Trump. This is not a matter of using the coronavirus crisis to bring him down; it's a question of the President's party really pushing him to do what he can to stop the virus from bringing the country down. And if he won't, they can start voting with Democrats in Congress, and give support to governors and other local officials-and, most fundamentally, they can be honest with the public. Perhaps Republicans could even nominate someone else at the convention this August (if, given the fears of COVID -19, it's still held). That seems far-fetched, but so, a month ago, did trading being halted on the New York Stock Exchange, campuses closing, Broadway shutting down, major-league seasons getting suspended, and parts of the city of New Rochelle being cordoned off. Unimaginable scenes at overwhelmed hospitals may be ahead.\n\nLater Thursday, Trump spoke to reporters at an appearance with Leo Varadkar, the Prime Minister of Ireland. Trump was asked to clarify his travel-ban remarks-specifically, could he confirm whether Ireland is exempt? \"I think it was made very clear last night who is and who isn't,\" he said, without actually answering the question. (Varadkar jumped in to say that Ireland, which is not a Schengen country-and, obviously, not part of the U.K.-would indeed be exempt.) Trump then added to the confusion by saying that Americans (and, presumably, permanent residents) returning from countries where the ban is in force \"have to be tested. . . . we're not putting them on planes if they are positive.\" Who is going to do that testing? The way Trump explained it, one could almost imagine a situation so contorted that the fastest way to get a test would be to buy a ticket to Paris, and then to try to come back-which is undoubtedly not how the restrictions will work. But who knows with Trump? In the appearance with Varadkar, he was still talking about his rallies and petulantly demanding that America and the world imagine him as a man taking forceful action to save lives, saying, \"I have the right of doing a lot of things that people don't even know about.\" On Friday afternoon, he declared a national emergency. One wonders if he knows what a President can and, during a pandemic, must do and, for that matter, what he must not do. The people in his Administration and his party might tell him, not privately but publicly-so that everybody can hear.\n\nWhat it means to contain and mitigate the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nHow much of the world is likely to be quarantined ?\n\nDonald Trump in the time of coronavirus .\n\nThe coronavirus is likely to spread for more than a year before a vaccine could be widely available.\n\nWe are all irrational panic shoppers .\n\nThe strange terror of watching the coronavirus take Rome .\n\nHow pandemics change history .\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "What Lane Does Mike Pence Think He's Driving In, Exactly?\n\nMike Pence is officially running for president . Why?\n\nWell, because he wants to be president-that much has been clear since he accepted an invitation to be Donald Trump's running mate in 2016 despite his obvious incompatibility with Trump as a matter of both personal comportment and ideology. Among other things, Pence was a \"traditional family values\" guy and national security \"hawk\" vis-à-vis figures like Vladimir Putin; joining the Trump campaign was pretty obviously a case of careerism over principle. And when you're ambitious, and you're the vice president, the next job you're probably looking for is the big one!\n\nBut why does Pence think he has a chance of becoming president? This was a good question even before the events of Jan. 6, 2021. His record is extremely conservative even by Republican standards; he criticized George H.W. Bush for signing civil rights legislation and raising taxes and, in 2003, warned that a Medicare prescription drug benefit supported by the younger Bush would potentially \"usher in the beginning of socialized medicine in America.\" His most high-profile act as governor of Indiana was signing a bill intended to allow businesses to refuse service to gay customers.\n\nThis is why Trump selected him as a VP candidate-to give the 2016 Republican ticket credibility among the kinds of free-market evangelicals once thought of as the GOP \"base.\" But the idea of someone as fiscally and socially conservative as Pence winning a national election in 2024, or really at any point in modern U.S. history, is far-fetched, especially when you consider that conservative figures like George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan were at least considered personally charming by many middle-of-the-road voters. (Pence is, to my knowledge, not considered charming by any statistically significant group of Americans. He speaks in a plodding cadence, and his signature expression-you'd be forgiven for wondering whether it's his only expression-is a kind of squinting grimace that, to paraphrase the writer Moira Donegan, seems confused about whether it's supposed to be conveying swaggering alpha aggressiveness or restrained moral piety. )\n\nThose are just the reasons to believe Pence wouldn't win a general election. In the Republican primary, he's now contending with a huge number of voters who believe he betrayed the party by refusing to help overturn 2020. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has more money than Pence, is polling way ahead of him, and has been targeting the religious and social conservatives Pence would need to form a winning coalition. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott is running on a return-to-traditional-Republican-values theme, which is expected to be the theme of Pence's campaign as well, without any of Pence's Trump-related baggage.\n\nIf you really had to make a case that there was a Mike Pence path to victory-let's say someone put a gun to your head, or you were his campaign manager-it would probably have to unfold in the following way:\n\n• Pence spends the next seven months in Iowa convincing the portion of the state's evangelical voters who haven't written him off because of 2020 that he's the most authentic representative of their values.\n\n• DeSantis drops out before voting starts to save face after his much-hyped, expensive campaign fails to gain any ground against Trump.\n\n• Pence finishes in what pundits call \"a strong second place\" in Iowa, establishing media momentum and perhaps the support of Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers' donor network that he's worked with in the past (and which says it will be endorsing a non-Trump candidate).\n\n• Trump is indicted for so many different alleged crimes that he's logistically unable to campaign (and falls well behind Joe Biden in head-to-head general election polling), leaving Pence as the Republican front-runner and, eventually, nominee.\n\n• Biden suffers some sort of health problem that calls his fitness to serve into serious question, but doesn't drop out of the race.\n\n• Pence appeals to swing voters by touting his Jan. 6 stand on behalf of democracy and wins the lowest-turnout presidential election ever.\n\nCould that happen? Yes. Will it? No. But what has Mike Pence ever demonstrated as a public figure if not an immense capacity for self-delusion?\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Mike Pence Is No Hero. His Actions Might Send Trump to Jail Anyway.\n\nTuesday's indictment of Donald Trump on felony charges, for working to overturn the results of the 2020 election and his role in the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, features six unnamed co-conspirators -and one very frequently named man who is not facing charges: former Vice President Mike Pence. In fact, a not-insignificant amount of the evidence in the indictment seems to come from the hand of the ex-president's right hand.\n\nIn the 45-page document, Pence makes more than a few cameo appearances. Throughout December 2020 and January 2021, Pence is routinely being brought into meetings with the president and his co-conspirators, and being informed of his evolving role at the center of the attempted coup, when Pence was expected to pull off the ever-changing plan. As co-conspirator 2 put it, \"In the end, Pence then gavels President Trump as re-elected.'\"\n\nAs we all now know, Pence didn't do that-nor did he heroically condemn the president and go straight to the press, the police, or much of anywhere. What he did do, though, was take thorough and \"contemporaneous notes,\" which the Department of Justice seems to have leaned on heavily-and references explicitly and repeatedly-in its case against Trump.\n\nAs the indictment has it, \"On several private phone calls in late December and early January, the Defendant repeated knowingly false claims of election fraud and directly pressured the Vice President to use his ceremonial role at the certification proceeding on January 6 to fraudulently overturn the results of the election.\" It then details a number of private phone calls between the president and Pence on Dec. 25, Dec. 29, Jan. 1, and Jan. 3, apprising Pence of the plan and informing him of his role in it. We know the details of these conversations, the indictment affirms, because Pence was busy taking \"contemporaneous notes,\" which he seems to have handed over to the DOJ.\n\nWhat the notes reveal is that Pence did push back, meekly. He's in the indictment as \"telling the Defendant, as the Vice President already had in previous conversations, 'You know I don't think I have the authority to change the outcome.' \"\n\nAgain, at a later date, he \"responded that he thought there was no constitutional basis for such authority and that it was improper.\" Not that there was no constitutional basis, mind you, but that he just didn't think there was. According to the document, that resulted in an exchange Pence would probably have liked to lead the news coverage of his role in the gambit. \"In response, the Defendant told the Vice President, 'You're too honest.' \"\n\nBut if, through all that time, Pence wasn't committed to defiant, patriotic heroism, he was deeply committed to jotting down the details. On Jan. 4, the president met with co-conspirator 2, the vice president, Pence's chief of staff, and his counsel \"for the purpose of convincing the Vice President, based on the Defendant's knowingly false claims of election fraud, that the Vice President should reject or send to the states Biden's legitimate electoral votes, rather than count them.\" (White House counsel Pat Cipollone got the boot from this particular meeting after throwing cold water on the false claims of election fraud.)\n\nAt the meeting, Pence thoroughly cataloged Trump's lies to him about the election result. \"Defendant made knowingly false claims of election fraud, including, 'Bottom line, won every state by 100,000s of votes,' and 'We won every state.' \" These claims included stuff that Department of Justice officials had told Trump was false \"as recently as the night before.\"\n\nThen, Trump \"asked the Vice President to either unilaterally reject the legitimate electors from the seven targeted states, or send the question of which slate was legitimate to the targeted states legislatures.\" Pence, in response, challenged not the president but \"co-conspirator 2 on whether the proposal to return the question to the states was defensible.\" Co-conspirator 2 responded, \" 'Well, nobody's tested it before.' The Vice President then told the Defendant, 'Did you hear that? Even your own counsel is not saying I have that authority.' \"\n\nThe details of that exchange are also attributed to the vice president's \"contemporaneous notes.\"\n\nThe indictment also notes that the Jan. 6 crowd was chanting \"Hang Mike Pence!,\" \"Where is Pence? Bring him out!,\" and \"Traitor Pence!,\" and features an infamous Trump tweet, an exhortation to the vice president to send back the electors from the states whose results were unfavorable. \"All Mike Pence has to do is send them back to the States, AND WE WIN. Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!\"\n\nAfter the indictment dropped, though, Pence made no mention of either in his presidential campaign's statement. Instead, the campaign echoed Pence's notable, yet tepid pushback in the indictment. \"Today's indictment serves as an important reminder: anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be President of the United States,\" it reads. Pence is not defending the former president, whom he is running against in the Republican primary, as has become standard practice in the GOP. But he also follows that statement up with some grade-A pablum: \"I will have more to say about the government's case after reviewing the indictment. The former president is entitled to the presumption of innocence, but with this indictment, his candidacy means more talk about Jan. 6 th and more distractions.\"\n\nThis is not exactly a fearless truth-teller calling it like it is. It's a pretty mealymouthed assertion from a man who found himself cast in a central role in a plot to overthrow American democracy-it was Pence, after all, who would have been responsible for pressing the actual button in this scheme. In that position, Pence set to work trying to convince the plot's mastermind that Pence himself shouldn't be tasked with such an essential part because the rules forbade it. Pence, remember, has at no point been an ally of the case against Trump: He refused to testify before the House panel on Jan. 6 just nine months ago. His great act of defiance was as much an act of self-preservation-he preferred not to. Instead, he wrote it all down. His post-indictment statement leaves just enough room to admit the strong possibility that Trump will again be the Republican nominee for president, and that the ex-vice president will be led, in some way yet again, to fall in line: either to grumble and refuse, or to support the Republican ticket, but certainly never to help the opposition trying to stop all of this.\n\nAt no point in the saga did Pence ever tap into a well of extreme courage, in one way or the other. But he did seem to will himself into some extreme stenography, whether for self-preservation or merely his own memory, or for some other reason. In the end, the notes may end up doing more to bring about Trump's political and legal downfall than anything Pence said or did while running and serving as Trump's deputy. Given the central place of his notes in a case that may land a former president of the United States in jail, Pence's scribblings may end up defining his political legacy. When history asks, \"What did you do, Mr. Pence, when the revolution came?\" the former vice president will hold his head not very high, and say, \"I took dictation, and let someone else figure it out.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Mike Pence's Real Reason for Challenging His Trump Special Counsel Subpoena\n\nOn Tuesday, it was reported that former Vice President Mike Pence will challenge special counsel Jack Smith's subpoena surrounding the events of Jan. 6. Former President Donald Trump's \"quiet coup\" in the lead-up to Jan. 6 failed when Pence refused to do Trump's bidding in rejecting or delaying the certification of President Joe Biden's election.\n\nThe legal claim Pence reportedly intends to make should go nowhere. Even his own written statements fatally undermine it. That suggests another motive. It's no mystery that as a potential presidential candidate, he doesn't want to offend Trump's ponderous Republican base.\n\nPence's reported claim to be free from an obligation to testify comes under the Constitution's \"speech and debate\" clause . It provides that \"Senators and representatives ... shall not be questioned in any other Place\" than Congress about \"any Speech or Debate in either House.\" Courts have regularly made clear, however, that the protection extends only to questioning about legislative acts.\n\nLast year, Sen. Lindsey Graham failed when invoking the clause to try to avoid testifying before Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' grand jury about a phone call he made shortly after the November election to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. While one never knows with this radical Supreme Court majority, the same result should apply here.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of a constitutional scholar and a former federal prosecutor, Pence's resistance poses an issue of enormous significance for our constitutional system: Can the criminal process count on obtaining every person's testimony in order to ensure accountability, or are there some people who are above the law when a grand jury seeks the whole truth about a conspiracy to overturn a presidential election?\n\nThe case law tells us, in no uncertain terms, that the duty imposed by law on all citizens to testify can reach even those protected by the speech and debate clause. In 1972 the Supreme Court held that the clause does not \"immunize a Senator or aide from testifying at trials or grand jury proceedings involving third-party crimes where the questions do not require testimony about or impugn a legislative act.\"\n\nFor starters, special counsel Smith's questions about what Trump said in the White House to Pence and others before and even during the Jan. 6 special session wouldn't be seeking testimony about how anyone acted in a legislative capacity.\n\nEven if Smith were to question Pence about his responses to Trump's demands that he use his role as presiding officer of the joint session of Congress to steal the election, Pence himself has all but conceded that there was no formal \"legislative act\" in that role. That morning, he wrote Congress a letter stating unequivocally that his role was \"ministerial\" and \"largely ceremonial\" and that the actual \"role of Congress is very different\" from what his job as presiding officer was.\n\nHis letter quoted his esteemed conservative legal adviser, former Court of Appeals Judge J. Michael Luttig, for the proposition that \"[t]he only role and power of the Vice President under the Constitution is to count the Electoral College votes as they have been cast.\"\n\nTo be sure, no court has ever considered the application of the speech and debate clause to the role performed by the vice president in his special function of presiding over the quadrennial joint session when the electoral ballots are opened.\n\nBut that responsibility is far less \"legislative\" in character-and thus further from the purposes of the provision-than the duty a vice president fulfills when breaking a tie in any of the Senate's lawmaking functions.\n\nFurther, testimony regarding criminal actions is not protected by the speech and debate clause. Notably, in 1972, the Supreme Court rejected Maryland Democratic Sen. Daniel Brewster's claim that the speech and debate clause immunized him from prosecution for allegedly taking a bribe. \"Obviously,\" the court wrote, bribery is \"no part of the legislative function\" and is therefore \"not a legislative act.\"\n\nSurely testimony in Justice Department investigations, like the one being pursued into Trump for conspiring to stay in power, in apparent violation of various federal crimes, is similarly carved out.\n\nIndeed, in the course of ruling in Brewster's case, the court distinguished \"political acts\" from \"legislative\" ones: \"[I]t has never been seriously contended that ... political matters ... have the protection afforded by the Speech or Debate Clause.\" What Trump discussed with Pence was as shamefully political as anyone might imagine, and also potentially in violation of laws against obstruction in a congressional proceeding or participating in a seditious conspiracy.\n\nWhat's worse is that Pence is trying to have it both ways legally. He invoked the separation of powers to wrap himself in executive branch garb so as to avoid testifying before Congress' Jan. 6 committee, and now he is invoking a privilege designed to protect lawmakers to wrap himself in legislative branch garb so as to avoid testifying in a grand jury. Heads, he wins; tails, the law's search for truth loses.\n\nHis purpose is transparent. It's not to protect our legal institutions but to protect himself and his ambition to run for the White House. He knows that courts have consistently shot down claims of separation of powers and executive privilege in the context of attempts by Trump to shield his role in Jan. 6 and the events leading up to it. So Pence now makes a novel, if legally frivolous claim.\n\nIn the days ahead as the details of Pence's conflict with the special counsel become clearer and that legal dispute escalates, you should count on Pence to produce high-minded public statements about how his only goal is to once again preserve and protect the Constitution. This time, don't believe him.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

      "text": "The Biggest Takeaway From the First Night of the Jan. 6 Hearings Was About Mike Pence\n\nOn Thursday, the House select committee to investigate the Jan. 6 attack held the first of a series of summer hearings to illuminate the findings of its yearlong investigation into the Donald Trump-inspired insurrection and attack on the Capitol.\n\nRanking member Liz Cheney of Wyoming led a compelling 30-minute introduction that featured new footage of interviews with key witnesses including former Attorney General William Barr, Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, and Trump's daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump. While many of the new details in these video snippets merely expanded on information already known, there were a series of crucial revelations about Vice President Mike Pence: Basically, it was confirmed that Pence was acting as president on Jan. 6, 2021, even as he was being hunted by a mob that Donald Trump had virtually sent after him.\n\nThe most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.\n\nFirst, Cheney expanded on last month's blockbuster reporting by Politico that \"Trump had signaled a positive view of the prospect of hanging the vice president.\" The critical new details stated by Cheney were this:\n\nAware of the rioters' chants to hang Mike Pence, the president responded with this sentiment: \"Maybe our supporters have the right idea.\" Mike Pence \"deserves it.\"\n\nThis followed Trump's rally at which he told his supporters he would be disappointed if Pence didn't single-handedly overturn the election results during the Electoral College certification. It was also around the time that he tweeted \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution\" as Trump supporters stormed the Capitol chanting for Pence's head.\n\nDuring the riots, Pence was escorted to safety by Secret Service agents, even as the mob swarmed the inside of the Capitol rotunda. It was Trump's duty as president to restore order to the nation's government and call off the mob he had sent after Pence. But it was actually Pence who was issuing the orders for the military to send the National Guard. Those troops would eventually clear the Capitol.\n\nCheney said that the monthlong hearings would lay out what had previously been assumed about Trump's actions that day: that the president did nothing to stop the violence. It was not previously known that Pence was directing the response from his siege bunker.\n\n\"Not only did President Trump refuse to tell the mob to leave the Capitol, he placed no call to any element of the United States government to instruct that the Capitol be defended. He did not call his secretary of defense on Jan. 6. He did not talk to his attorney general. He did not talk to the Department of Homeland security. President Trump gave no order to deploy the National Guard that day. And he made no effort to work with the Department of Justice to coordinate and deploy law enforcement assets,\" Cheney said. \"Vice President Pence did each of those things.\"\n\nCheney then played video of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, describing how Pence responded in the crisis.\n\n\"There were two or three calls from Vice President Pence. He was very animated and he issued very explicit, very direct, unambiguous orders. There was no question about that,\" Milley said in an audio-recorded sworn deposition. \"But he was very animated, very direct, very firm, and to Secretary [of Defense Christopher] Miller: 'Get the military down here, get the Guard down here. Put down this situation,' etc.\"\n\nBy contrast, Milley testified that Trump gave no such orders. Rather, his communication with the White House involved chief of staff Mark Meadows asking the nation's military leadership to pretend that Trump was still in command.\n\n\"He said, 'We have to kill the narrative that the vice president is making all the decisions,' \" Milley testified. \" 'We need to establish the narrative that the president is still in charge and that things steady or stable,' or words to that effect. I immediately interpreted that as politics, politics, politics . Red flag for me personally, no action. But I remember it distinctly.\"\n\nThe Pence revelations were the biggest of the hearing, but blunt video testimony from Barr and Ivanka Trump also proved momentous.\n\nBarr testified that he told the former president that the Department of Justice had investigated his fraud allegations about the election, and that Barr told Trump they were \"bullshit.\"\n\n\"I saw absolutely zero basis for the allegations, but they were made in such a sensational way that they were obviously influencing a lot of people, members of the public,\" Barr testified, referring to Trump's claims that the election was stolen. \"I told them that it was crazy stuff and that they were wasting their time on that and it was doing a grave, grave disservice to the country.\"\n\nIvanka Trump, in testimony, said she agreed. \"I respect Attorney General Barr, so I accepted what he was saying,\" Ivanka said in a prerecorded video.\n\nRichard Donoghue, who took over as acting deputy attorney general after Barr left his job in December 2020, also testified that DOJ officials went so far as to tell the White House that Trump's efforts to get the Department of Justice to parrot his fraud claims were an attempt to outright corrupt the election.\n\n\"I recall towards the end saying, 'What you're proposing is nothing less than the United States Justice Department meddling in the outcome of the presidential election,' \" Donoghue testified.\n\nIn spite of the day's dramatic revelations, it seems likely that House Republicans and the rest of the party will continue to rally around the former president, and even Democratic representatives seemed to acknowledge as much. \"It's a reminder that there was a period of time in the days and weeks after Jan. 6 when everybody who now defends the president, and embraces the lie, understood exactly what had happened and in some cases was apparently ashamed of their role,\" Rep. Tom Malinowski said. \"It was striking to hear-not surprising, but striking-to hear the former president's attorney general say, finally, that it was all 'bullshit.' \"\n\nThe day's live witnesses included Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards, who testified about the moment that officer Brian Sicknick was attacked with chemical irritant. \"I see movement to the left of me and I turned and it was officer Sicknick with his head in his hands and he was ghostly pale,\" Edwards said. \"He turned just about as pale as this sheet of paper.\" Edwards was then herself sprayed in the eyes by chemical irritant, and Sicknick suffered two strokes and died one day later.\n\nAfter the hearing, Sicknick's partner Sandra Garza exchanged a long hug with Edwards. Other officers were there in support of Edwards, including Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who testified at last summer's opening Jan. 6 hearing and was wearing a T-shirt that offered the dictionary definition of the word insurrection next to another definition that read simply: \"January 6, 2021.\"\n\nAs Dunn told reporters of Trump's failure to act that day: \"I can't say I'm surprised anymore. Disappointed. He's got a job to protect not just us, but this country. He didn't.\"\n\nJim Newell contributed reporting to this article from inside the hearing.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "I Lived Like Mike Pence for a Week\n\nIn Human Guinea Pig , Slate writers subject themselves to various experiments and indignities so you don't have to.\n\nMen are never to spend any time with a woman without a chaperoning presence. That's a core tenet of the Modesto Manifesto , as defined by the late mega-preacher and notorious fundamentalist crusader Billy Graham. The idea is that by putting yourself under constant, panoptic surveillance, you shall never succumb to temptations of the flesh.\n\nYou probably already understand the retrograde logic of this philosophy. It's built on the twin premises that women are conniving succubi put on Earth exclusively to test the sexual discipline of other people's spouses-and that men possess no agency over who they try to sleep with, rendering the penis an autonomous, malignant presence on the body. It also assumes that men exclusively marry women, and that a consensual, mutually beneficial agreement for there to be some extramarital touching is totally out of the question-all classics of prehistoric Christianity.\n\nBilly Graham established this statute in 1948, with input from a variety of his other neo-evangelist comrades, and lived by it until his death in 2018. More recently, a version of the creed was popularized by former Vice President and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence-who is destined to accrue, like, 0.7 percent of the vote come primary season.\n\nPence has been married to his wife Karen since 1985, and during that time, he has never dined with a woman without the leering proximity of the Mrs., ostensibly to keep his raging erection in check. (In fact, Pence has mandated that any governmental aides assisting him during late-night shifts need to be male. How horny is this guy?) To top it all off, he allegedly calls her \"Mother.\"\n\nIt seems like a miserable, needlessly convoluted existence. A political life is a public life, which seems to mean that Pence must navigate his self-enforced castigation while frequently interfacing with women in leadership roles. (I'm imagining Karen looking on from the bar while Pence and Angela Merkel debate global energy policy.) Furthermore, it demonstrates an intrinsic self-loathing and fearfulness about the most casual, low-stakes, and lighthearted flirting-one of the few things that make life worth living-which, as someone who grew up going to a Baptist megachurch, is one of the integral features of the masculine Protestant archetype.\n\nI say all of this because Slate asked me-a 32-year-old media professional with a liberal arts degree, a long-term cohabiting girlfriend, an apartment in Brooklyn, and, let's say, a 65-to-35 split between female friends and male friends-to live like Mike Pence for a week. I was to embrace his petrifying fear of impure thoughts, to believe that every woman on the face of the Earth was plotting to ruin my life, and to steal away from their influence. If everything went to plan, perhaps I'd come out the other side with a greater appreciation for what makes one of the most unseemly politicians in America tick. Who knows? Maybe it could be the start of my own cascading puritanical spiral, as I learn just how euphoric inner castration can be.\n\nI earmarked two Wednesdays in early August to be the start and end points of this experiment, and before I embarked on my hermetic era, it had already become obvious that there are certain logistical hang-ups that made the principles of this lifestyle untenable. First and foremost, both my boss and the other full-time writer on the Human Interest team at Slate are women-which I'm sure a guy like Mike Pence would disapprove of for reasons that are far more sexist than sexual. Our team has one-on-ones and pitch meetings every week, which means if Pence becomes president and institutes total theocracy-the Gestapo going restaurant to restaurant in order to make sure that men are not alone with a woman other than their betrothed-then I literally wouldn't be able to do my job. Compromises needed to be made already, so I resigned to make any and all work calls in the living room, within the direct eyeline of my girlfriend, keeping the ridiculous charade aboveboard.\n\nThe other apprehension I was staring down was far more humiliating. I am not a politician-I do not gallivant around the campaign trail cutting ribbons, kissing babies, shaking a zillion different hands on a long afternoon in Paducah, Kentucky-and I've also been living with the same partner for three years now. All this is to say that I'm rarely in a position to be dining alone with a woman who is not my girlfriend. So it occurred to me that one of the horrifying truths I might discover during my Pence dalliance is that I've become an inveterate and domesticated Wife Guy-someone who literally never leaves the house without his significant other-both of us mutated into a single amorphous, childless unit.\n\n\"I really don't think your life is going to be any different,\" she quipped when I told her about what we were cooking up for this month's Human Guinea Pig. It was the coldest thing she's ever said, because the truer a retort is, the more damaging it is. Maybe all of my proclaimed alternative fashionability was totally counterfeit; maybe I'm just as lame as Mike Pence. There was only one way to find out.\n\nWednesdays are typically pretty light in my itinerary. It's often designated for our weekly book club, but this particular session had been postponed because a few of our regulars were out of town, leaving a voluminous blank space on the calendar. My girlfriend had dinner plans with some college pals in the city, which is the sort of thing I wouldn't have been invited to even if I wasn't trying to Be Like Pence. So I spent my first afternoon in my stringent Judeo-Christian world watching an interview with Charles Barkley-which is the sort of entertainment that tends to be absent of any female interest, perspective, or intrigue whatsoever. We were off to a good start.\n\nI tried to keep the trad-hetero vibes churning deep into the evening. Seriously, what did I use to do when I was single and dateless on a random weekday? Naturally, I texted an old college buddy, who is a man. He arrived at my door brandishing a six-pack of Pacifico, and we both sank into a debauched night of two-player tabletop gaming. ( Summoner Wars, if you're curious.) My friend has been married for years, so our rendezvous was something like a platonic affair. If this is what it is to live like Mike Pence-to fearlessly indulge in my nerdiest and most femme-repellent inclinations-then maybe this week wouldn't be so bad after all.\n\nNews of my Mike Pence pivot had trickled into our greater social sphere, which means that my male friends and I were hard at work dreaming up new ways to keep ourselves occupied-while respecting the limitations of the doctrine-on what was shaping up into a turgid, sweltering Thursday. A lightbulb went off in the group text. Tonight was the Hall of Fame Game, the dawn of the NFL's yearly preseason, and one of the grimmest dude-centric spectacles on the calendar. At last, we had our plans.\n\nMy girlfriend was enjoying another blissful girls-only retreat-this time a café co-working session which neatly morphed into an extended happy hour-while two of my guy friends and I crowded around a skunky high-top in the neighborhood's dankest dive. It seems important to note here that Mike Pence seems to be a teetotaler; his only bad habit, he says, is nonalcoholic beer (which is a total humblebrag and he knows it).\n\nBut the Modesto Manifesto says nothing about vices outside of the elemental mistrust of women, which means that I felt like I could imbibe with aggro ferocity while keeping the structure of the practice intact. In fact, I was beginning to wonder if the sudden withdrawal of feminine energy might've been emphasizing my more churlish aptitudes. By the middle of the first quarter I found myself gambling on this terrible 21-16 Cleveland Browns-New York Jets slobberknocker, which is something nobody should ever do under any circumstances. My caveman DNA was percolating, the backslide had begun. If I wasn't careful, I'd be taking up golfing next.\n\nMy girlfriend, as always, was there to save me before things got too dark. Our Friday was wide open, and as a late-summer sunset smoldered outside our windows, we sat on the couch with nothing to do. Perhaps sensing that the physical lack of women in my social structure was leeching out some of my latent bro frailties, she cued up It's Complicated -a proud, tertiary Nancy Meyers joint-as a way to soften my interior after losing $25 on the Cleveland Browns. It was just what the doctor ordered.\n\nIf you haven't seen the film before, you're basically looking at a standard suite of empty-nest travails; divorced dads dating much younger women, moms smoking weed and sharing pain au chocolat with their hunky architect (who also happens to be played by Steve Martin), and a brush with death that sparks a deeply selfish midlife crisis. You get the sense that the content of the movie is exactly what Mike Pence is trying to avoid with the Modesto Manifesto: a family untethered by a combination of male ego, neediness, and good old-fashioned avarice-all of which, in his mind, could be sparked by one chance meeting with an unmarried woman. So perhaps this is how the Pence flock gets a dose of suburban intrigue when life gets dull. You may never be able to enjoy a sordid, emotionally fraught affair with Meryl Streep, but you'll always have Nancy Meyers.\n\nI should probably note that I wasn't focused on avoiding random female encounters in the wild during my Pence exercise. If you live in New York City, you are going to be surrounded by people of all stripes in elevators, subways, and coffee shops as you go about your day-and even the most devout Christian fascists must accept that as fact. (Come to think of it, it's likely a lot easier to ensconce oneself in an impermeable bubble back in Columbus, Indiana. I think I'm finally starting to understand the roots of Pence's derangement.)\n\nAnyway, on Day 4 my girlfriend and I went out with a bunch of friends to a bar. The group skewed female, and nobody spiraled into incorrigible libidinal psychosis. (She didn't even need to hawk over us like \"Mother\" to keep the peace.) If men could understand how easy it is to be friends with whoever you want, nature would finally heal.\n\nIs Mike Pence allowed to text women? The Modesto Manifesto specifically restricts its membership in the context of social environments-bars, restaurants, churches, whatever. But other, more intangible means of interaction-like, say, a phone call-were left unaccounted for. Yes, these rules were originally penned in the 1940s, long before communication was digitized. But you have to imagine that if Billy Graham did live and die by this code, surely there were a few incidents where he, I don't know, wrote a letter to a woman. Did he have Mrs. Graham read it over before licking the seal? Did she monitor every pen stroke? Was he dictating the type to her? These are the gray areas of the femme-free lifestyle.\n\nI found myself thinking about this because, toward the end of this experiment, I received a totally inert Instagram DM from a female friend of both me and my partner. (If you must know, we were bonding over the '90s post-hardcore band Slint.) A chill went up my spine. Wait, am I about to betray the Modesto lifestyle? So I quickly wrote back explaining to my friend that in order to internalize the Penceian spirit, I would need to communicate with her exclusively in a group text with my girlfriend for the next couple of days. She responded by sending an exclamation-mark emoji before dropping the thread entirely.\n\nSlate has a lot of brilliant women on staff, which further accentuates the whole texting confusion. Is it verboten to connect with my femme co-workers in the Culture channel? An enigma wrapped in a riddle! I decided to do something like a \"masculine carbon offset\" for my interstitial interactions with the women at Slate by attempting to get in plenty of unambiguous Guy Talk around the office when I could. For instance, on Day 6, me and three men spent an hour chopping it up about the history of the music-crit institution Pitchfork Media-which naturally gave way to a discussion about a recent tweet by Jenny Lewis about indie rock ethics. I doubt Mike Pence knows who Rilo Kiley is, but if he did, he'd be proud.\n\nWe wrapped up the experiment exactly where I started. In the living room, surrounded by a few boys, playing a board game on a hot weekday night. Once again, I did my best to make the evening as oppressively mannish as possible. We unpacked Cuba Libre, a war game set during the Cuban Revolution, where four players wrest control of asymmetrical sides during the insurgency (government forces, Fidelistas, the students' movement, and the mafia), brokering uneasy alliances and leveraging dwindling resources on a path toward victory. (This might shock you, but once again, my girlfriend had her own plans.) It is the sort of board game that takes about an hour and a half to teach, which is a ritual that makes all of the women in my life feel like they're about to die. My girlfriend has said that when she listens to me explain how little wooden cubes move around a board, her soul leaves her body. I can't really blame her, and that's the ironic thing with the Modesto Manifesto as a whole. Paradoxically, Mike Pence's parochial, flagellating extremism allowed me to indulge myself rather than discipline myself. A week following his footsteps unlocked a certain intoxicating shamelessness in the way I organize my interests. I honored the primacy of my hetero-male self; I played a Cuba game with three other hetero males until 1:00 in the morning.\n\nMike Pence and I don't have a lot in common. I believe in the validity of LGBTQ+ identity. I think a major reconstruction of global capital is the only way we'll be able to preserve the human race on planet Earth. I would welcome the decline of American paramountcy in international relations, and I am certain that people should generally start having sex before they turn 25.\n\nHowever, despite the flagrant patriarchal toxicity at the heart of the Billy Graham project, I have learned that Pence and I are similar in one crucial way, which is that we are both boring men who enjoy the company of our significant others. If you construct a nice life for yourself-from left-incubating coastal enclaves to the rolling plains of MAGA Indiana-the Modesto undertaking isn't much of a challenge. Maybe there's hope for unity after all.\n\nUpdate, Aug. 21, 2023: This article has been updated to more accurately characterize the tenets of the Modesto Manifesto.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Whew, Mike Pence's New Book Makes Some Hilarious Claims About Trump!\n\nThe day after the Republican Party's red \"wave\" barely managed to lap the shores of American democracy, former Vice President Mike Pence took the opportunity to step into the spotlight, publishing something in the Wall Street Journal that I am honestly still trying to categorize.\n\nTechnically, it's an essay-or more precisely, an adapted excerpt from Pence's forthcoming memoir, My Last Days With Donald Trump . It may sound as if it's going to be a Tuesdays With Morrie ­-type thing, but it's actually about how Pence and Trump interacted regarding \"stolen election\" stuff.\n\nIn the piece, Pence recounts meeting with Donald Trump five days after the Jan. 6 siege of the Capitol, in which many Trump-supporting rioters clearly expressed their desire to \"hang\" Pence, whom they blamed for failing to overturn the 2020 election. Not cool, particularly if you are Pence!\n\nIn Pence's telling, the Trump he visited on Jan. 11, 2021, was a sobered, sensitive, repentant man. \"He looked tired,\" Pence writes, \"and his voice seemed fainter than usual.\" (O ... K?) He continues:\n\n\"How are you?\" [Trump] began. \"How are Karen and Charlotte?\" I replied tersely that we were fine and told him that they had been at the Capitol on Jan. 6. He responded with a hint of regret, \"I just learned that.\" He then asked, \"Were you scared?\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied, \"I was angry. You and I had our differences that day, Mr. President, and seeing those people tearing up the Capitol infuriated me.\"\n\nHe started to bring up the election, saying that people were angry, but his voice trailed off. I told him he had to set that aside, and he responded quietly, \"Yeah.\"\n\nI said, \"Those people who broke into the Capitol might've been supporters, but they are not our movement.\" For five years, we had both spoken to crowds of the most patriotic, law-abiding, God-fearing people in the country.\n\nWith genuine sadness in his voice, the president mused: \"What if we hadn't had the rally? What if they hadn't gone to the Capitol?\" Then he said, \"It's too terrible to end like this.\"\n\nThe only question I can ask after reading this is: Does anyone believe that any of this actually happened? I can't imagine Pence does, even though he's the one who allegedly lived it. Certainly not the publisher of his memoir, or the editors of the Wall Street Journal. No one who has witnessed any public moment of Trump's presidency or life could believe this actually happened. Not even Trump! In fact, if I were him, I'd sue for defamation! This excerpt makes him look like a wuss!\n\nOne of Trump's primary qualities, the thing that would have him a very happy autocrat if he had managed to get his shit together, is his complete incapacity for the following things: self-reflection, remorse, \"musing,\" second thoughts, admitting wrongdoing, saying \"yeah\" when someone suggests he set a grievance aside, and feeling \"a hint of regret\" that people tried to hang the guy who allegedly cost him a second term as president.\n\nWe all know this. We all lived it for four years! So, it's a bit too cute that Pence is trying to make Emo Donald Trump happen. There's a reason why every anonymous anecdote leaked about Trump's private conversations has made him out to be exactly the kind of walking anger management problem he appears to be in public: Even anonymous leakers know that the idea of Trump \"responding quietly\" or speaking with \"genuine sadness in his voice\" is too farfetched to pass muster!\n\nDo not sleep on this Pulitzer-worthy world-building exercise. And while you're reading, take a moment to marvel at the way Pence summarizes Trump's video to Jan. 6 rioters with the quote \"I know your pain, I know your hurt ... but you have to go home now, we have to have peace.\" This heroic ellipsis-which elides the part of the video in which Trump reiterates his lies about the stolen election and tells the rioters, \"We love you, you're very special\"-is doing more work than any punctuation mark has ever previously attempted. It's too beautiful to be factual. It's art!\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Slate's guide to the most important figures in politics this week.\n\nWelcome to this week's edition of the Surge, Slate's politics newsletter bumpily sliding face-down into your inbox after another week of terror.\n\nWith Congress out for the rest of the summer, we look largely toward the other two constants in politics: campaigns and criminality. Ron DeSantis makes it only to the runner-up spot this week; hopefully he doesn't slit our throats. Mike Pence is going all in on \"honesty,\" the trait Republican primary voters are notorious for demanding in their leader. Don't you think you're sitting pretty either, Joe Biden-at least until you're impeached.\n\nLet us begin with the prosecutor who is stone-cold going for it.\n\nBy Jim Newell\n\nThe Surge does not know if former President Donald Trump thought that announcing his candidacy in November 2022 would make it less likely that he'd face criminal charges. That might have been the case had Attorney General Merrick Garland, who never seemed comfortable against accusations of politicization, continued running point. Instead, Trump's announcement made criminal charges a certainty, as it led directly to Garland's appointment of Jack Smith as special counsel to continue the Trump investigations. Smith has aggressively prosecuted Trump, first dropping a Mar-a-Lago classified documents indictment, then (just a week ago!) adding a few more charges to that, and then this week hitting Trump with the big one : four charges relating to his, and his as-yet-uncharged co-conspirators', attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Beardy over here wakes up each morning with the same routine: He goes to the office, indicts Donald Trump, takes a purposeful lunch break at Subway, goes back to the office, and issues a superseding indictment of Trump. This happens literally (figuratively) every day. Smith's most recent bombshell, given the subject material and the defendant, has to go down as the boldest indictment in American history-especially as it's not a slam-dunk case. It takes a certain type of personality to go through with something like that. Certain people would label it \"deranged.\" That's directionally correct-prosecutors, who choose to make imprisoning people a career, are all a little sus-but dogged might be a little more apt here. And last November, it seems, Trump landed himself one of the most dogged there is.\n\nOne theory partially explaining Trump's grip over the GOP presidential nomination holds that each indictment further weds him to the Republican primary electorate as he portrays himself as a subject of political persecution. The Surge is not here to disprove that-there are many correct reasons for Trump's dominance in the primary. But we're beginning to believe that more of the weight should be placed on a different known factor: the awfulness of Ron DeSantis, built up to be Trump's main rival. A New York Times/Siena College poll this week found Trump leading DeSantis nationally, 54 to 17 percent. Beneath that top-line number, though, there was a question about whether Trump or DeSantis was more \"fun.\" Trump was leading on that question 54 to 16, almost an exact proxy for his overall lead. DeSantis may understand that Republican voters want a bulldozer taken to Washington and its institutions, but he entirely misses that they want the operator to have a little savoir faire in going about it. Consider how he described his plan to trim the federal bureaucracy this week. \"On bureaucracy, you know, we're going to have all these deep state people, you know, we're going to start slitting throats on Day 1,\" he said in Rye, New Hampshire, on Thursday. He similarly said last week that he would \"slit some throats\" at the Pentagon if he became president. This is not fun language! Sure, active serial killers might salivate at it, but they're a modest 8 percent of the Republican primary electorate. Ron is recording in mono out there. Trump, meanwhile, can talk about how he's going to replace the career civil service with political appointees in one breath and, in the very next, about his chance to \"make it\" with Farrah Fawcett in 1983.\n\nMike Pence's notes and quotes to the special counsel's office are all over the 45-page indictment in United States v. Trump . And the former vice president has come almost fully out of his shell in having the will to criticize Trump for his actions on and leading up to Jan. 6. \"Today's indictment serves as an important reminder,\" Pence said in an initial statement on Tuesday, that \"anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be President of the United States,\" and noted that the president's accruing indictments mean \"less attention paid to Joe Biden's disastrous economic policies afflicting millions across the United States and to the pattern of corruption with Hunter.\" Pence went a little harder the following day, explaining that Trump \"was surrounded by a group of crackpot lawyers that kept telling him what his itching ears wanted to hear.\" Among the new information in the indictment, almost certainly provided by Pence himself, was that of a call between Trump and Pence on Jan. 1, 2021, during which Trump told Pence (as an insult),\"You're too honest.\" The Pence campaign-which still hasn't hit the donor threshold to make the Aug. 23 presidential debate-quickly turned this into merch , selling \"Too Honest\" hats and T-shirts. The Surge doubts Pence could persuade his own family members to buy something so lame, but you've got to try something.\n\nThe libs are reading these first three entries and just loving the mess Republicans are in! Which means it's a good time to remind everyone that Biden is also unpopular , viewed as visibly in decline by voters, and struggling in polls against supposedly easy-to-beat Republicans because decline is an irreversible condition. He is a sub-ideal candidate, and he could very easily lose to anyone-very much including Trump-that Republicans offer up. Plenty of elected Democrats acknowledge this privately. One of the few to repeatedly question Biden's fitness for a second term publicly, though, is Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, a suburban moderate who's been calling for Biden not to run again since last summer. As Politico first reported , Phillips himself has recently \"been receiving inquiries about his willingness to challenge Biden\" and was going to New York to meet with the money people about a possible bid. Phillips confirmed that he had \"been overwhelmed with outreach and encouragement\" and would give it a think. Well, there's nothing wrong with spending an evening humoring rich people in New York. But there's not much of a think to give here. Dean Phillips won't be the Democratic nominee, and at this juncture, he'd ruin his life in Democratic politics if he tried. The ship has sailed. It's Biden for better or worse at this point, because all of the leading party figures nervous about him running for a second term were too timid to talk him out of it when they had the opportunity. Another nail-biter awaits. Stock up on heart medication now.\n\nIt's underappreciated how likely House Republicans are to attempt impeaching Biden in the coming months. It would make Trump happy, it could be timed to distract from any of Trump's trials, and it would theoretically muddy the waters ahead of a general election to show that \"both sides\" are corrupt. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has recently suggested openness to launching an impeachment inquiry tethered, in some way or another, to committee investigations into Hunter Biden's shady business dealings and whether the president played any assisting role. It's probably just a matter of locking down the votes in McCarthy's narrow majority at this point. The risk of backfire here, though, is substantial, as it would rally Democratic voters feeling squishy about Biden's second campaign to his side. In unrelated news this week, Fitch downgraded the United States' credit rating, explicitly citing as its reasons polarization and the country's \" deterioration in governance .\"\n\nTrump's indictment made it clear that it takes a village to fail to overturn an election loss. Smith's diss track listed six co-conspirators who helped in Trump's efforts, five of whom are easily identifiable . None of them were indicted alongside Trump. That doesn't, however, mean that they're out of the woods yet; the decision to charge Trump solo in this indictment may have merely been to keep the pace of his trial from being bogged down. The co-conspirators seem to be ranked roughly in order of pending legal trouble. First, there's Rudy Giuliani, who badgered everyone he could publicly and privately to do what they could to assist Trump's efforts to reverse the election outcome. The second co-conspirator, though, John Eastman, might be in the most acute trouble. He was the lawyer pressing Pence to try various schemes rejecting electoral votes, and at one point begged of Pence, \"I implore you to consider one more relatively minor violation [of the Electoral Count Act] and adjourn for 10 days to allow the legislatures to finish their investigations, as well as to allow a full forensic audit of the massive amount of illegal activity that has occurred here.\" Here is Eastman explicitly asking the vice president to violate the law. It would not surprise the Surge in the slightest if Jack Smith is two or three 6-inch Italian BMTs away from making it official with this guy.\n\nAn absolutely GRUESOME BRAWL has broken out on the VIOLENT SUPREME COURT about Congress' ability to REGULATE IT. Meaning, a couple of justices have politely disagreed about it in public. The Senate Judiciary Committee recently passed a bill imposing ethics and disclosure rules on Supreme Court justices and clerks, and Justice Samuel Alito did not take kindly to this. \"I know this is a controversial view, but I'm willing to say it,\" Alito told the Wall Street Journal in an interview last weekend. \"No provision in the Constitution gives [Congress] the authority to regulate the Supreme Court-period.\" A few days later, though, Justice Elena Kagan offered her take in an interview. \"Of course, Congress can regulate various aspects of what the Supreme Court does,\" she said . \"Congress funds the Supreme Court. Congress historically has made changes to the court's structure and composition. Congress has made changes to the court's appellate jurisdiction.\" Kagan did note, though, that there are, of course, \"limits\" to what Congress can do. Fortunately, there is a direct way to figure out whether Congress can regulate the Supreme Court: Congress can pass a law doing so, and then five Supreme Court justices can decide whether they'll allow it. But since no such legislation is being signed into law anytime soon, it's a thought exercise.\n\nThe most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Mike Pence \"Literally Working Around the Clock\" to Garner Any Semblance of National Support\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, a guy who did one thing or another in business and is now running for president on a platform of anger to get famous, said this weekend that he has qualified for the first presidential debate on Aug. 23. That means that he, a political nobody as of a few months ago, met each of the Republican National Committee's relatively stringent requirements. He's registering in the requisite number of polls, and he has received donations from at least 40,000 unique donors-including at least 200 from each of at least 20 states. He'll sign the RNC's loyalty pledge to support the eventual party nominee.\n\nAnd that means that Vivek Ramaswamy is, at this moment, in better shape than the most recent Republican vice president of the United States.\n\n\"We're not there yet,\" Mike Pence told CNN over the weekend, of his campaign remaining short of meeting the donor criteria. \"We're literally working around the clock\" to get 40,000 individual donors, he said, and he's \"confident\" he will make the debate stage in the end.\n\n\"People every day are going to MikePence2024.com and donating even a dollar to get us on the stage,\" he said.\n\nPence probably will make the debate stage, for the simple reason that he has to. Were he to miss that stage, he would immediately have to end his campaign out of shame. (Which would be funny.)\n\nPence is polling in the mid-single digits in the national polling average, which doesn't matter, and in the low single digits in Iowa, on whose evangelical caucusgoers he's staking his campaign. It's not that these numbers are meaningfully worse than those of any other candidate not named Trump or DeSantis-everyone else is largely fighting for scraps at this point.\n\nBut most of the other third-tier campaigns fighting for scraps have at least qualified for the debate. Besides Trump (who may not show) and DeSantis, the campaigns of Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, Chris Christie, and now Ramaswamy all say they have met their mark.\n\nNot all of this has been entirely on the level, or-as the RNC intended with the requirement-demonstrative of broad grassroots support. Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor, is using his vast wealth to pay people to donate to his campaign. In a legally questionable scheme, he is offering $20 gift cards to the first 50,000 people to donate $1 to his campaign. That has supposedly worked, although he has not yet met the polling requirement to get on stage. In other attempted gimmicks, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez is entering donors into raffles for Major League Soccer games or free tuition payments. And Ramaswamy designed an interesting new program to incentivize bundling, allowing fundraisers to keep 10 percent of the donations they refer to the campaign.\n\nPence, in his Sunday CNN interview, scoffed at these gimmicks. \"We're not offering kickbacks,\" he said. \"We're not offering gift cards. We're not even offering soccer tickets. We're just asking people for their support, and we're getting support all over the country. And I couldn't be more grateful.\"\n\nPerhaps he, an august former statesman, thinks it would hurt more than help his candidacy in the long run if he lowered himself to the level of carnival tricks.\n\nBut there's not much of a long run that's apparent here.\n\nPence, a former vice president, governor, and congressman who has debated (well) in two general-election presidential debates, raised a meager $1.2 million in the second quarter. In the most recent poll of Iowa, commissioned by Fox Business, he placed sixth with 4 percent among likely GOP caucusgoers. He has little space in which to maneuver. He repels moderate voters for his years of carrying water for Trump and his calling-card policy proposal of a national abortion ban, and he repels conservatives for his refusal to help Trump overturn the 2020 presidential election. Beyond the abortion plank, Pence is offering an eat-your-vegetables conservative platform of federal spending cuts and Social Security reform to a primary electorate that craves cultural revenge against its perceived heretical oppressors. And the top two GOP candidates have that market pretty well cornered.\n\nThis is not a candidacy, in other words, that entices tens of thousands of people-specifically, four tens of thousands of people-to open their wallets.\n\nIt's time to raffle something.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Goodbye, Mike Pence\n\nMike Pence spent most of his time as VP using his blandness, his low murmuring voice, and his biblical \" servant leadership \" to quietly normalize Donald Trump for a certain type of person. For example, he once called his boss a \" man of his word .\" Then, the pandemic hit, and Pence was made head of the White House's coronavirus task force, a fittingly Trumpian choice, given that Pence had historically been disastrous on public health. And he wasn't just bad on the typical stuff, like trying to take away affordable health care . When he was governor of Indiana, his policies actively worsened his state's HIV outbreak. He has been, in various moments, on the wrong side of condoms, smoking, and even day care.\n\nIn charge of guiding America through a pandemic, with Anthony Fauci and all manner of doctors and scientists at his disposal, Pence took the opportunity to add masks , plexiglass , and cruise ships to his list of public health fuck-ups. As the head of the task force, he routinely missed its planning calls .\n\nThe VP was never the main driver of disinformation during the pandemic (or the presidency, at large), but he was bizarrely happy to further the cause. While America was climbing up the second wave of COVID-19 cases, Pence was declaring that he would \" keep opening up America .\" While parents were bracing for a chaotic school year, Pence was speaking at the Life Wins! 2020 Tour (the \"life\" in question being cells in utero). While Trump was sick with COVID and maniacally tweeting about the \" SPACE FORCE ,\" Pence was sharing bland positive updates-like a video of Trump's doctor, shared without commentary -that fit with the narrative that everything was going just fine, even as Trump clearly appeared to be in a meltdown of illness and falsehoods. This is the crux of Pence's VP-ship, really: delivering Trumpism minus the swears and the yelling.\n\n\"We're about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people,\" Pence said at the vice presidential debate in October, a patriotic bon mot that covers for absolute selfishness. It came in the same breath as a defense for attending what became a superspreader event at the White House. He started by outright lying about the nature of the party, saying, among many other things , that \"it was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advise.\" In reality, it involved no distancing, a scant number of masks, and it happened partially indoors.\n\nMike Pence being tapped to lead the coronavirus task force is a reflection of the broader role he filled for the Trump administration: He was meant to quietly, happily carry buckets of shit in exchange for proximity to power. But even as he has spent much of the past four years wandering around in the background with his perpetual simple smile , we should not forget the deal he took, and what it's cost our country. Pence's entire modus operandi during COVID appears to be that neither he nor Americans were obligated to engage in the Sesame Street -level skill of cooperation with scientists or with one another. And yet, he always found room in his heart for Trump. After the Access Hollywood tape, he gently said that he did not condone it, and then went on to accept Trump's apology and happily continue serving in his role as enabler. He provided permission for Trump supporters to spend four years accepting the president's worst, most damaging impulses.\n\nPence should spend his post-Trump life hanging out with Mother , the fly , and no one else.\n\nThis is part of a series of goodbyes to Trumpworld figures.

      "text": "Vice President Pence's \"never dine alone with a woman\" rule isn't honorable. It's probably illegal.\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nAn employment lawyer weighs in.\n\nby Joanna L. Grossman\n\nThe wave of sexual-harassment scandals has led some commentators to suggest that the \"Mike Pence rule\" deserves a second look. In March, law professor Joanna Grossman explained why the rule is not just bad business practice: It may be illegal:\n\n\"I don't work with women. If they're attractive, I'm too tempted. And if they're not attractive, what's the point?\"\n\nA male partner at a law firm casually made this pronouncement one day at lunch, hardly looking up from his plate. Everyone laughed and went back to eating - in the rough-and-tumble world of DC law, it wasn't even the most obnoxious thing said that day. But this is no laughing matter for the women whose career opportunities are impeded by men who cavalierly dismiss half of the labor force and insist that they've behaved honorably by doing so.\n\nThis issue was thrust into the news when the Washington Post ran a piece on Karen Pence , the wife of our current vice president, and reminded readers of something Mike Pence said in 2002: He does not eat alone with a woman or attend an event where alcohol is being served unless his wife is present. The Twittersphere lit up like a Christmas tree with jokes and rants about Pence's wife-rule. It's not clear whether Pence still adheres to this practice, but there are men who do.\n\nAs the Atlantic observes , such arrangements are especially common within marriages between religious conservatives of various stripes. (It need not be only men who follow such strictures, but the emphasis is often on male temptation.) On Capitol Hill, where long days and late nights away from the family are part of the job, some Congressmen will not travel alone in a car with a female staffer, the National Journal has reported . Some politicians set gender-neutral rules that have a side effect of keeping them from being alone with women - such as excluding any staff from the office before 7 am or after 7 pm - but others clearly apply special rules to women.\n\nTo be sure, a politician's declining to dine alone with a woman does not fall in the same category as a law partner refusing to work with women (or at least musing about refusing to work with women). Nonetheless, the practice described by Pence in that 2002 interview is clearly illegal when practiced by a boss in an employment setting, and deeply damaging to women's employment opportunities.\n\nTitle VII, which governs workplace discrimination, does not allow employers to treat people differently on the basis of certain protected characteristics, one of which is sex. This means that an employer cannot set the terms and conditions of employment differently for one gender than for the other. This includes any aspect of the relationship between employer and employees - extending to benefits like equal access to the employer.\n\nEmployers are not permitted to classify employees on the basis of gender without proof that sex is a bona fide occupational qualification for a particular job. A Pence-type rule could never satisfy this test. A male boss cannot casually cordon off certain jobs, tasks, or opportunities for men only. (I am assuming here that Pence does occasionally dine with men - table for two - without his wife present.)\n\nEmployers are also not permitted to base employment decisions on gender-based stereotypes - including the stereotype that women are temptresses, or incapable of having purely professional relationships with male bosses or co-workers.\n\nPence's defenders said he was merely acting prudently, and expressed amazement at the all the fuss. Yet we know that women pay a heavy price for behavior that either resembles his or falls on the same continuum. We know this from anecdotal reports and surveys of women who report exclusion from travel, events, or one-on-one meetings with male bosses; from cases in which men have fired female subordinates to assuage jealous wives; and from decades of employment-discrimination litigation in which we get a picture of the everyday ways in which workplaces remain unequal for women.\n\nWhy might men refuse to work with women, either generally or one in particular? Some fear that temptation will cause them to overstep a marital boundary by having a consensual affair - or a legal boundary by engaging in unwelcome harassment. Others fear just the appearance of a sexual or romantic liaison - which could provoke wifely jealousy, concerns about sexual favoritism, or reputational harm to the male boss who might wrongfully be labeled a creep.\n\nSome fear false accusations of sexual harassment, against which they can't defend themselves because there aren't any witnesses. Assuming these fears are legitimate (although some may be more about anxiety about women in leadership roles than marital fidelity), surely there are ways to alleviate them that do not curtail potentially productive business interactions?\n\nAn Iowa dentist made headlines a few years ago when he fired his longtime hygienist because his wife was jealous. The dentist directed sexually inappropriate comments at the (married) hygienist, complained that her scrubs were too tight and revealing, and asked questions about her sex life. The hygienist didn't reciprocate with sexual innuendo, did not engage in a romantic or sexual relationship with the dentist, and put on a lab coat whenever he complained her clothing was \"distracting.\"\n\nNonetheless, the dentist fired the hygienist. The dentist's wife viewed her as a \"big threat\" to their marriage, and the family pastor agreed that firing the \"hot\" hygienist was the best course of action. When the hygienist's husband called the dentist to ask why his wife had been fired, the dentist reassured him that she was the best assistant he ever had and had done nothing wrong or inappropriate. But he was getting too attached and \"feared he would try to have an affair with her down the road if he did not fire her.\" In a shocking 7-0 opinion, in 2013, the Iowa Supreme Court held in Nelson v. Knight that the hygienist's firing did not constitute sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nThink for a moment about the absurdity of this ruling, given the existence of a statute that prohibits employers from making employment decisions because of an employee's sex. Is there any doubt that Melissa Nelson could have kept her job if she was a man? The hygienist got fired for being an attractive woman, plain and simple. The court did not see it that way, characterizing her firing instead as something that grew out of a particular interpersonal relationship and situation, falling back on the right of an employer to fire an employee for any nondiscriminatory reason.\n\nBut even that deeply misguided court would understand that a policy or practice of excluding or avoiding female employees in general is unlawful. In its opinion, the Iowa Supreme Court distinguished between an \"isolated employment decision based on personal relations ... driven by individual feelings and emotions regarding a specific person\" and a \"decision based on gender itself.\" And if an employer \"repeatedly took adverse employment actions against persons of a particular gender, that would make it easier to infer that gender ... was a motivating factor.\"\n\nVice President Pence's \"policy\" applies to all women - not just one in particular. That is why it runs afoul of Title VII.\n\nMen needn't isolate themselves from women in the workplace out of fears of false allegations of harassment. The vengeful, spurned woman who ruins an honorable man's life (think Demi Moore in Disclosure ) is a backlash caricature with an outsize impact on the popular imagination. False claims of harassment are exceedingly rare and impossible to prove; even meritorious claims of harassment are hard to prove. Men shouldn't worry about being led unto temptation because, well, it is entirely within their control whether to harass a subordinate or initiate an affair.\n\nWe have a president who brags about grabbing women by the pussy - and a vice president who won't even have dinner with them. These are two sides of the same coin, both reflecting the fundamentally unequal sphere working women inhabit because of male behavior.\n\nAs for the prototypical jealous wife? Perhaps some counseling is in order - and some self-reflection about why either partner in the marriage would perceive the relationship to be so vulnerable as to be undermined by the mere proximity of other women outside the wife's presence. In any case, women in the workplace have protected civil rights that outweigh such concerns.\n\nWomen have been shut out of equal employment opportunity for all of history. It's long past time the doors to power and opportunity were opened, whether after hours, on a trip, or, gasp, at a working dinner with a male boss. After all, as the song \"The Room Where It Happens\" from the musical Hamilton puts it, sometimes \"decisions are happening over dinner.\"\n\nJoanna L. Grossman is the Ellen K.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIt's not yet clear who exactly his Republican supporters would be.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence is once again taking on his former boss, this time as a challenger for the presidency .\n\nPence officially announced his candidacy on Wednesday after doing swings through primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire. As part of his pitch, he's set to frame himself as a traditional \"Reagan conservative\" concerned about fiscal responsibility, but with a heavier emphasis on social issues like abortion .\n\nIt's unclear, however, how much of a constituency that message and his candidacy have, given the party's shift toward populism and the staunch support many voters still have for former President Donald Trump .\n\n\"This campaign is going to reintroduce Mike Pence to the country as his own man, not as vice president, but as a true economic, social, and national security conservative - a Reagan conservative,\" Scott Reed, a co-chair for Pence's Committed to America Super PAC, told reporters in May . Pence's goal is to rally a coalition of evangelical voters and more traditional fiscal and social conservatives as he tries to defeat Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and the other competitors in a crowded primary field.\n\nWhether he'll be able to do that, however, is in doubt. Currently, FiveThirtyEight's polling average has Pence lagging Trump and DeSantis by wide margins. Trump is far ahead with 54 percent support, DeSantis follows with 21 percent, and Pence comes in third with 5 percent. Pence's past confrontation with Trump over the latter's attempts to undermine the 2020 election results, and his work for the administration, also make it difficult for him to win over either Trump loyalists or the narrower segment of Republicans who oppose the former president, respectively. Because of that dynamic, it's uncertain who the supporters of his candidacy will be.\n\n\"With the red meat Republican base voters, they think he betrayed Trump on January 6,\" says Gunner Ramer, the political director of the Republican Accountability Project, an anti-Trump GOP group that's not affiliated with any candidates. \"The Never Trump Republicans don't like him because he worked for Trump.\"\n\nA former governor of Indiana and longtime House member prior to becoming Trump's vice president, Pence has government experience and conservative bona fides he can lean into as part of his campaign. Already, he has said he's open to cuts to Social Security and Medicare, and expressed robust backing for Ukraine, both positions that contrast heavily with how Trump and DeSantis have approached these topics.\n\nHe's also long held more hard-line positions on restricting abortion, and he previously opposed same-sex marriage . As Republicans have tried to navigate the political backlash they've faced in being too harsh on abortion, Pence has been one of the few prominent candidates who has embraced a legal challenge of medication abortion and efforts to take it \"off the market.\" Pence has emphasized, too, his commitment to religious liberty and that he believes marriage is \"between a man and a woman.\"\n\n\"His authenticity, experience, and conservative credentials are second to none in the field, and those things will stand out-particularly in Iowa-as the campaign unfolds,\" said Michael Ricci, a communications strategist for Committed to America.\n\nThe question, however, is whether a large enough contingent of Republican voters is interested in this message and whether it would differentiate him enough from a packed field. Pence has called for Republicans to resist \"unprincipled populists\" and ideas that have taken hold since Trump's presidency, including isolationist foreign policy and anti-democratic sentiments. Many Republican voters are increasingly open to these stances. \"Mike Pence is making a pitch that would make sense if it was 15 or 20 years ago,\" says Ramer.\n\nMany of the socially conservative voters Pence is looking to appeal to are also still fans of Trump, and it's uncertain if Pence will be able to change that. In a spring focus group the Republican Accountability Project did with eight Evangelical voters, seven of the eight chose Trump as the candidate they'd support between him and Pence, while the last person abstained. A February 2023 Monmouth poll also found that 34 percent of Evangelical voters said they'd like to see Trump as the nominee, 32 percent said DeSantis, and 3 percent said Pence.\n\nPence is famously known for refusing to challenge the election results on January 6 as Trump demanded ( a power Pence did not even legally have ), and being a major target of the president in the rally leading up to the insurrection. Since then, Pence has called out Trump for endangering his family and other people at the Capitol, though he's also stopped short of full-blown critiques on other issues like the indictment the former president faced in New York.\n\nThe decision to hold back on more aggressive attacks on Trump could be driven by the enduring advantage he still has in the party. \"What we have seen over the last half dozen, eight years now is that Donald Trump is a more durably popular figure than anybody else they've been able to bring down the pike,\" says Johns Hopkins political scientist Daniel Schlozman.\n\nBut between that lack of a clean break with Trump and his constructive work within the administration for most of his tenure as vice president, Pence also has a difficult job appealing to Republicans who completely oppose the former president, making finding his lane all the more difficult. \"The Trumpists are angry with him. The Never Trumpists are mad at him for his being part of the administration and support of an impeached, convicted insurrection promoter. It's a hard path,\" says Republican strategist Chip Felkel.\n\nUpdate, June 7, 11 am ET: This story was originally published on June 1 and has been updated multiple times, most recently to reflect Pence's official announcement.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe then-president reportedly berated Pence in a heated phone call on January 6.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nThursday's January 6 committee hearing focused heavily on one aspect of former President Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election : The pressure campaign he levied against former Vice President Mike Pence and the verbal attacks he used to do so.\n\nLawmakers on the committee spotlighted a reportedly fiery phone call that took place the morning of January 6, which emphasized how Trump targeted Pence despite the fact that multiple experts told him the vice president didn't have the power to overturn the election. It illustrated, too, the escalation in Trump's rhetoric, which the committee linked to violence at the Capitol.\n\nAfter days of pushing Pence to reject the electoral votes - which Pence repeatedly refused to do - Trump called the vice president on January 6. In that call, which multiple staffers described as \"heated,\" Trump reportedly berated Pence, calling him a \"wimp\" and what an assistant to Trump's daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump described as the \"p-word.\"\n\n\"You're not tough enough to make the call,\" Trump reportedly said, according to testimony from Pence's former national security adviser, retired Gen. Keith Kellogg.\n\nFor days, Trump and Pence had gone back and forth over the vice president's role in certifying the election. According to the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act, the vice president's role is to oversee the counting of the ballots and the announcement of the outcome. The committee detailed how Trump adviser John Eastman, a conservative lawyer, convinced the president that vice presidents have the power to adjudicate the legitimacy of electoral votes and to control the counting process. This is false, and Pence and his advisers consistently told Trump so, the committee found.\n\nAfter the January 6 call, Pence stayed committed to completing the election certification as planned and headed to the Capitol. Trump, meanwhile, amended the remarks he was expected to give at the \"Stop the Steal\" rally on the National Mall, going out of his way to call out Pence and his ability to address the unfounded election fraud allegations.\n\n\"Mike Pence, I hope you're going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country. And if you're not, I'm going to be very disappointed in you,\" Trump said in his remarks at the rally.\n\nTrump's remarks, as well as a tweet that he sent later in the afternoon also naming the vice president, fueled vitriol toward Pence, who became the target of the insurrectionists' ire. Rioters chanted \"Hang Mike Pence!\" as they broke into the Capitol, and put up a gallows outside. A confidential informant also told the FBI that members of the Proud Boys would have killed Pence had they found him as well as other lawmakers they encountered, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThe revelations are striking in that they emphasize the intense pressure Pence was under to break the law at the president's behest.

It derives its name from the 1984 breakdancing film Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, a film that is sometimes used as a sarcastic shorthand for an unnecessary sequel . The idea is that the Boogaloo movement hopes to bring about a sequel to the Civil War.\n\nAs Vox's Jane Coaston writes, the movement is \"a loosely connected anti-government movement that has included some white nationalists who believe in an ' accelerationist' ideology that encourages spurring civil disorder to eventually foment the breakdown of the political system entirely.\"\n\nThis right-wing extremist movement is emphatically not associated with Biden, the Democratic Party, Black Lives Matter, or any left-leaning protest movement seeking to prevent police violence. Underwood's death, as far as we know, is related to left-leaning protest movements only to the extent that the Boogaloo boys hope to exploit protests and advance goals that those protesters would likely find repugnant.\n\nAnd yet, to Mike Pence, Underwood's death was just an opportunity to pin violence on his political opponents - regardless of whether the attack has any real basis in fact.\n\nNew goal: 25,000\n\nIn the spring, we launched a program asking readers for financial contributions to help keep Vox free for everyone, and last week, we set a goal of reaching 20,000 contributors.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWhy most conservatives aren't calling for Trump to step aside.\n\nby Jane Coaston\n\nWhat's wrong with Mike Pence?\n\nTo left-leaning observers appalled by what they view as President Donald Trump's reckless behavior and lawbreaking, that's the most mystifying aspect about the Republican Party establishment: Party elites seem determined to stand by the president despite the constant whirl of scandal, inappropriate behavior, and outright chaos that surrounds him.\n\nIt's one thing, these observers might argue, for conservative voters to decide that they would prefer Trump to a Democrat. The proximate question posed by impeachment , however, is whether or not conservative voters would rather see Vice President Pence, a conventional Republican seemingly without the baggage of Trump, take over in the White House.\n\nBut beyond the simple realities of Team Red versus Team Blue, this left-wing viewpoint is all too blinkered, missing the fundamental point of Donald Trump: He isn't just a president for many on the right; he's a bulwark, a fighter, a state of mind with an 87 percent approval rating among Republicans. And Pence? As one conservative pundit told me, \"He's weak and clueless and totally unimpressive.\"\n\nTrump stands accused by his enemies of, in essence, fighting dirty. But to conservatives who sincerely believe themselves to be under assault from an increasingly left-wing movement that itself fights dirty, that's more a feature than a bug.\n\nOf course, there are some conservatives who might not see it this way. As conservative pundit and writer Erick Erickson, who is supportive of the president, wrote earlier this week , \"I think if [Trump] said tomorrow that he had made America great again and was passing things off to Pence, we would be in a better place.\"\n\nSimilarly, to the American Enterprise Institute's Jim Pethokoukis, Trump's advancements on conservative policy priorities are perhaps hindered by the drama and chaos emitting from the White House on a near-daily basis.\n\nIn a conversation with the Atlantic's McKay Coppins , Erickson made the same point, telling Coppins in an email that some activists on the right are getting tired of the circus that is this administration. He added, \"I have talked to a handful of politicians who would never say anything publicly, but they do think 2020 is going to be tough for Trump, and Pence could neutralize some of the antagonism.\"\n\nTo social conservatives who love Trump's judicial nominees but perhaps not Trump himself, Pence does seem like a more appealing personal figure and role model. He was chosen for the vice presidency in part because of his close affinity with evangelical Christians , as well as because of his political experience as governor of Indiana and a member of the House of Representatives.\n\nI asked Rod Dreher, senior editor at the American Conservative, about the possibility of a President Pence, who I said seemed \"certainly more in line with the views and values of social conservatives\" than Trump. Dreher offered this: \"I would rather go to war in 2020 with President Pence than Donald Trump. Certainly, I think a President Pence would be a far more effective leader of the GOP agenda than Trump.\"\n\nBut he went on, telling me, \"But I think we shouldn't kid ourselves. Having Pence as president would require removing Trump, obviously, and the metaphorical violence of that act would have consequences on the right that are hard to predict. The 2020 election, with Pence leading the ticket, would be all about Trump - and, on the right, about avenging him.\"\n\nTo most of the right, however, it's not just the tactical impossibility of swapping in Pence without first waging a brutal intra-party battle that's the problem. Rather, it's the fact that a swath of the conservative movement views Trump as the person best equipped not to advance conservatism, but to fight the left - to them, a more critical effort in 2019.\n\nUnderstand the impeachment process, from its history to what comes next. Explore the full guide here .\n\nI spoke to a number of conservative writers, radio hosts, and pundits for this piece. And many of them agreed that the reason why conservatives weren't happy with the Pence option is the simple fact that Mike Pence is not Donald Trump. Or, as National Review writer David French told me, \"Trump's base believes that Trump - not Pence - is the guy who's best-equipped to fight the Democrats. So that's not their calculation.\"\n\nAnother prominent conservative pundit was even more brutal about Pence, saying, \"I know him well. I've never heard him say an interesting or insightful thing.\"\n\nIt's obvious Pence and Trump are more different than alike as personalities, with Pence as the \"establishment\" choice to some. But to many conservatives, that's a good thing. They're convinced that the real lesson of 2016 is that an aggressive fighter like Trump makes a superior politician to more strait-laced Republicans like Mitt Romney. And that makes Trump look like a far better option than Pence, no matter what.\n\nJosh Hammer, editor-at-large at Daily Wire, told me, \"From a traditional, Reaganite, National Review-esque 'three-legged stool of conservatism' perspective, Pence is undoubtedly more traditional and \"classically conservative\" from Trump.\" But Hammer said that in his view, \"The right is fundamentally under siege from the left,\" and so now \"there is a profound desire by many on the right for a blunt, crass instrument to push back against this.\"\n\nIn our conversation, Hammer referenced the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination hearings , a topic that comes up almost every time I speak with conservatives. And Hammer, like most conservatives I speak with often, drew two lessons from that fight: The left will stop at nothing to smear innocent conservatives, and a typical Republican Party politician, more concerned than Trump with elite opinion, would have backed down and rescinded Kavanaugh's nomination. Trump's decision to fight back under those circumstances, when other Republicans perhaps would not, is emblematic of what Hammer sees as one of his key virtues.\n\n\"Trump encapsulates this mentality - a mentality that refuses to be subdued and easily swept away to the proverbial ash heap of history,\" Hammer said. \"And it is unclear at best if Pence could provide the same.\"\n\nThe idea that Trump is a bulwark against the excesses of the left, or, as Dreher told me, a \"kind of katechon - a force that holds back something much worse,\" is a common sentiment among conservative voters, if not among elected members of the Republican Party. While Trump might be, in their view, uncouth, unfair, even immoral and a hindrance to the growth of the conservative movement, they view the left as the real threat, a threat only Trump has seemed able to stand up against.\n\nAnd to many Trump-supportive conservatives, the impulse to fight on Trump's behalf against his critics on the left and in the media is intimately tied to their own sense that they themselves are constantly targeted in unfair ways by those same forces.\n\nBen Shapiro, the popular podcast and radio host told me, \"People feel that no honest standard has been applied to conservatives, and they feel that Trump has been targeted just as they have.\"\n\nOr as Dreher put it, \"At least Donald Trump doesn't actively hate people like me.\"\n\nIt's no wonder, then, that many conservatives, with a wide range of views on Trump as a person, firmly believe that he poses far less of a risk to them than Democrats and the left - forces that Trump seems uniquely able to defeat. In Trump, some see versions of themselves, making them feel both sympathetic to Trump's plight, and largely unwilling to surrender him to the forces urging on his impeachment - even if, in his place, would come a President Pence.\n\nOur podcast explains how Ukraine finds itself at the center of the American political drama, yet President Trump is the least of the country's worries.\n\nLooking for a quick way to keep up with the never-ending news cycle?

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nTime and time again, Pence dutifully implemented Trump's disastrous coronavirus agenda.\n\nby German Lopez\n\nVice President Mike Pence went into Wednesday's vice presidential debate versus Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with a big stain on his record: his prominent leadership role in the White House's failed response to Covid-19 .\n\n\"The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,\" Harris said, referring to Trump and Pence's approach to Covid-19.\n\nStarting in February, Pence was made the head of the White House's coronavirus task force, which was charged with coordinating the federal response to the pandemic on a day-to-day basis. This put Pence in a leadership position for everything dealing with the coronavirus: testing, scaling up production and distribution of protective equipment, creating public health guidelines, spurring production of a vaccine, and so on - none of which, save the potential future success of a vaccine, went well.\n\nPence and the task force still answered to President Donald Trump. As Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, said upon Pence's appointment: \"He is uniquely qualified for this because of his close relationship to the president. Basically there's no confusion that the president's in charge.\"\n\nIt was an admission that Pence would be a yes-man, spearheading and implementing Trump's Covid-19 agenda - an agenda that has focused on downplaying the pandemic and urging the country to reopen rather than containing a disease that's so far killed more than 210,000 Americans.\n\nPence is \"basically just a parrot for the president,\" Céline Gounder, an epidemiologist at New York University and CNN medical analyst, told me. \"He just comes across as a more sane adult.\"\n\nAt first, Pence's position put him at the forefront of the Trump administration's botched rollout of coronavirus tests. The White House effectively punted the issue down to the states and private sector, calling the federal government merely \"a supplier of last resort\" - which the New York Times described as \"perhaps one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in generations.\"\n\nPence claimed \"any American could be tested\" in March only to acknowledge days later that \"we don't have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward.\" The US struggled for months to build up testing - it still doesn't have enough, many experts argue - and Pence was often the public face of that failure, like when he had to call governors to talk them down from fiercely criticizing the administration.\n\nAs the epidemic continued, Pence's positions were often an echo of Trump's. When Trump pushed for places to reopen quickly, Pence called on states to implement phased reopening plans. When Trump denied coronavirus cases were spiking over the summer, Pence said the rise was a result of more testing and wrote an op-ed titled \"There Isn't a Coronavirus 'Second Wave'\" - an argument that was proven wrong within weeks. As Trump attempted to bend public health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to do his political bidding, Pence's staff led the push to get the CDC to loosen its guidelines for reopening schools.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. More than 210,000 people have died from Covid-19 so far in the US - the highest death toll in the world . Among developed countries , the US has the fourth-highest death rate relative to its population, with America recently surpassing the UK as more than 700 Americans continue dying of the coronavirus each day.\n\nMuch of this is, of course, on Trump and his erratic leadership. (The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.)\n\nBut Pence closely tied himself to Trump's response, as the chair of the White House task force and a constant advocate for the president. So far, Pence hasn't publicly criticized the administration's response to Covid-19 once - but he has defended it plenty as one of the administration's leaders on this issue.\n\nHe is as close to this mess as anyone but Trump can get.\n\nTrump's failures on Covid-19 are now well-known. He's called for states to reopen quickly despite experts' warnings. He's pushed for less testing . He's mocked masks and often refused to wear one - even after falling sick with the virus himself. And even as he deals with his own case of Covid-19, he's continued to downplay the virus, doing everything in his power to push a message that America is back to normal in order to boost his reelection chances.\n\nBut much of the behind-the-scenes work that's enabled Trump and implemented his agenda was done by the White House's task force - led by the vice president. Trump summarized the setup at the time of Pence's appointment: \"Mike is going to be in charge, and Mike will report back to me.\"\n\nAs the coronavirus became a more prominent threat in the US over February, and as the country struggled to build up testing in what experts now call a \"lost month,\" the Trump administration scrambled to right its response. The White House put Pence in charge of fixing the mess.\n\nIt's not clear why, given Pence's bad record on public health issues. When he was governor of Indiana, parts of the state saw spikes in HIV cases, largely because Pence refused to allow needle exchanges - a public health intervention with decades of evidence behind it - in the state. The epidemic only subsided once Pence, under public and expert pressure, eventually gave in and allowed needle exchanges .\n\nBefore that, in 2001, Pence wrote an op-ed claiming that \"smoking doesn't kill\" - flouting the decades of scientific evidence proving otherwise.\n\nOne of Pence's first tasks on the coronavirus task force was to muzzle officials that contradicted Trump's positive spin. For much of February, Trump claimed that the US had kept the coronavirus under control and even said at one point that it would soon disappear \"like a miracle.\" But a CDC official, Nancy Messonnier, on February 25 contradicted Trump's magical thinking, telling reporters that Americans should prepare for community spread of the coronavirus, social distancing, and the possibility that \"disruption to everyday life might be severe.\" It was the right call, as we now know, but the negative outlook reportedly angered Trump .\n\nTwo days later, the New York Times reported , the White House moved to take control of public messaging on the coronavirus, requiring federal public health officials and scientists to \"coordinate all statements and public appearances with the office of Vice President Mike Pence.\" From then on, the bulk of federal communication came from the White House press conferences, which spanned from genuinely helpful advice by officials like Anthony Fauci to Trump musing about injecting bleach as a Covid-19 treatment.\n\nThe dynamic - Trump pushing for something and Pence or his task force making it happen - has continued throughout the pandemic.\n\nAs the summer's coronavirus surge began, Trump and his administration pushed back on the possibility of a spike, arguing that any increase was an artifact of more tests picking up more cases. Pence put that into writing in his op-ed denying a \"second wave,\" boasting that Covid-19 cases and deaths were in decline across the US in \"a testament to the leadership of President Trump.\" Within days, it was clear that Covid-19 cases were rising. Within weeks, the US hit records for daily new coronavirus cases as new outbreaks popped up in Southern and Western states, particularly, Arizona, Florida, and Texas, and eventually the rest of the country.\n\nEven with these outbreaks in the background, Trump continued his demands that states reopen quickly. That included schools, with Trump publicly criticizing the CDC's guidance on schools as \"very tough\" and \"expensive.\" Once again, Pence dutifully implemented what Trump asked for: As the Times reported , Pence's staff, including his chief of staff, pressured the CDC to relax its guidelines. The agency eventually gave in .\n\nIn a similar scenario, Trump said he told his people to \"slow the testing down, please,\" because, in his view, more tests made the US look bad. It's unclear how personally involved Pence was in this, but, at least under his watch, the White House task force pushed the CDC to in effect recommend less testing : The agency no longer said people without symptoms should get tested if they come into close contact with someone known to have Covid-19. The CDC later reversed course - once again recommending testing for people without symptoms - after experts nearly universally condemned the politically motivated change.\n\nOn masks, Pence has similarly imitated Trump, refusing to wear masks at meetings and campaign events , including those in states where masks are supposed to be mandatory under the law.\n\nThe result of Trump and Pence's leadership: The US leads the world in Covid-19 deaths. If you control for population, the country is still among the worst: The US is now in the top 15 percent for Covid-19 deaths per capita among developed nations , with seven times the death rate as the median wealthy country. If the US had the same Covid-19 death rate as Canada, more than 125,000 more Americans would likely be alive today.\n\nTo make matters worse, the US is still extremely vulnerable to the coronavirus - something underlined by Trump's infection, confirmed last week. (Pence has so far avoided the same fate, testing negative multiple times.)\n\nExperts also warn that the US should brace itself for a potential surge of the virus this fall and winter . School reopenings are already leading to some large outbreaks, particularly in colleges and universities. The cold in northern parts of the country will push people inside, where the virus has an easier time spreading than it does outdoors. Friends and family will likely come together for holidays such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Eve. On top of all that, another flu season may be around the corner.\n\nThe US is vulnerable to all of this because the federal government, under Trump and Pence, has done such a poor job responding to Covid-19. The US still doesn't have enough tests - with a positive rate of 5 percent only meeting the bare minimum experts recommend and above the 3 percent some experts believe is necessary. Contact tracing is nonexistent in much of the country, with experts estimating the number of contact tracers nationwide is less than half of what it needs to be. Americans' adherence to masking is still spotty, with 17 states still not mandating masks. Cities, counties, and states are now reopening high-risk settings, such as bars and indoor dining, under pressure from Trump, Pence, and other Republican leaders.\n\nGiven all of this, some experts worry that the worst is yet to come. \"The next number in the fall is likely going to shoot way up,\" Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, told me . \"Likely well beyond 65,000, 70,000\" - the summer's previous peak. \"I think this fall is going to be the biggest spike of all.\"\n\nThis isn't because the answers to Covid-19 are unknown. The solutions are all the things that experts have called for again and again throughout the pandemic: social distancing, testing and tracing, and masking. That's what the research supports , and what the experience of places ranging from San Francisco to New York to Germany and South Korea shows.\n\n\"It's not rocket science. It's not that we need some new thing that hasn't been thought of before,\" Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me . \"There are things that have been done in some cases, or can be done. But if there was a stronger, coordinated federal role ... that could really make a difference. It's happened in other countries.\"\n\nBy failing to adequately support these policies, Trump and Pence have left America with one of the worst Covid-19 epidemics in the world, and on very shaky ground as the risk of fall and winter coronavirus surges looms.\n\nDespite this, the Trump administration hasn't shown a willingness to change its approach. Even after Trump got sick with Covid-19, he and his staff have continued pushing the idea that everything is fine - with Trump tweeting , \"Don't be afraid of Covid. Don't let it dominate your life.\" Pence has also downplayed the need for stricter measures, down to plexiglass at the vice presidential debate , as the White House does everything it can to avoid reminding people that the coronavirus is still very much around.\n\nIt's this record, one in which Pence consistently stuck with Trump's botched response, that followed the vice president at Wednesday's debate.\n\nYou've read 1 article in the last month\n\nHere at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you - threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.\n\nOur mission is to provide clear, accessible journalism that empowers you to stay informed and engaged in shaping our world.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nEmphasize your popular positions and your opponents' unpopular ones.\n\nby Matthew Yglesias\n\nDonald Trump seems likely to lose this election, and if Wednesday night's vice presidential debate ends up being important to the outcome, that would be a freakish and historically bizarre conclusion.\n\nBut viewed in isolation, Vice President Mike Pence's performance was a master class in how to play a weak hand strongly. Liberals ought to pay attention to the way he outperformed Sen. Kamala Harris because it's a reminder that not every Republican politician is as inept as Trump.\n\nWhat Pence did is not that complicated. Time after time, exchange after exchange, regardless of the question, he relentlessly focused on popular Republican positions and unpopular Democratic ones - positioning the Trump/Pence ticket as the moderate choice compared to Biden/Harris, which he cast as a radical and risky alternative.\n\nPence's job was to try to stanch the bleeding his ticket has been experiencing and subject the opposition to some scrutiny, and it largely worked. But Harris avoided any damaging gaffes, and the debate was most memorable for the fact that a fly landed on Pence's head. Under the circumstances, that's a good enough outcome for Biden/Harris. But while this debate is not going to determine the outcome of the presidency, it's a good lesson in the reality that with Trump's antics offstage, Republicans can win an argument.\n\nMidway through the debate, moderator Susan Page asked Pence a good question about abortion - if Roe v. Wade were repealed, would you want to ban all abortions? It's a good question because this has important implications for people's lives, and it's a tough question for Pence because his answer (yes) is very unpopular.\n\nSo Pence did what good politicians do under those circumstances: He didn't answer the question.\n\nInstead, he delivered a response that poked at Democrats for their handling of Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation, nodded at the idea that liberal opposition to Amy Coney Barrett is driven by anti-Catholic sentiment , and noted that the Harris/Biden ticket holds unpopular views on abortion, like that taxpayer funds should be available for the procedure.\n\nHarris, taking her turn at the question, was much less sharp. She didn't note that Pence dodged the question. She didn't describe the actual Trump/Pence position on abortion, which is unpopular. She made a process argument about Barrett. And then she got sucked into an extended debate on court-packing where she, being a skilled lawyer and knowledgeable about the judiciary, made some good points. But she got caught in a bind trying to avoid answering the question of whether a Biden administration would support court-packing and she couldn't turn the conversation away from it.\n\nAnd this was the pattern time and again throughout the debate. Once the initial exchange on Covid-19 had passed, Pence downplayed his administration's more extreme views and Harris failed to highlight them.\n\nThe public opinion low point of the Trump administration came in 2018 when they passed a sharply regressive tax cut that delivered the overwhelming majority of its benefits to the wealthiest Americans. That record ought to be a major weak point for the Trump/Pence ticket both because the bill was unpopular and because it revealed the extent to which their priority is enriching the richest people in the country.\n\nBut when discussing taxes, Pence hewed to the talking point that the average family of four saved $2,000 a year and that Biden had promised to repeal the Trump tax cuts, thus raising taxes on everyone.\n\nHarris protested that Biden has promised not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000. But Pence kept circling back to the repeal point. Harris didn't manage to explain how Biden's plan actually works, and she was unable to explain that the Trump tax bill overwhelmingly delivered cuts to corporations, non-corporate businesses, and heirs to multimillion-dollar fortunes while actually managing to raise taxes on at least some middle-class households.\n\nSimilarly, faced with questions on climate change, Pence positioned the administration as moderate - eager to protect clean air and clean water but averse to the supposed extremes of the Green New Deal. In fact, air pollution is getting worse during the Trump years because even as science increasingly indicates that air pollution is more harmful than previously believed , the Trump administration is rolling back every clean air and clean water regulation in sight.\n\nBut, like on taxes and on abortion, Harris didn't manage to mention the Trump/Pence administration's unpopular record, instead allowing all the focus to be placed on arguing the merits of the Biden approach.\n\nWhat Harris did instead was repeatedly get visibly annoyed at the way Pence would go over time, attack her or Biden in dishonest ways, or misrepresent his own record. In the grand tradition of debate-as-theater-criticism, pundits will inevitably question whether this played badly, like Al Gore's infamous sighing in the 2000 debate. Pence talking over a female moderator and repeatedly interrupting his female opponent was an experience that spoke in a profound way to many of the professional women I know, and will further amplify this segment of the Democratic base's rage against Trump and the GOP.\n\nBut if you're not keyed into those dynamics in that specific way, the basic problem is that misleading rhetoric is a thing that happens in politics. And when it happens to you live on a debate stage, you need to do something about it - something like point out that your opponent is ducking questions and misrepresenting his positions. And you need to argue that it's happening for a reason, like that his real positions are unpopular and his entire agenda serves as a smokescreen for powerful pernicious interests.\n\nThis is something Democrats have struggled with for years, and Harris is not unique. The way the Democratic Party coalition works is that a politician who failed to stand up for a base group's key issues would become a figure of distrust. The GOP coalition is more forgiving. Companies that want to dump more toxic waste in the water don't mind if their allies pretend to support the Clean Water Act. And billionaires who want the estate tax cut think it's fine if their allies pretend to be populist champions of workers' rights. But the most effective Democratic politicians, from Barack Obama on down, find ways to cut through the rhetoric and discuss the reality that Republicans adhere to a lot of extreme positions on economic issues.\n\nHarris didn't do that. She didn't bring up the minimum wage, or the way Trump's payroll tax shenanigans jeopardize Social Security, or any of a half-dozen other bread-and-butter Democratic Party go-tos. Harris is a donor favorite and the likely future of Democratic Party politics. But having come up in California, she has essentially no experience with running races where she needs to appeal to moderate cross-pressured voters. Pence has also spent his entire career running in a safe House seat and then statewide in a very red state. But somewhere along the way, he has picked up the knack for focusing on his good issues and downplaying his bad ones. Harris hasn't, and it showed.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

It was also the last HIV testing center in the county. By 2015, an HIV outbreak was brewing in the state. At the peak of the outbreak, 20 new cases were being diagnosed per week, with a total of nearly 200 cases eventually reported, according to HuffPost .\n\nBut that Congress member, who became Indiana's governor, didn't want to authorize a needle-exchange program to stop the spread of the virus.\n\n\"I don't believe effective anti-drug policy involves handing out drug paraphernalia,\" he said .\n\nThat Indiana governor was, of course, Mike Pence. Now he's the vice president, and on Wednesday, President Trump put him in charge of fighting coronavirus in the US.\n\n\"He's got a certain talent for this,\" Trump said.\n\nBut others say the opposite is true. In Indiana, cuts to Planned Parenthood meant that \"when the state experienced an HIV outbreak, they were unprepared to respond to it,\" Mary Alice Carter, a senior adviser at Equity Forward, a reproductive-health watchdog group, told Vox. Pence's role in cutting Planned Parenthood funding showed a \"short-sightedness\" that makes Trump's decision to put him in charge of coronavirus response concerning, Carter said. (The White House has not responded to a request for comment from Vox on the selection of Pence for the position.)\n\nMoreover, Pence and his history are part of a bigger problem in the Trump administration, Carter and others say. In general, the administration has sought to restrict funding to Planned Parenthood and other groups, reproductive health advocates say, without regard to the public health implications. The administration's policies have already made it harder for low-income Americans to get screening for conditions like breast and cervical cancer. And some fear that, especially with Pence in charge, the administration could put politics over science when it comes to coronavirus response too.\n\n\"The ongoing concern is whether you let science and medicine lead an effort or whether you let ideology run your policy,\" Carter said.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has long been a target for anti-abortion groups because some of its affiliates offer the procedure, but for years, it has also functioned as a safety-net health care provider for millions of Americans, offering STI testing, cervical cancer screening, and other services at low or no cost. In order to do this, the group has received public funding from a number of state and federal sources.\n\nCutting that funding has been a Republican priority for years. The Hyde Amendment already bans federal funding for nearly all abortions, but for many years, Planned Parenthood was still able to use federal funds for other health services. Getting rid of that funding, abortion opponents argued , would indirectly make it harder for the group to perform abortions.\n\nPence was essentially the architect of this strategy, as Sarah Kliff reported at Vox in 2016. In Congress, he proposed bills to cut funding to the group repeatedly beginning in 2007, and one finally passed the House in 2011.\n\n\"If Planned Parenthood wants to be involved in providing counseling services and HIV testing, they ought not be in the business of providing abortions,\" Pence told Kliff. \"As long as they aspire to do that, I'll be after them.\"\n\nThe 2011 legislation did not make it through the Senate . But states also joined in the effort, with Indiana chief among them. In 2005, Planned Parenthood got $3.3 million from the state of Indiana; in 2014, it got just $1.9 million, according to Indy100 .\n\nThose cuts started before Pence became governor, but they continued under his administration. Indeed, during his governorship, overall funding for public health in the state decreased, Beth Meyerson, a research professor at the University of Arizona's Southwest Institute for Research on Women and co-director of the Rural Center for AIDS/STD Prevention at the Indiana University School of Public Health, told Vox.\n\nIn 2013, Pence's first year as governor, the only Planned Parenthood in Scott County closed, leaving 24,000 people without an HIV testing center.\n\nBy 2015, health officials were seeing HIV infections linked to intravenous drug use in Scott County, Erin Schumaker reported at HuffPost : \"Scott County residents were sharing needles to inject their opioids, and nobody was getting tested.\"\n\nPublic health experts called for a needle-exchange program to make sure people got clean needles, but Pence refused, Meryl Kornfield reports at the Washington Post . He said he would veto any bill for such a program.\n\nFinally, over two months after the HIV outbreak was reported, Pence said he would pray on the issue, according to the New York Times . Two days later, he issued an executive order for syringes to be distributed in Scott County.\n\nThe distribution helped stop the epidemic, according to the Times. But Pence didn't actually allocate new money for the program, or for fighting the epidemic generally, forcing state officials to cut other health programs, Meyerson said: \"overall, his governorship showed that he did not commit to an adequately funded public health infrastructure.\"\n\nThen, in 2016, Pence was elected vice president. And the effort to cut funding to Planned Parenthood that he had championed for nearly a decade became a priority for the Trump administration.\n\nLast year, the administration issued a rule barring Planned Parenthood and other groups that perform or refer for abortions from getting federal funding through Title X, a program aimed at providing family planning services to low-income Americans. As a result, nearly 1,000 health centers around the country have lost funding, making it harder for many Americans to get necessary services like cancer screening or HIV tests.\n\nThe move was doubly concerning because for many people, Title-X-funded clinics \"are really the first line of defense in public health,\" Carter said. For many low-income patients, their health-care provider at such a clinic may be the only provider they see all year.\n\n\"You may go in for birth control and come out knowing you need to get a flu shot,\" Carter said, and family planning clinics can also help patients sign up for Medicaid and other services.\n\nMeanwhile, Planned Parenthood has played a crucial role in previous public health crises, doing outreach around prevention of the Zika virus and offering water filters in Michigan during the Flint water crisis.\n\nToday, the Trump administration is tasked with responding to coronavirus, with Pence, one of Planned Parenthood's most long-standing opponents, at the head of that effort. It's not clear yet how the group will be involved, if at all, in fighting coronavirus. But its leadership has already expressed concern over the selection of Pence to lead the government's response.\n\n\"Pence has long been obsessed with defunding Planned Parenthood, even when Planned Parenthood closures in the state affected one of Indiana's worst public health crises,\" said Jacqueline Ayers, vice president of government relations and public policy at Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a statement on Thursday. \"There's no evidence he has learned any lessons since then.\"\n\nCarter also noted the administration's attitude to Planned Parenthood raises questions about how it will respond to coronavirus. For example, she asked, would it ship a virus testing kit to a Planned Parenthood facility?\n\nMore broadly, the administration and its officials have a record of disregarding medical evidence or the advice of experts, Carter and others say. Pence, for example, went against the guidance of public health officials when he opposed a needle-exchange program. (And in 2000, he claimed in an op-ed that \" smoking does not kill .\") Later, when the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups asked the Trump administration not to bar Planned Parenthood and other groups from getting Title X funds, arguing that the move would harm public health, the administration did it anyway.\n\nThe issue goes beyond Planned Parenthood. In 2017, the Trump administration reinstated and expanded the \"global gag rule,\" which bars health care providers abroad that receive US government aid from providing, referring for, or discussing abortion.\n\nExperts have long said the rule, enacted by previous Republican presidents but broadened by Trump to apply restrictions to a larger share of government funds, would not reduce abortions but would instead jeopardize providers' ability to offer cancer screenings, contraception, and prenatal care. Indeed, a 2019 study found that access to HIV testing and screening for breast and cervical cancers, among other services, had been reduced across several countries as a result of the rule.\n\nAlso in 2017, six members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV and AIDS resigned in protest , with one writing in Newsweek that \"the Trump administration has no strategy to address the ongoing H.I.V./AIDS epidemic, seeks zero input from experts to formulate H.I.V. policy, and - most concerning - pushes legislation that will harm people living with H.I.V. and halt or reverse important gains made in the fight against this disease.\"\n\nThen, in 2019, the Trump administration cut funding for fetal-tissue research , despite long-standing arguments by scientific and medical experts that such research is crucial for developing vaccines and treatments for diseases. Research into AIDS and other conditions has already suffered as a result , Carter said.\n\nThe failure to listen to experts in the past raises questions about the administration's coronavirus response today, Carter said. For example, \"are we going to see immigration policies put in place, or travel restrictions put in place, that are scientifically based or based on race or country of origin?\"\n\nMoreover, the research on coronavirus is constantly evolving, and Americans need someone in charge of the response who can sift through it with a focus on data, not ideology, Meyerson said.\n\n\"We need a strong, clear, transparent, public health evidence-based communicator who will coordinate among agencies and who will manage upward in our current draconian administration,\" she explained. When it comes to Pence, \"there's no evidence that he will handle that job and do it in the way the American people need.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Trump's pressure on Pence to reject the 2020 election results (which Pence said endangered his family's life on Jan. 6) prompted a rift in their relationship, and prompted Pence to argue on the campaign trial that his efforts to overturn his election loss should be disqualifying.\n\nAsked who he plans to vote for in the general election, Pence said, \"Like most Americans, I'm going to keep my vote to myself.\"\n\n\"I would never vote for Joe Biden,\" Pence said when asked if he would vote for Biden. \"How I vote when that curtain closes, that will be for me.\"\n\nPence dismissed the idea of backing a third-party candidate or himself running as a third-party candidate, saying \"I'm a Republican.\"\n\nLater on in the interview, when asked if he'd run as third-party candidate, Pence more clearly dismissed that idea, saying, \"I'm a Republican.\"\n\nPence acknowledged the fact that Republican primary voters have made their choice clear, and said he plans to spend the rest of the year pushing for \"what we should be for.\"\n\n\"Republican primary voters have made it clear, Martha, who they're for in this election,\" Pence said. \"What I'm going to spend the rest of the year is talking about what we should be for - the broad mainstream conservative agenda that has defined our party and always made America strong and prosperous and free.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Pence never directly ruled out voting for Trump in 2024 but repeatedly said, \"I don't think I'll have to.\"\n\nHe argued Republicans would select a \"new standard bearer\" before Trump this week secured enough delegates to presumptively be the GOP nominee.\n\nAfter warning against what he called the \"siren song of populism,\" Pence's political advocacy organization, Advancing American Freedom, announced plans last month to invest $20 million in a program intended to uphold conservatism as \"bigger than any one moment, election, or person\" -- in a not so thinly-veiled swipe against Trump and CPAC.\n\nAfter Pence suspended his campaign in October last year, Trump urged his former running mate to endorse him, saying he \"made him vice president\" and that he \"had a successful presidency.\"\n\nTrump also complained about \"disloyalty\" in politics, a topic Trump had frequently mentioned earlier this election cycle while attacking former 2024 rivals like Floria Gov.

      "text": "Pence told Jan. 6 special counsel harrowing details about 2020 aftermath, warnings to Trump: Sources\n\nThe former VP is the top official known to have spoken with investigators.\n\nSpeaking with special counsel Jack Smith's team earlier this year, former Vice President Mike Pence offered harrowing details about how, in the wake of the 2020 presidential election , then-President Donald Trump surrounded himself with \"crank\" attorneys, espoused \"un-American\" legal theories, and almost pushed the country toward a \"constitutional crisis,\" according to sources familiar with what Pence told investigators.\n\nThe sources said Pence also told investigators he's \"sure\" that -- in the days before Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob tried to stop Congress from certifying the election -- he informed Trump he still hadn't seen evidence of significant election fraud, but Trump was unmoved, continuing to claim the election was \"stolen\" and acting \"recklessly\" on that \"tragic day.\"\n\nPence is the highest-ranking current or former government official known to have spoken with the special counsel team investigating efforts to overturn the 2020 election . What he allegedly told investigators, described exclusively to ABC News, sheds further light on the evidence Smith's team has amassed as it prosecutes Trump for allegedly trying to unlawfully \"remain in power\" and \"erode public faith\" in democratic institutions.\n\nPence could take the stand against Trump should Smith's election interference case go to trial, which is currently slated to occur in March.\n\nAs described to ABC News, much of what the former vice president told Smith's investigators mirrored -- and at times restated verbatim -- comments he has previously made publicly. Questions from Smith's team repeatedly focused on a book Pence published last year, with investigators apparently seeking to have Pence confirm -- under oath -- an array of post-election stories and opinions he included in the book.\n\nBut speaking with Smith's team behind closed doors, Pence also offered previously-undisclosed anecdotes and details showing how his longtime friendship with Trump unraveled in the final weeks of their time in the White House, including Pence's repeated warnings to Trump about the then-president's push to overturn the election results.\n\nSources said that in at least one interview with Pence, Smith's investigators pressed the former vice president on personal notes he took after meetings with Trump and others, which investigators obtained from the National Archives.\n\nAccording to sources, one of Pence's notes obtained by Smith's team shows that, days before Pence was set to preside over Congress certifying the election results on Jan. 6, 2021, he momentarily decided that he would skip the proceedings altogether, writing in the note that there were \"too many questions\" and it would otherwise be \"too hurtful to my friend.\" But he ultimately concluded he had a duty to show up.\n\nSpeaking with Smith's team, Pence insisted his loyalty to President Trump at the time never faltered -- \"My only higher loyalty was to God and the Constitution,\" sources described Pence as telling them.\n\nSources said that investigators' questioning became so granular at times that they pressed Pence over the placement of a comma in his book: When recounting a phone call with Trump on Christmas Day 2020, Pence wrote in his book that he told Trump, \"You know, I don't think I have the authority to change the outcome\" of the election on Jan. 6.\n\nBut Pence allegedly told Smith's investigators that the comma should have never been placed there. According to sources, Pence told Smith's investigators that he actually meant to write in his book that he admonished Trump, \"You know I don't think I have the authority to change the outcome,\" suggesting Trump was well aware of the limitations of Pence's authority days before Jan. 6 -- a line Smith includes in his indictment.\n\nIn April, ABC News reported that Pence had just testified before a federal grand jury in Washington. Two months later, in June, Pence launched a bid to challenge Trump as the Republican Party's next presidential candidate -- but Pence's campaign lasted only four months .\n\nSources said Pence acknowledged to Smith's team that even before Election Day on Nov. 3, 2020, he was aware that the Trump-Pence ticket was expected to take a big early lead in the polls that would then gradually fade as more mail-in ballots were counted.\n\nIn the first few days after the election, Pence never saw any \"significant allegations of fraud,\" according to what he told Smith's team, sources said. But Trump still declared victory -- and claimed there was \"a major fraud in our nation\" -- within hours of polls closing, though Pence allegedly told investigators he believes Trump was speaking \"in very general terms,\" not about specific instances of fraud.\n\nAt the same time, Trump privately instructed Pence to dig into any potential fraud or \"irregularities\" in the election, telling Pence their campaign \"was going to fight,\" in court and elsewhere, Pence allegedly told Smith's team.\n\nHowever, sources told ABC News, Pence said he grew concerned when, within days of the election, Trump began ignoring the advice of credible and experienced attorneys inside the White House, instead relying on outside attorneys like Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, who pushed notions of widespread election fraud and, as Pence allegedly told Smith's team, \"did a great disservice to the president and a great disservice to the country.\"\n\nThere is \"no doubt\" that Trump \"knew what I thought of those attorneys,\" but he still listened to them, Pence told Smith's investigators, according to sources.\n\nIn his interviews with Smith's team, Pence recalled a meeting he had alone with Trump inside the Oval Office on Dec. 21, 2020, as the campaign's legal challenges across the country were failing but Trump was continuing to claim the election was stolen and had begun urging supporters to gather in Washington, D.C., for a \"big protest\" on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nWhen Trump privately asked Pence what they should do, Pence said he told the then-president that if nothing changed, \"[you] should simply accept the results,\" \"you should take a bow,\" travel the country to thank supporters, \"and then run again if you want.\"\n\n\"And I'll never forget, he pointed at me ... as if to say, 'That's worth thinking about.' And he walked [away],\" Pence recalled to investigators, sources said.\n\nHowever, two days later -- as noted in Smith's election interference-related indictment against Trump -- Trump \"re-tweeted a memo titled 'Operation PENCE CARD,' which falsely asserted that the Vice President could, among other things, unilaterally disqualify legitimate electors from six targeted states.\"\n\nWhen Pence, on his way to Colorado for Christmas vacation, saw Trump's post, he turned to his wife and said, \"Here we go,\" he recalled to Smith's investigators, sources said.\n\nAs Pence described it to investigators, according to sources, he understood by late December 2020 that the Trump campaign had run out of legal options in its fight to remain in power -- but he urged lawmakers to raise potentially credible allegations of fraud during the upcoming proceedings on Jan. 6, 2021, when Pence would be presiding over Congress to certify the election results and decide whether to reject any votes.\n\nIn a meeting at the White House in late December 2020, as many as 20 House Republicans erupted in applause after Pence told them to \"get your evidence together\" and assured them \"we [will] get our day in Congress,\" with an opportunity for all of the evidence to be heard before the election would be certified, sources said he told Smith's team.\n\nPence told investigators he was then still \"very open to the possibility that there was voter fraud\" in the election, and he was focused on following the facts and the law, according to the sources.\n\nAt the same time, Trump was privately pressing Pence to reject certain votes at the Jan. 6 proceedings and block certification of the election -- and Trump even suggested to Pence that perhaps he should skip the session altogether, Pence allegedly told Smith's team. But, according to sources, Pence told investigators that he \"clearly and repeatedly\" emphasized to Trump that rejecting certain votes would violate the Constitution.\n\n\"I told him I thought there was no idea more un-American than the idea that any one person could decide what electoral votes to count,\" Pence allegedly told Smith's team, echoing what he has said before in his book and other public forums. \"I made it very plain to him that it was inconsistent with our history and tradition.\"\n\nPence insisted that in America, under the Constitution establishing three co-equal branches of government, election disputes are resolved by courts and elected lawmakers, sources said.\n\nBut, the sources said, with the pressure on Pence mounting, he concluded on Christmas Eve -- just for a moment -- that he would follow Trump's suggestion and let someone else preside over the proceedings on Jan. 6, writing in his notes that doing otherwise would be \"too hurtful to my friend.\"\n\n\"Not feeling like I should attend electoral count,\" Pence wrote in his notes in late December. \"Too many questions, too many doubts, too hurtful to my friend. Therefore I'm not going to participate in certification of election.\"\n\nThen, sitting across the table from his son, a Marine, while on vacation in Colorado, his son said to him, \"Dad, you took the same oath I took\" -- it was \"an oath to support and defend the Constitution,\" Pence recalled to Smith's investigators, sources said.\n\nThat's when Pence decided he would be at the Capitol on Jan. 6 after all, according to the sources.\n\nSmith's federal indictment against Trump, filed in August, repeatedly refers to Pence, including Trump's unsuccessful efforts \"to enlist\" him.\n\nThe indictment says Trump's claims of outcome-determinative fraud in the election \"were false, and [Trump] knew that they were false,\" in part because Pence, \"who personally stood to gain by remaining in office,\" already told Trump \"he had seen no evidence of outcome-determinative fraud.\"\n\nSenior White House attorneys, senior Justice Department officials, senior staffers on Trump's campaign, officials at the Department of Homeland Security, and state and federal courts across the country had offered similar assessments to Trump, the indictment notes.\n\nBut Trump repeated claims of widespread election fraud anyway to, among other things, \"create an intense national atmosphere of mistrust and anger,\" according to the indictment. And in his public statements on the morning of Jan. 6, Trump \"directed\" supporters to the Capitol \"to obstruct the certification proceeding and exert pressure\" on Pence, the indictment alleges.\n\n\"After it became public on the afternoon of January 6 that the Vice President would not fraudulently alter the election results, a large and angry crowd -- including many individuals whom the Defendant had deceived into believing the Vice President could and might change the election results -- violently attacked the Capitol and halted the proceeding,\" the indictment says.\n\nAccording to sources, when Pence spoke with Smith's team earlier this year, he said Trump's words that morning \"didn't help,\" and he said Trump \"acted recklessly\" as the Capitol was under siege. But Pence also said he will \"never believe\" Trump meant for Jan. 6 to become violent.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in the case and denied any wrongdoing. He recently accused Pence of \"mak[ing] up stories about me, which are absolutely false.\"\n\n\"I never said for him to put me before the Constitution,\" Trump posted to his social media platform, Truth Social, in September. \"Mike failed badly on calling out Voter Fraud in the 2020 Presidential Election.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Trump told ABC News, \"Tens of millions of Americans, including Vice President Pence, as he repeatedly stated himself, have had grave and serious concerns about the legitimacy of the rigged and stolen 2020 Presidential Election, further proving that the lawless indictment against President Trump should be summarily dismissed.\"\n\nPence has never described the election as \"stolen,\" and in his public statements -- as well as what sources said he told Smith's investigators -- he has said he didn't have concerns about widespread fraud, but instead about \"irregularities\" in how elections were managed.\n\nA spokesperson for Smith and a spokesperson for Pence both declined to comment to ABC News.\n\nIn an overnight court filing, Trump's attorneys suggested -- without evidence -- that Pence may have been under pressure to incriminate Trump when he testified before the special counsel, given the Justice Department's separate investigation into Pence's handling of classified materials after leaving the White House.\n\nIn January of this year, Pence's attorneys notified the government of a handful of documents with classified markings that were found at his Indiana home , prompting the FBI to conduct a search where they found one additional classified document.\n\nThe DOJ's National Security Division informed Pence in June that they had closed their investigation into the matter, and that no criminal charges would be sought.\n\n\"The potential criminal charges faced by Vice President Pence gave him an incentive to curry favor with authorities by providing information that is consistent with the Biden Administration's preferred, and false, narrative regarding this case,\" Trump attorney Todd Blanche said in a filing Monday evening that was filed with the court before news broke regarding the details of what Pence told investigators.\n\nBlanche, in the filing, asks a judge to compel the government to hand over all information related to the government's investigation of Pence's handling of classified information, arguing it could have bearing on his \"credibility and bias\" as a potential witness against Trump.\n\nThe filing could telegraph a potential strategy Trump's attorneys hope to use to undercut Pence's credibility should he be called as a trial witness in the federal election interference case.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Mike Pence calls Trump's abortion position 'a slap in the face'\n\nPro-abortion access groups also claimed Trump's comments were misleading.\n\nDonald Trump's former vice president, Mike Pence, is calling Trump's latest statement on his abortion policies \"a slap in the face to the millions of pro-life Americans who voted for him in 2016 and 2020.\"\n\n\"Today, too many Republican politicians are all too ready to wash their hands of the battle for life. Republicans win on life when we speak the truth boldly and stand on the principle that we all know to be true - human life begins at conception and should be defended from womb to tomb,\" Pence wrote in a post on Monday on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nPence has long been to the right of the former president on the issue of reproductive rights.\n\nDuring his unsuccessful 2024 presidential campaign, Pence advocated for a 15-week abortion ban as a \"minimum nationwide standard.\"\n\nIn his statement on X, Pence -- like Trump has -- touted his role in the Supreme Court overruling Roe v. Wade's national protections for abortion access.\n\n\"By nominating and standing by the confirmation of conservative justices, the Trump-Pence Administration helped send Roe v. Wade to the ash heap of history where it belongs and gave the pro-life movement the opportunity to compassionately support women and unborn children,\" Pence wrote.\n\nMarc Short, Pence's former chief of staff, also came out with a blistering statement rebuking Trump's stance, pushing for the former president to \"acknowledge life begins at conception.\"\n\nShort argued that Trump had made his announcement because of \"a political calculation that tries to avoid confronting the fundamental evil of\" abortion and \"continues the former president's drift away from the conservative achievements of his own Administration.\"\n\nIn a video statement on Monday, Trump, after months of dodging questions about his abortion position , rejected calls to endorse a national abortion ban, saying he believes it should be a states' rights issue.\n\n\"The states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land in this case, the law of the state,\" Trump said.\n\n\"At the end of the day, this is all about the will of the people,\" he continued. \"You must follow your heart or in many cases, your religion or your faith. Do what's right for your family and do what's right for yourself. Do what's right for your children, do what's right for our country and vote. So important to vote. At the end of the day, it's all about the will of the people.\"\n\nHowever, Trump's position did not address some of the key questions that have come to define the debate over abortion rights since Roe v. Wade was overruled in 2022.\n\nTrump did not say if he personally favors a certain number of weeks into pregnancy at which state-level bans should take effect, he did not say how he will vote on an upcoming ballot measure in his home state of Florida which would broaden abortion access there and though he specifically criticized that abortion policy had been decided at the federal level under Roe, he did not say what he would do as president if a nationwide ban passes Congress and makes it to his desk to be signed into law.\n\nTrump also did not address his views on abortion medication, the use of which is currently being challenged before the Supreme Court by a group of anti-abortion doctors, and though he reiterated his support for three exceptions to abortion bans -- in the cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the pregnant woman -- he was not more specific on how those exceptions should be implemented.\n\nHis campaign did not respond to follow-up questions from ABC News.\n\nHe suggested in his latest statement that his views on abortion were tied to political concerns -- something he has said before while boasting that he could find an electorally viable compromise.\n\n\"I think both sides are going to like me,\" he said in September in an interview with NBC News.\n\n\"I think the Republicans speak very inarticulately about this subject,\" he said then.\n\n\"Other than certain parts of the country, you can't -- you're not going to win on this issue. But you will win on this issue when you come up with the right number of weeks,\" he told NBC News.\n\nTrump echoed that on Monday: \"Many states will be different. Many will have a different number of weeks [for their ban] or some will have more conservative than others, and that's what they will be.\"\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican thought to be among Trump's potential running mate choices, agreed with him in a social media post of her own.\n\nAnd the conservative public policy organization Concerned Women for America said in a statement from its CEO that the 2024 election is a \"stark choice\" between Trump's opposition to abortion and Biden.\n\nOther conservatives split from Trump.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham released a statement saying he \"respectfully disagrees\" with Trump's position, a rare defection for the staunch Trump ally.\n\nGraham has long advocated for a nationwide 15-week abortion ban and he said he will continue to advocate for such restrictions.\n\nTrump responded to Graham with characteristic bluntness, saying that Graham is \"doing a great disservice to the Republican Party, and to our Country.\"\n\nDemocrats, Trump said, \"love this Issue [abortion], and they want to keep it going for as long as Republicans will allow them to do so.\"\n\nMore broadly, Trump maintained on social media that sending the abortion discussion back to the states was the \"policy of the Republican Party and Conservatives for 50 years.\"\n\nOne of the leading anti-abortion rights groups in the country separately said it was \"deeply disappointed in President Trump's position\" about deferring to individual states.\n\n\"Unborn children and their mothers deserve national protections and national advocacy from the brutality of the abortion industry. ... Saying the issue is 'back to the states' cedes the national debate to the Democrats,\" Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement to ABC News.\n\nReproductive Freedom for All (formerly known as NARAL) reacted to Trump's statement on abortion by claiming that the former president had \"deployed dangerous disinformation about abortion in order to distract from the truth about what he will do if elected.\"\n\nThe group insisted that despite what Trump said on Monday, he \"will work to ban all abortion nationwide.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden, Trump's rival in the upcoming election, contended in his own statement that Trump was now \"scrambling\" to shore up support by being ambiguous on his true stance.\n\n\"Let there be no illusion. If Donald Trump is elected and the MAGA Republicans in Congress put a national abortion ban on the Resolute Desk, Trump will sign it into law,\" Biden said.\n\nHe followed up later on Monday with another reaction to Trump's views on abortion, saying in part that \"Donald Trump just endorsed every single state ban on reproductive care nationwide. ... Donald Trump is the reason Roe has ended. If you reelect me, I'll be the reason why it's restored.\"\n\nABC News' Gabriella Abdul-Hakim, Libby Cathey, Fritz Farrow, Isabella Murray, Allison Pecorin and Rachel Scott contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in Boston for \"putting his life and career on the line\" during the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nPence, President Donald Trump's vice president during his first term in the White House, will receive the award on May 4. It will be presented by Caroline Kennedy, the only surviving child of President Kennedy, and her son, Jack Schlossberg, during a ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library.\n\nIn a statement, Kennedy and Schlossberg said Pence will receive the award for his decision to certify Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election victory despite the attacks on the Capitol.\n\n\"Political courage is not outdated in the United States. At every level of government, leaders are putting country first, and not backing down. Despite our political differences, it is hard to imagine an act of greater consequence than Vice President Pence's decision to certify the 2020 presidential election during an attack on the U.S. Capitol,\" Kennedy and Schlossberg said. \"Upholding his oath to the Constitution and following his conscience, the Vice President put his life, career, and political future on the line. His decision is an example of President Kennedy's belief that an act of political courage can change the course of history.\"\n\nPence released a statement as well, saying he is \"humbled and honored\" to receive the award.\n\n\"I have been inspired by the life and words of President John F. Kennedy since my youth and am honored to join the company of so many distinguished Americans who have received this recognition in the past,\" Pence said.\n\nIn the past, Pence said that Trump's words and actions endangered him and his family on January 6. Pence chose not to endorse Trump during the 2024 election, saying Trump has walked away from conservative principles.\n\n\"I worked day in and day out for four and a half years to build that record of the Trump-Pence administration. I'm incredibly proud of it. But as I look at what Donald Trump is running on now, I simply cannot in good conscience, endorse his candidacy this year,\" Pence told Face the Nation in March 2024.\n\nThe John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award was created in 1989 to honor the late president's commitment and contribution to public service. It is named after President Kennedy's 1957 Pulitzer Prize-winning book, \"Profiles in Courage.\"\n\nPrevious recipients include former Presidents Barack Obama, Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Sen. John McCain, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nA bipartisan committee of national, political, and community leaders selects the award winner each year.\n\nMatt Schooley is a digital producer at CBS Boston.

      "text": "Former Vice President Mike Pence drops out of 2024 presidential race\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  October 28, 2023 / 4:54 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence ended his campaign to become the 2024 GOP nominee to a standing ovation Saturday at the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas.\n\n\"We always knew this would be an uphill battle, but I have no regrets,\" Pence said. \"To the American people, I say this is not my time, but it's still your time. I urge you to hold fast to what matters most, faith, family, and the constitution of the United States of America.\"\n\nPence had struggled to gain traction in the race since entering the presidential fray , lagging in fundraising and languishing in polls. Pence is the most high-profile candidate to drop out so far, proving how hard it is for any of the Republicans to break publicly with former President Donald Trump amid the crowded field.  His announcement comes shortly before the third presidential debate on Nov. 8 in Miami - for which he had yet to qualify.\n\n\"I came here to say it's become clear to me: this was not my time. So after much prayer and deliberation, I have decided to suspend my campaign for president, effective today,\" Pence said in Las Vegas.\n\nPence vowed even though he was ending his campaign he would persist in championing the cause of electing Republican leaders to every level of government. He did not say if he would endorse any other Republican presidential candidates .\n\nAttempting to contrast himself from his former boss without alienating the large swath of Trump voters proved to be an uphill battle for Pence. His campaign struggled to create high levels of enthusiasm for his candidacy - and his fundraising reflected the disinterest.The candidate's latest FEC filing in mid-October disclosed  substantial debts and minimal individual donations. Since Pence announced he would be running for president, Trump was indicted in two separate jurisdictions - one federal and one in Fulton County, Georgia - for his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election results, throwing Pence's break with Trump in the public spotlight and forcing him to be more vocal in his opposition to his former boss.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Pence had to frequently defend his decision to oppose Trump and his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Pence repeatedly said that he fulfilled his constitutional responsibilities during the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021 amid the attack on the U.S. Capitol, a claim that many Republican voters disagreed with.\n\nBetween June and September, he managed to raise $3.3 million, but his available cash on hand was limited to $1.2 million, leaving him grappling with a significant debt of approximately $620,000. His personal contribution of $150,000 to his campaign underscored the financial deficit his campaign had been facing.\n\nPence concentrated his efforts on fundraising to secure a spot in the upcoming Republican debate in Miami on Nov. 8. The Pence campaign had not verified whether the candidate had garnered the 70,000 individual donations or fulfilled the polling requirements needed for participation. So far, only four campaigns have said they qualified and are attending the debate: Former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nAs the deadline for filing for the South Carolina primary loomed just three days away, the candidate's campaign had evaded inquiries from reporters about the filing process, which required a $50,000 fee.\n\nPence had split with Trump began after the 2020 election when he refused to overturn the election results at the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021 impacted his campaign. Pence's role in the lead-up to Jan. 6 has been well-documented, including by the House select committee that had been investigating the attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAmid the attack on the U.S. Capitol that day, rioters could be heard chanting \"hang Mike Pence\" and Pence was moved to a secure location.\n\nUltimately in the early hours of Jan. 7 - after the joint session of Congress reconvened - Pence certified the election results.Trump long blamed Pence for refusing to back his plans to overturn the election results, causing Pence to have to publicly rebuke Trump - and by extension, many of his followers.\n\n\"There are those in our party who believe that as the presiding officer of the joint session of Congress that I possessed unilateral authority to reject Electoral College Votes. And I heard this week that President Trump said I had the right to overturn the election. President Trump is wrong,\" Pence said in 2022 during a speech in Florida to the Federalist Society. \"I had no right to overturn the election.\"\n\nTrump was indicted by a federal grand jury in August for his alleged role in trying to overturn the election results, and in the indictment, Pence is portrayed as a central figure in the attempt to resist Trump and his co-conspirators alleged schemes. The 45-page indictment mentions Pence's name or the \"vice president\" more than 100 times.\n\nThe indictment alleges repeated attempts by Trump \"to enlist the Vice President to use his ceremonial role at the certification to fraudulently alter the election results,\" and links these efforts  to the violence at the Capitol when Pence refused to oblige.\n\nExpressing his disapproval of the Pence campaign, President Biden made a pointed remark regarding the former vice president's position on abortion and his involvement in election denialism.\n\nThe Biden-Harris campaign also directed CBS to a post from a member of Biden's rapid response team.\n\n\"Since he left office Mike Pence campaigned for election deniers, led the charge for a nationwide abortion ban, and repeatedly called for slashing Social Security and Medicare,\" the post said. \"Not an inch of daylight between the two of them, despite the endless spin from Pence world.\"\n\nAfter the news broke, several candidates sent out messages of support to the former Vice President. Notably, Vivek Ramaswamy, the biotech mogul, has not released a statement.\n\nIn an appearance on \" Meet the Press\" in August , Ramaswamy said he would \"have done it very differently\" on Jan. 6, and that he would have pushed \"reforms\" through Congress before the date of the joint session.\n\nTrump also made no comments on his former running mate's decision to suspend his campaign.\n\nDuring the first Republican debate on June 20 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, most candidates on stage stood in solidarity with Pence's defense that he carried out his constitutional duties on Jan. 6.\n\nOn Saturday, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson posted well wishes to Pence on X , moments after Pence's announcement.\n\n\"Susan and I wish Mike and Karen the best as they continue to fight for conservative values and serve America,\" Hutchinson wrote.\n\nOne of the earlier speakers at Saturday's event in Las Vegas, Republican hopeful Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said in a statement, \"The Vice President has been a prayer partner, a friend, and a man of integrity and deep conviction. The Republican Party is stronger today because of Mike's leadership. I have no doubt Mike and Karen will continue to serve this nation and honor the Lord in all they do.\"\n\nAlso taking to X to comment, Christie said, \"I am beyond grateful for everything Vice President @Mike_Pence has done for this country. He has consistently fought for American values from his time in Congress to his governorship and serving the American people as Vice President.\"\n\nAnother one of his former 2024 rivals, Haley, applauded Pence's time in government and commended his faith.\n\n\"He's been a good man of faith. He's been a good man of service. He has fought for America and he has fought for Israel and we all owe him a debt of gratitude,\" Haley said in a statement.\n\nJoining his Republican rivals on X , DeSantis said, \"Vice President Mike Pence is a principled man of faith who has worked tirelessly to advance the conservative cause. Casey and I appreciate Mike and Karen for their willingness to put themselves forward in this campaign and wish the Pence family well in their next steps.\"\n\n\"Thank you @Mike_Pence for your service and for having the courage to be in the arena! Wishing you and Karen the very best,\" Burgum wrote on X.\n\nShawna Mizelle contributed to this report.\n\nJake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice.

Trump is now facing four separate indictments and is the first president ever to be accused of state and federal crimes.\n\nPence said Friday there were \"profound differences\" between him and Trump on a number of issues, including his resistance against Trump's repeated demands to reject the Electoral College results after the 2020 campaign.\n\n\"As I have watched his candidacy unfold, I've seen him walking away from our commitment to confronting the national debt,\" Pence said. \"I've seen him starting to shy away from a commitment to the sanctity of human life.\"\n\nPence also criticized Trump's opposition to legislation that would force Chinese company ByteDance to sell TikTok to continue operating in the U.S .\n\nThe former vice president wouldn't say who he's voting for in November, but also said it would not be for President Biden. Both Mr. Biden and Trump became the presumptive nominees of their respective parties earlier this week.\n\n\"I'm going to keep my vote to myself,\" he said. \"I would never vote for Joe Biden.\"\n\nCaitlin Yilek is a politics reporter at CBSNews.com, based in Washington, D.C.

Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for \"putting his life and career on the line\" in overseeing the certification of the 2020 presidential election results, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation announced Thursday.\n\n\"Despite our political differences, it is hard to imagine an act of greater consequence than Vice President Pence's decision to certify the 2020 presidential election during an attack on the U.S. Capitol,\" the Foundation's Caroline Kennedy and Jack Schlossberg said in a statement.\n\n\"Upholding his oath to the Constitution and following his conscience, the Vice President put his life, career, and political future on the line,\" the pair continued.\n\nThe award, created in 1989, is presented to \"public servants who have made courageous decisions of conscience without regard for the personal or professional consequences.\"\n\nThe former Republican vice president said he's \"deeply humbled and honored to be the recipient\" of the award, which he'll be presented with in May.\n\n\"I have been inspired by the life and words of President John F. Kennedy since my youth and am honored to join the company of so many distinguished Americans who have received this recognition in the past,\" Pence said in a statement.\n\nPence broke with his boss President Donald Trump in his decision to not overturn the 2020 election results while he was ceremonially overseeing Congress' certification of Joe Biden's win on January 6, 2021.\n\nPence later said Trump's \"reckless words\" that day, when a mob of the president's supporters violently breached the US Capitol, \"endangered\" his family and others at the US Capitol. He ran against Trump in the 2024 GOP primary and continued defending his actions on January 6.\n\nPast recipients of the award have been tied to \"protecting democracy\" against the efforts to overturn the election results, including Republican former Rep. Liz Cheney, Michigan Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, former Arizona Republican House Speaker Rusty Bowers and Fulton County, Georgia, election worker Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "First on CNN: Classified documents found at Pence's Indiana home\n\nA lawyer for former Vice President Mike Pence discovered about a dozen documents marked as classified at Pence's Indiana home last week, and he has turned those classified records over to the FBI, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nThe FBI and the Justice Department's National Security Division have launched a review of the documents and how they ended up in Pence's house in Indiana.\n\nThe classified documents were discovered at the former vice president's new home in Carmel, Indiana, by a lawyer for Pence in the wake of the revelations about classified material discovered in President Joe Biden's private office and residence , the sources said. The discovery comes after Pence has repeatedly said he did not have any classified documents in his possession.\n\nIt is not yet clear what the documents are related to or their level of sensitivity or classification.\n\nRelated article What we know about the Pence classified documents: A timeline of events\n\nPence's team notified congressional leaders and relevant committees of the discovery on Tuesday.\n\nPence asked his lawyer with experience handling classified material to conduct the search of his home out of an abundance of caution. Sources said that the attorney, Matt Morgan, began going through four boxes stored at Pence's house last week, finding a small number of documents with classified markings.\n\nPence's lawyer immediately alerted the National Archives, the sources said. In turn, the Archives informed the Justice Department.\n\nA lawyer for Pence told CNN that the FBI requested to pick up the documents with classified markings that evening, and Pence agreed. Agents from the FBI's field office in Indianapolis picked up the documents from Pence's home, the lawyer said.\n\nOn Monday, Pence's legal team drove the boxes back to Washington, DC, and handed them over to the Archives to review the rest of the material for compliance with the Presidential Records Act.\n\nIn a letter to the National Archives obtained by CNN, Pence's representative to the Archives, Greg Jacob, wrote that a \"small number of documents bearing classified markings\" were inadvertently boxed and transported to the vice president's home.\n\n\"Vice President Pence was unaware of the existence of sensitive or classified documents at his personal residence,\" Jacob wrote. \"Vice President Pence understands the high importance of protecting sensitive and classified information and stands ready and willing to cooperate fully with the National Archives and any appropriate inquiry.\"\n\nThe classified material was stored in boxes that first went to Pence's temporary home in Virginia before they were moved to Indiana, according to the sources. The boxes were not in a secure area, but they were taped up and were not believed to have been opened since they were packed, according to Pence's attorney. Once the classified documents were discovered, the sources said they were placed inside a safe located in the house.\n\nPence's Washington, DC, advocacy group office was also searched, Pence's lawyer said, and no classified material or other records covered by the Presidential Records Act were discovered.\n\nThe news about Pence comes as special counsels investigate the handling of classified documents by both Biden and former President Donald Trump . The revelations also come amid speculation that Pence is readying for a run at the Republican nomination for president in 2024.\n\nSince the FBI searched Trump's home in Florida for classified material in August with a search warrant, Pence has said that he had not retained any classified material upon leaving office. \"No, not to my knowledge,\" he told The Associated Press in August.\n\nIn November, Pence was asked by ABC News at his Indiana home whether he had taken any classified documents from the White House.\n\n\"I did not,\" Pence responded.\n\n\"Well, there'd be no reason to have classified documents, particularly if they were in an unprotected area,\" Pence continued. \"But I will tell you that I believe there had to be many better ways to resolve that issue than executing a search warrant at the personal residence of a former president of the United States.\"\n\nWhile Pence's vice presidential office in general did a rigorous job while he was leaving office of sorting through and turning over any classified material and unclassified material covered by the Presidential Records Act, these classified documents appear to have inadvertently slipped through the process because most of the materials were packed up separately from the vice president's residence, along with Pence's personal papers, the sources told CNN.\n\nThe vice president's residence at the US Naval Observatory in Washington has a secure facility for handling classified material along with other security, and it would be common for classified documents to be there for the vice president to review.\n\nSome of the boxes at Pence's Indiana home were packed up from the vice president's residence, while some came from the White House in the final days of the Trump administration, which included last-minute things that did not go through the process the rest of Pence's documents did.\n\nRelated article Clinton, Bush and Obama turned over all classified records, representatives say\n\nThe discovery of classified documents in Pence's residence marks the third time in recent history in which a president or vice president has inappropriately possessed classified material after leaving office. Both Biden and Trump are now being investigated by separate special counsels for their handling of classified materials.\n\nSources familiar with the process say Pence's discovery of classified documents after the Trump and Biden controversies would suggest a more systemic problem related to classified material and the Presidential Records Act, which requires official records from the White House to be turned over to the National Archives at the end of an administration.\n\nOn Friday, the FBI searched Biden's Wilmington residence for additional classified material, an unprecedented search of a sitting president's home that turned up six additional items containing classified markings. The search was conducted after Biden's lawyers discovered classified material in Wilmington following the initial discovery of classified documents at Biden's private think office in November.\n\nBiden's attorneys say they are fully cooperating with the Justice Department, seeking to draw a distinction from the Trump investigation.\n\nTuesday's development was welcome news for Biden administration officials and allies. As one senior administration official put it: \"It turns down the temperature on this being a Biden-only story.\"\n\nOne hope, this official said, is that the discovery of classified documents at Pence's home will help to underscore that Biden aides were not alone in making the mistake of packing up classified documents that should have been turned over to the Archives. The development could also be used by the White House, the official said, to emphasize the importance of how the situation was handled once the classified documents were discovered.\n\nAdministration officials have maintained that lawyers working for the president did the right thing by immediately informing the Archives as soon as classified documents were first found in early November, drawing the distinction between the Biden legal team's handling of the matter and the actions of Trump and his team.\n\nThe FBI obtained a search warrant to search Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in August. Federal investigators took that step because they believed Trump had not turned over all classified material despite a subpoena and were concerned records at Mar-a-Lago were being moved around.\n\nStill, Trump's legal team also viewed the Pence development as positive for the former president, according to a source familiar with the matter. While the circumstances are different in each case, members of his legal team believe the developments will make it harder for prosecutors to justify bringing criminal charges against any of them, the source said.\n\n\"They are all now linked in a way,\" the source said, referring to Pence, Biden and Trump.\n\nPence told Larry Kudlow in a Fox Business interview earlier this month that he received the President's Daily Brief at the vice president's residence.\n\n\"I'd rise early. I'd go to the safe where my military aide would place those classified materials. I'd pull them out, review them,\" Pence said. \"I'd receive a presentation to them and then, frankly, more often than not Larry, I would simply return them back to the file that I'd received them in. They went in commonly into what was called a burn bag that my military aide would gather and then destroy those classified materials-same goes in materials that I would receive at the White House.\"\n\nCongressional leaders in both parties were stunned about the new revelations that Pence was also in possession of classified records at his home.\n\n\"I don't understand this,\" said Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin.\n\n\"The bottom line is I don't know how this happened, we need to get to the bottom of it,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican. \"I don't believe for a minute that Mike Pence is trying to intentionally compromise national security. But clearly we've got a problem here.\"\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul responded to the development, calling it \"not permissible.\"\n\n\"I don't know what to tell you other than it's not permissible, whether you're a chairman of a committee or president of the United States or vice president. And I've been dealing in the classified world all my career; I don't understand people taking these documents home. If you do that, you're supposed to have a safe designated for storage and you have to have a proper briefcase to carry it in. I don't know all the facts here,\" the Texas Republican said.\n\nHouse Oversight Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican who is investigating Biden's classified documents, said in a statement that Pence reached out to him about the classified documents found at his home.\n\n\"He has agreed to fully cooperate with congressional oversight and any questions we have about the matter,\" said Comer, adding that Pence's transparency \"stands in stark contrast\" to the Biden administration's response to Congress over the classified documents. Comer's statement did not mention Trump's classified documents.\n\nThe former president, however, came to Pence's defense on Tuesday. \"Mike Pence is an innocent man. He never did anything knowingly dishonest in his life. Leave him alone!!!\" Trump posted on his social media site.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated when Pence appeared on Fox Business. It has also been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN's Elizabeth Stuart, Ted Barrett, Manu Raju, Nicky Robertson, Kristen Holmes, Zachary Cohen and MJ Lee contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

(AP) - Vice President Mike Pence told South Carolina conservatives Monday night that another four years for the Trump administration is a far better choice than anything the Democratic Party might offer from its nomination race.\n\n\"Have faith in the American people,\" Pence told about 3,000 people attending a fundraising barbecue in the town of Anderson. \"When the American people are given a choice between more freedom and more government, they'll choose freedom every time.\"\n\nPence spoke at the Faith and Freedom BBQ, an annual fundraiser for U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan, one of the more conservative members of South Carolina's congressional delegation. Organizers tout the event as the state's largest annual gathering for conservatives, who packed out a civic center for plates of barbecue, cole slaw and homemade ice cream.\n\nOther speakers Monday included Duncan, Gov. Henry McMaster and U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, as well as U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.\n\nPence said that South Carolina - 55% of its voters backed Donald Trump in 2016 - is a beneficiary of military victories and economic successes pledged by Trump during his campaign.\n\n\"It's been two and a half years of promises made and promises kept. We're just getting started, South Carolina,\" Pence said. \"With God's help, we will keep America great.\"\n\nRead more : 'You remain a frickin' coward': Trump taunting a 2020 Democratic candidate and retired Marine isn't a laughing matter for some veterans\n\nPence visited the state in March to help Graham kick off his reelection bid. On Monday night, Graham playfully swiped at the president, with whom he said he got off to a \"rocky start.\"\n\n\"I've come to like the president, admire the president,\" said Graham, who frequently sparred with Trump when both sought the 2016 nomination but now counts as an ally and frequent golfing partner. \"He likes himself, so we've got a lot in common. ... This is a hell of a country, and we're not going to give it over to a bunch of socialists.\"\n\nTo applause and cheers, Graham also told the crowd, \"If you're not here to support Trump/Pence, you came to the wrong place.\"\n\nBefore the program, former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, who is mulling a primary challenge to Trump, worked the room, speaking with attendees and calling for a conversation on what he sees as the ignored topic of the national deficit.\n\nSanford visited the early-voting state of New Hampshire earlier this month, where he said he felt he got \"another greenlight\" in terms of making a decision to challenge Trump. The former 1st District congressman, who is set to visit Iowa this week, has said he will take until Labor Day to make his decision.\n\nAs Sanford spoke with reporters, attendees waving Trump/Pence signs surrounded him, some chanting, \"Trump! Trump!\" and \"Go take a hike,\" a reference to Sanford's 2009 disappearance to visit a mistress in Argentina while telling his gubernatorial staff he was hiking the Appalachian Trail.\n\nEarlier Monday, Pence visited a metal fabrication business to promote the proposed U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA.\n\n\"The USMCA is a win for South Carolina,\" Pence said at Sargent Metal. \"It's a win for the United States. And it's going to strengthen our economy and strengthen our hand on the world stage. It's time to get it done.\"\n\nJump to"

He went on to outline some of the bill's primary proposals, such as expanding health savings accounts, providing tax credits to individuals to go towards their healthcare costs, and repealing the individual and employer mandate.\n\nHe also underscored two popular Obamacare conditions the GOP intends to keep in its replacement plan: the pre-existing conditions mandate, and the stipulation that allows children to remain on their parents' insurance plans until the age of 26.\n\nHowever, under the GOP's new plan, while insurance companies would not be able to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, it would penalize lapses in coverage with a premium hike of 30% as a means to discourage people from waiting until they are sick to purchase health insurance.\n\nPence spoke at length about reforming Medicaid as it currently stands. The GOP's replacement bill includes Medicaid block grants and would also kick lottery winners off the Medicaid program. It would also give place Medicaid regulation largely in the hands of individual states.\n\n\"We'll give states like Kentucky the freedom and flexibility with Medicaid to meet the needs of your most vulnerable in the way that works here in Kentucky,\" Pence said. He added that the bill would give states the chance to reform and regulate Medicaid so that it would \"better serve the underprivileged\" in each state.\n\nAccording to a poll released in February by the Kaiser Family Foundation , a nonpartisan health policy organization, majority of Americans support the Medicaid expansion implemented by the ACA.\n\n65% of Americans surveyed in the poll said that Medicaid, the government-run health program, should continue largely as it exists today, despite Republican proposals to change the program.\n\nUnder the ACA, Medicaid became available to more than 11 million new people than it was available to before, and states who adopted the Medicaid expansion received federal funds to assist with the program.\n\n\"Obamacare has failed the people of Kentucky, it's failed the people of America, and Obamacare must go,\" Pence concluded.\n\nPence's pitch to Kentucky came on the heels of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's forceful rebuke of the replacement bill, which he and other conservatives argue doesn't go far enough to repeal the ACA.\n\n\" House leadership plan is Obamacare Lite,\" Paul tweeted. \"It will not pass. Conservatives are not going to take it.\"\n\nSen. Paul, who has been a staunch opponent of the ACA since its implementation and has worked to repeal it multiple times in the past, is against the provision of tax credits, as well as the few ACA stipulations the GOP's proposal leaves in place.\n\nSen. Paul and members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus announced earlier in the week that they would be introducing legislation that would repeal Obamacare in its entirety.\n\nAfter Sen. Paul and other congressional Republicans spoke out against the GOP's replacement bill, Trump tweeted , \" I feel sure that my friend @RandPaul w ill come along with the new and great health care program because he knows Obamacare is a disaster!\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "'We are here to stay' - Pence says he personally challenged China with a South China Sea flyby\n\nVice President Mike Pence is traveling through Asia with a message for China, and that is that the US \"will not be intimidated.\"\n\nFlying from Japan to Singapore Tuesday, the vice president's Air Force 2 airplane reportedly passed within 50 miles of Chinese outposts in the contested Spratly Islands. Speaking with The Washington Post's Josh Rogin, Pence characterized the flight as something of a \"freedom-of-navigation\" operation.\n\nAs Pence's aircraft was actually a good distance from the islands, his flyby in the South China Sea obviously did not serve as an official FONOP or even as a particularly-demonstrative overflight, like the flights occasionally conducted by US Air Force bombers.\n\nThe US military conducts FONOPS around the world on a regular basis, typically to signal that the US does not recognize a country's territorial claims. In the South China Sea, these operations have become less about territorial sovereignty and instead are about standing up to Chinal. In that sense, Pence's intentions were right on target.\n\nBeijing claims the vast majority of the South China Sea, and while China's extensive claims to the region were discredited by an international arbitration tribunal two years ago, the Chinese military has continued to strengthen its position in the important strategic waterway.\n\nChina has typically  responded to US military activities in the region with critical rhetoric, but the situation escalated in late September during a tense showdown between the US and Chinese navies. A Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) Type 052C Luyang II-class guided-missile destroyer challenged the US Navy destroyer USS Decatur following its close patrol through the Spratlys.\n\nThis troubling incident, during which the two ships nearly collided, was preceded by multiple B-52 bomber overflights, which Beijing called \"provocative.\"\n\nDuring his flight to Singapore Tuesday, Pence reiterated some of the points he made during a tough speech on China at the Hudson Institute last month. \" We will not be intimidated. We will not stand down. We will continue to exercise freedom of navigation,\" he said, adding that if China refuses to play ball, \"then so be it. We are here to stay.\"\n\n\"We seek an Indo-Pacific where every nation ... is free to follow its own path and pursue its own interests, where the seas and skies are open to all engaged in peaceful activity, and where sovereign nations grow stronger together,\" the vice president explained earlier in Tokyo.\n\nHe restated the Trump administration's position that \"authoritarianism and aggression have no place in the Indo-Pacific.\" Rising tensions between Washington and Beijing come amid what some observers are describing as a new Cold War.\n\nJump to"

(The article resurfaced last year when reporter Andrew Kaczynski wrote about it for BuzzFeed.)\n\nIn the movie, a female Chinese peasant named Fa Mulan disguises herself as a man so she can serve in the military in place of her elderly father.\n\nBut after going to see the movie with his kids, Pence worried that it may send the wrong message to the younger generation - namely, that women can or should serve in the military.\n\n\"Housing, in close quarters, young men and women (in some cases married to non-military personnel) at the height of their physical and sexual potential is the high of stupidity,\" Pence wrote. \"It is instructive that even in the Disney film, young Ms. Mulan falls in love with her superior officer!\"\n\nIn the past, Pence has also said he never eats dinner alone with a woman who isn't his wife. After coming to the White House, Pence repeatedly led efforts to strike down women's abortion rights. In his op-ed article, Pence insisted that the \"politically correct Disney types\" had missed the point of the movie.\n\n\"Moral of story: women in military, bad idea,\" Pence finished.\n\nJump to"

Wade, declaring that \"a new arena in the cause of life has emerged and it is incumbent on all who cherish the sanctity of life to resolve that we will take the defense of the unborn and support for women in crisis pregnancies to every state capitol in America.\"\n\nHe's said thinks Americans would \"welcome\" a national ban on abortion after 15 weeks , but Pence has celebrated states like Florida for passing further restrictions (the state recently passed a ban on most abortions after six weeks).\n\nAn aide told NBC News in a story that published in May that Pence supports rape, incest and life-of-the-mother exceptions to abortion restrictions.\n\nAsked about whether abortion restrictions should impact IVF treatments, Pence recalled his family's struggle with infertility and told CBS News last year, \"I fully support fertility treatments and I think they deserve the protection of the law.\"\n\nPence took an active role in the Trump administration's posture toward China, trying to walk the line between the push for cooperation while also holding the nation accountable.\n\nDuring a key speech on China in 2018 , he warned that \"the dream of freedom remains distant for the Chinese people,\" criticized  its \"wholesale theft of American technology,\" its military \"aggression\" and \"reckless harassment,\" and that \"China is meddling in America's democracy.\"\n\nAfter he left office, Pence spoke at the Heritage Foundation in July of 2021 , warning that \"the Chinese Communist Party aspires not merely to join the community of economically developed nations, but to sit atop a new global order, created in its own image. A world in which freedom is constrained, but Beijing's power is not.\"\n\nPence has tried to differentiate himself from many in the GOP presidential field by arguing that America needs to have a realistic conversation about making changes to entitlements to curb the rising debt and to account for concerns about insolvency of those programs.\n\nDuring a CNBC interview in February , Pence said that entitlements need to be put on the table in the long-term, but he didn't outline specifics on what he would want to do to the programs outside of a promise not to make changes that would affect those retiring in the next 25 years.\n\n\"We're looking at a debt crisis in this country over the next 25 years that is driven by entitlements, and nobody in Washington, D.C., wants to talk about it,\" he said.\n\n\"There's lots of good ideas to solve this that are common sense that ... don't affect anybody that's gonna retire in the next 25 years. I mean, you could phase in just like Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill did 50 years ago. They raised the retirement age to 67. They, they made Social Security solvent until 2009. The things that you could do in personal savings accounts in the long term, allowing younger Americans to get a higher rate of return. ... But these are all ideas but the first job is to be straight, the second job is get everybody at the table.\"\n\nPence is severely critical of the Biden administration's approach to immigration and border policy, and he has argued that the Trump administration's policies made the situation better.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News in May, Pence highlighted the administration's \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, invoking the Title 42 policy to curb migration during the pandemic and the administration's construction of new border fencing .\n\nPence has defended his decision to oversee the certification of the 2020 presidential election and has said the \"2020 election was not stolen.\"\n\n\"The 2020 election was not stolen. We have a process in this country, where states conduct elections. Questions of irregularities and fraud are then adjudicated in the courts, the states then certify electoral votes, and as we did on January 6, in the wake of that terrible violence, the role of the Congress is to open and count those votes and to certify the election. We did that, until Biden was elected President of the United States of America,\" Pence told CBS last year .\n\nBut he has on multiple occasions argued that there were \" significant voting irregularities \" during the election.\"\n\n\"That's not to say that there weren't irregularities in the election, there were. There were states that changed the rules governing the elections, all in the name of Covid. Ultimately, the courts upheld those and the allegations about widespread fraud would never be supported by the facts,\" he told NBC News in May.\n\n\"One of the tragic consequences of the riot that took place that day was that it ultimately disrupted a full hearing and a full debate over the concerns of really millions of Americans and many members of Congress about what had taken place in the course of the election.\"\n\nPence regularly invokes the GOP's \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" from 2017 to argue the Trump administration prioritized cutting taxes -- despite Democratic arguments the bill did more to help corporations than the middle class.\n\nIt was a major issue during Pence's October 2020 debate with his eventual successor, then-Sen. Kamala Harris.\n\n\"President Trump cut taxes, across the board. Despite what Senator Harris says, the average American family of four had $2,000 in savings in taxes. And with the rise in wages that occurred, most predominantly for blue-collar, hardworking Americans, the average household income for a family of four increased by $4,000 following President Trump's tax cuts,\" Pence said.\n\nPence speaks highly of his time as vice president and regularly points to the Trump administration's policies. But he's sought to distance himself from former President Donald Trump's tone.\n\n\"As I've traveled around the country, I've heard two things. Number one, I've heard countless Americans tell me that they want to get back to the policies of the Trump-Pence administration, policies that saw us make historic investments in our military, saw a peaceful and stable world, that saw our economy revived through tax cuts and unleashing American energy, saw conservatives on our courts and a secure southern border,\" he said to NBC News in February.\n\n\"But the next thing I hear, Ali, is that they want to see us and our politics return to the kind of civility and respect that Americans show one another every day.\"\n\nBut he has been more direct in his criticism of Trump's rhetoric, particularly around the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"I will tell you that I think the president's words that day were reckless. And they endangered me and my family and everyone serving at the Capitol,\" he told NBC News in May.\n\nPence has also sought to make a contrast with some other GOP presidential candidates on the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"We need to stand with President Zelenskyy and stand with the courageous soldiers in Ukraine until they achieve that victory,\" he told NBC News in February.\n\n\"Anyone who believes that Vladimir Putin would stop at the western border of Ukraine has another thing coming. ... America first is not America alone.\"\n\nBen Kamisar is a national political reporter for NBC News\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Like other surveys, the most recent NBC News poll shows Trump with a commanding lead.\n\nThe June poll also shows deep resistance to Pence among parts of the Republican Party: 33% of Republican primary voters had positive views of Pence, while 37% had negative views. Only Pence and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie had net negative ratings among Republican primary voters, who were quizzed about their feelings about Pence, Christie, Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\nBartholomew County GOP Vice Chair Josh Barnett said Pence's actions to certify the 2020 election results on Jan. 6, 2021 - which have generated skepticism on the campaign trail among some GOP voters - show that he is \"consistent.\"\n\n\"He showed that with his courage on a very difficult day in American history, but he's shown that his whole life, so you know what you're going to get, and people will just have to decide if that's, if that's the direction they want to go,\" Barnett said.\n\nColumbus Police Officer Matt Harris lived next door to Pence when he was in Congress and thinks the lack of national support is due to Pence's \"quieter personality.\"\n\n\"He's definitely a doer but not quite the showman that President Trump is,\" he said.\n\nLike Harris, Bruce Shearer, 81, of Columbus, sees that as a positive.\n\n\"We are Republicans, but we're tired of Trump's mouth,\" Shearer said of himself and his wife. \"We think he accomplished more than anybody ever has, but, you know, he don't know when to shut up.\"\n\nShearer said that he would support Pence but that he doesn't think he'll get the nomination because there are \"not enough Christian people like him\" in the GOP primary electorate.\n\n\"I just don't think he'll get the major vote. Because even in the Republican sector, you've got people that are not, they're not behind him,\" he said. \"So I wish they were. He's the man for us.\"\n\nMilo Smith, who represented Columbus in the state House from 2006 to 2018, including while Pence was governor, said, \"Mike will have to step into the ring and put some gloves on more than he ever has before.\"\n\n\"I hope he doesn't do that in a way that's uncomfortable for him. But he has to identify some of the issues and point out some of the differences and how he can do it better,\" said Smith, who is a strong supporter of Pence. \"And you're going to have to take the gloves off a little bit to do that, in my opinion, or he'll never get noticed outside of Indiana.\"\n\nCORRECTION (July 20, 2023, 11 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled the name of a community in Shelby County.

Pence is dropping his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. John Locher/AP hide caption\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence speaks at an annual leadership meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition, Saturday, Oct. 28, 2023, in Las Vegas. Pence is dropping his bid for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nNEW YORK - Former Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday dropped his bid for the Republican presidential nomination , ending his campaign for the White House after struggling to raise money and gain traction in the polls.\n\n\"After much prayer and deliberation, I have decided to suspend my campaign for president effective today,\" Pence said at the Republican Jewish Coalition gathering in Las Vegas. \"We always knew this would be an uphill battle, but I have no regrets,\" he said.\n\nPence becomes the first major candidate to leave a race that has been dominated by his former boss-turned-rival, Donald Trump.\n\nThe decision, more than two months before the Iowa caucuses that he had staked his campaign on, saves Pence from the embarrassment of failing to qualify for the third Republican primary debate, Nov. 8 in Miami.\n\nBut the withdrawal is a huge blow for a politician who spent years biding his time as Trump's most loyal lieutenant, only to be scapegoated during their final days in office when Trump became convinced that Pence somehow had the power to overturn the results of the 2020 election and keep both men in office - not something a vice president could do.\n\nWhile Pence averted a constitutional crisis by rejecting the scheme, he drew Trump's fury, as well as the wrath of many of Trump's supporters who believed his lies and still see Pence as a traitor.\n\nAmong Trump critics, meanwhile, Pence was seen as an enabler who defended the former president at every turn and refused to criticize even Trump's most indefensible actions time and again.\n\nAs a result, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research from August found that the majority of U.S. adults, 57%, viewed Pence negatively, with only 28% having a positive view.\n\nThroughout his campaign, the former Indiana governor and congressman had insisted that while he was well-known by voters, he was not \"known well\" and set out to change that with an aggressive schedule that included numerous stops at diners and Pizza Ranch restaurants.\n\nPence had been betting on Iowa, a state with a large white Evangelical population that has a long history of elevating religious and socially conservative candidates such as former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Rick Santorum. Pence often campaigned with his wife, Karen, a Christian school teacher, and emphasized his hard-line views on issues such as abortion, which he opposes even in cases when a pregnancy is unviable. He repeatedly called on his fellow candidates to support a minimum 15-week national ban and he pushed to ban drugs used as alternatives to surgical procedures.\n\nHe tried to confront head-on his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, explaining to voters over and over that he had done his constitutional duty that day, knowing full well the political consequences. It was a strategy that aides believed would help defuse the issue and earn Pence the respect of a majority of Republicans, whom they were were convinced did not agree with Trump's actions.\n\nBut even in Iowa, Pence struggled to gain traction.\n\nHe had an equally uphill climb with donors, despite years of connections. Pence ended September with just $1.18 million in the bank and $621,000 in debt, according to his most recent campaign filing. That debt number probably has grown in the weeks since and seemingly will take years for Pence, who is not independently wealthy, to pay off.\n\nThe Associated Press first reported after the filing that people close to Pence had begun to feel he faced a choice about whether remaining a candidate might potentially diminish his long-term standing in the party, given Trump's dominating lead in the race for the 2024 nomination. While they said Pence could stick it out until the Jan. 15 Iowa caucuses if he wanted, he would have to consider how that might affect his ability to remain a leading voice in the conservative movement, as he hopes.\n\nSome said that Hamas' attack on Israel in October, which pushed foreign policy to the forefront of the campaign, had given Pence a renewed sense of purpose given his warnings throughout the campaign against the growing tide of isolationism in the Republican Party. Pence had argued that he was the race's most experienced candidate and decried \"voices of appeasement\" among Republican, arguing they had emboldened groups such as Hamas.\n\nPence is expected to remain engaged, in part through Advancing American Freedom, the conservative think tank he founded after leaving the vice presidency. He envisions it as an alternative to the The Heritage Foundation.\n\nPence's group is expected to continued to advocate for policies that he supported in his run, including pushing for more U.S. support for Ukraine's defense against the Russian invasion and proposed cuts to Social Security and Medicare to rein in the debt. Such ideas were once the bread-and-butter of Republican establishment orthodoxy but have fallen out of a favor as the party has embraced Trump's isolationist and populist shifts.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Charlie Neibergall/AP hide caption\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former Vice President Mike Pence speaks at the Northside Conservatives Club Meeting, on Aug. 30 in Iowa.\n\nAt an event in New Hampshire, former Vice President Mike Pence took aim at his former boss, calling for the Republican Party to abandon populism in favor of good, old-fashioned conservatism.\n\nAt the New Hampshire Institute of Politics on the campus of St. Anselm College in Manchester, N.H., and billed as a \"major speech\" by the Pence campaign, Pence said that Donald Trump had promised to run as a conservative in 2016.\n\n\"It's important for Republicans to know that he and his imitators in this Republican primary make no such promise today,\" Pence said.\n\nNoting New Hampshire's status as an early-primary state, Pence said Republican voters  \"face a choice ... will we be the party of conservatism, or will we follow the siren song of populism unmoored to conservative principles?\"\n\nIn the speech, Pence argued that the party should be guided by what he described as longstanding conservative principles, such as a hawkish foreign policy and free-market economics, rather than a populism he argued is rising on both the political right and left.\n\nPence repeatedly invoked the memory of Ronald Reagan, calling for a return to what Pence described as the \"limited government\" and \"traditional moral values\" that he said the Republican Party had stood for for 50 years. Pence warned that the GOP stands \"at a crossroads\" and described populism as a path of \"decline\" and irrelevance.\n\nPence's speech confronting the rise of populism comes at a time when he and other Republican presidential hopefuls are trying to distinguish themselves in a crowded field that's been consistently dominated by Trump.\n\nSo far, Pence has walked a careful line when it comes to his former boss: stressing that he obeyed the Constitution rather than Trump during the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, while also saying that he would support Trump if he becomes the Republican party's 2024 presidential nominee, even if Trump is convicted of charges he's facing related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and other matters.\n\nThe former vice president also took aim at \"liberal progressives\" and what he described as failed policies by the Biden administration, including President Biden's economic and immigration policies.\n\nBut Pence focused some of his most pointed remarks on his former boss and his own party, describing the divide between conservatism and populism as a \"fundamental divide between these two factions is unbridgeable.\"\n\nThe definition of populism - and the usefulness of the term itself - has been widely debated . According to Oxford Bibliographies , populism is an \"anti-establishment, anti-elite ideology and political strategy\" which tends to focus \"on the tensions between the 'pure people' and the 'corrupt elite.'\"\n\nThe meaning of \"conservatism\" is also a subject of contention. Oxford notes that conservatism is associated with the political right, \"which was defined as defending inequalities and differential entitlements, concentrating matters involving rights around preserving property rights, shoring up public and social order, and promoting traditional values and conventional social relations.\"\n\nPopulism, meanwhile, is neither an exclusively right-wing or leftist phenomenon; the idea gained increasing prominence in the early 2010s with the rise of grassroots movements like the Tea Party on the right and Occupy Wall Street on the left. While the two movements offered starkly different visions for a way forward, both drew supports with the idea that individual citizens had to organize and push back against government and corporate interests that were not serving them, whether because of incompetence or by design.\n\nThe political ascent and election of former President Donald Trump in 2016 - with his promises to remember \"the forgotten man \" left behind by the political establishment - moved Trump's form of populism from from the fringes to the mainstream of the Republican Party.\n\nAs Trump's vice president, Pence watched those policies unfold up close. While conservatives marked major wins in the Trump administration, like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, many traditional priorities shifted under Trump. Most notably, Republicans long advocated for free and open markets, including international trade with few, if any, regulations.\n\nTrump, however, took on a protectionist stance on trade, enacting tariffs on allies and adversaries alike to try to force concessions.\n\nPence added that he understands why many Americans across the political spectrum may be drawn to populist movements, pointing to economic inequality, widespread addiction, and other social trends as likely causes. But he said those movements on both the right and left \"fellow travelers on the same road to ruin.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

He capped off his campaign announcements with an event outside Des Moines, Iowa in front of supporters.\n\nIn a very different tone than he has taken in appearances leading up to the confirmation of his campaign, Pence did not mince words when it came to speaking about his former boss and running mate, former President Donald Trump.\n\nHe took direct and pointed aim at Trump about the events of Jan. 6, 2021, in which the angry mob that engulfed the Capitol shouted \"Hang Mike Pence\" and erected a gallows on the lawn. Pence was overseeing the official count of Electoral College votes that declared Joe Biden to be the winner of the 2020 election.\n\n\"My former running mate continues to insist that I had the right to overturn the 2020 election,\" Pence said. \"President Trump is wrong.\"\n\n\"I will always believe by God's grace I did my duty that day.\"\n\nPence attempted to position himself as a constitutional conservative and argued that the Republican Party needs to be the party of the U.S. Constitution, directly addressing the oath he took as vice president and using it, again, to contrast with Trump.\n\n\"The American people deserve to know on that fateful day, President Trump also demanded I choose between him and our Constitution,\" Pence remembered. \"Now voters will be faced with the same choice. I chose the constitution and I always will.\"\n\nPence has been signaling his plans for several months with several stops in early voting states like New Hampshire and Iowa and the announcement of a super PAC supporting his bid. Pence will join at least nine other Republicans attempting to unseat Trump as the frontrunner for the GOP nomination.\n\nIn the past several weeks, Pence has previewed a campaign focused on returning the Republican Party to traditional GOP themes like expanding free markets, fiscal responsibility, supporting American allies abroad and small government. He has also made more pointed attacks on Trump, his former running mate, by invoking his own faith and family values and promising to respect the Constitution.\n\nPresident Donald Trump listens as Vice President Mike Pence speaks about the coronavirus in the Rose Garden of the White House on April 27, 2020.

Pierre Kattar/NPR hide caption\n\nSteve Inskeep and Mike Pence  discussed Pence's latest book, So Help Me God.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence spoke with NPR's Steve Inskeep on Monday in a video interview at the Indiana State Capitol They discussed the January 6th attack on the Capitol, a Pence's potential 2024 presidential campaign and the issues facing the Republican party today.\n\nIn addition to the context provided in the course of the interview, you can read more fact-checking and analysis of the conversation here.\n\nYou've said a lot already about January 6th. I don't want to make you go over everything, but I want to pick up the story in the middle, so to speak. When you were in the vice president's office, inside the Capitol...At what point and how did you come to understand that many people in the crowd were coming after you or wanted to come for you? They had come on to the Senate floor - my Secret Service detail - while we were debating initial objections that had been filed. And my Secret Service agent, Maximilian, said, \"We need to get you out of the building.\" I rose, I walked across the short lobby to our ceremonial office, confident that we could hold there. I'd been informed by the parliamentarian that the rioters had breached the Capitol on the House side. But, Steve, I spent 12 years in Congress. I was there when an assailant broke into the majority leader's office and claimed lives. I had great confidence in the ability of the Capitol Hill police to secure the Capitol. So I simply told my details that we would hold in my office and then have the ability to reconvene the Congress and continue our work.\n\nBut shortly thereafter, my lead Secret Service agent came in and said, We need to get you out of the building. And I said, \"No, we'll stay here.\" The third time he came in, he was very adamant and he said, \"We need to leave the building.\" And I put my finger on his chest and said, \"You're not hearing me. I'm not leaving. I'm not giving those people the sight of a 16 car motorcade speeding away from the Capitol.\" Did you understand at that point that they wanted you, that they were chanting things such as \"Hang Mike Pence?\"\n\nCandidly, Steve, I did not. I found that out after the fact. But we were very aware, watching the visuals on television, that there was a riot underway. I just was determined to stay at my post. You know, for me, I had no more complicated view than that. And I believe that it was important that I stay. At that point, my daughter helpfully interjected with the question, \"Is there somewhere else in the capital Dad could go?\" Because she saw the loggerheads that we'd reached with my Secret Service agent. And he said, \"We could take you to the parking garage\" And I agreed. And then I touched my wife Karen on the arm and my daughter and I said, \"Let's go\". And we walked down to the parking garage below the Capitol building. We could hear the sound of footfall, we could hear chanting. But it was only later that I learned that many people had come to the Capitol looking for me. When you did learn in hours and days to come, it's my understanding that you had a conversation with a friend of yours, Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, who gave an interview to the Tulsa World. And he quoted you as saying of President Trump something to the effect of, \"After all I've done for him.\" The idea being that you had been loyal to him and that he had not been perhaps to you. What did it mean to you that that loyalty was not repaid? Steve, I had always been loyal to President Donald Trump. He was my president and he was my friend. For all four years of our administration. We work closely together and frankly, we develop a close working relationship that I recount in my book, So Help Me God. Anytime we had differences, and we did from time to time, I thought as vice president, it was important that I only express those differences in private to the president. But January of 2021, things had to be different because I have a higher loyalty to God and the Constitution, and I'll always believe that we did our duty that day, that we kept our oath to the Constitution. But what happened that day angered me. You know, as I looked at the site on our cell phones and on a small television in the Senate office where I was standing, and saw people breaking windows and vandalizing a Capitol that I had dreamed as a little boy of serving in, growing up in Columbus, Indiana, and then had the privilege to serve in for 12 years. It just infuriated me. I was struck with a sense of not this, not here, not in America. But I must tell you, by the time we made it to the parking garage, I knew I had to put all those emotions aside. When the tweet came across from the president saying that I lack courage it angered me, but I really didn't have time for it. I thought it was a moment where it was clear to me the president had decided to be a part of the problem. And I was determined to be part of the solution. And we convened the Republican and Democrat leaders of the Congress and started to work to get the response from the Pentagon and the Justice Department to support all those remarkable people in the Capitol Hill police that were holding the line against the angry crowd. Did he at some level, on some level betray you? Well, I'm not a victim, Steve. I'm not. I'm a guy that did my duty that day, and I'll never see it any other way. But I will tell you that the way that Republicans and Democrat leaders came together that day, I think would be an inspiration to people around this country. We huddled on our first conference call. I heard from the Speaker, and from Leader Schumer, Leader McCarthy and Leader McConnell, a great frustration on their part. They were not getting answers. or they were getting conflicting answers, about what the federal assistance would be and when help would arrive at the Capitol. And that's when I said to the leadership, I was the presiding officer under the Constitution of the joint session, but I said to them, \"Do you want me to get involved?\" m. And I was determined to stay at my post. I felt instinctively that by remaining in the capital, it might facilitate even a quicker response by federal authorities to come alongside the Capitol Hill police as they fought against the rioters. But I thought it was important that I ask the leaders of the Congress if they wanted me to engage. They all adamantly said yes. I said once before we hung up the first call. I said again, \"You want me to get answers?\" They said, \"Yes.\" And I said, \"I'm on it.\" And then leaning against a cinder block wall in the parking garage with notes strewn out in front of me, I started to work the phones. I spoke to the Pentagon, I spoke to the Justice Department and I spoke to the Capitol Hill police chief on a number of occasions when he informed me that it appeared that the violence would be quelled. Late that afternoon, I asked him to come down to the parking garage to brief me personally. And then I contacted the Democrat and Republican leadership and told them that it appeared that we would be able to reconvene the Congress and complete our work under the Constitution by 7 p.m. that night. Which, in fact, you did. It took all night, as I recall, before you got home, but the work was done. I want to ask about the period leading up to that, because, of course, there was a period of several months leading up to that in which the president first predicted and then claimed a stolen election. You write something very interesting in this book. You say that, I believe, on November 7th. Two months before the attack on the Capitol, the race had been called for Joe Biden. And you spoke with Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, and said you were not convinced that there had been sufficient irregularities to change the election. In the period that followed, did you consider yourself saying something in public or even conceding the race yourself because you were on the ballot, too? Well, let me clarify something that's in the book, So Help me God, is that even at that early point, I was not convinced that there was fraud sufficient to change the outcome of the election. And, of course, evidence of widespread fraud would never come. But I was concerned about the voting irregularities that had taken place. And I said so all the way up to my correspondence to Congress on January 6th. I mean, there were a half a dozen states around the country, Steve, that in the name of COVID had changed the rules around elections, sometimes through executive action, sometimes through an attorney general's decision. Sure.\n\nAnd in many cases, as my staff briefed me, in many cases, they were changes that seemed to benefit Democrat candidates in those states above Republicans. I thought it was important that we have that debate. It was one of the reasons why I made it clear going into January 6th that I thought a fulsome debate about irregularities and any evidence of fraud that may emerge would be useful for the country, if only to set the stage for future reform, which I'm glad to see is happening in states around the country. Laws have changed. But did you think about or discuss doing as Attorney General Barr did? I think on December 1st and just say, listen, \"There's not sufficient evidence here of anything major?\" For my part, I thought it was important that we just continue to support both the legal challenges as well as the legal processes that are established under federal law. And for all intents and purposes at the moment, at which the states certified their elections, the election was over, but we still had the process established. When Rutherford B Hayes was elected president after a controversial election, the Electoral Count Act was established. I thought it was important as the presiding officer that we see all of those challenges through. But as I write and So Help Me God, it would be just a matter of a week or so after the election that I told the president that if the challenges in the court didn't play out, he should simply accept the result and support a peaceful transfer of power. And if he wanted to run again, he could run again.\n\nGranting that your advice to the president is private, could you have told us what you knew at that point? I think it was important in that moment that we let the courts, the states through certification and then the Congress... Look, the core of the president and my confrontation was over the fact that he had a gaggle of outside lawyers that were telling him that as vice president, I had unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes to count. Which, no vice president in American history had ever claimed that authority. The American presidency belongs to the American people, the American people alone. But disputes over electoral votes under federal law are decided by the elected representatives of the American people in the Congress. And I thought it was important that we work entirely through that process, uphold the Constitution, uphold the laws of the country, and move our country forward under the rule of law. I want people to know that you include some of your past speeches in this book, in an appendix in the end, including your 2016 convention speech in Cleveland accepting the vice presidential nomination. I was in Cleveland at the time, I watched that speech. It's a good speech. I appreciated reading it again. Thank you. In that speech, you say Donald Trump is a good man, not just that he was the man for the moment, or the right man, or a strong candidate, but a good man. Do you still believe he's a good man? President Trump was wrong on January 6th in arguing that I had the authority to overturn the election. But I'll always be proud of the record that we created for the American people, Steve. I mean, I joined the ticket because I thought the country was in a lot of trouble. I thought if we stayed on the path that we were on, we would tend to weaken our economy, weaken America's place in the world. And under the Trump administration, we rebuilt our military, we launched the first new branch of our Armed Forces in 75 years. Our military crushed the ISIS caliphate. We took out the most dangerous terrorists in the world. And Russia never tried to redraw international lines by force during our administration, which remains the only administration in the 21st century where that can be said. 7 million good paying jobs, revived our economy, became energy independent and of course, saw 300 conservatives appointed to our courts at every level. So of course, I'm incredibly proud of the record of our administration. I was proud to work with President Trump throughout. But as I write it, So Help Me God. President Trump was wrong and his his words and actions that day were reckless. They endangered my family and people at the Capitol building. And, uh, I'll never hold any other view. While you're proud of the record, you didn't just call him a good man again. Well, look, I truly do believe that only God knows our hearts. And I'll, uh, I'll leave it to others to make their own judgments. But I must tell you that the president and I enjoyed a close working relationship, and. And I know it may...it may strike people in a surprising fashion. But in the days after January 6th, when the president asked to meet with me privately. I'd made no effort to reach out to him. The morning after that tragic day he had said what needed to be said. He condemned the violence. He committed to a peaceful transfer of power. But I told his daughter and son-in-law if he had something he wanted to say to me, I'd hear him out. I went down to the Oval Office and walked to that back dining room where he and I had spent so many hours together and, I will tell you, I sense that he was, that he was, remorseful about what had happened. His first question to me was about my daughter and my wife.\n\nWho had been with you at the time. Who had been with me the entire time. He said, \"How are Charlotte and Karen\" And I said rather startlingly, \"They're fine.\" I said they were with me the whole time. They wouldn't leave. And then he asked me, \"Were you scared?\" And I said, \"No, Mr. President, I was angry.\" I made it clear to him I was angry at our differences. And I said that seeing those people ransacking the Capitol just infuriated me. I truly do believe, Steve, that those people may have thought they were our supporters, but they're not our movement. I mean, I had spent the last four and a half years speaking at rallies around the country, meeting people in our movement. And they were some of the most patriotic, God fearing, law abiding people I'd ever met in my life who would never have done something like that there or anywhere else. But we talked through the issues that day. I was very direct with him about what I had done and my determination and my conviction that what I'd done was consistent with the oath of office that I'd taken in the Constitution. But in the days that followed, we talked from time and time again, and when we left the White House, we parted amicably. Um, we even spoke on the phone from time to time after we left office. But, uh, Steve, when the president returned to the rhetoric he was using before January 6th, began again to question those of us that had defended the Constitution. I just thought it was important that we go our separate ways and we have. I want to ask about your future, because you have told other interviewers that in the weeks to come, perhaps you will consider your future, talk with your family and pray. So I understand that. I'd like to understand something about what's on your mind, though. If you ran for president. If you were president, what would your purpose be? What would you want to do with the power? Well, I'm always very humbled when people ask me whether or not I'm considering running for the highest office in the land. Back in 2010 when I was considering coming home to run for governor of Indiana or enter a national campaign, as some conservatives urged me to do. People would ask me, Do you ever thought about running for president? I'd always say \"No more, no less than any other kid that grew up with a cornfield in his backyard. I mean, that's kind of what it is to be an American, right? (laughs). You can dream your dreams.\n\nAnybody can be president. Sure. But why would you want to be?\n\nAnybody can be anybody.\n\nBut what would be the point for you? Well, you know, for me, it all comes down to a belief in service. I mean, my dad was a combat veteran in the Korean War. My grandfather came to this country - I was named after him - stepped off on a boat onto Ellis Island, raised my mom, who is 90 years young this month, living here in Indiana. Unstoppable. First generation Irish American. I watched my parents live the American Dream in a small town here in Indiana, and my dad always raised us with the idea that you ought to give back to your country, a country that had given our families so much. And that's somewhere in my youth, the dream of representing my hometown in Congress was born, but I never imagined I'd have the chance to be governor of this state or vice president of the United States. So for me and my family, when you say if we were to run well, first is we'd run in such a way that we've sought to run the last 20 years, which is that we wouldn't run against anybody. We'd run for things. I started out in politics as a Democrat. In my teenage years. But in the voice and values of Ronald Reagan, I heard the ideals of my youth, and I joined the Reagan revolution and never looked back. And but early on in my life as I write and So Help Me God, I learned some hard lessons in politics. I got caught up in a couple of negative personal campaigns for Congress. Steve. I not only lost, but I lost a lot of my self-respect, as I write about in the book. But after that, I wrote an essay entitled Confessions of a Negative Campaigner in 1991. In which I reflect on the fact that what I profess to believe as a Christian, I set aside in my campaigns. The heart of the Christian faith apart from trusting in Jesus Christ is to do unto others as you would have them do unto you. It's known as the Golden Rule. And I hadn't done that. I'd failed to live out my faith in the public square. And I wrote an essay with the thought of just being honest about how I'd failed. And never imagining ten years later, that I'd have the opportunity to try again. And ever since then, I've sought to run in such a way, that first honors God, advances issues and ideals, and then is about winning. But as you say, what would it be about? You know, I really do believe, as I've been traveling around this country, what I've heard from the American people is they want to get back to the policies of the Trump-Pence administration, of a strong military, of free market economics, conservatives on our courts, America's standing with our allies, standing up to our enemies. But I think they long for leadership that could unite our country around our highest ideals and demonstrate the kind of respect and civility that the American people show each other every day. You know, our politics is very divided right now, maybe more than any time in my lifetime. But you know, moving back to Indiana, shopping at the grocery store, going to the gas station, being back around family and friends, traveling the country, I'm not convinced that the American people are as divided as our politics. I mean, the truth is, and it'll be true this Thanksgiving week, the American people figured out how to get along with each other, people you don't agree with on every issue. And what I like to say is that what I hear is people longing for leadership that reflects that same kind of civility and respect that I've always tried to aspire to, at least in the back end of my political career. One of the reasons I ask why you'd want to do this is because, as I'm sure you know, there's a debate about the future of the Republican Party. And there are some people who advocate what has been called national conservatism, which could be defined in different ways. But one way to think of it is, instead of going for small government and limited government, a kind of libertarian approach, maybe you endorse a bigger or more active government that will promote or even impose traditional values. Do you support that way of thinking? Well, I'm not sure I've heard it put quite that way. But look, I'm a Christian, a conservative and a Republican in that order. I've said that since my days on talk radio that I write about in So Help Me God. But I'm a limited government conservative. You know, I think one of the things that I think I brought to the Trump-Pence administration was not just my experience in Congress, but having been a governor. And understanding the role that governors and states play really informed my approach to leading the White House coronavirus task force. I mean, I knew from early on that our job was to get the states and get governors the resources, supplies that they needed to meet their moment. And that was the system that our founders had created. And so for me, it, you know, it all comes down to the Constitution, Steve. It all comes down to the limited government republic that our founders enshrined. And that's the foundation that I set - And so more of the Ronald Reagan idea than the national conservatism idea. As Ronald Reagan said in his first inaugural address, it's important to remember the states created the federal government. The federal government didn't create the states. And I think we would do well as a country to seize a moment where we, again, encourage states to be those laboratories of democracy and innovation that our founders contemplated. They're now, of course, laboratories of debate on abortion. And abortion was on the ballot in a number of states this fall. In numerous states, people voted in various ways in favor of abortion rights. And it appears that candidates who supported abortion rights did well. What message did you take from that election? On that issue.\n\nWell, let me say I'm. I'm pro-life. I don't apologize for it. I'll always cherish the fact that I was vice president in the administration that appointed three of the justices of the Supreme Court. that gave us a new beginning for life, that returned the question of abortion to the states and to the American people where it belongs. And now that debate begins, I said, in the wake of the Dobbs decision, that we haven't come to the end. We've come to the end of the beginning. And I'm determined in however many years I have left on this earth to be a voice for the unborn and to work every day to restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law. But I've said to my fellow pro-life champions, it may take us as long to restore the sanctity of life to the center of law in every state in this country as it took us to overturn Roe versus Wade. But I believe a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable. The aged, the infirmed, the disabled and the unborn. And all of my life, I'll... whatever role we're in, I'll look to be a voice for the right to life. You don't think that this election is the signal of where the country is going on this? Well, I will tell you that the common denominator for me was that Republicans who articulated their position on the right to life, did well. Republicans who did not articulate their position, and allowed their position to be defined, did not do as well. And the truth is that, the Democratic Party today supports abortion on demand up to the moment of birth and taxpayer funding of abortion. Those are positions that are supported by about one out of four Americans. I truly believe that this is a pro-life country. We're still divided on the issue, Steve. I should mention President Biden has said the Roe versus Wade standard is the one that he would approve. That's the way I think he would phrase it. And in fact, he has, in on the record statements. I didn't hear you. President Biden has said that the standard of Roe versus Wade is the one that he supports. which is a little different than abortion on demand up to the moment of birth. It is...I will tell you, the Democratic Party have been very clear in their position on this issue. And I believe that the candidates that articulated their position on life, wherever that was, protecting the unborn, fared better than Democrat candidates in race after race. But, look, I want to concede a point. We have a ways to go in this issue. But I believe that in the most prosperous nation on earth we ought to be a nation that is grounded in the unalienable right to life and makes it possible for women in crisis pregnancies to go to term, or raise their child, or give their child up for adoption. But I also think it's just as important as you see states advance pro-life legislation that the advanced legislation, not just for the unborn, but for the newborn. I think we have a unique opportunity to demonstrate the deep compassion of the American people and say yes to life with the generosity and the kindness of every American. One of the most interesting chapters in this book is called Blessed. (coughs) Excuse me. You laugh, but it's an interesting chapter. Do you like the title? It's a fascinating title. And it begins with a quote, a biblical quote about persecution. And in the course of the chapter, which is about your faith and people's responses to your faith, you say have been mocked that you were the focus of a mania about your faith, faith that you faced hostility and intolerance, and that Christians generally were insulted and demeaned, and also that your faith had been misunderstood. What is it that people misunderstood? Well, let me say, Steve, I've never heard any of that from you. But when my wife was attacked for teaching at a Christian school. When one media outlet after another ridiculed our Christian faith from time to time, I was always struck by that. Because, you know, as I traveled around America, the words I most often heard, and I heard them every day. People would reach out across a rope line or stop me on a street corner and say, \"I'm praying for you.\" I mean, this is a nation of faith, of different faiths. I'm a born again Christian, raised in a wonderful Catholic home. But the American people cherish faith in the overwhelming majority. And yet it seemed to be a subject of fascination by some in the liberal media. But it was always a blessing to me because the net effect of it was as I as I would learn, traveling around the country, I was always reminded that some of the criticism from those on the left about my deeply held religious beliefs would invariably remind people that I, who shared those values and those beliefs, that we share have something in common. When you said you were misunderstood in the chapter, I believe you were talking about very in various ways, people in the LGBTQ community. Is there something on issues having to do with sexual orientation and gender that people misunderstand about you? Well, I write an entire chapter, in the book, about our experience here in Indiana. With the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. You know, I believe President John F Kennedy said, to lead is to be misunderstood. And here was a bill in the run up to the decision legalizing gay marriage by the Supreme Court. It was immediately characterized in the media as a license to discriminate, which, of course, it clearly wasn't. And legal scholars at the time recognized that. And we found our way through it. And we eventually took actions necessary to reassure people that there was no license to discriminate. You know, I'm a Hoosier, Steve. You know something about that. Hoosier hospitality is not a slogan. It literally is the way we live every day. Hoosier's are some of the most caring, compassionate, strong willed, but strong hearted people you'll ever meet in your life. And I said at the time when I was governor, I don't believe anyone should ever be harassed or discriminated against because of who they are, who they love, or what they believe. But that being said, there are profound implications on this question. As Justice Kennedy wrote in the Obergefell decision that, \"Bear upon religious freedom.\" And the courts have been sorting through that ever since. I will tell you, I've been encouraged that the Supreme Court has been striking a balance on the issues of religious liberty and individual rights. And I trust that the conservatives on the court will continue to do that. But if there's anything people don't understand well about the Pences, to know Karen and Mike Pence, to know our family is that we love everybody. My faith tells me to love your neighbor as yourself. And that's something we aspire to do every day, whether we agree with every view or every value of the people that we meet. One thing that occurred to me as I read this is that...(coughs). I am so sorry. Let me get a sip of water here and continue. Thank you so much. How are we doing for time? Great, we've got about five...got a couple of questions left. One thing that occurred to me as I read that chapter is that some of the words you use to describe the way you've been treated. I feel that I've heard from people who identify as lesbian or gay or trans that they faced hostility or a mania, that they've been mocked, they faced intolerance, that they were insulted, they were demeaned. You probably followed the news of the nightclub shooting in Colorado just in the last few days. Heartbreaking. What would you say to reassure, if anything, your fellow citizens who feel that way? Well, I do believe that it adheres to the American character to show tolerance. Just who we are. And not just here in the Midwest, but really all across this country. You know, during my time as Vice President, my opinion of the American people went up, not down. I've seen the American people in good times, I've seen them facing natural disasters and I've seen the incredible generosity. What I write about and So Help me God, is that for many Bible believing Christians, we perceive what I call the intolerance of tolerance. That in the name of tolerance, people are intolerant - Toward people like you.\n\nOf traditional views. And I don't. I don't argue for a moment that people on the other end of that debate have felt the same way. One of the reasons is, I think we need to get to a place. Where we recognize again what really the First Amendment is all about. And that is it's the right to live, to work, to worship according to the dictates of your conscience and to respect one another. I do think it's one of the things I've heard over and over traveling around the country. As I said before, and that I think the American people long for leadership at the national level. That shows the respect and civility that Americans show to one another every day, whether it's at the grocery store or the gas station or at work or at worship or across a backyard fence. It's just the reality. The American people actually get along pretty well every day because we're tolerant and caring, and we're the most generous people in the history of the world. And so I think there is much to be said about hunger in our country for that kind of leadership. And people say that to me, and I'm humbled because they tend to associate us at least, at least in our recent career with aspiring to be that kind of a voice. How do you grade your party, particularly this year, on that issue of tolerance? I'm thinking of the governor of Utah, a Republican who vetoed a bill having to do with sports and was overridden. And as part of that issued a message in which he said, I want to show compassion for people, even if I don't agree with them. And also, it seemed to me he was saying, I don't understand why this is even important. Why are we legislating on something that involves so few people? The suggestion being that a small number of people were being demonized. How would you grade your party on that? I think our party has made it clear that the doors of the Republican Party are wide open. I remember being at the Republican National Convention when the president acknowledged the support of the LGBT community, and there was rousing applause at that Cleveland convention stage, Steve. You remember. You were there. But you know, for us to have achieved the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African-Americans, the lowest unemployment ever recorded for Hispanic Americans, I think that our party made great strides in the four years of the Trump administration, making clear what our values were, what our core values were, but also making it clear that that every American is welcome in the Republican Party. The administration reversed trans issues in the military, for example, programs that were attempting to encourage tolerance there. Well, I and I respect and support that decision. I just think we always need to put military readiness and the mission of our military first and issues that would be obscure to most Americans except those who've served in the military or are serving now. Issues like unit cohesion are absolutely essential to an effective military. And I, I think that it's it's important as we see this administration flatlining military spending, as we see the advance of of ideas like critical race theory making their way into Pentagon policies that we...Look, the military in the United States of America since the founding of this country, has been a melting pot for the American people. We ought to celebrate that, but we should never lose focus on the purpose of our military, which is to defend the nation and stand with our allies. I want to impose on you one more question before I let you go. It is about your youth. It's about what?\n\nYour youth! You write a fascinating story about a kid who is finding his way in the world. You say that you were fifty pounds overweight and were unhappy about it. At one point, you lose weight, you gain confidence. You learn to give speeches and win competitions. But you say you end up full of yourself. Later comes a period where you change your faith. How often, when you're going through your political life, do you think about that uncertain, unformed, insecure kid and what he wanted and what he needed? Well, first, thanks for reading, So Help Me God. I'm humbled by that. And, I can tell you that from very early on, my Irish grandfather told me I was the only Irishman born in our family, which I think may have been because I had the gift of the gab. But I learned that I had the ability to say things, give speeches in elementary school and high school. I competed even nationally. But as I wrote in the book, when I went off to college, I had a pretty healthy opinion of myself. But I knew down in my heart that I really didn't know Who I was or what I believed. And it was off in college in my freshman year that I met people whose Christian faith was...the likes of which I hadn't encountered before. I'd grown up in a wonderful Catholic family. My parents were both devout believers who'd poured that foundation, but I lost interest in religion completely when I went off to college. But I met people who talked to me about having a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ. And in those discussions and in that time in my life, I felt drawn to making a personal decision in my faith. And in the spring of 1978, made what I believe is the most important decision of my life, and that was to accept Christ as my personal savior. And everything I've done since then begins there, trying to keep faith with what I believe that God in his word requires of me, both as a husband, as a father, uh, as a grandfather, now, as a public servant. And, um, it's that faith, it's the relationship with my incredible wife of 37 years. It's the kids that are the part of our lives that are going to continue to steer us and continue to focus us. But I'm a long way from that young man back in Columbus, Indiana. But, um, whatever progress we've made is owing to the grace of God, to my family, and to the support of the people of Indiana and America. Is that kid still in you, though? Because that kid was ambitious. Tried to win the Optimist Club competition. Maybe I can see a little bit of you in that kid. That kid will always be in me. And he's one of the reasons I have a fundamental distrust of my own ambition. My own ambition has carried me places early in my career that I learned hard lessons. But ever since that time, we've always sought just a kind of reflect, pray, talk to one another as a family. Talk to trusted friends to discern what our calling might be and whatever the future holds. We know who holds the future, and we'll go where we're called. Mr. Vice President, it's been a pleasure. Thank you so much. Steve. Thank you. It's good to be with you.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Former Vice President Mike Pence on his new book, 'So Help Me God'\n\nSteve Inskeep\n\nNPR's Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep talks with former Vice President Mike Pence about his new book, \"So Help Me God,\" and how his faith informed his political career.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Former Vice President Mike Pence is considering a presidential run. He would seek the Republican nomination against Donald Trump, the president he once served. In a memoir, he's telling his story of January 6, 2021, when he ignored demands to overturn Trump's election defeat. He discussed his role in that election on today's Morning Edition. Pence also talked about his life with our own Steve Inskeep. STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: We met at the Indiana State Capitol, where Pence once served as governor. He grew up in the small city of Columbus, Ind. And his book, \"So Help Me God,\" describes his youth. He was overweight and unhappy about it, he writes, a kid out of place but also eager to rise. MIKE PENCE: That kid will always be in me. And he's one of the reasons I have a fundamental distrust of my own ambition. INSKEEP: He lost the weight and won speech competitions sponsored by the Optimist Club. He also says he grew full of himself and struggled to reconcile his ambition with his evangelical faith. He ran for Congress, lost and later publicly recanted negative campaigns. In 2016, he agreed to serve as Donald Trump's running mate and vouched for him to other evangelicals. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PENCE: Donald Trump is a good man, and he will... INSKEEP: In our talk this week, he no longer called Trump a good man but says he is still praying for him. Much of Pence's memoir dwells in the way that his faith shaped his conservative politics and view of the world. One of the most interesting chapters in this book is called \"Blessed.\" PENCE: (Laughter). INSKEEP: You laugh, but it's an interesting chapter. PENCE: Do you like the title? INSKEEP: It's a fascinating title. And it begins with a quote, a biblical quote, about persecution. And in the course of the chapter, which is about your faith and people's responses to your faith, you say you have been mocked, that you were the focus of a mania about your faith, that you faced hostility and intolerance and that Christians generally were insulted and demeaned and also that your faith had been misunderstood. What is it that people misunderstood? PENCE: Well, let me say, Steve, I've never heard any of that from you. But when my wife was attacked for teaching at a Christian school, when one media outlet after another ridiculed our Christian faith from time to time, I was always struck by that because, you know, as I traveled around America, the words I most often heard were - people would reach out across a rope line or stop me on a street corner and say, I'm praying for you.

INSKEEP: When you said you were misunderstood in the chapter, I believe you were talking about people in the LGBTQ community. Is there something on issues having to do with sexual orientation and gender that people misunderstand about you? PENCE: Well, I write an entire chapter in the book about our experience here in Indiana with the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. You know, I believe President John F. Kennedy said to lead is to be misunderstood. INSKEEP: In 2015, the Supreme Court affirmed a right to same-sex marriage. Pence was then governor of Indiana and signed what was seen as a response. The state religious freedom law said no person or church or company should have to bear a, quote, \"substantial burden on their religious beliefs.\" Critics asserted that that allowed discrimination for religious reasons, though Pence tried to defend the law on ABC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes or no. Should it be legal to discriminate against gays and lesbians? PENCE: George, you're following the mantra of the last week online, and you're trying to make this issue about something else. What I am for is protecting, with the highest standards in our courts, the religious liberty of Hoosiers. INSKEEP: Facing overwhelming public pressure, the governor signed follow-up bills that assured protection. PENCE: I don't support discrimination against gays or lesbians or anyone else. INSKEEP: Pence still insists the original law did not discriminate. He adds that, in recent years, the Supreme Court has supported religious concerns like the ones he raised. A Colorado baker, for example, who famously declined to make a cake for a gay wedding won his case. And that was even before the Trump administration added three justices to the court. PENCE: I will tell you I have been encouraged that the Supreme Court has been striking a balance on the issues of religious liberty and individual rights. But if there's anything people don't understand well about the Pences is to know Karen and Mike Pence - to know our family. We love everybody. My faith tells me to love your neighbor as yourself. And that's something we aspire to do every day, whether we agree with every view or every value of the people that we meet. INSKEEP: One thing that occurred to me as I read that chapter is that some of the words you use to describe the way you've been treated, I feel that I've heard from people who identify as lesbian or gay or trans, that they faced hostility or a mania, that they'd been mocked, that they faced intolerance, that they were insulted, they were demeaned. You probably followed the news of the nightclub shooting in Colorado just in the last few days. PENCE: Heartbreaking. INSKEEP: What would you say to reassure your fellow citizens who feel that way? PENCE: Well, I do believe that it adheres to the American character to show tolerance - it's just who we are. For many Bible-believing Christians, we perceive what I call the intolerance of tolerance - that in the name of tolerance, people are intolerant of... INSKEEP: Toward people like you. You feel... PENCE: ...Traditional views. And I don't argue for a moment that people on the other end of that debate have felt the same way. It's why one of the reasons is that I think we need to get to a place where we recognize, again, what really the First Amendment is all about. And that is it's the right to live, to work, to worship according to the dictates of your conscience and to respect one another. INSKEEP: How do you grade your party, particularly this year, on that issue of tolerance? I'm thinking of the governor of Utah, a Republican who vetoed a bill having to do with trans sports and was overridden and, as part of that, issued a message in which he said, I want to show compassion for people even if I don't agree with them. And also, it seemed to me, he was saying, I don't understand why this is even important. Why are we legislating on something that involves so few people, the suggestion being that a small number of people were being demonized. How would you grade your party on that? PENCE: I think our party has made it clear that the doors of the Republican Party are wide open. I mean, I remember being at the Republican National Convention when the president acknowledged the support of the LGBT community. And there was rousing applause at that Cleveland convention, Steve. You remember. You were there. You know? INSKEEP: The administration reversed trans issues in the military, for example, programs that were attempting to encourage tolerance there. PENCE: Well, and I respect and support that decision. I just think we always need to put military readiness and the mission of our military first. INSKEEP: The Trump administration prevented trans people from openly serving, arguing their presence would interfere with military readiness, though the Pentagon found their service consistent with that. The Biden administration now allows them to serve. Former Vice President Mike Pence is considering his future. His memoir, \"So Help Me God,\" is seen as a possible preliminary to a presidential run.

He would seek the Republican nomination against Donald Trump, the president he once served. In a memoir, he's telling his story of January 6, 2021, when he ignored demands to overturn Trump's election defeat. He discussed his role in that election on today's Morning Edition. Pence also talked about his life with our own Steve Inskeep. STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: We met at the Indiana State Capitol, where Pence once served as governor. He grew up in the small city of Columbus, Ind. And his book, \"So Help Me God,\" describes his youth. He was overweight and unhappy about it, he writes, a kid out of place but also eager to rise. MIKE PENCE: That kid will always be in me. And he's one of the reasons I have a fundamental distrust of my own ambition. INSKEEP: He lost the weight and won speech competitions sponsored by the Optimist Club. He also says he grew full of himself and struggled to reconcile his ambition with his evangelical faith. He ran for Congress, lost and later publicly recanted negative campaigns. In 2016, he agreed to serve as Donald Trump's running mate and vouched for him to other evangelicals. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PENCE: Donald Trump is a good man, and he will... INSKEEP: In our talk this week, he no longer called Trump a good man but says he is still praying for him. Much of Pence's memoir dwells in the way that his faith shaped his conservative politics and view of the world. One of the most interesting chapters in this book is called \"Blessed.\" PENCE: (Laughter). INSKEEP: You laugh, but it's an interesting chapter. PENCE: Do you like the title? INSKEEP: It's a fascinating title. And it begins with a quote, a biblical quote, about persecution. And in the course of the chapter, which is about your faith and people's responses to your faith, you say you have been mocked, that you were the focus of a mania about your faith, that you faced hostility and intolerance and that Christians generally were insulted and demeaned and also that your faith had been misunderstood. What is it that people misunderstood? PENCE: Well, let me say, Steve, I've never heard any of that from you. But when my wife was attacked for teaching at a Christian school, when one media outlet after another ridiculed our Christian faith from time to time, I was always struck by that because, you know, as I traveled around America, the words I most often heard were - people would reach out across a rope line or stop me on a street corner and say, I'm praying for you. I mean, this is a nation of faith, of different faiths. But the American people cherish faith in the overwhelming majority. And yet it seemed to be a subject of fascination by some in the liberal media. But it was always a blessing to me because the net effect of it was, as I would learn traveling around the country, I was always reminded that some of the criticism from those on the left about my deeply held religious beliefs would invariably remind people that I - who shared those values and those beliefs that we shared something in common.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes or no. Should it be legal to discriminate against gays and lesbians? PENCE: George, you're following the mantra of the last week online, and you're trying to make this issue about something else. What I am for is protecting, with the highest standards in our courts, the religious liberty of Hoosiers. INSKEEP: Facing overwhelming public pressure, the governor signed follow-up bills that assured protection. PENCE: I don't support discrimination against gays or lesbians or anyone else. INSKEEP: Pence still insists the original law did not discriminate. He adds that, in recent years, the Supreme Court has supported religious concerns like the ones he raised. A Colorado baker, for example, who famously declined to make a cake for a gay wedding won his case. And that was even before the Trump administration added three justices to the court. PENCE: I will tell you I have been encouraged that the Supreme Court has been striking a balance on the issues of religious liberty and individual rights. But if there's anything people don't understand well about the Pences is to know Karen and Mike Pence - to know our family. We love everybody. My faith tells me to love your neighbor as yourself. And that's something we aspire to do every day, whether we agree with every view or every value of the people that we meet. INSKEEP: One thing that occurred to me as I read that chapter is that some of the words you use to describe the way you've been treated, I feel that I've heard from people who identify as lesbian or gay or trans, that they faced hostility or a mania, that they'd been mocked, that they faced intolerance, that they were insulted, they were demeaned. You probably followed the news of the nightclub shooting in Colorado just in the last few days. PENCE: Heartbreaking. INSKEEP: What would you say to reassure your fellow citizens who feel that way? PENCE: Well, I do believe that it adheres to the American character to show tolerance - it's just who we are. For many Bible-believing Christians, we perceive what I call the intolerance of tolerance - that in the name of tolerance, people are intolerant of... INSKEEP: Toward people like you. You feel... PENCE: ...Traditional views. And I don't argue for a moment that people on the other end of that debate have felt the same way. It's why one of the reasons is that I think we need to get to a place where we recognize, again, what really the First Amendment is all about. And that is it's the right to live, to work, to worship according to the dictates of your conscience and to respect one another. INSKEEP: How do you grade your party, particularly this year, on that issue of tolerance? I'm thinking of the governor of Utah, a Republican who vetoed a bill having to do with trans sports and was overridden and, as part of that, issued a message in which he said, I want to show compassion for people even if I don't agree with them. And also, it seemed to me, he was saying, I don't understand why this is even important. Why are we legislating on something that involves so few people, the suggestion being that a small number of people were being demonized. How would you grade your party on that? PENCE: I think our party has made it clear that the doors of the Republican Party are wide open. I mean, I remember being at the Republican National Convention when the president acknowledged the support of the LGBT community. And there was rousing applause at that Cleveland convention, Steve. You remember. You were there. You know? INSKEEP: The administration reversed trans issues in the military, for example, programs that were attempting to encourage tolerance there. PENCE: Well, and I respect and support that decision. I just think we always need to put military readiness and the mission of our military first. INSKEEP: The Trump administration prevented trans people from openly serving, arguing their presence would interfere with military readiness, though the Pentagon found their service consistent with that. The Biden administration now allows them to serve. Former Vice President Mike Pence is considering his future. His memoir, \"So Help Me God,\" is seen as a possible preliminary to a presidential run.

He grew up in the small city of Columbus, Ind. And his book, \"So Help Me God,\" describes his youth. He was overweight and unhappy about it, he writes, a kid out of place but also eager to rise. MIKE PENCE: That kid will always be in me. And he's one of the reasons I have a fundamental distrust of my own ambition. INSKEEP: He lost the weight and won speech competitions sponsored by the Optimist Club. He also says he grew full of himself and struggled to reconcile his ambition with his evangelical faith. He ran for Congress, lost and later publicly recanted negative campaigns. In 2016, he agreed to serve as Donald Trump's running mate and vouched for him to other evangelicals. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PENCE: Donald Trump is a good man, and he will... INSKEEP: In our talk this week, he no longer called Trump a good man but says he is still praying for him. Much of Pence's memoir dwells in the way that his faith shaped his conservative politics and view of the world. One of the most interesting chapters in this book is called \"Blessed.\" PENCE: (Laughter). INSKEEP: You laugh, but it's an interesting chapter. PENCE: Do you like the title? INSKEEP: It's a fascinating title. And it begins with a quote, a biblical quote, about persecution. And in the course of the chapter, which is about your faith and people's responses to your faith, you say you have been mocked, that you were the focus of a mania about your faith, that you faced hostility and intolerance and that Christians generally were insulted and demeaned and also that your faith had been misunderstood. What is it that people misunderstood? PENCE: Well, let me say, Steve, I've never heard any of that from you. But when my wife was attacked for teaching at a Christian school, when one media outlet after another ridiculed our Christian faith from time to time, I was always struck by that because, you know, as I traveled around America, the words I most often heard were - people would reach out across a rope line or stop me on a street corner and say, I'm praying for you. I mean, this is a nation of faith, of different faiths. But the American people cherish faith in the overwhelming majority. And yet it seemed to be a subject of fascination by some in the liberal media. But it was always a blessing to me because the net effect of it was, as I would learn traveling around the country, I was always reminded that some of the criticism from those on the left about my deeply held religious beliefs would invariably remind people that I - who shared those values and those beliefs that we shared something in common. INSKEEP: When you said you were misunderstood in the chapter, I believe you were talking about people in the LGBTQ community. Is there something on issues having to do with sexual orientation and gender that people misunderstand about you? PENCE: Well, I write an entire chapter in the book about our experience here in Indiana with the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. You know, I believe President John F. Kennedy said to lead is to be misunderstood. INSKEEP: In 2015, the Supreme Court affirmed a right to same-sex marriage. Pence was then governor of Indiana and signed what was seen as a response.

Why are we legislating on something that involves so few people, the suggestion being that a small number of people were being demonized. How would you grade your party on that? PENCE: I think our party has made it clear that the doors of the Republican Party are wide open. I mean, I remember being at the Republican National Convention when the president acknowledged the support of the LGBT community. And there was rousing applause at that Cleveland convention, Steve. You remember. You were there. You know? INSKEEP: The administration reversed trans issues in the military, for example, programs that were attempting to encourage tolerance there. PENCE: Well, and I respect and support that decision. I just think we always need to put military readiness and the mission of our military first. INSKEEP: The Trump administration prevented trans people from openly serving, arguing their presence would interfere with military readiness, though the Pentagon found their service consistent with that. The Biden administration now allows them to serve. Former Vice President Mike Pence is considering his future. His memoir, \"So Help Me God,\" is seen as a possible preliminary to a presidential run.

He also says he grew full of himself and struggled to reconcile his ambition with his evangelical faith. He ran for Congress, lost and later publicly recanted negative campaigns. In 2016, he agreed to serve as Donald Trump's running mate and vouched for him to other evangelicals. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PENCE: Donald Trump is a good man, and he will... INSKEEP: In our talk this week, he no longer called Trump a good man but says he is still praying for him. Much of Pence's memoir dwells in the way that his faith shaped his conservative politics and view of the world. One of the most interesting chapters in this book is called \"Blessed.\" PENCE: (Laughter). INSKEEP: You laugh, but it's an interesting chapter. PENCE: Do you like the title? INSKEEP: It's a fascinating title. And it begins with a quote, a biblical quote, about persecution. And in the course of the chapter, which is about your faith and people's responses to your faith, you say you have been mocked, that you were the focus of a mania about your faith, that you faced hostility and intolerance and that Christians generally were insulted and demeaned and also that your faith had been misunderstood. What is it that people misunderstood? PENCE: Well, let me say, Steve, I've never heard any of that from you. But when my wife was attacked for teaching at a Christian school, when one media outlet after another ridiculed our Christian faith from time to time, I was always struck by that because, you know, as I traveled around America, the words I most often heard were - people would reach out across a rope line or stop me on a street corner and say, I'm praying for you. I mean, this is a nation of faith, of different faiths. But the American people cherish faith in the overwhelming majority. And yet it seemed to be a subject of fascination by some in the liberal media. But it was always a blessing to me because the net effect of it was, as I would learn traveling around the country, I was always reminded that some of the criticism from those on the left about my deeply held religious beliefs would invariably remind people that I - who shared those values and those beliefs that we shared something in common. INSKEEP: When you said you were misunderstood in the chapter, I believe you were talking about people in the LGBTQ community. Is there something on issues having to do with sexual orientation and gender that people misunderstand about you? PENCE: Well, I write an entire chapter in the book about our experience here in Indiana with the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. You know, I believe President John F. Kennedy said to lead is to be misunderstood. INSKEEP: In 2015, the Supreme Court affirmed a right to same-sex marriage. Pence was then governor of Indiana and signed what was seen as a response. The state religious freedom law said no person or church or company should have to bear a, quote, \"substantial burden on their religious beliefs.\" Critics asserted that that allowed discrimination for religious reasons, though Pence tried to defend the law on ABC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes or no. Should it be legal to discriminate against gays and lesbians? PENCE: George, you're following the mantra of the last week online, and you're trying to make this issue about something else. What I am for is protecting, with the highest standards in our courts, the religious liberty of Hoosiers. INSKEEP: Facing overwhelming public pressure, the governor signed follow-up bills that assured protection. PENCE: I don't support discrimination against gays or lesbians or anyone else. INSKEEP: Pence still insists the original law did not discriminate. He adds that, in recent years, the Supreme Court has supported religious concerns like the ones he raised. A Colorado baker, for example, who famously declined to make a cake for a gay wedding won his case. And that was even before the Trump administration added three justices to the court. PENCE: I will tell you I have been encouraged that the Supreme Court has been striking a balance on the issues of religious liberty and individual rights. But if there's anything people don't understand well about the Pences is to know Karen and Mike Pence - to know our family. We love everybody. My faith tells me to love your neighbor as yourself. And that's something we aspire to do every day, whether we agree with every view or every value of the people that we meet. INSKEEP: One thing that occurred to me as I read that chapter is that some of the words you use to describe the way you've been treated, I feel that I've heard from people who identify as lesbian or gay or trans, that they faced hostility or a mania, that they'd been mocked, that they faced intolerance, that they were insulted, they were demeaned. You probably followed the news of the nightclub shooting in Colorado just in the last few days. PENCE: Heartbreaking. INSKEEP: What would you say to reassure your fellow citizens who feel that way? PENCE: Well, I do believe that it adheres to the American character to show tolerance - it's just who we are. For many Bible-believing Christians, we perceive what I call the intolerance of tolerance - that in the name of tolerance, people are intolerant of... INSKEEP: Toward people like you. You feel... PENCE: ...Traditional views. And I don't argue for a moment that people on the other end of that debate have felt the same way. It's why one of the reasons is that I think we need to get to a place where we recognize, again, what really the First Amendment is all about. And that is it's the right to live, to work, to worship according to the dictates of your conscience and to respect one another. INSKEEP: How do you grade your party, particularly this year, on that issue of tolerance? I'm thinking of the governor of Utah, a Republican who vetoed a bill having to do with trans sports and was overridden and, as part of that, issued a message in which he said, I want to show compassion for people even if I don't agree with them.

A Colorado baker, for example, who famously declined to make a cake for a gay wedding won his case. And that was even before the Trump administration added three justices to the court. PENCE: I will tell you I have been encouraged that the Supreme Court has been striking a balance on the issues of religious liberty and individual rights. But if there's anything people don't understand well about the Pences is to know Karen and Mike Pence - to know our family. We love everybody. My faith tells me to love your neighbor as yourself. And that's something we aspire to do every day, whether we agree with every view or every value of the people that we meet. INSKEEP: One thing that occurred to me as I read that chapter is that some of the words you use to describe the way you've been treated, I feel that I've heard from people who identify as lesbian or gay or trans, that they faced hostility or a mania, that they'd been mocked, that they faced intolerance, that they were insulted, they were demeaned. You probably followed the news of the nightclub shooting in Colorado just in the last few days. PENCE: Heartbreaking. INSKEEP: What would you say to reassure your fellow citizens who feel that way? PENCE: Well, I do believe that it adheres to the American character to show tolerance - it's just who we are. For many Bible-believing Christians, we perceive what I call the intolerance of tolerance - that in the name of tolerance, people are intolerant of... INSKEEP: Toward people like you. You feel... PENCE: ...Traditional views. And I don't argue for a moment that people on the other end of that debate have felt the same way. It's why one of the reasons is that I think we need to get to a place where we recognize, again, what really the First Amendment is all about. And that is it's the right to live, to work, to worship according to the dictates of your conscience and to respect one another. INSKEEP: How do you grade your party, particularly this year, on that issue of tolerance? I'm thinking of the governor of Utah, a Republican who vetoed a bill having to do with trans sports and was overridden and, as part of that, issued a message in which he said, I want to show compassion for people even if I don't agree with them. And also, it seemed to me, he was saying, I don't understand why this is even important. Why are we legislating on something that involves so few people, the suggestion being that a small number of people were being demonized. How would you grade your party on that? PENCE: I think our party has made it clear that the doors of the Republican Party are wide open. I mean, I remember being at the Republican National Convention when the president acknowledged the support of the LGBT community. And there was rousing applause at that Cleveland convention, Steve. You remember. You were there. You know? INSKEEP: The administration reversed trans issues in the military, for example, programs that were attempting to encourage tolerance there. PENCE: Well, and I respect and support that decision. I just think we always need to put military readiness and the mission of our military first. INSKEEP: The Trump administration prevented trans people from openly serving, arguing their presence would interfere with military readiness, though the Pentagon found their service consistent with that. The Biden administration now allows them to serve. Former Vice President Mike Pence is considering his future. His memoir, \"So Help Me God,\" is seen as a possible preliminary to a presidential run.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nINSKEEP: In our talk this week, he no longer called Trump a good man but says he is still praying for him. Much of Pence's memoir dwells in the way that his faith shaped his conservative politics and view of the world. One of the most interesting chapters in this book is called \"Blessed.\" PENCE: (Laughter). INSKEEP: You laugh, but it's an interesting chapter. PENCE: Do you like the title? INSKEEP: It's a fascinating title. And it begins with a quote, a biblical quote, about persecution. And in the course of the chapter, which is about your faith and people's responses to your faith, you say you have been mocked, that you were the focus of a mania about your faith, that you faced hostility and intolerance and that Christians generally were insulted and demeaned and also that your faith had been misunderstood. What is it that people misunderstood? PENCE: Well, let me say, Steve, I've never heard any of that from you. But when my wife was attacked for teaching at a Christian school, when one media outlet after another ridiculed our Christian faith from time to time, I was always struck by that because, you know, as I traveled around America, the words I most often heard were - people would reach out across a rope line or stop me on a street corner and say, I'm praying for you. I mean, this is a nation of faith, of different faiths. But the American people cherish faith in the overwhelming majority. And yet it seemed to be a subject of fascination by some in the liberal media. But it was always a blessing to me because the net effect of it was, as I would learn traveling around the country, I was always reminded that some of the criticism from those on the left about my deeply held religious beliefs would invariably remind people that I - who shared those values and those beliefs that we shared something in common. INSKEEP: When you said you were misunderstood in the chapter, I believe you were talking about people in the LGBTQ community. Is there something on issues having to do with sexual orientation and gender that people misunderstand about you? PENCE: Well, I write an entire chapter in the book about our experience here in Indiana with the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. You know, I believe President John F. Kennedy said to lead is to be misunderstood. INSKEEP: In 2015, the Supreme Court affirmed a right to same-sex marriage. Pence was then governor of Indiana and signed what was seen as a response. The state religious freedom law said no person or church or company should have to bear a, quote, \"substantial burden on their religious beliefs.\" Critics asserted that that allowed discrimination for religious reasons, though Pence tried to defend the law on ABC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes or no. Should it be legal to discriminate against gays and lesbians? PENCE: George, you're following the mantra of the last week online, and you're trying to make this issue about something else. What I am for is protecting, with the highest standards in our courts, the religious liberty of Hoosiers. INSKEEP: Facing overwhelming public pressure, the governor signed follow-up bills that assured protection. PENCE: I don't support discrimination against gays or lesbians or anyone else.

The state religious freedom law said no person or church or company should have to bear a, quote, \"substantial burden on their religious beliefs.\" Critics asserted that that allowed discrimination for religious reasons, though Pence tried to defend the law on ABC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes or no. Should it be legal to discriminate against gays and lesbians? PENCE: George, you're following the mantra of the last week online, and you're trying to make this issue about something else. What I am for is protecting, with the highest standards in our courts, the religious liberty of Hoosiers. INSKEEP: Facing overwhelming public pressure, the governor signed follow-up bills that assured protection. PENCE: I don't support discrimination against gays or lesbians or anyone else. INSKEEP: Pence still insists the original law did not discriminate. He adds that, in recent years, the Supreme Court has supported religious concerns like the ones he raised. A Colorado baker, for example, who famously declined to make a cake for a gay wedding won his case. And that was even before the Trump administration added three justices to the court. PENCE: I will tell you I have been encouraged that the Supreme Court has been striking a balance on the issues of religious liberty and individual rights. But if there's anything people don't understand well about the Pences is to know Karen and Mike Pence - to know our family. We love everybody. My faith tells me to love your neighbor as yourself. And that's something we aspire to do every day, whether we agree with every view or every value of the people that we meet. INSKEEP: One thing that occurred to me as I read that chapter is that some of the words you use to describe the way you've been treated, I feel that I've heard from people who identify as lesbian or gay or trans, that they faced hostility or a mania, that they'd been mocked, that they faced intolerance, that they were insulted, they were demeaned. You probably followed the news of the nightclub shooting in Colorado just in the last few days. PENCE: Heartbreaking. INSKEEP: What would you say to reassure your fellow citizens who feel that way? PENCE: Well, I do believe that it adheres to the American character to show tolerance - it's just who we are. For many Bible-believing Christians, we perceive what I call the intolerance of tolerance - that in the name of tolerance, people are intolerant of... INSKEEP: Toward people like you. You feel... PENCE: ...Traditional views. And I don't argue for a moment that people on the other end of that debate have felt the same way. It's why one of the reasons is that I think we need to get to a place where we recognize, again, what really the First Amendment is all about. And that is it's the right to live, to work, to worship according to the dictates of your conscience and to respect one another. INSKEEP: How do you grade your party, particularly this year, on that issue of tolerance? I'm thinking of the governor of Utah, a Republican who vetoed a bill having to do with trans sports and was overridden and, as part of that, issued a message in which he said, I want to show compassion for people even if I don't agree with them. And also, it seemed to me, he was saying, I don't understand why this is even important. Why are we legislating on something that involves so few people, the suggestion being that a small number of people were being demonized. How would you grade your party on that? PENCE: I think our party has made it clear that the doors of the Republican Party are wide open. I mean, I remember being at the Republican National Convention when the president acknowledged the support of the LGBT community. And there was rousing applause at that Cleveland convention, Steve. You remember. You were there. You know? INSKEEP: The administration reversed trans issues in the military, for example, programs that were attempting to encourage tolerance there. PENCE: Well, and I respect and support that decision. I just think we always need to put military readiness and the mission of our military first. INSKEEP: The Trump administration prevented trans people from openly serving, arguing their presence would interfere with military readiness, though the Pentagon found their service consistent with that. The Biden administration now allows them to serve. Former Vice President Mike Pence is considering his future. His memoir, \"So Help Me God,\" is seen as a possible preliminary to a presidential run.

INSKEEP: It's a fascinating title. And it begins with a quote, a biblical quote, about persecution. And in the course of the chapter, which is about your faith and people's responses to your faith, you say you have been mocked, that you were the focus of a mania about your faith, that you faced hostility and intolerance and that Christians generally were insulted and demeaned and also that your faith had been misunderstood. What is it that people misunderstood? PENCE: Well, let me say, Steve, I've never heard any of that from you. But when my wife was attacked for teaching at a Christian school, when one media outlet after another ridiculed our Christian faith from time to time, I was always struck by that because, you know, as I traveled around America, the words I most often heard were - people would reach out across a rope line or stop me on a street corner and say, I'm praying for you. I mean, this is a nation of faith, of different faiths. But the American people cherish faith in the overwhelming majority. And yet it seemed to be a subject of fascination by some in the liberal media. But it was always a blessing to me because the net effect of it was, as I would learn traveling around the country, I was always reminded that some of the criticism from those on the left about my deeply held religious beliefs would invariably remind people that I - who shared those values and those beliefs that we shared something in common. INSKEEP: When you said you were misunderstood in the chapter, I believe you were talking about people in the LGBTQ community. Is there something on issues having to do with sexual orientation and gender that people misunderstand about you? PENCE: Well, I write an entire chapter in the book about our experience here in Indiana with the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. You know, I believe President John F.

The state religious freedom law said no person or church or company should have to bear a, quote, \"substantial burden on their religious beliefs.\" Critics asserted that that allowed discrimination for religious reasons, though Pence tried to defend the law on ABC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes or no. Should it be legal to discriminate against gays and lesbians? PENCE: George, you're following the mantra of the last week online, and you're trying to make this issue about something else. What I am for is protecting, with the highest standards in our courts, the religious liberty of Hoosiers. INSKEEP: Facing overwhelming public pressure, the governor signed follow-up bills that assured protection. PENCE: I don't support discrimination against gays or lesbians or anyone else. INSKEEP: Pence still insists the original law did not discriminate. He adds that, in recent years, the Supreme Court has supported religious concerns like the ones he raised. A Colorado baker, for example, who famously declined to make a cake for a gay wedding won his case. And that was even before the Trump administration added three justices to the court. PENCE: I will tell you I have been encouraged that the Supreme Court has been striking a balance on the issues of religious liberty and individual rights. But if there's anything people don't understand well about the Pences is to know Karen and Mike Pence - to know our family. We love everybody. My faith tells me to love your neighbor as yourself. And that's something we aspire to do every day, whether we agree with every view or every value of the people that we meet. INSKEEP: One thing that occurred to me as I read that chapter is that some of the words you use to describe the way you've been treated, I feel that I've heard from people who identify as lesbian or gay or trans, that they faced hostility or a mania, that they'd been mocked, that they faced intolerance, that they were insulted, they were demeaned. You probably followed the news of the nightclub shooting in Colorado just in the last few days. PENCE: Heartbreaking. INSKEEP: What would you say to reassure your fellow citizens who feel that way? PENCE: Well, I do believe that it adheres to the American character to show tolerance - it's just who we are. For many Bible-believing Christians, we perceive what I call the intolerance of tolerance - that in the name of tolerance, people are intolerant of... INSKEEP: Toward people like you. You feel... PENCE: ...Traditional views. And I don't argue for a moment that people on the other end of that debate have felt the same way. It's why one of the reasons is that I think we need to get to a place where we recognize, again, what really the First Amendment is all about. And that is it's the right to live, to work, to worship according to the dictates of your conscience and to respect one another. INSKEEP: How do you grade your party, particularly this year, on that issue of tolerance? I'm thinking of the governor of Utah, a Republican who vetoed a bill having to do with trans sports and was overridden and, as part of that, issued a message in which he said, I want to show compassion for people even if I don't agree with them. And also, it seemed to me, he was saying, I don't understand why this is even important. Why are we legislating on something that involves so few people, the suggestion being that a small number of people were being demonized. How would you grade your party on that? PENCE: I think our party has made it clear that the doors of the Republican Party are wide open. I mean, I remember being at the Republican National Convention when the president acknowledged the support of the LGBT community. And there was rousing applause at that Cleveland convention, Steve. You remember. You were there. You know? INSKEEP: The administration reversed trans issues in the military, for example, programs that were attempting to encourage tolerance there. PENCE: Well, and I respect and support that decision. I just think we always need to put military readiness and the mission of our military first. INSKEEP: The Trump administration prevented trans people from openly serving, arguing their presence would interfere with military readiness, though the Pentagon found their service consistent with that. The Biden administration now allows them to serve. Former Vice President Mike Pence is considering his future. His memoir, \"So Help Me God,\" is seen as a possible preliminary to a presidential run.

And in the course of the chapter, which is about your faith and people's responses to your faith, you say you have been mocked, that you were the focus of a mania about your faith, that you faced hostility and intolerance and that Christians generally were insulted and demeaned and also that your faith had been misunderstood. What is it that people misunderstood? PENCE: Well, let me say, Steve, I've never heard any of that from you. But when my wife was attacked for teaching at a Christian school, when one media outlet after another ridiculed our Christian faith from time to time, I was always struck by that because, you know, as I traveled around America, the words I most often heard were - people would reach out across a rope line or stop me on a street corner and say, I'm praying for you. I mean, this is a nation of faith, of different faiths. But the American people cherish faith in the overwhelming majority. And yet it seemed to be a subject of fascination by some in the liberal media. But it was always a blessing to me because the net effect of it was, as I would learn traveling around the country, I was always reminded that some of the criticism from those on the left about my deeply held religious beliefs would invariably remind people that I - who shared those values and those beliefs that we shared something in common. INSKEEP: When you said you were misunderstood in the chapter, I believe you were talking about people in the LGBTQ community. Is there something on issues having to do with sexual orientation and gender that people misunderstand about you? PENCE: Well, I write an entire chapter in the book about our experience here in Indiana with the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. You know, I believe President John F.

And that is it's the right to live, to work, to worship according to the dictates of your conscience and to respect one another. INSKEEP: How do you grade your party, particularly this year, on that issue of tolerance? I'm thinking of the governor of Utah, a Republican who vetoed a bill having to do with trans sports and was overridden and, as part of that, issued a message in which he said, I want to show compassion for people even if I don't agree with them. And also, it seemed to me, he was saying, I don't understand why this is even important. Why are we legislating on something that involves so few people, the suggestion being that a small number of people were being demonized. How would you grade your party on that? PENCE: I think our party has made it clear that the doors of the Republican Party are wide open. I mean, I remember being at the Republican National Convention when the president acknowledged the support of the LGBT community. And there was rousing applause at that Cleveland convention, Steve. You remember. You were there. You know? INSKEEP: The administration reversed trans issues in the military, for example, programs that were attempting to encourage tolerance there. PENCE: Well, and I respect and support that decision. I just think we always need to put military readiness and the mission of our military first. INSKEEP: The Trump administration prevented trans people from openly serving, arguing their presence would interfere with military readiness, though the Pentagon found their service consistent with that. The Biden administration now allows them to serve. Former Vice President Mike Pence is considering his future. His memoir, \"So Help Me God,\" is seen as a possible preliminary to a presidential run.

Is there something on issues having to do with sexual orientation and gender that people misunderstand about you? PENCE: Well, I write an entire chapter in the book about our experience here in Indiana with the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. You know, I believe President John F. Kennedy said to lead is to be misunderstood. INSKEEP: In 2015, the Supreme Court affirmed a right to same-sex marriage. Pence was then governor of Indiana and signed what was seen as a response. The state religious freedom law said no person or church or company should have to bear a, quote, \"substantial burden on their religious beliefs.\" Critics asserted that that allowed discrimination for religious reasons, though Pence tried to defend the law on ABC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes or no. Should it be legal to discriminate against gays and lesbians? PENCE: George, you're following the mantra of the last week online, and you're trying to make this issue about something else. What I am for is protecting, with the highest standards in our courts, the religious liberty of Hoosiers. INSKEEP: Facing overwhelming public pressure, the governor signed follow-up bills that assured protection. PENCE: I don't support discrimination against gays or lesbians or anyone else. INSKEEP: Pence still insists the original law did not discriminate. He adds that, in recent years, the Supreme Court has supported religious concerns like the ones he raised. A Colorado baker, for example, who famously declined to make a cake for a gay wedding won his case. And that was even before the Trump administration added three justices to the court. PENCE: I will tell you I have been encouraged that the Supreme Court has been striking a balance on the issues of religious liberty and individual rights. But if there's anything people don't understand well about the Pences is to know Karen and Mike Pence - to know our family. We love everybody. My faith tells me to love your neighbor as yourself. And that's something we aspire to do every day, whether we agree with every view or every value of the people that we meet. INSKEEP: One thing that occurred to me as I read that chapter is that some of the words you use to describe the way you've been treated, I feel that I've heard from people who identify as lesbian or gay or trans, that they faced hostility or a mania, that they'd been mocked, that they faced intolerance, that they were insulted, they were demeaned. You probably followed the news of the nightclub shooting in Colorado just in the last few days. PENCE: Heartbreaking. INSKEEP: What would you say to reassure your fellow citizens who feel that way? PENCE: Well, I do believe that it adheres to the American character to show tolerance - it's just who we are. For many Bible-believing Christians, we perceive what I call the intolerance of tolerance - that in the name of tolerance, people are intolerant of... INSKEEP: Toward people like you. You feel...

You probably followed the news of the nightclub shooting in Colorado just in the last few days. PENCE: Heartbreaking. INSKEEP: What would you say to reassure your fellow citizens who feel that way? PENCE: Well, I do believe that it adheres to the American character to show tolerance - it's just who we are. For many Bible-believing Christians, we perceive what I call the intolerance of tolerance - that in the name of tolerance, people are intolerant of... INSKEEP: Toward people like you. You feel... PENCE: ...Traditional views. And I don't argue for a moment that people on the other end of that debate have felt the same way. It's why one of the reasons is that I think we need to get to a place where we recognize, again, what really the First Amendment is all about. And that is it's the right to live, to work, to worship according to the dictates of your conscience and to respect one another. INSKEEP: How do you grade your party, particularly this year, on that issue of tolerance? I'm thinking of the governor of Utah, a Republican who vetoed a bill having to do with trans sports and was overridden and, as part of that, issued a message in which he said, I want to show compassion for people even if I don't agree with them. And also, it seemed to me, he was saying, I don't understand why this is even important. Why are we legislating on something that involves so few people, the suggestion being that a small number of people were being demonized. How would you grade your party on that? PENCE: I think our party has made it clear that the doors of the Republican Party are wide open. I mean, I remember being at the Republican National Convention when the president acknowledged the support of the LGBT community. And there was rousing applause at that Cleveland convention, Steve. You remember. You were there. You know? INSKEEP: The administration reversed trans issues in the military, for example, programs that were attempting to encourage tolerance there. PENCE: Well, and I respect and support that decision. I just think we always need to put military readiness and the mission of our military first. INSKEEP: The Trump administration prevented trans people from openly serving, arguing their presence would interfere with military readiness, though the Pentagon found their service consistent with that. The Biden administration now allows them to serve. Former Vice President Mike Pence is considering his future. His memoir, \"So Help Me God,\" is seen as a possible preliminary to a presidential run.

PENCE: George, you're following the mantra of the last week online, and you're trying to make this issue about something else. What I am for is protecting, with the highest standards in our courts, the religious liberty of Hoosiers. INSKEEP: Facing overwhelming public pressure, the governor signed follow-up bills that assured protection. PENCE: I don't support discrimination against gays or lesbians or anyone else. INSKEEP: Pence still insists the original law did not discriminate. He adds that, in recent years, the Supreme Court has supported religious concerns like the ones he raised. A Colorado baker, for example, who famously declined to make a cake for a gay wedding won his case. And that was even before the Trump administration added three justices to the court. PENCE: I will tell you I have been encouraged that the Supreme Court has been striking a balance on the issues of religious liberty and individual rights. But if there's anything people don't understand well about the Pences is to know Karen and Mike Pence - to know our family. We love everybody. My faith tells me to love your neighbor as yourself. And that's something we aspire to do every day, whether we agree with every view or every value of the people that we meet.

A Colorado baker, for example, who famously declined to make a cake for a gay wedding won his case. And that was even before the Trump administration added three justices to the court. PENCE: I will tell you I have been encouraged that the Supreme Court has been striking a balance on the issues of religious liberty and individual rights. But if there's anything people don't understand well about the Pences is to know Karen and Mike Pence - to know our family. We love everybody. My faith tells me to love your neighbor as yourself. And that's something we aspire to do every day, whether we agree with every view or every value of the people that we meet. INSKEEP: One thing that occurred to me as I read that chapter is that some of the words you use to describe the way you've been treated, I feel that I've heard from people who identify as lesbian or gay or trans, that they faced hostility or a mania, that they'd been mocked, that they faced intolerance, that they were insulted, they were demeaned. You probably followed the news of the nightclub shooting in Colorado just in the last few days. PENCE: Heartbreaking. INSKEEP: What would you say to reassure your fellow citizens who feel that way? PENCE: Well, I do believe that it adheres to the American character to show tolerance - it's just who we are. For many Bible-believing Christians, we perceive what I call the intolerance of tolerance - that in the name of tolerance, people are intolerant of... INSKEEP: Toward people like you. You feel... PENCE: ...Traditional views. And I don't argue for a moment that people on the other end of that debate have felt the same way. It's why one of the reasons is that I think we need to get to a place where we recognize, again, what really the First Amendment is all about. And that is it's the right to live, to work, to worship according to the dictates of your conscience and to respect one another. INSKEEP: How do you grade your party, particularly this year, on that issue of tolerance? I'm thinking of the governor of Utah, a Republican who vetoed a bill having to do with trans sports and was overridden and, as part of that, issued a message in which he said, I want to show compassion for people even if I don't agree with them. And also, it seemed to me, he was saying, I don't understand why this is even important. Why are we legislating on something that involves so few people, the suggestion being that a small number of people were being demonized. How would you grade your party on that? PENCE: I think our party has made it clear that the doors of the Republican Party are wide open. I mean, I remember being at the Republican National Convention when the president acknowledged the support of the LGBT community. And there was rousing applause at that Cleveland convention, Steve. You remember. You were there. You know? INSKEEP: The administration reversed trans issues in the military, for example, programs that were attempting to encourage tolerance there. PENCE: Well, and I respect and support that decision. I just think we always need to put military readiness and the mission of our military first. INSKEEP: The Trump administration prevented trans people from openly serving, arguing their presence would interfere with military readiness, though the Pentagon found their service consistent with that. The Biden administration now allows them to serve. Former Vice President Mike Pence is considering his future. His memoir, \"So Help Me God,\" is seen as a possible preliminary to a presidential run.

The Biden administration now allows them to serve. Former Vice President Mike Pence is considering his future. His memoir, \"So Help Me God,\" is seen as a possible preliminary to a presidential run.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nINSKEEP: What would you say to reassure your fellow citizens who feel that way? PENCE: Well, I do believe that it adheres to the American character to show tolerance - it's just who we are. For many Bible-believing Christians, we perceive what I call the intolerance of tolerance - that in the name of tolerance, people are intolerant of... INSKEEP: Toward people like you. You feel... PENCE: ...Traditional views. And I don't argue for a moment that people on the other end of that debate have felt the same way. It's why one of the reasons is that I think we need to get to a place where we recognize, again, what really the First Amendment is all about. And that is it's the right to live, to work, to worship according to the dictates of your conscience and to respect one another. INSKEEP: How do you grade your party, particularly this year, on that issue of tolerance? I'm thinking of the governor of Utah, a Republican who vetoed a bill having to do with trans sports and was overridden and, as part of that, issued a message in which he said, I want to show compassion for people even if I don't agree with them. And also, it seemed to me, he was saying, I don't understand why this is even important. Why are we legislating on something that involves so few people, the suggestion being that a small number of people were being demonized. How would you grade your party on that? PENCE: I think our party has made it clear that the doors of the Republican Party are wide open. I mean, I remember being at the Republican National Convention when the president acknowledged the support of the LGBT community. And there was rousing applause at that Cleveland convention, Steve. You remember. You were there. You know? INSKEEP: The administration reversed trans issues in the military, for example, programs that were attempting to encourage tolerance there. PENCE: Well, and I respect and support that decision. I just think we always need to put military readiness and the mission of our military first.

Drew Angerer/Getty Images hide caption\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, seen here in November, said on Friday that former President Donald Trump is \"wrong\" that Pence could have changed the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence called out former President Donald Trump on Friday, saying Trump is \"wrong\" to say that Pence had the authority to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election when Congress gathered to certify Joe Biden's victory on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering of the conservative Federalist Society in Florida, Pence said, \"President Trump is wrong: I had no right to overturn the election. The presidency belongs to the American people and the American people alone. And frankly, there is no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president.\"\n\nTrump has continued to refuse the election's outcome - that he lost to Biden - and this week he inaccurately insisted again that Pence \"could have overturned the election\" when Pence presided over the counting of electoral ballots at the Capitol. A pro-Trump mob overran the building that day, with some rioters shouting, \"Hang Mike Pence.\"\n\nPence called Jan. 6, 2021, \"a dark day\" in Washington. \"Whatever the future holds, I know we did our duty that day,\" Pence said, adding, \"I believe the time has come to focus on the future.\"\n\n\"Under the Constitution, I had no right to change the outcome of our election,\" Pence said, adding that Vice President Harris \"will have no right to overturn the election when we beat them in 2024.\"\n\n\"The truth is there's more at stake than our party or political fortunes,\" Pence added. \"Men and women, if we lose faith in the Constitution, we won't just lose elections. We'll lose our country.\"\n\nPence's speech came on the same day that the Republican National Committee adopted a resolution censuring two House Republicans, Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, for taking part in a bipartisan committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, in which four people were killed.\n\nThe resolution says that the committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot is going after people for engaging in \"legitimate political discourse.\" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel later tried to clarify that language, insisting it was not referring to the violence of the day.\n\nTrump has floated the idea of giving pardons to those convicted of taking part in the violence should he be reelected president in 2024.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nOfficials at USAID warned that favoring Christian groups in Iraq could be unconstitutional and inflame religious tensions. When one colleague lost her job, they said she had been \"Penced.\"\n\nby Yeganeh Torbati\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nLast November, a top Trump appointee at the U.S. Agency for International Development wrote a candid email to colleagues about pressure from the White House to reroute Middle East aid to religious minorities, particularly Christian groups.\n\n\"Sometimes this decision will be made for us by the White House (see... Iraq! And, increasingly, Syria),\" said Hallam Ferguson, a senior official in USAID's Middle East bureau, in an email seen by ProPublica. \"We need to stay ahead of this curve everywhere lest our interventions be dictated to us.\"\n\nThe email underscored what had become a stark reality under the Trump White House. Decisions about U.S. aid are often no longer being governed by career professionals applying a rigorous review of applicants and their capabilities. Over the last two years, political pressure, particularly from the office of Vice President Mike Pence, had seeped into aid deliberations and convinced key decision-makers that unless they fell in line, their jobs could be at stake.\n\nFive months before Ferguson sent the email, his former boss had been ousted following a mandate from Pence's chief of staff. Pence had grown displeased with USAID's work in Iraq after Christian groups were turned down for aid.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nProPublica viewed internal emails and conducted interviews with nearly 40 current and former U.S. officials and aid professionals that shed new light on the success of Pence and his allies in influencing the government's long-standing process for awarding foreign aid. Most people spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe Trump administration's efforts to influence USAID funding sparked concern from career officials, who worried the agency risked violating constitutional prohibitions on favoring one religion over another. They also were concerned that being perceived as favoring Christians could worsen Iraq's sectarian divides.\n\n\"There are very deliberate procurement guidelines that have developed over a number of years to guard precisely against this kind of behavior,\" said Steven Feldstein, a former State Department and USAID official during the Obama administration. When politics intrude on the grant-making process, \"you're diluting the very nature of what development programs ought to accomplish.\"\n\nUSAID regulations state that awards \"must be free from political interference or even the appearance of such interference and must be made on the basis of merit, not on the basis of the religious affiliation of a recipient organization, or lack thereof.\"\n\nLast month, USAID announced two grants to Iraqi organizations that career officials had previously rejected. Political appointees significantly impacted the latest awards, according to interviews with officials and other people aware of the process. Typically, such appointees have little to no involvement in USAID grants, to avoid perceptions of undue political influence on procurement.\n\nOne of the groups selected for the newest awards has no full-time paid staff, no experience with government grants and a financial tie that would typically raise questions in an intense competition for limited funds. The second organization received its first USAID direct grant after extensive public comments by its leader and allies highlighting what they described as a lack of U.S. assistance to Christians. The two groups - a charity that primarily serves Christian Iraqis and a Catholic university - were not originally listed as front-runners, according to a document seen by ProPublica.\n\nWe're expanding our coverage of government agencies and federal policy. With your help, we can dig deeper.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal and BuzzFeed have previously reported Pence's interest in increasing foreign aid to Christians and his displeasure with USAID's activities in Iraq .\n\nPence's spokeswoman, Katie Waldman, did not respond to questions. A USAID spokeswoman did not respond to specific questions, including about Ferguson's email, but said the latest grants were appropriate.\n\n\"The Trump Administration has made responding to the genocide committed by the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) against religious and ethnic minorities a top priority,\" said the spokeswoman, Pooja Jhunjhunwala. \"Assistance to religious and ethnic communities targeted by ISIS is not a departure from the norm, but rather a continuation of USAID's rich history of promoting inclusive development and defending human dignity and religious freedom in our partner countries.\"\n\nApproximately 97% of Iraq's population is Muslim, according to the most recent U.S. figures available . Religious minorities - including Christians, Yazidis and others - make up around 2% to 3% of Iraq's total population.\n\nThe Trump administration's efforts to steer funding to these minorities in Iraq stand in stark contrast to its overall approach to foreign aid. It has repeatedly proposed cutting U.S. diplomatic and foreign assistance budgets by billions of dollars. In August, as the White House was considering cuts to an array of foreign aid programs, it shielded funding for religious minorities abroad, according to news accounts .\n\nAs Trump mounts a 2020 reelection effort, he is taking steps to solidify his conservative Christian base, including his decision last week to install his spiritual adviser , Florida televangelist Paula White, in a White House position. Increasing aid to Christians abroad is a core value for his supporters.\n\nIn a speech last month at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, a major gathering of the religious right, Trump touted his administration's work on behalf of religious minorities in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\"Other presidents would not be doing that,\" he said. \"They'd be spending a lot more money, but they'd be spending it on things that would not make you very happy.\"\n\nLate in the Obama administration, USAID's activities in Iraq focused on an effort by the United Nations to restore basic services as soon as cities had been liberated from Islamic State rule.\n\nBy the end of 2016, the United States had contributed over $115 million to the effort through USAID, and other countries had contributed hundreds of millions of dollars more. U.S. officials credit the U.N.'s work with enabling millions of Iraqis to return to their homes soon after the fighting was done instead of languishing in refugee camps.\n\n\"Here's another example of when the U.N. and the United States work together, really good things can happen,\" said John Allen, the former special presidential envoy to the global coalition formed to defeat ISIS, at an event at the Brookings Institution in September.\n\nRobust U.S. support for the U.N.'s work initially carried over into the Trump administration. In July 2017, the administration announced that USAID would provide an additional $150 million to the U.N. Development Program's Iraq stabilization fund, bringing the total U.S. contribution to more than $265 million since 2015.\n\nBut by then, U.S. officials in Iraq were sensing dissatisfaction among some Iraqi Christians and American religious groups with the U.S. strategy and the U.N.'s work. Trying to head off problems, U.S. officials urged the U.N. in the summer of 2017 to pay special attention to the Nineveh Plains, an ethnically and religiously diverse region of northern Iraq where many of the country's Christians live.\n\nU.N. officials were reluctant, arguing their assistance could go further in dense urban areas like Mosul, as opposed to the Nineveh Plains, a stretch of farmland dotted by small towns and villages.\n\n\"They were going for the biggest bang for the buck,\" one former U.S. foreign service officer said.\n\nDylan Lowthian, a UNDP spokesman, said the agency worked closely with local Christian leaders in 2017 to encourage more people to return to the Nineveh Plains.\n\n\"UNDP is one of the largest supporters of minority communities in Iraq in terms of volume of projects, impact, and funding,\" Lowthian said.\n\nBut the pressure from Washington built. Influential religious groups like the Knights of Columbus and current and former Republican members of Congress advocated throughout 2017 for direct U.S. aid to religious minorities, including Christians and Yazidis. They said that the groups merited special attention because they had been targeted for genocide by Islamic State and that local churches had proven track records of delivering aid quickly and reliably. Furthermore, Christians - who fled the country in droves after the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq - were at risk of disappearing from Iraq altogether if they didn't receive help, they argued.\n\nBashar Warda, a powerful archbishop based in Erbil, Iraq, was a key figure in this effort. \"The Christians of Iraq desperately need American government humanitarian aid now, and we need it to be delivered in a manner to ensure it actually reaches us and does not get absorbed and redirected in the existing aid structures,\" he said in a 2017 interview with Crux , a Catholic- focused publication. \"While the U.S. has donated generously to the overall humanitarian aid effort in Iraq, almost none of this aid reached the Christians.\"\n\nWarda met with Pence in late 2017 and stood beside Trump in the Oval Office in 2018 as he signed a bill authorizing the State Department and USAID to provide relief to victims of Islamic State, particularly religious minorities. Warda had advocated for the bill's passage.\n\nImportant dialogue with Bashar Warda, the Archbishop of Erbil, about @POTUS ' commitment to directly assist persecuted Christians & religious minorities in Iraq. I'm heading to the Middle East this month to discuss U.S. plans to accelerate funding those impacted in the region. pic.twitter.com/eQIdNytPlZ\n\nWarda's and others' argument on the flow of aid resonated with the Trump administration's distrust of multilateral organizations, especially the U.N., and a desire to help Christians worldwide.\n\nMany career officials at the State Department and USAID supported the broader scope of the U.N.'s work. They acknowledged it wasn't perfect - it could be slow, and the U.N. was not adept at communicating with local communities - but said the rebuilding had benefited wide swaths of territory that included both Muslims and minority groups.\n\nPrivately, some officials felt that Warda's and his allies' lobbying efforts in Washington were downplaying how the U.N. projects benefited their communities. And serving Iraq's Sunni Muslims, they said, was essential to ensuring that Islamic State, which drew its ranks from Sunnis, did not make a resurgence.\n\n\"We were focused on the overriding policy priority of making sure that areas where young men with guns and other weapons were wandering around got the vast majority of the funding,\" one current U.S. official said in an interview.\n\nAs of July, USAID and the State Department had announced nearly $373 million in funding for \"persecuted ethnic and religious minorities in Iraq\" since 2017. Jhunjhunwala, the USAID spokeswoman, said the U.S. government had provided over $1.5 billion in assistance to Iraq in 2017 and 2018, \"the vast majority in areas inhabited by Sunni and Shia Muslims.\" The Obama administration did not publicize its spending on Iraqi religious groups in the same way, making an exact comparison difficult.\n\nStephen Rasche, who works closely with Warda and serves as his spokesman, told ProPublica that U.N. reports detailing its rebuilding work in 2016 and 2017 \"were highly misleading and could not be substantiated as they applied to assistance in the Christian towns.\"\n\n\"In all our interactions with State/AID they were relying almost exclusively on the U.N. reports rather than making their own, first-hand inspections,\" he said in an emailed statement. \"Our position was that we were there on the ground and could not find evidence of the work that the U.N. said was being done.\"\n\nLowthian said that all UNDP projects are tracked by a \"rigorous and robust\" monitoring effort, and that project details are shared regularly with partner countries.\n\nCareer officials also expressed concerns at the time that targeting federal funds toward particular minority groups on the basis of religion could be unconstitutional. USAID rules bar providing funding for explicitly religious activities such as worship or proselytizing. But faith-based groups can still receive U.S. funding, as long as they are inclusive and do not use the funds for religious programming.\n\nUSAID regulations mirror the U.S. Constitution's establishment clause, which broadly prohibits government actions that favor one religion over another. Over time, Trump appointees have grown exasperated at pushback that mentioned the clause, one official said.\n\n\"They find it very constraining,\" this person said. \"They get frustrated that we can't just do direct support.\" Still, several officials said, career attorneys at USAID painstakingly review its programming in Iraq to ensure it is legal.\n\nAnd USAID and State Department officials questioned whether Christian groups were significantly needier than the broader Iraqi population victimized by Islamic State, including Shiite and Sunni Muslims.\n\n\"There was a pushback, a feeling like we shouldn't be doing this, first of all because of our own policies and regulations, and secondly because they're not worse off than the others,\" a former USAID official said.\n\nInitially, Pence's office and political appointees at USAID were focused on helping Christians, with little attention to Yazidis, a small, ancient sect that was targeted in an especially cruel manner by Islamic State militants, said a current official and a former foreign service officer. Over time, career officials \"helped educate\" political appointees on the extent of the Yazidis' suffering, in hopes of getting their support for directing some aid at non-Christian groups, the former foreign service officer said.\n\n\"There was a very ideological focus on Christians, and most of the questions were about Christians,\" this person said. \"We were trying to get them to focus on others in the minority communities that might need assistance.\"\n\nSome also felt that if the U.S. were perceived as openly favoring particular groups, it could lead to further tensions in a country with deep and complicated sectarian divisions. Even some Christian Iraqis, several current or former U.S. officials said, did not want to be singled out by USAID for help, because they feared that preferential treatment would only add to instability.\n\nBut Trump appointees at USAID in favor of sending more aid to Christians - including Middle East bureau official Hallam Ferguson and Bill Steiger, the agency's chief of staff - discounted career officers' concerns, arguing that they had heard differently from the Christian groups focused on Iraq with whom they were in touch, one former USAID official said. Trump appointees \"seemed convinced that an imbalance did exist\" in how Christians were being treated, a U.S. official said.\n\nSteiger, who served at the Department of Health and Human Services during the George W. Bush administration, has been a key conduit through which Pence's office has exerted pressure on USAID, several officials said.\n\nTrump appointees in Washington pressed officials to frequently visit the areas where Christians lived, seemingly unaware of the weeks of preparation and security logistics needed to make even one such visit happen, one current U.S. official and the former foreign service officer said.\n\nBy September 2017, Steiger was holding meetings with USAID officials to discuss how to help religious minorities in Iraq. And by early October, USAID's leadership had decided to try to satisfy Pence's preferences through new grants focusing on northern Iraq.\n\nWhile the grant process was being worked out at USAID, Pence blindsided officials in October 2017 when he declared to an influential Christian group in Washington that Trump had ordered diplomats to no longer fund \"ineffective\" U.N. programs. USAID would now directly help persecuted communities, he said.\n\n\"It sent us scrambling the next day,\" one U.S. official working on Iraq at the time said. \"That seemed to me, in retrospect, a turning point in saying, 'We've got a real interest in doing more to help minorities, especially Christians,' to, 'OK, now we're really going to shift some funds.'\"\n\nThe $150 million that USAID had pledged to the U.N. effort in Iraq in July 2017 had been divided into two tranches of $75 million each. After Pence's comments, USAID renegotiated its agreement with the U.N. so that the majority of the first payment, $55 million, would still go to the U.N. but would be earmarked for religious and ethnic minorities in Nineveh Province.\n\nFor new grants, which were separate from the U.N. funding, USAID hosted 33 organizations at a two-day March 2018 Baghdad workshop. They included large, established faith-based groups like Samaritan's Purse and Catholic Relief Services, as well as smaller, little-known Iraqi organizations, according to a list of attendees obtained by ProPublica through a public records request.\n\nThe attendees included two Pence aides: Sarah Makin-Acciani and Steve Pinkos. Before joining Pence's team, Makin-Acciani worked for Republican lawmakers, as a lobbyist for the U.S. Consumer Coalition and for the Trump campaign. Pinkos had worked for a lobbying firm, as an aide to Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy and in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Neither of them appear to have expertise in development or foreign aid issues. Neither Makin-Acciani nor Pinkos responded to messages requesting comment.\n\nTheir presence at the Baghdad meeting, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, unsettled participants, according to four people who attended the event or were briefed on it. White House officials rarely, if ever, are so deeply involved in agency grant-making.\n\nPeople \"assumed they were there for a political reason or to put pressure on the process,\" said one participant.\n\nAfter introductory remarks by then-U.S. ambassador to Iraq Doug Silliman, attendees split into smaller groups to discuss possible collaborations. Makin-Acciani and Pinkos mostly observed and asked questions, several people who attended the meeting said. But at one point, the pair objected to a programming idea, saying it would take too long and not be valuable, two people who witnessed the interaction said.\n\n\"They were looking for quick fixes,\" said one of the people.\n\nBack in Washington, Mark Green, the head of USAID, expressed discomfort to a colleague about potential interference by Pence into the grant process, one former U.S. official said.\n\nUltimately, later that spring, career officials made the final grant decisions and gave millions of dollars in funding to large, established organizations: Catholic Relief Services, Heartland Alliance and others. Awards were structured as umbrella grants that included sub-awards to small Iraqi organizations. USAID rejected some bids by smaller, untested groups with no prior experience with the agency.\n\n\"We still try to stick to our principles, that you gotta have a good proposal and you gotta have your qualifications there and so on, and they didn't meet the standards,\" a former USAID official said.\n\nOne rejected application was a bid by the Catholic University in Erbil and the Nineveh Reconstruction Committee, a coalition of three major Christian denominations in Iraq. Warda, head of the Chaldean Catholic archdiocese in Erbil, also heads the board of trustees at the university. (Chaldean Catholics, an Eastern Rite of the Roman Catholic Church, make up about two-thirds of Iraq's Christians.)\n\nRasche, who is a vice chancellor at the Catholic University in Erbil, was formerly president of Nineveh Reconstruction Committee-USA, a now-defunct nonprofit formed to further NRC's aims by winning U.S. government grants. Rasche said he and Warda were in Washington when their proposal was rejected and promptly told their \"friends and partners\" of their denial.\n\nBefore USAID had itself announced the awards, Fox News published a detailed account criticizing USAID's activities in Iraq. \"We are worse off now than we were two years ago,\" Warda said to Fox.\n\nTwo days later, former Reagan administration national security adviser Robert McFarlane and New Jersey Republican Rep. Chris Smith co-authored an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal criticizing USAID's decision to reject the two Christian organizations. They said it showed career USAID officials were ignoring Pence's preferences. The title of the op-ed: \"Iraqi Christians Are Still Waiting, Mr. Pence.\"\n\nSmith's spokesman and McFarlane did not respond to interview requests.\n\nOn June 8, 2018, a day after the op-ed was published, Pence's spokeswoman issued a terse statement , saying he \"will not tolerate bureaucratic delays in implementing the Administration's vision.\" Pence also directed Green to travel to Iraq and report back on how to resolve delays.\n\nThat same day, Pence's then-chief of staff, Nick Ayers, called Steiger to demand somebody at the agency be punished for the failure to provide aid to Christian groups quickly enough, according to several people familiar with the conversation. Ayers did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nGreen's reaction was to remove Maria Longi, a career civil servant and a top official in USAID's Middle East bureau. Though still on USAID's payroll, she now teaches national security strategy at the National War College.\n\nLongi's dismissal and Pence's displeasure with USAID had been reported by BuzzFeed and The Wall Street Journal , though the extent of Pence's role in her reassignment had not been. Longi declined to answer questions.\n\nThe move reverberated among career officials, who traded text messages and emails expressing shock. USAID insiders coined a term for what had happened to her: Longi had been \"Penced.\"\n\nConcern spread even among Trump appointees that their jobs might be threatened. \"What it did instill in the Middle East bureau was fear among the political appointees that they could be thrown out at any time,\" a former USAID official said.\n\nLast month, USAID announced $4 million in new grants to six Iraqi organizations as part of an effort in Iraq and other countries to work with small, local groups that have done little prior work with the agency. Two of the winning groups were the Shlama Foundation, a small charity, and the Catholic University in Erbil.\n\nTwo USAID political appointees were involved in awarding those grants: Ferguson, the second-highest-ranking official in USAID's Middle East bureau, and Samah Norquist, the agency's adviser on religious pluralism in the Middle East and wife of conservative tax activist Grover Norquist.\n\nFerguson and Samah Norquist were included in the selection process for the newest grants, and one official said Ferguson oversaw the final determinations.\n\nA former USAID official said Norquist was \"really involved in the details\" of the grants but seemed to have little awareness of standard USAID practice when meeting with grantees.\n\n\"She was swimming in the dark, and it was really quite clear that she didn't know the first thing about grant-making,\" such as what information was proper to share and how to ensure an open award process rather than one targeting specific groups, the former official said.\n\nNorquist expressed support for Trump's 2020 reelection at a State Department forum in July, a statement that experts said likely violated a law forbidding government officials from engaging in political activities on the job. The incident sparked complaints to an independent agency, which determined in October that Norquist's comments did not violate the law.\n\nA third political appointee at USAID, Max Primorac, the agency's envoy in Erbil for minority assistance programs, tweeted praise for the Shlama Foundation months before USAID announced the final grant winners. The group replied with thanks , tagging Pence's Twitter account. Shortly after the award announcement, Primorac met with a Shlama Foundation board member during a visit to Michigan.\n\nThank you Max, and your work since joining USAID has not gone unnoticed! We are really amazed at all the accompshments @USAID_ICRI has achieved in such short time 💙 @VP\n\nPrimorac is known among U.S. officials for his close working relationship with Pence's office. Prior to joining USAID, Primorac served with Rasche at NRC-USA, as secretary and treasurer of the nonprofit. The two submitted an unsolicited $22.5 million bid to rehabilitate Christian towns to USAID in 2017, which was not awarded.\n\nAsked if any Shlama Foundation officials were in touch with Primorac, Norquist or Ferguson prior to its award being announced, board member Ranna Abro declined to answer specifically.\n\n\"USAID was familiar with our organization as it is well-known by the local community in the Nineveh Plains,\" she said. \"We have met USAID several times along with all other organizations serving the same area.\"\n\nRasche said Norquist ran a workshop in Erbil for organizations interested in applying for the new grants, which staff members of the Catholic University in Erbil attended. Rasche also spoke with Ferguson two to three times about the grant dates and funding cycles, he said.\n\nFive current or former U.S. officials said involvement in grant decisions by political appointees - particularly by someone as senior as Ferguson - is highly unusual. USAID grants are typically decided by a review committee and a contracting officer, all of whom are career officials.\n\n\"USAID procurement rules with technical review panels are strict, as they should be, to avoid any political interference on the use of U.S. taxpayer dollars,\" said Paige Alexander, a former senior USAID official who served during the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations.\n\nJhunjhunwala, the USAID spokeswoman, said the award process is rigorous \"and follows all federal regulations.\" Ferguson, Norquist and Primorac were not on the committees that made the recommendations, she said.\n\nThe new grants have \"empowered local organizations to solve problems not adequately addressed by other USAID investments and that directly respond to the grassroots needs of conflict-affected communities,\" she said.\n\nLike the Catholic University in Erbil, the Shlama Foundation had previously applied and been rejected for the 2018 grants. Shlama had complained about the rejection via Twitter , and Abro confirmed the tweet referred to the same grant for which the Catholic University in Erbil was also rejected.\n\nFor the newest awards, a document seen by ProPublica shows that neither the Shlama Foundation nor the university were originally included in a list of leading applicants that circulated within USAID.\n\nThe Shlama Foundation will receive $1 million over two years for a project focusing on solar energy, a pittance in the overall U.S. foreign assistance budget. But the money is three times what the nonprofit has taken in from charitable donations since 2014, according to its website . It has never before received government grants, Abro said.\n\n\"The Shlama Foundation, USAID and our vendor partners are certainly experienced and capable of implementing this solar program for a greener future,\" Abro said.\n\nAside from its small size and lack of federal grant experience, Shlama was an unconventional choice for another reason. Last year it received $10,000 in donations from the Clarion Project, a nonprofit organization which researchers at Georgetown University's Bridge Initiative said \"advances anti-Muslim content through its web-based and video production platforms.\"\n\nA Shlama Foundation board member also appeared in Clarion's 2017 documentary \"Faithkeepers,\" about the persecution of Christians in the Middle East. The film focuses on atrocities committed by Islamic State, but also depicts Islam overall as a religion that seeks to subjugate minorities. Zach Sicherman, an associate producer for the film, declined to respond to questions.\n\nClarion also did not respond to questions. It describes itself as a \"non-profit organization that educates the public about the dangers of radical Islam and other extremist ideologies.\"\n\nAbro said that Shlama did not solicit the Clarion donation, and that it appeared in the documentary because \"we value transparency and are open to participate in interviews from all sides.\" The film's website includes a donation page that benefits Shlama.\n\nWe found multiple Trump ethics pledge violations hidden in a little-noticed government report. They show inappropriate actions by government employees, lobbyists and former business clients.\n\nForeign aid experts said USAID typically examines an organization's major donors to protect the agency from perceptions that it is benefiting biased groups, but they disagreed over whether the link to Clarion should have disqualified Shlama for U.S. funding.\n\nThe Catholic University in Erbil's new grant from USAID is its first direct agency award. The award, $700,000 over one year, will support courses for \"widows, victims of abuse, and former captives of ISIS,\" according to a USAID press release.\n\nThe newest grant \"has come very late in the day, and our award is comparatively quite small,\" Rasche said. He attributed the award not to Warda's public statements but rather to the passage of the 2018 bill.\n\nUSAID's inspector general is investigating some of the agency's activities in Iraq, the watchdog said, though it is unclear what sparked the probe.\n\nUSAID is now expanding its emphasis on religious minorities far beyond Iraq. In December, a month after his email about White House pressure, Ferguson told USAID mission directors in the Middle East that agency leadership had identified up to $50 million it planned to use in 2019 for \"urgent religious freedom and religious persecution challenges,\" according to a second email seen by ProPublica. He asked mission directors to submit programming ideas.\n\nIn a follow-up email in June, also seen by ProPublica, Ferguson wrote that in addition to Iraq, religious and ethnic minority programming was planned for Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia.\n\nDo you have access to information about U.S. foreign assistance that should be public?

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nWeeks before joining the administration, Max Primorac, a USAID appointee and adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, pushed the business interests of a client to an organization funded by USAID.\n\nby Yeganeh Torbati\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nIn early 2018, an incoming Trump political appointee and ally of Vice President Mike Pence made an unusual suggestion to a United Nations agency whose funding hinged on support from a skeptical Trump administration: He pitched them to do business with one of his private-sector clients.\n\n\"Might merit your team's consideration,\" Max Primorac wrote in January, weeks before he formally started at the U.S. Agency for International Development, where he would eventually become an adviser to Pence.\n\nThe client pitch by an incoming official sparked a complaint a month later from an anonymous State Department official, according to documents obtained by ProPublica. The U.N. agency, the United Nations Development Program in Iraq, had by then received over $190 million in funding from USAID, the complaint said.\n\nVirginia Canter, chief ethics counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said Primorac's email demonstrated \"poor judgment,\" given the significant financial contribution that USAID makes to the UNDP.\n\n\"He wasn't yet subject to the government standards of conduct, but he was right on the threshold of that,\" Canter said. \"He gave the appearance that he was using the office he was about to take for the private interests of his client.\"\n\nPrimorac's pitch did not result in UNDP business for his former client. But it is the latest instance to come to light of Primorac's behavior raising eyebrows among some of his colleagues in the U.S. government. Last year, Primorac expressed confidence during a State Department forum that President Donald Trump would win reelection, a comment that drew a complaint to an independent agency, which determined that Primorac did not violate a law forbidding government officials from engaging in political activities on the job.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nAnd ProPublica reported last year that in the midst of a drive by the White House, particularly by Pence's office, to steer more USAID funding to Christians in Iraq, Primorac publicly praised a charity primarily serving Iraqi Christians that had applied for funding, months before the final grants were announced.\n\nAn acting USAID spokesperson, Pooja Jhunjhunwala, did not respond to specific questions about Primorac's email but said the agency \"has an extensive system of ethics training, mandatory reporting, legal review, recusal and counseling procedures.\" Primorac did not respond to questions.\n\n(In August, nearly three months after this story was published, Jhunjhunwala forwarded ProPublica a report from the inspector general's office signed March 30, 2018, stating the watchdog would not open an investigation into the complaint due \"to the non-systemic nature of the alleged conflict of interest and lack of investigative resources.\")\n\nIn the Jan. 10 email, Primorac touted Qi Card, an Iraqi debit card, and suggested that the UNDP use it for transactions. Primorac identified his client as Markez, a U.S. firm hired at the time by Qi Card's parent company to help build the card's customer base, according to Mark Crego, a former Markez adviser.\n\nThe ethics complaint by the State Department official noted that the UNDP was a major USAID funding recipient as it tried to rebuild parts of Iraq destroyed by a protracted war with the Islamic State militant group. Pence had made clear that U.S. support to the UNDP was in jeopardy when he said in October 2017 that the Trump administration would stop funding \"ineffective\" U.N. programs in Iraq and criticized the organization for not doing enough to help Iraqi Christians.\n\nProPublica reported last year that career USAID and State Department officials came under sustained White House pressure, particularly from Pence's office, to give more money to Christians in Iraq, which along with other religious minorities make up about 2% to 3% of the country's population. In addition to the public criticism of the U.N. by Pence in October 2017, Trump appointees pushed in internal meetings for USAID to pay more attention to Christians.\n\nThere is no evidence that Primorac's email resulted in new business for Markez, which originally launched as a construction company before taking on the biometric card project. \"UNDP Iraq has not had any business with Qi Card,\" Dylan Lowthian, a UNDP spokesman, said.\n\nPrimorac's email to the UNDP surfaced as part of a broader records request from ProPublica, seeking complaints made to the USAID watchdog about the agency's work in Iraq between 2017 and 2019. The agency responded by releasing 133 pages of documents, the majority of which consisted of USAID-funded organizations self-reporting potential misconduct by employees. Two complaints focused on Primorac, the only USAID official whose conduct was questioned in the emails released to ProPublica.\n\nThe second complaint about Primorac in the documents accused him of favoring one Iraqi Christian sect over another as he disbursed U.S. funding to groups in the country's north. Insiders who are familiar with the dynamics of the Iraqi Christian community said they were skeptical of that complaint's merit.\n\nPrimorac has moved back and forth between the government and private sector in the past two decades.\n\nAfter the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, he served in the Coalition Provisional Authority, the U.S. occupation government that controlled Iraq until 2004, and he held State Department positions focused on Iraq during the rest of the Bush administration.\n\nHe then launched the Washington, D.C.-based consulting company Between Two Rivers LLC, and his clients included the governments of Japan, Canada and Iraq, according to archived versions of the firm's website.\n\nPrimorac consulted for Markez as the company enlisted well-connected advisers in Washington to build business for the Qi Card, used by millions of Iraqi pensioners and state workers. International Smart Card, an Iraqi company partly owned by two state banks, had hired Markez to find new U.S. customers, Crego said.\n\nIn his January 2018 email to UNDP officials, Primorac suggested the agency could use the Qi Card for transactions.\n\n\"Full disclosure: the (redacted) for Qi Card, US-based Markez, is my client, though I am shutting down my practice end of this month,\" Primorac wrote.\n\nOfficials at USAID warned that favoring Christian groups in Iraq could be unconstitutional and inflame religious tensions. When one colleague lost her job, they said she had been \"Penced.\"\n\nMarkez, founded more than a decade ago in Maryland by Iraqi American businessman Samer Skooti, initially focused on construction. The firm expanded into project management, and International Smart Card hired Markez to provide \"subject matter expertise\" and help it comply with international standards, Skooti said in an interview.\n\nInternational Smart Card paid for lobbying that Markez conducted in 2016 and 2017 on \"promotion of biometric payments,\" according to lobbying records.\n\nThe business relationship between Markez and Primorac lasted no more than three months, Skooti said. \"It was a project-based engagement.\"\n\nPrimorac joined USAID in February 2018 in its Middle East bureau. Tensions at USAID peaked in June 2018, when Pence was displeased by new grants in Iraq, which had gone to large, established aid groups and not local Christian organizations. USAID officials scrambled to create new programs and convince Pence and his staff that the agency was paying enough attention to Christians and Yazidis, another religious minority in Iraq.\n\nAmid the upheaval, Primorac was elevated in late 2018 to a new role based in northern Iraq: USAID's special representative for minority assistance programs. He has described himself as the vice president's \"special envoy,\" briefed Pence's office on his work and is known among U.S. officials for his close working relationship with Pence's staff. Since returning from Iraq several months ago, he has taken on an expanded role, as chief adviser for international religious freedom to USAID's administrator, according to his LinkedIn profile .\n\nPence's spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDo you have access to information about USAID that should be public?

Mike Pence served five terms in Congress and worked his way up to a leadership role in the House. Since he has sealed his Congressional records until December 2022, we've done what we can to dig up the best reporting on Donald Trump's would-be vice president.\n\nPence describes himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.\" He may be best known outside his state for his defense of Indiana's religious freedom restoration law, which allowed businesses to deny service to gays and lesbians.\n\nHe started his political career as a Democrat who kept clippings of John F. Kennedy in his Indiana home as a boy. But in law school, his views shifted to the right. By 1988, at the age of 29, he ran as a Republican to try to unseat the Democratic incumbent in Indiana's 2nd district and lost . He lost to the same candidate in 1990 after an ugly race that featured an ad with an actor dressed to look Arab thanking his opponent for foreign oil support. Pence's campaign paid for his car payment and golf fees . (A year later, he wrote an essay called \" Confessions of a Negative Campaigner \" and repudiated his own style.)\n\nPence found his niche in talk radio in 1992 with \" The Mike Pence Show ,\" which was syndicated across the state two years later. From 1995 to 1999, he hosted an Indianapolis political talk show on television. In 2000, he re-entered the political arena and finally won his seat to Congress (later redrawn as Indiana's 6th district). An envelope with traces of anthrax welcomed Pence to the Capitol during the 2001 scare.\n\nThe Hoosier quickly became known in Congress as a small-government, small-budget purist, fighting against many of then-president George W. Bush's initiatives. He derided the No Child Left Behind education reform as \" more red tape .\" He opposed Bush's push to extend Medicare Part D and subsidize senior citizens' prescription drugs. As the Great Recession began, he vehemently opposed the 2008 bailouts .\n\nPence waded into the immigration battle in 2006 with a proposed compromise that would focus first on border security and, once that was accomplished, incentivize undocumented immigrants to \" self-deport \" and reapply to be guest workers. The proposal quickly brought the scorn of the right . Pence's proposal failed, and he ultimately opposed the 2007 deal that never passed.\n\nUnlike his counterpart at the top of the ticket , Pence has repeatedly backed protections for the press, introducing and reintroducing a federal shield law that would protect reporters' confidential sources, with exceptions including national security. \"Without the free flow of information from sources to reporters, the public is ill-equipped to make informed decisions,\" he said in 2011.\n\nA rundown of the best reporting on Donald Trump over the years. Read more.\n\nClinton has been in the public eye for four decades - and there have been investigative stories about her for nearly as long. Read more.\n\nPence, who served as chair of the Republican Study Committee, tried to challenge John Boehner for minority leader in 2006 and lost, getting only 27 votes to Boehner's 168. By 2008, Pence made his way to leadership, running unopposed to be Republican Conference Chairman .\n\nHe flirted with a bid for the 2012 GOP nomination and ultimately decided to run to be Indiana governor instead. He won the governor's mansion in 2012. The governor took his tax-cutting chops from Congress to the state budget, signing the largest tax cut in Indiana history into law and axing the estate tax.\n\nPence is known for his strict views against abortion - which could help temper the worries of the GOP's conservative base about the one-time \" very pro-choice \" Trump. While in Congress, he called Bush's initiative that allowed limited stem cell research \" morally wrong .\" As governor, Pence signed one of the strictest anti-abortion measures in the nation in March 2016, which banned abortions based on fetal anomalies like Down syndrome. Even some Republican lawmakers in the state opposed the law . (Hoosier women responded by calling Pence's office and giving detailed descriptions of their periods .) He also pushed a bill to cut off Title X grants to Planned Parenthood .\n\nIndiana's 2015 Religious Freedom Restoration Act expanded the definition of religious liberty to the point that critics said could allow discrimination against gays and lesbians. While Pence said at the time that the RFRA was \" not about discrimination ,\" businesses came forward within a week announcing that they'd deny service to LGBT people.\n\nThe backlash was swift and harsh. The governors of Connecticut, New York and Washington - and mayors across the country - banned non-essential travel to the state for public employees. The NCAA hinted that it might pull out of future events just a week before the Final Four was set to begin in Indianapolis. The San Francisco-based computer firm Salesforce \" canceled all programs \" that required travel to Indiana, Angie's List pulled out of a $40 million, 1,000 jobs expansion, and the top executives from Yelp and Apple wrote letters decrying the law and warning other states against following Indiana's lead. The governor's approval plummeted . Just weeks after signing the law, Pence signed an amended version of the law that was intended to provide protection for gays and lesbians.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruled in favor of President Obama's Affordable Care Act, Pence made comments at a House GOP meeting that compared the ruling to 9/11 (he apologized quickly).\n\nFor all his opposition to refugees settling in his own state, Pence hasn't always been 100 percent on board the Trump Train. In December 2015, Pence tweeted, \"Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional .\" The governor first endorsed Ted Cruz in the GOP primary but threw his support to Trump after the Texas senator dropped out.\n\nPence was in the middle of a tough reelection fight when the call came from Trump. He dropped his gubernatorial bid to run on the national ticket.\n\nSarah Smith\n\nSarah Smith was a reporter covering housing, mental health, poverty and religion for ProPublica's South unit.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

But the White House's chaotic requests have not included consistent information on how exactly businesses can do that.\n\nby Yeganeh Torbati\n\nThe U.S. Response to COVID-19\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nAs hospitals across the country face drastic shortages of masks, respirators and other vital equipment, the White House has sent out a plea for donations that's left many recipients confused and full of questions.\n\nIn at least one instance this week, Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the Trump administration's coronavirus task force, blindsided private industry by requesting that construction companies donate face masks to hospitals. The White House then failed to provide guidance when directly asked.\n\nPence asked builders on Tuesday to donate the N95 masks used at many construction sites to local hospitals and refrain from ordering more. Within minutes, Stephen Sandherr, chief executive officer of the trade group Associated General Contractors of America, contacted the White House for more details, said Brian Turmail, a group spokesman.\n\nAfter receiving no reply from the White House, Sandherr sent an email to AGC's local chapters on Tuesday telling them that Pence's statement had taken the group by surprise.\n\nAre you a public health worker or front-line medical provider? Do you work for or with a government agency involved in the effort to protect the public? Have you or your family personally been affected? Show us what we should be covering or serve as an expert to make sure we're on track.\n\nNote: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick.\n\n\"As we received no advance notice of this announcement and we have received no additional guidance from the Administration, it is our view that this should be considered as a voluntary gesture and not a mandate,\" Sandherr wrote. Turmail said several AGC members have donated equipment to their local hospitals.\n\nOn Thursday, Sandherr finally heard back from the Department of Health and Human Services, speaking on behalf of the White House, and his group's members were asked not to donate equipment to hospitals, as Pence had instructed. Instead, he was told the group should collect an inventory of available equipment from members, including masks, booties and protective suits, and share it with the administration.\n\n\"It isn't clear to us, yet, how they intend to use this information, but obviously we are happy to collect the info and share it,\" Turmail said.\n\nRecently, the National Association of Manufacturers, a prominent business group, sent its members a White House request asking for \"volunteers who can donate and provide and/or produce within two weeks large-scale quantities of critical supplies to help the nation respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\nThe notice - which consisted of a short questionnaire prepared through Survey Monkey - did not explain how the White House would distribute donated equipment to states demanding urgent help, including distributions from the national stockpile of emergency supplies and medications.\n\nThe problem with that strategy, said Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, is that it is far too small and piecemeal to meet a demand for protective equipment that is likely to persist for months.\n\n\"Good ideas can come from everywhere, but this seems like the wrong scale of effort by orders of magnitude,\" Inglesby said. He noted that producing enough masks, gloves and other supplies will require complicated analyses of shortages and manufacturing capabilities as well as negotiating new contracts and large financial commitments to incentivize businesses to retool production lines.\n\n\"That to me suggests we should have a large professional logistics organization running things in a centralized manner that can help states around the country,\" Inglesby said.\n\nJeremy Konyndyk, a former official at the U.S. Agency for International Development who worked on the Ebola virus response, said the government's efforts to reach out to trade associations are \"not a bad idea\" and would reach many potential private sector partners. But he said given how the virus is spreading, voluntary donations \"will be a month out of sync with transmission.\"\n\nThe donation request was circulated widely and made its way to some small businesses struggling to stay afloat as the health crisis escalates.\n\n\"I was troubled,\" said Tsan Abrahamson, a California attorney who is a member of the Women's Business Enterprise National Council, which certifies women-owned businesses. WBENC sent out a plea to members on Wednesday saying the White House had asked for donations of supplies. The WBENC email directed members to fill out the NAM questionnaire.\n\nAbrahamson said women-owned companies are \"traditionally marginalized businesses who are being asked to donate not to those in specific need, like hospitals, nursing homes, grocery stock warehouses.\" Instead, the survey asks respondents for their contact information so they can be reached directly by the White House for follow-up.\n\nThe request was part of a \"whole of America\" approach pushed by Pence to combat the coronavirus, emphasizing robust, voluntary partnerships with the private sector.\n\nThe White House and WBENC did not respond to questions, and a NAM spokesman declined to respond to questions.\n\nHealth care workers are growing desperate for gear to protect them from airborne particles and liquids that can spread the coronavirus. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has downgraded its guidance for how health workers should protect themselves, saying they \"might use homemade masks\" like a bandanna or scarf if no masks are available.\n\nElizabeth Zimmerman, a former associate administrator at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said FEMA has coordinated with the private sector to identify supply shortfalls in past emergencies, but she was not sure if that coordination included online surveys of the type sent out by NAM.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act , which gives the president broad authority to require companies to prioritize government contracts and incentivize companies to expand production of critical goods. The executive order granted Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar additional powers to allocate medical supplies.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has come under fire as several states' requests for supplies from the emergency medical stockpile go unfulfilled. A chaotic distribution plan is buckling under a big problem: Nobody has enough.\n\nBut the president has contradicted himself several times on whether he has actually triggered the DPA. In a Thursday press conference, he said \"we hope we're not going to need that\" and put the onus on individual states.\n\n\"The federal government is not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping. You know, we're not a shipping clerk,\" Trump said.\n\nJust hours later, governors on a teleconference with Trump, Pence, Azar and other senior officials complained that their efforts to get crucial supplies on the private market were floundering.\n\nPence said during that teleconference that although Trump had \"activated\" the DPA, \"he has not initiated any other action underneath it\" and suggested that voluntary decisions by American businesses would be sufficient to meet the critical needs.\n\n\"I think the president's perception and the team's perception is now\" that \"American industry is stepping forward very aggressively,\" Pence said.\n\nThen on Friday, in response to a question about whether Trump was using the DPA to \"tell businesses they need to make ventilators, masks, respirators,\" Trump nodded and said, \"We are using it.\"\n\n\"We are using the act, the act is very good for things like this,\" Trump said. \"We're invoking it to use the powers of the federal government to help the states get things that they need, like the masks, like the ventilators.\"\n\nMinutes later, Trump appeared to backtrack, saying that \"when we need something, we will use the act.\"\n\nAre you a public health worker or front-line medical provider?

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nA new report warns that USAID may not be able to effectively oversee $1.16 billion in foreign aid to Iraq - including to Christian groups Vice President Mike Pence's office favored - after the administration cut much of its on-the-ground staff.\n\nby Yeganeh Torbati\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nIraq is one of the top recipients of American assistance, and the U.S. foreign aid agency manages more than $1 billion in projects there, including funding for Iraqi religious minorities pushed by Vice President Mike Pence. But increasingly, the agency doesn't have people on the ground to make sure the money is being well-spent.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development has been forced to cut nearly 80% of its non-Iraqi staff in Iraq in the last year, even as the agency funds large, ambitious and complex aid projects there. A critical government watchdog report released this week said USAID officials reported the cuts \"have had significant adverse effects\" on the oversight and management of grants.\n\nAs ProPublica detailed this month, Pence's office has pressured USAID to support local groups representing Iraqi minorities, particularly Christians. The watchdog report released this week said, in the context of the staff reductions and uncertainty, overseeing local groups \"is particularly challenging given that awards to local organizations require increased involvement.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nOne small charity that recently received a USAID grant and primarily serves Christian Iraqis has no full-time paid staff and no experience with government grants.\n\nOverall, the report notes that USAID now has no staff based permanently in Iraq to oversee $430 million in basic humanitarian aid, such as food, safe drinking water and medical services. USAID officials manage the funding remotely via phone calls, reports from implementers and temporary visits, the report said.\n\nAs a result, \"staff are only able to engage in the bare minimum coordination\" with the rest of the U.S. government, the Iraqi government and the international community, USAID staff told the inspector general.\n\nIn May, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ordered a partial evacuation of U.S. personnel in Iraq in response to concerns over threats from Iran. The ordered departure has been controversial, and diplomats have criticized what they view as a gutting of core diplomatic functions in Iraq.\n\nThat decision, combined with an earlier State Department move to shrink the USAID mission, reduced the agency's non-Iraqi staff from 26 at the start of the 2019 fiscal year to six by this fall, the report said. Some of those officials relocated to Washington, while others transferred to Germany.\n\nUSAID, the State Department and Pence's office did not respond to questions. In response to the prior ProPublica story, a USAID spokeswoman said local grants in Iraq follow all federal regulations and have empowered those groups to respond to \"grassroots needs.\"\n\nThe report, which covers the period between July 1 and Oct. 25, was jointly prepared by the inspectors general of USAID, the State Department and the Pentagon.\n\nThe watchdog report said the Pompeo-ordered departure had been extended through Nov. 9, citing reports of violence and threats to diplomatic personnel. In July, Foreign Policy reported that the lower staffing levels are being treated as permanent.\n\nUSAID manages $1.16 billion in assistance in Iraq, spanning development, humanitarian aid and stabilization efforts, according to the report.\n\nThat \"large portfolio,\" coupled with the staff reductions, \"create uncertainty as to how programs will be overseen remotely,\" the report said. \"Uncertainty around staffing levels also raises questions about USAID's continuing ability to effectively oversee its high-priority, high-risk portfolio.\"\n\nU.S. assistance in Iraq includes over $400 million for religious and ethnic minorities targeted by the militant group Islamic State. That has been a major priority for Pence, as well as for conservative Christian groups and vocal communities of Iraqi Christians.\n\nA new component of that effort was announced by USAID last month: $4.1 million to six local Iraqi organizations. ProPublica previously found that political appointees played a significant role in the latest awards.\n\nThe awardees included two groups that had been rejected by career officials for separate grants in Iraq in 2018. One of the groups, the Shlama Foundation, is a small charity that primarily serves Christian Iraqis; it will receive $1 million over two years. It has no full-time paid staff and no experience with government grants, a Shlama board member, Ranna Abro, previously told ProPublica.\n\nShlama did not respond to a request for comment this week, but Abro said previously that it is capable of handling the work, and that USAID had \"fully and completely reviewed our capacity and is releasing the funds in small, manageable amounts based on deliverable outcomes.\"\n\nUSAID has exacting requirements for its funding, requiring groups to provide extensive background and financial information. Small organizations often are less equipped to fulfill those requirements and need particularly close oversight from agency officials, experts on foreign aid said.\n\nThe watchdog report addressed the latest awards to local Iraqi groups, and it said their structure \"relies on in-country expertise from USAID personnel to train local organizations on the requirements of receiving U.S. funding.\" It added: \"According to USAID, this is particularly challenging given that awards to local organizations require increased involvement.\"\n\nOfficials at USAID warned that favoring Christian groups in Iraq could be unconstitutional and inflame religious tensions. When one colleague lost her job, they said she had been \"Penced.\"\n\nThe report also raised questions about the effectiveness of some of USAID's efforts toward Christians and other minority groups in Iraq.\n\nFor instance, one major USAID goal in Iraq has been to encourage the return of Christians, Yazidis and other groups to their homes in northern Iraq, which they fled after Islamic State took over swaths of the country. Last year, USAID administrator Mark Green said the agency was \"committed to creating the conditions so that these communities can return safely to their ancestral lands.\"\n\nBut officials have acknowledged relatively modest returns on the effort thus far. In September, senior USAID official Hallam Ferguson said the returns of persecuted religious minority groups to their homes still \"lag far behind\" other displaced groups in Iraq.\n\n\"We are struggling against tectonic forces in Iraq,\" including decades of government neglect and discriminatory policy, more than 15 years of sectarian strife and unchecked local armed groups, Ferguson said in testimony to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom.\n\nAccording to the watchdog report, USAID officials have said that obstacles in Iraq cannot be resolved without more diplomatic engagement, made far more difficult by Pompeo's drawdown. The report cited disputes between local Iraqi political leaders that had allowed a \"vacuum of governance\" to develop in Sinjar, an area of Iraq that includes many religious minorities.\n\n\"The longer these barriers remain in place, the more significant the questions grow about the potential effectiveness of these assistance efforts,\" the report said.\n\nDo you have access to information about foreign assistance that should be public?

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nA company created by a former Pentagon official who describes himself as a White House volunteer for Vice President Mike Pence won a $2.4 million dollar contract in May - its first federal award - to supply the Bureau of Prisons with surgical gowns.\n\nMathew J. Konkler, who worked in the Department of Defense during the George W. Bush administration, formed BlackPoint Distribution Company LLC in August 2019 in Indiana, state records show, but had won no federal work until May 26. The Bureau of Prisons chose the company with limited competition for a contract to supply surgical gowns to its facilities.\n\nIt is at least the second contract awarded to a company formed by an individual who had worked in or volunteered for the Trump administration; a company formed by Zach Fuentes, a former White House deputy chief of staff, won a $3 million contract just days after forming to supply face masks to the Indian Health Service. The masks did not meet FDA standards for use in health care settings, and an IHS spokesman said this week that the agency is trying to return the masks to Fuentes. Members of Congress called for investigations into the contract, and the Government Accountability Office now plans to review the deal \"in the coming few months, as staff become available,\" spokesman Charles Young said last week.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nA lawyer for Fuentes' company said the firm fulfilled all of its obligations to IHS under the contract.\n\nBlackPoint Distribution's website does not mention Konkler but describes its work as \"locating, verifying and successfully delivering vital products and equipment in the midst of extremely challenging environments.\" The domain name was registered on April 9, 2020. In its incorporation documents, Konkler is listed as the CEO of BlackPoint Distribution. The only contact information on the site is a web form and an email address. Emails sent to it were returned as undeliverable, and Konkler did not return multiple phone calls and messages seeking comment.\n\nOn the website for BlackPoint Creative LLC , another Indiana firm where Konkler serves as managing partner, his bio says that \"since 2018, Mr. Konkler has also served as a volunteer at the White House on the staff of the Vice President, Michael R. Pence.\"\n\nIn a 2018 interview with an Indiana business publication, Konkler said that another of his companies, BlackPoint Strategies was a \"full-service consulting firm offering a variety of other advisory services, which focus on strategic marketing, digital marketing and crisis communications,\" but also assisted Indiana companies in selling products in international markets. A search of Indiana state contracts yielded no previous or current government contracts for BlackPoint Distribution or other firms that Konkler is involved in.\n\nA spokesman for Pence said that Konkler previously had helped coordinate some of the vice president's travel but was not currently a volunteer.\n\nCoronavirus has triggered a global economic crisis. We are trying to cover it - and we need your help.\n\n\"Mr. Konkler is not nor ever has been a member of Vice President Pence's staff,\" said Devin O'Malley in an email. \"Mr. Konkler has previously helped in a volunteer capacity doing advance on trips, but has not done so since June 2019. No one in the Office of the Vice President was aware of or had any role in Mr. Konkler receiving this contract.\"\n\nResearchers at American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic opposition research group, identified Konkler's role.\n\nWhite House volunteers are not uncommon, and typically they are involved in specific projects such as the correspondence office, which reads and answers messages sent to the administration, or in holiday decoration efforts .\n\nGovernment ethics experts said that conflict of interest rules do apply to volunteers but depend on the kind of work being done. \"I'm worried about conflicts of interest but also about someone who isn't a government employee knowing the [vice president's] travel plans,\" said Scott Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight. Konkler's online biography states that he has held a Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information security clearance.\n\n\"The Bureau of Prisons took a risk awarding a $2.5 million contract to a new company,\" Amey said. \"Let's hope this ends up as a success story and not another example of a pop-up contractor trying to profit from an emergency situation.\"\n\nThe contract itself was awarded under urgent circumstances. The Bureau of Prisons did not issue a request for proposals because the pandemic \"resulted in the need to limit competition due to compelling urgency,\" Justin Long, a spokesman for the bureau, wrote in an email. The contract originally stated June 3 as the date for gown delivery to six different federal prisons, but Long said in an email that the final shipment was delivered on June 25.\n\nBlackPoint's contract is the largest of all federal contracts that specifically mention \" surgical gowns ,\" according to federal contracting data.\n\nThe former official, Zach Fuentes, is refusing to take back the masks even though IHS said they did not meet FDA standards. His company's lawyer says the IHS is trying to cancel the order for \"political reasons.\"\n\nRecords show that the agency received three offers and that the contract was awarded under what are known as \"simplified acquisition procedures,\" a process typically used for contracts involving smaller amounts of money. Because of the national emergency declared in response to the pandemic, the threshold for using simplified procedures was raised to $13 million when purchasing commercial items such as surgical gowns. BlackPoint Distribution's bid was the lowest, Long said.\n\nBlackPoint Distribution is one of more than 445 first-time federal contractors awarded contracts during the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a ProPublica analysis of federal contracting data. These new contractors have received more than $2 billion in federal spending as of June 25, often without competitive bidding or direct experience in the areas they won deals in.\n\nAfter declaring a national emergency on March 13, the federal government relaxed procurement rules to allow federal agencies to skip competitive bidding at times in favor of a more streamlined process that could deliver personal protective equipment and other products quickly. But in doing so, it also has made deals with vendors who were unable to fulfill orders or who have provided inadequate equipment.\n\nDo you have access to information about federal contracts that should be public?

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nDear ProPublican,\n\nYou've almost certainly seen some of the more than 600 tweets President Donald Trump has sent in the last three years using the phrase \"fake news.\" And you've heard the president repeatedly use the phrase \"enemy of the people\" --- previously a favorite of Robespierre, Stalin, Hitler and Mao, a veritable Mount Rushmore of totalitarianism --- to refer to the press. But I sometimes wonder if people not in our business understand how the current war on journalism plays out day to day. Last week provided an illustration.\n\nLast Wednesday, ProPublica Washington reporter Yeganeh Torbati published a long and meticulously documented piece on how the Trump administration, led in this instance by Vice President Mike Pence, was overriding judgments about foreign aid to funnel money to Christian groups ; how some Trump appointees view the constitutional prohibition on the establishment of a state religion or favoritism of one religion over another as a \"constraint\"; and how officials who don't go along are in danger of being \"Penced,\" or fired.\n\nThe story ran more than 4,500 words, with lots of newly reported details. It was picked up by The Washington Post, CNN, Politico and others, and it has been viewed more than 160,000 times on our website. No questions have been raised by anyone about its factual accuracy.\n\nBut that afternoon, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, a political appointee named Richard Grenell, decided to respond to a tweet from the reporter explaining what it means at the U.S. Agency for International Development to be \"Penced.\" The ambassador began by asserting, \"This isn't a thing.\" (How he could be sure of this, since he's never worked at USAID, he didn't say.)\n\nThen he added this: \"Yeganeh is anti-faith groups. She wants to exclude them.\"\n\nLet's count the levels on which this is offensive.\n\nFirst, the ambassador has never met our reporter, so why is he using her first name? Would he do that for a man? Possibly. But two days earlier on Twitter he referred to someone else he doesn't appear to know and of whom he was being critical, former NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart, as \"Lockhart.\"\n\nNext, why invoke this particular first name, Yeganeh? It feels to me like it might be for the same reason some people used to use President Barack Obama's middle name, Hussein: because it sounds foreign. Some people like to use euphemisms about this kind of behavior. I prefer to call it what it seems to me to be, xenophobia and racism. In this case (as in the case of Obama, a native of Hawaii), the purpose is to suggest the person under attack is \"not from here.\"  While Grenell might want you to think of Yeganeh Torbati as foreign, she is, as he could have seen from her bio on our site , a native of ... Oklahoma, where she was born and raised.\n\nI am not sure what it would mean to be \"anti-faith groups,\" but it's hard to imagine how the ambassador would have learned about the private views of a person he's never met.\n\nThe attempted smear from a man who is supposed to be a diplomat representing our entire country wasn't the only event of last Wednesday I want to call to your attention to. Early that evening, we heard from a \"social issues reporter\" with the Daily Caller, the web site co-founded by Tucker Carlson of Fox News. The reporter asked for our comment \"on a spokesman for Pence calling your story one-sided.\"\n\nI was pleased to reply with a statement that added to the public record, telling the Daily Caller that \"it's highly ironic that the vice president's office did not bother to respond to questions before this story was published but has now found time to call it 'one-sided.'\"\n\nI liked that response. Maybe it was sufficiently effective that some people would think the vice president's office got the worse of the exchange. I don't know what they thought at the Daily Caller, but I do know no story ever ran.\n\nOn Thursday, The Washington Times published a story that included Pence's office's critique of our story as \"one-sided.\" The Times did not bother to call us for comment or to inform its readers that our story included Pence's refusal to comment.\n\nWe also pointed out that the vice president's staff had failed to answer our questions. I thought you might want to see what that entails, so we have posted all of the reporter's questions to the vice president's office. They're here . There were more than 25 specific questions in five emails over a period of 15 days. (We've omitted portions of the questions relating to material we didn't ultimately publish.) The vice president's press secretary didn't answer any of them.\n\nI have taken you through all of this not because it is unusual, but because it is not. There is a war underway against journalism in this country. It is being fought by powerful people who would like to see their use of power go unexamined, and therefore unchecked. Attacks like those described above happen every day. You need to know that.\n\nWe decided to call this newsletter \"Not Shutting Up\" because, in the first days of the current administration, a senior White House staffer said the press \"should just shut up.\" That is still the hope of some. It remains our intention not to comply.\n\nBest, Dick\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nThe commission told ProPublica that states' voter rolls will be run against federal databases to find potential fraudulent registrations - a move experts say will result in thousands of errors and could distort fraud.\n\nby Jessica Huseman\n\nVice President Mike Pence's office has confirmed the White House commission on voter fraud intends to run the state voter rolls it has requested against federal databases to check for potential fraudulent registration. Experts say the plan is certain to produce thousands of false positives that could distort the understanding of the potential for fraud, especially given the limited data states have agreed to turn over.\n\n\"This just demonstrates remarkable naivety on how this voter data can be used,\" said David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research. \"There's absolutely no way that incomplete data from some states - mainly consisting of names and addresses - can be used to determine anything.\"\n\nThe commission's vice chair, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, sent a letter to states last week requesting detailed information on voters. The request asked for information such as Social Security numbers and military status most states cannot legally make available. But most states will be handing over information that is public, such as names, years of birth and whether they've voted in previous elections.\n\nMarc Lotter, spokesman for Pence, told ProPublica the state voter information will be run \"through a number of different databases, looking for the possibility for areas where voter rolls could be strengthened.\"\n\nWhile Lotter would not say specifically which databases the rolls would be run against, The Washington Times reported last week the commission may seek to check the names against the federal government's database of non-citizens. A 2012 attempt by Florida to do that resulted in many legitimate voters being falsely flagged because they had the same names as people in the federal database. Gov. Rick Scott scrapped the effort and eventually apologized .\n\nComparing names nationwide could result in far more false positives.\n\n\"How many Manuel Rodríguezes born in 1945 who are citizens are going to be on an immigration list? There are likely to be several,\" said Charles Stewart, a professor at MIT and expert in election administration. \"How will you know if he's the immigrant, or he is one of the several people with that name who are citizens and legally registered?\"\n\nKobach runs a matching program that appears to have its own high rate of errors. A recent study by political scientists at Stanford University found that Kobach's Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck Program had 200 false positives for every actual double registration. The Kansas secretary of state's office did not immediately return a call for comment on the program.\n\nOther systems already exist that do rigorous matching. The Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, is a voluntary, paid system operated by a nonprofit and used by 20 states and the District of Columbia. The system uses far more information than states are able to make publicly available, such as driver's license numbers, Social Security numbers and even email addresses.\n\nBecker, who helped create ERIC, said it took years of work to ensure careful matches. The speed at which Kobach and Pence sought information from states, which were given two weeks to hand over their voter rolls, and their plan for the limited amount of information they'll receive \"demonstrates a remarkable ignorance of the process,\" said Becker.\n\nLotter, Pence's spokesman, said that even if false matches were made they'd do no harm since the commission can't remove names from states' voter rolls. He said the commission is simply going to provide recommendations and highlight any common problems that might come up in the matching process.\n\n\"What we are trying to do is create the first national look at voter registration and the potential for fraudulent registration that could lead to fraudulent voting,\" Lotter said. \"At the end of the day you have to ask yourself who is not for making sure we have one person one vote?\"\n\nJohn Merrill, the Republican secretary of state for Alabama, said any false positive raises the likelihood a voter might be incorrectly purged.\n\nA commission created by President Donald Trump to enhance confidence in America's elections has asked all 50 states for copies of their voter records which often include names, addresses and ages. The commission has said it intends to make the information widely available.\n\n\"I would be surprised if they could find a way to improve upon the methods already in place from the consortiums that already exists,\" Merrill said. \"Every time you remove a mechanism that more positively identifies a voter, it increases the opportunity for a false positive to match.\"\n\nPresident Trump created the commission after making unsupported claims that there were millions of illegal votes cast in the 2016 presidential election. Kobach, the commission's public face, has long asserted without evidence that voter fraud is widespread.\n\nDespite numerous academic studies to the contrary, Kobach has claimed that non-citizens regularly vote, that people vote twice with frequency and has backed Trump's claims of illegal voting last year. Kobach, along with other members of the commission, has also supported restrictions on voter registration, including strict voter ID laws.\n\nLotter said the bipartisan nature of the commission - currently four of the 10 announced commissioners are Democrats - should assuage any concerns from critics. The four Democrats include Maine's secretary of state, Matthew Dunlap, whose state has declined to provide the information the commission requested in Kobach's letter.\n\nLotter also said none of the commissioners had \"pre-conceived notions\" about voter fraud and that they would fairly judge the results of the matches.\n\nDale Ho, the director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, disputed Lotter's claims of neutrality.\n\n\"It's up is down and black is white,\" he said. \"The idea that people who have made repeated public statements that they believe, contrary to all evidence, that there is massive fraud are not biased is ludicrous.\"\n\nFiled under:\n\nJessica Huseman\n\nJessica Huseman was a reporter voting rights and election administration for ProPublica.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nTwo commissioners say they were in the dark not only about the arrest of a researcher for the commission - but also about the fact that he was working there in the first place.\n\nby Jessica Huseman\n\nThe arrest , on child pornography charges, of a researcher for the controversial Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity is intensifying conflict inside the group, with two Democratic members asserting again that a small band of conservatives holds disproportionate power. The researcher, Ronald Williams II, who was arrested late last week, previously worked as an intern at the Department of Justice on a case with J. Christian Adams, who is now a Republican member of the commission.\n\nDemocratic commissioner Matt Dunlap contends Williams' involvement with the commission is the latest in a series of discoveries suggesting a few conservative members wield outsize clout; Dunlap claims that Democratic members have been largely excluded from planning. Today he wrote a letter to the commission demanding information.\n\n\"I am seeking information because I lack it,\" stated the letter, a copy of which was given to ProPublica. \"I am in a position where I feel compelled to inquire after the work of the Commission upon which I am sworn to serve, and am yet completely uninformed as to its activities.\" The letter demanded copies of \"any and all communication between members of the commission\" beginning in May.\n\nDunlap called the arrest of Williams the last straw in what he characterized as a series of actions by several commissioners to manipulate the commission. In September , an email was released showing that Republican Commissioner Hans von Spakovsky lobbied against the inclusion of Democrats on the commission. And earlier this month , filings in a lawsuit showed that, before they joined the commission, von Spakovsky and Adams played a role in the commission's most consequential action to date: a letter sent to states requesting sweeping quantities of voter data.\n\nBoth Dunlap and Alan King - a Democratic commissioner and probate court judge in Jefferson County, Alabama - said the commissioners were never told about any staff members apart from Andrew Kossack, the person running the commission. They said they did not know of Williams until they read about him in a Washington Post article describing his arrest in Maryland on 11 counts of possessing and distributing child pornography. (Williams, who no longer works for the commission, was released on $150,000 bail. Attempts to reach him by phone and email were unsuccessful.)\n\n\"It seems like you have the core of the commission - J. Christian Adams, Hans van Spakovsky and [Kris] Kobach - and then you have the rest of us, who are kind of like mannequins,\" Dunlap said in an interview. He said he was surprised to learn of Williams' history working alongside Adams.\n\nWilliams was an intern at the DOJ during the administration of George W. Bush. He worked alongside Adams on litigation the department filed against Noxubee County, Mississippi, in 2006 - the first time the DOJ used the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to protect white voters.\n\nAdams recognized Williams' work on the Noxubee case in the acknowledgements of his 2011 book, \"Injustice: Exposing the Racial Agenda of the Obama Justice Department.\" \"Thanks to the Noxubee team,\" Adams wrote, \"including Joshua Rogers, Ron Williams, and Joann Sazama, who made litigation enjoyable.\" The DOJ declined to comment on Williams' role in the litigation.\n\nAdams declined to answer questions about Williams' role on the commission, or whether he helped hire Williams. Adams did provide a written statement:\n\n\"Ronald Williams worked at the Criminal and Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice where presumably he underwent regular background checks. The alleged behavior is appalling and incomprehensible, particularly given his long tenure at DOJ handling sensitive matters. It would be hyper-partisan overreach to say that any grotesque behavior in his personal life is in any way a reflection of the vitally important work the Commission is doing for the American people.\"\n\nWilliams appears to be the intern mentioned in a 2013 report by the DOJ's Office of the Inspector General, which recounted complaints of alleged hostile treatment by fellow DOJ employees after Williams' involvement in the Noxubee litigation. \"You know why they asked you to go down there ... they used you as a token,\" a black intern - whose mother was also employed by the DOJ - stated he was told, according to the report. Williams, who is black, was an intern assigned to the Noxubee case and his mother was a long-time employee at the DOJ.\n\nThe OIG report noted that the intern \"perceived a broader 'whisper campaign' in the office about his participation in the Noxubee case,\" and that \"the remarks angered and insulted him by suggesting he was duped into working on the matter.\"\n\nDunlap said despite the widespread media coverage of Williams' arrest, no one on the commission was provided any explanation. He expressed frustration over this in his letter to the commission, which indicates he found out about the arrest through a journalist.\n\nAbigail Dillen sees the increase of lawsuits targeting green groups as just one of the growing threats to environmental advocacy organizations - and the people who staff them.\n\nThe Office of the Vice President of the United States - Mike Pence is the co-chair of the commission - did not respond to multiple questions about Williams' role, or when he began his work. (Kobach and von Spakovsky also did not respond to emails seeking comment.) Williams was pictured sitting behind the commissioners at the first meeting of the voting commission in mid-July.\n\nDavid Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, said the commission continues to operate in a \"shroud of secrecy.\"\n\n\"Despite being asked repeatedly for information about its activities, sometimes by fellow commissioners themselves,\" he said, \"it takes a revelation like this to learn anything about what this panel is doing behind closed doors at taxpayer expense.\"\n\nUpdate: On Oct. 18, Democratic senators sent two letters requesting information from the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. One, from Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, cited ProPublica's reporting - that members of the commission were unaware of the names of staff assigned to work for the commission - and expressed \"alarm.\"\n\n\"If the Commission's own members do not know who is working under its direction, how can the Commission ensure accountability and transparency?\" wrote Klobuchar, who requested a list of staff and information about the commission's vetting process. \"Knowledge that a member of the Commission's staff was arrested for possession and distribution of child pornography only reinforces our concern about who has access to [widespread voter data requested by the commission] and how it is being maintained.\"\n\nA second letter , signed by 18 Democratic senators, also expressed concerns about data security and the commission's plans for the voter data it requested from states. The letter repeated questions posed to the commission in a July letter, asserting that none of them have been answered.\n\nWhen the letters were sent on Wednesday to the commission's public email address, an automatic response email stated that the account no longer accepts public comments. Instead, commenters were directed to an \"eRulmaking [sic] portal\" or to submit written comments to \"Mr. Ron Williams, Policy Advisor, Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity\" - the individual arrested on child pornography charges last week. The commission did not return a request for comment.\n\nFiled under:\n\nJessica Huseman\n\nJessica Huseman was a reporter voting rights and election administration for ProPublica.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "Mike Pence quietly lays the groundwork for a post-Trump future\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nMike Pence stuck his head up this week to take a whack at Trumpism, urging Republicans to reject âprotectionist tariffsâ and âisolationismâ while âunashamedlyâ recommitting to anti-abortion positions.\n\nItâs a sign of what heâs up to behind the scenes as well.\n\nThe former vice president is laying the groundwork for a party that could move on after the election from Donald Trumpâs populism and protectionism. Sometimes that means being a rare voice of public dissent, at other times it means quietly trying to recruit allies to his cause who might be more willing to join him on specific policy or political fights.\n\nâWeâre trying to plant a flag for conservatism and believe that many of our traditional conservative groups have become far more enamored with populism these days and walked away from those principles,â Marc Short, Penceâs longtime advisor, told Semafor.\n\nThe former vice presidentâs Wall Street Journal op-ed taking veiled shots at Trumpâs policy priorities is just a hint of what Pence is thinking as he waits for the 2024 election to play out. But the big question for Pence is: Is there still a place for him in todayâs GOP?\n\nThe answer isnât even clear to his fans: Pence doesnât fit into âthe Republican party of today,â said Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney. âThe Republican Party of tomorrow may be a different matter.â\n\nAfter incurring Donald Trumpâs wrath for certifying the 2020 election, Penceâs platform of traditional conservatism failed to move GOP voters in his presidential campaign. Yet the former vice president, governor, and member of House leadership â who was key to helping expand Trumpâs coalition in 2016 â remains concerned about the direction of the party, and heâs been making moves to cultivate like-minded supporters.\n\nPence faces a tough road back: He doesnât have the same rabid fan base as other leaders in the party âÂ his presidential run confirmed that. As Trump-aligned Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley put it: âIf you run for president and lose, itâs hard to maintain influence.â\n\nPence also faces criticism from Trump allies for being âdisloyalâ to the former president. But he does have long standing relationships with lawmakers on the Hill and activists across the country, and is well-respected, albeit quietly at times, among a solid faction of the party.\n\nHeâs leaning into that, and trying, with the help of his group Advancing American Freedom (AAF), to be the GOPâs âconscienceâ of sorts, as the organizationâs president Tim Chapman put it. Itâs welcome news for the coterie of Republicans who, like Pence, find themselves on the outside of the partyâs populist bent.\n\nâThereâs room for his voice and the voices of others, for this reason: Our party is, at this point, mostly a political coalition in search of a clear policy agenda,â said Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, a Republican who has not endorsed Trump. âAt some point weâre going to have to gravitate around a clear policy agenda â¦ And Mike Pence is very well equipped to do that.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nPence and AAF weighed in on various issues this year â most notably abortion and the SALT deduction , the latter of which Trump vowed to reverse (after it passed during his first administration) just last week. Pence is also reaching out to his partyâs more hawkish and interventionist wing, while harmonizing with free traders and criticizing tariffs, which are Trumpâs top economic priority.\n\nHis group has spent $10 million on defending the partyâs 2017 tax cuts, and is also in the midst of hosting sessions for staffers on the Hill about the expiring tax cuts. Theyâve engaged in support for Ukraine, anti-abortion legislation, and the bill intended to force a TikTok sale or ban. Pence personally meets often with lawmakers and texts with them on AAF priorities. The group distributes policy memos around the hill, holds off the record events, and generally tries to maintain a visible presence.\n\nâOver the last year or so youâve definitely seen more members and staff taking note of what AAF is putting out there as they call balls and strikes on policy,â one former GOP leadership aide told Semafor.\n\nPenceâs team believes thereâs still a lane for his style of conservatism, even as they acknowledge questions about his continued relevance. Short argued that thereâs been an increased âappetite among supportersâ who are concerned about the direction of the party. Chapman maintained that âthere are a lot of lawmakers who still would describe themselves behind closed doors as traditional Reagan Republicans.â\n\nâPence and their organization have done a good job of focusing on the issues and not being antagonistic to President Trump,â one senior Republican staffer said, adding that theyâve spent time on the Hill highlighting areas, like tax cuts, where thereâs agreement with Trump. âThere are a lot of people here who maybe donât agree with the president on all policy matters and might align more with the vice president. And then thereâs vice versa.â\n\nDespite Pence and AAF being at odds with many of Trumpâs current positions, Short said he wouldnât describe their effort as ânon-MAGA.â Instead, Pence would be willing to work with Trump on policy topics where there is agreement. Still, the dynamics between Trump and Pence could spark party infighting next year if Trump wins and Pence challenges the former presidentâs priorities. Chapman made clear that their mission would be to keep âRepublicans accountable to a set of principlesâ regardless of who wins the White House, even if it meant conflict.\n\nPence is also keeping strong Indiana ties, meeting with Republican Sen. Mike Braun this summer to discuss his gubernatorial campaign. They evaded discussing Penceâs refusal to endorse Trump this cycle, Braun said: âI felt that was not for me to weigh in on. â\n\nâItâs a difficult spot because of the crossfire he was within. And I think at some point, weâll get back to true conservative principles â¦ once we get past the moment in time that looks chaotic politically,â Braun told Semafor. âWeâre a party that avoids policy.â\n\nPenceâs best opportunity to redirect his party is if Trump loses. Thereâs pent-up angst over the partyâs policy direction on foreign and economic policy, and lots of social conservatives who are closer to Pence on issues like abortion than they are to Trump. So if Republicans are picking up the pieces in mid-November, it seems likely Pence will be one of the voices involved.\n\nItâs harder to see where Pence and his group will go if Trump wins â and Penceâs non-endorsement of Trump doesnât help in that scenario. Itâs also hard to see Pence holding elected office again, though there are plenty of opportunities for him to influence policy through his group and in the press.\n\nWhile these challenges are real, at minimum heâs engendered goodwill around Washington from his time on Capitol Hill and the Trump presidency. âMike Pence is a good man and I definitely think he has a place in the party,â Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said. âIâm not going to second-guess anybodyâs endorsement.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Mike Pence quietly lays the groundwork for a post-Trump future\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nMike Pence stuck his head up this week to take a whack at Trumpism, urging Republicans to reject âprotectionist tariffsâ and âisolationismâ while âunashamedlyâ recommitting to anti-abortion positions.\n\nItâs a sign of what heâs up to behind the scenes as well.\n\nThe former vice president is laying the groundwork for a party that could move on after the election from Donald Trumpâs populism and protectionism. Sometimes that means being a rare voice of public dissent, at other times it means quietly trying to recruit allies to his cause who might be more willing to join him on specific policy or political fights.\n\nâWeâre trying to plant a flag for conservatism and believe that many of our traditional conservative groups have become far more enamored with populism these days and walked away from those principles,â Marc Short, Penceâs longtime advisor, told Semafor.\n\nThe former vice presidentâs Wall Street Journal op-ed taking veiled shots at Trumpâs policy priorities is just a hint of what Pence is thinking as he waits for the 2024 election to play out. But the big question for Pence is: Is there still a place for him in todayâs GOP?\n\nThe answer isnât even clear to his fans: Pence doesnât fit into âthe Republican party of today,â said Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney. âThe Republican Party of tomorrow may be a different matter.â\n\nAfter incurring Donald Trumpâs wrath for certifying the 2020 election, Penceâs platform of traditional conservatism failed to move GOP voters in his presidential campaign. Yet the former vice president, governor, and member of House leadership â who was key to helping expand Trumpâs coalition in 2016 â remains concerned about the direction of the party, and heâs been making moves to cultivate like-minded supporters.\n\nPence faces a tough road back: He doesnât have the same rabid fan base as other leaders in the party âÂ his presidential run confirmed that. As Trump-aligned Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley put it: âIf you run for president and lose, itâs hard to maintain influence.â\n\nPence also faces criticism from Trump allies for being âdisloyalâ to the former president. But he does have long standing relationships with lawmakers on the Hill and activists across the country, and is well-respected, albeit quietly at times, among a solid faction of the party.\n\nHeâs leaning into that, and trying, with the help of his group Advancing American Freedom (AAF), to be the GOPâs âconscienceâ of sorts, as the organizationâs president Tim Chapman put it. Itâs welcome news for the coterie of Republicans who, like Pence, find themselves on the outside of the partyâs populist bent.\n\nâThereâs room for his voice and the voices of others, for this reason: Our party is, at this point, mostly a political coalition in search of a clear policy agenda,â said Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, a Republican who has not endorsed Trump. âAt some point weâre going to have to gravitate around a clear policy agenda â¦ And Mike Pence is very well equipped to do that.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nPence and AAF weighed in on various issues this year â most notably abortion and the SALT deduction , the latter of which Trump vowed to reverse (after it passed during his first administration) just last week. Pence is also reaching out to his partyâs more hawkish and interventionist wing, while harmonizing with free traders and criticizing tariffs, which are Trumpâs top economic priority.\n\nHis group has spent $10 million on defending the partyâs 2017 tax cuts, and is also in the midst of hosting sessions for staffers on the Hill about the expiring tax cuts. Theyâve engaged in support for Ukraine, anti-abortion legislation, and the bill intended to force a TikTok sale or ban. Pence personally meets often with lawmakers and texts with them on AAF priorities. The group distributes policy memos around the hill, holds off the record events, and generally tries to maintain a visible presence.\n\nâOver the last year or so youâve definitely seen more members and staff taking note of what AAF is putting out there as they call balls and strikes on policy,â one former GOP leadership aide told Semafor.\n\nPenceâs team believes thereâs still a lane for his style of conservatism, even as they acknowledge questions about his continued relevance. Short argued that thereâs been an increased âappetite among supportersâ who are concerned about the direction of the party. Chapman maintained that âthere are a lot of lawmakers who still would describe themselves behind closed doors as traditional Reagan Republicans.â\n\nâPence and their organization have done a good job of focusing on the issues and not being antagonistic to President Trump,â one senior Republican staffer said, adding that theyâve spent time on the Hill highlighting areas, like tax cuts, where thereâs agreement with Trump. âThere are a lot of people here who maybe donât agree with the president on all policy matters and might align more with the vice president.

      "text": "âWeâre not doing kickbacksâ: Mike Pence says heâs ready to hit the debate stage\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence sat down with Semafor on Friday after his remarks at the Republican Party of Iowaâs Lincoln Dinner. It wasnât an easy room. Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis got most of the crowd, of 1,000 party activists and donors, on their feet. No one else did. Ex-Texas Rep. Will Hurd ended his speech under a chorus of boos, after saying that Donald Trump was running for president to stay out of jail. Pence, even when talking about the record of the âTrump-Pence administration,â got a mild response, and wrapped up by thanking the audience for hearing him out.\n\nPence is constantly asked to comment on his former running mateâs legal problems; he told reporters in Nevada, Iowa on Saturday that he didnât agree with Hurd, because Trump was obviously planning to run again as soon as he left the presidency, before the law caught up with him. He talked about a few other issues with Semafor, starting with the reaction he got from an audience that had voted overwhelmingly for him to be vice president.\n\nSemafor: What was your read on that crowd?\n\nMike Pence: I thought the crowd was respectful, enthusiastic. From where Iâm sitting, I got a lot of response. To me, tonight was really about just putting down a clear message about what we can all agree on. And that is that Joe Biden will never be reelected as president of the United States. As I said, I think that everybody on this stage â we have differences, we have plenty of time to sort that out. Tonight, I wanted to express that what brought me to the stage is that I think the country is in a lot of trouble. But I was very encouraged by the response.\n\nSemafor: In your anti-inflation plan, you once again endorse ending the dual mandate. It was Jerome Powell who not only kept the dual mandate, but said growth should be âbroad-based and inclusive.â Was it a mistake to appoint him? Who would you want to replace him?\n\nPence: Well, as you know, when I was in Congress, I was deeply concerned about the practice of quantitative easing. I think I had hoped that Jerome Powell would bring a change in direction, away from essentially free money. But in the early days of his time at the Fed, we didnât see that progress. And then, of course, the COVID pandemic struck.\n\nI honestly think that this is an issue that takes a moment to explain. For me, ending the dual mandate is about saying to the Fed: We need you to look after the integrity of the dollar, to combat inflation, and we ought to be holding presidents and members of Congress accountable for full employment. I think that the presence of the dual mandate over recent decades has resulted in the kind of policies that set off the inflation that we have today. The greatest means of combating inflation is to get runaway federal spending under control and to bring forward common sense policies that will stave off the debt crisis facing our children and grandchildren.\n\nSemafor: Youâve delineated a lot of the spending cuts that you want to fight inflation: Eliminating the EPA; cutting environmental programs, electric car tax credits, subsidies for electric batteries. What would be the climate impact of rolling that back?\n\nPence: Well, one of the least reported facts of the Trump-Pence years was that we actually saw a reduction in carbon output in our administration that exceeded the goals of the Paris Climate Accord. But we did it through American innovation. For my part, I believe that the responsibilities the EPA can be entrusted to other agencies with regard to upholding current law. But at the end of the day, I think the pathway to a cleaner environment is to continue an all-of-the-above energy strategy and to promote American innovation, including nuclear energy. I was in New Hampshire last week, and at several of our town hall and restaurant conversations, people asked the question, why arenât we doing nuclear energy? That, of course, has zero carbon output. I just think itâs a moment for national leadership, and weâll provide that.\n\nSemafor: After Gov. DeSantis suggested a role for RFK Jr in his administration, you said this week that youâd only put pro-life people in your cabinet. How do you define pro-life for those purposes? Supporting a 15-week ban? Heartbeat bill?\n\nPence: Weâll have a pro-life administration with each person. The one thing I wonât do is appoint people to healthcare positions who donât embrace the right to life. I felt it was important this week to make it clear that if Iâm President of the United States, I would only appoint pro-life Americans to lead HHS, CDC and the FDA, given the enormous role that those agencies play in policies that affect the right to life.\n\nSemafor: The Biden administration has launched a civil rights inquiry into legacy admissions at Harvard. Would you continue that investigation if you were president?\n\nPence: It feels like another example of Biden bullying private academic institutions or public institutions of higher education. Look, my first full time job after college was an admissions counselor. Iâd rather leave our universities to establish the criteria for admission, without the heavy hand of government. But I really do believe that, while there may well have been a day that we needed affirmative action to correct historic wrongs and to ensure access, I think that that day is over. And I truly do believe that the Supreme Courtâs step has moved us toward a more perfect union than ideal of a colorblind society. And I celebrate it.\n\nSemafor: You have not qualified for the first debate yet. There are candidates whoâve offered gift cards for donors â basically, you get $19 back for a dollar â to get in. Are you ruling out any kind of gimmicks like that?\n\nPence: Yeah, weâre not doing kickbacks. Weâre not doing gift cards. Weâre not even giving out soccer tickets. Weâre just asking people for support, and itâs rolling in. I will tell you, weâve averaged, over the last week, over 1,000 contributions a day from all across the country. Iâm confident that weâll meet the qualifications. With the pace weâre going I actually think we may meet the threshold to qualify for the second debate before we arrive at the first one. But, you know, Iâm someone that just believes in going out and telling your story, and people around the country have been stepping up. I also recognize that other candidates had significantly more time than weâve had. We announced on June 7, but weâre confident weâll be there.\n\nSemafor: Gov. DeSantis is riding on his super PACâs bus this week. Thereâs a super PAC supporting you â whatâs your level of comfort around coordinating with it? Is the governor flouting the guidelines for separation between a super PAC and a campaign?\n\nPence: Well, Iâm grateful for the work that the Committed to America super PAC is doing, especially here in Iowa. Iâm able to read reports after the fact of their efforts on the ground and the results. Theyâve been literally talking to hundreds of thousands of caucus goers, and been able to tell our story. Actually, in their contacts, weâre running a solid second place in Iowa. So Iâm grateful for that. But we donât we donât coordinate with the Committed to America PAC. Weâll get our own bus.\n\nSemafor: If the Jack Smith investigation is not over, and you become president, would you shut it down?\n\nPence: Itâs a hypothetical question. It appears to me that theyâre moving much more rapidly than that. And look, the presidentâs entitled or presumption of innocence. Heâs entitled to his day in court, to make his defense. But I am never going to downplay the importance of protecting classified documents. I was pleased that the Justice Department was able to determine that the documents that inadvertently made their way back to my residence was an innocent mistake. But it was a mistake. And I took responsibility for it. And I expect theyâll move forward expeditiously on that.\n\nSemafor: Before this event started, the president released a statement to People Magazine acknowledging that he has a seventh grandchild â Hunterâs daughter with a woman from Arkansas. Whatâs your reaction to him doing that, and how long it took?\n\nPence: Well, look, I became a grandfather three times over in the last two years. And for all the difficulties in their family, I canât help but feel that the President has finally been willing to come to terms and be public with acknowledging all of his grandchildren. I think itâs a welcome step. But it shouldnât have taken that long.\n\nSemafor: If Hunter Bidenâs convicted of a crime, would you pardon him, if youâre president?\n\nPence: You know, Iâve actually pardoned people. Iâve been a governor. The only thing I can say is, I have a very high bar for pardons, and if there was an application by any American, weâd give it every consideration. But I wouldnât walk into the White House with an inclination to do that.\n\nSemafor: Do you support the strikes going on in Hollywood â the SAG strike, and the writersâ strike? In both, theyâre negotiating against the use of AI.\n\nPence: Well, look, itâs a free country. And the Screen Actors Guild has every right to engage in collective bargaining. But I will tell you, in a very broad sense, Iâm very concerned about AI, particularly when it comes to our national security. I met this week with a leading voice in technology and he told me that he shared the concern. Weâve got to be very careful about the role of AI in compromising intellectual property, and also compromising in the privacy of the American people and, ultimately, our national security. But Iâd leave it to the SAG members to figure out their agreement.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Can Mike Pence win the anti-abortion vote?\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nMike Pence is going all-in on the issue of abortion as he inches closer to a potential 2024 run, throwing his support behind strict legislation that could be a bridge too far for other Republicans. The former vice presidentâs team believes his genuine devotion to the cause could be a key differentiator if he hops into a crowded GOP field.\n\nâI donât think that there is another potential candidate that can rival his record on life,â one advisor told Semafor. âI donât think anybody has championed the issue as vocally as he has and prominently as he has.â\n\nPence has long been defined by his deeply devoted Christian conservatism, and since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade , his advocacy group, Advancing American Freedom, has backed a slew of anti-abortion bills. Theyâve included some of the countryâs most far-reaching proposals, such as the Life at Conception Act , that would extend protections to embryos by declaring that life begins at the moment an egg is fertilized.\n\nPenceâs advisor said his moves havenât been politically âcalculatedâ to outflank his potential 2024 opponents, and that heâd take these stances whether or not he was contemplating a presidential run. But his unapologetic position has already created a sharp contrast with his old boss Donald Trump.Â\n\nDespite having appointed the Supreme Court justices who ended Roe, the former president recently blamed hardline anti-abortion voters and politicians for hurting Republicans in the midterms. In an interview with the Daily Signal published Thursday, Pence said he âstronglyâ disagreed with Trumpâs comments and argued that candidates with a âââclear, unambiguous commitment to lifeâ did well in the last election cycle.\n\nIn this article:\n\nItâs unclear how many votes, or how much activist support, Pence will win by championing the movementâs every goal. So far, anti-abortion activists havenât been willing to set many explicit litmus tests for 2024 hopefuls, and have left open the possibility of backing a candidate who goes less far than the ex-VP.\n\nAs of now, the influential Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America has only drawn one clear red line for candidates: They must voice support for some kind of federal legislation restricting abortion.\n\nâIf they donât â¦ theyâre disqualified in our books,â warned Marilyn Musgrave, Vice President of Government Affairs at SBA. But her organization hasnât demanded that candidates support specific bills or bans after a certain number of weeks. Musgrave added that there would be numerous âgreat pro-life people running for president,â name dropping Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Trump.\n\nBrian Burch, president of CatholicVote.org, told Semafor that while Pence deserved credit for his stances, his recent maneuvers donât âautomatically transform the electoral landscape,â and that anti-abortion groups needed to assess candidates based on their records, as well their promises.\n\nâDonald Trump had some worrisome comments recently over the question of abortion, but of course his record speaks for itself, and I think speaks louder than anything that anyone has said,â Burch said.\n\nInstead of enforcing strict purity tests, the anti-abortion movementâs leaders mostly seem content for the moment to hang back with their endorsements, and encourage as many candidates as possible to move in their direction.\n\nâPro-life activists need to be careful and not fall for the media trap, which is: Letâs see how far we can get someone to go and then tar and feather any candidate not willing to explicitly do the same,â Burch said.\n\nIn his Daily Signal interview, Pence subtly hinted at his faith that he could pull anti-abortion voters off of Trump, no matter how much some might still like the former president. âTheir loyalty is to the cause of life,â he said. âNot to any particular candidate. And I think thatâs as it should be.â\n\nSome Republicans wish the party would let up a bit on the issue of abortion â particularly hardline stances like Pence is backing, which (like Trump) theyâve argued hurt GOP candidates in the midterms.\n\nâWe lost seats that we could have had because of some of the harsh stances on abortion that some in our party have taken,â Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C. recently told The Washington Post, adding that she raised âher frustrations internally with [House] leadershipâ upon learning that they planned to begin their first week in the majority by pushing through abortion bills.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Donald Trump - January 6 + Ronald Reagan = Mike Pence\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nANKENY, Iowa â Mike Pence entered the 2024 presidential race with sharp, direct criticism of Donald Trump, accusing his former running mate of betraying both conservatism and the Constitution.\n\nâAnyone who puts themselves over the Constitution should never be president of the United States,â Pence told a crowd at the Future Farmers of America building outside Des Moines. âAnyone who asks someone else to put them over the Constitution should never be president again.â\n\nSketching out his own vision for the country â from entitlement reform to protecting âthe God-given right to lifeâ â Pence promised to ârestore a threshold of civility to our politicsâ while pursuing a conservative agenda.\n\nâWe need leaders who can distinguish between starting fights and finishing them,â Pence said.\n\nA longtime culture warrior in his own right, he also made clear he wouldnât cede the debate to Ron DeSantis on social issues.\n\nâI stood before the woke brigades even before woke was a thing,â Pence said Wednesday.\n\nIn this article:\n\nPence is offering what many frustrated conservatives say theyâve long craved â the policies of the Trump years, with no place for Trump himself.\n\nHe spent a surprising amount of time condemning Trumpâs behavior on Jan. 6, far more aggressively in many ways than his public remarks in the aftermath of the riot itself. He made clear he would embrace the administrationâs record, while treating Trumpâs efforts to overturn the election as a red line âÂ a stance that could put pressure on other candidates to take a clearer position themselves.\n\nBut Pence also made the pitch that he was a more reliable Reagan-style conservative than Trump, saying that the former president was âretreating from the cause of the unbornâ and accusing him of echoing Joe Biden by refusing to tackle entitlement reform.\n\nâMikeâs proud of the record of the administration,â Marc Short, one of Penceâs senior advisors, told Semafor. âWhen Trump literally says, [abortion is] now on the negotiating table because of me â whatâs on the negotiating table? Which children live and which ones donât? I think thatâs going to be an important separation.â\n\nOn both issues, Trumpâs taken the position that polls best â letting states write their own abortion laws, and refusing to ever cut Medicare or Social Security. On the latter, Pence sounded more like former House Speaker Paul Ryan, whose politics have been abandoned by MAGA Republicans, than most Republicans running for president. And Trump abandoned those politics because Ryan, as the partyâs 2012 nominee for vice president, got clobbered.\n\nPence starts this race in a weaker position than most former vice presidents whoâve sought the presidency, few of whom ever challenged their running mates. (The last one to do it was John Nance Garner, who ran against FDR when the president sought a then-unprecedented third term in 1940.)\n\nTrumpâs decision to run deprives Pence of the biggest advantage that former vice presidents like Joe Biden or George H.W. Bush typically enjoy: A built-in base of support inherited from the president they served. And his break with Trump over his false election claims puts him on the other side of most Republican voters .\n\nShort argued that Republican primarygoers could be swayed away from Trump on this topic. He told Semafor that a recent focus group shared with Penceâs team, but not commissioned by them, found that participants understood and agreed with Penceâs actions regarding the 2020 election â but only after hearing Pence, in past speeches, lay out his side of the story.\n\nâPeople have been told one thing, but they havenât heard the other side,â Short said. âTheyâve heard it from mainstream media, but they havenât heard from a conservative perspective.â\n\nTrumpâs top rival, DeSantis, condemned the violence on January 6 at the time , but has said little about the topic overall and recently told an interviewer heâd consider pardons for people convicted in connection with the riot.\n\nIn polling of next yearâs Iowa caucuses, make-or-break for Pence, he polls in the low single digits, far behind Trump and DeSantis. In the March edition of the Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll, one in four GOP voters had an unfavorable view of Pence, higher than any other candidate.\n\nThe launch event was also smaller than the one DeSantis put together on his first stop here, when he filled a chapel and an overflow room. Some seats were reserved for Penceâs family friends whoâd come in from Indiana, and campaign staff kept the mood high with chants of âI Like Mike,â tossing campaign T-shirts past the red, white, and blue balloons in a room that fit less than 300 people. The password for the eventâs wifi was âKeptHisOath!â\n\nâIâve grown more and more impressed with Mr. Pence over the last several months. I was really impressed with his integrity over the January 6th incident and the way heâs conducted himself then and since,â 77-year-old Paul Cox said. âI thought his tone [today] was perfect. I thought he was very respectful of former President Trump, and yet he also made his case for the stance that he took.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nDES MOINES â Mike Pence said that President Biden took a âwelcome stepâ by acknowledging 4-year old Navy Roberts as his seventh grandchild â but that âit shouldnât have taken that long.â\n\nâLook, I became a grandfather three times over in the last two years,â Pence said, after his speech at the Republican Party of Iowaâs annual Lincoln Dinner on Friday. âFor all the difficulties in their family, I canât help but feel that the President has finally been willing to come to terms and be public with acknowledging all of his grandchildren.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nBiden had been more than reluctant to talk about Hunter Bidenâs daughter with Lunden Roberts, an Arkansas woman who had sued for child support after a DNA test proved that the presidentâs wayward son was Navyâs father. In a statement released to People magazine on Friday, Biden called the situation âa family matterâ that was being resolved, adding that he and First Lady Jill Biden âonly want what is best for all of our grandchildren, including Navy.â\n\nThat was new; Biden had refused to answer questions about the topic before. Four years ago, when Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy asked Biden about the paternity case, the future president referred to it as a âprivate matterâ and sarcastically called the reporter âclassyâ for asking. And as president, when the subject of his extended family came up, Biden would say he had six grandchildren, referring only to the two children of his late son, Beau, and the four children Hunter had with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle and current wife Melissa Cohen.\n\nSetting aside the personal and legal issues at play, the presidentâs approach to Hunterâs daughter became politically difficult during a child support dispute that was litigated in Arkansas last month. While Roberts and the younger Biden settled it out of court, the conflict drove more press attention to a story that had been covered extensively in conservative media but gingerly by mainstream outlets. The new coverage included a front page New York Times story with the detail that âseveral of the presidentâs allies fear that the case could damage his re-election prospects.â\n\nRepublican candidates had tread carefully around the topic, but that changed after the Times story, which preceded a brutal op-ed from the paperâs longtime columnist Maureen Dowd. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis hit back at some criticism from the Biden administration with a shot at the president for failing to âvisit his granddaughter.â At the Iowa GOP Dinner, two candidates â former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson â joked about Bidenâs refusal to say he had a seventh grandchild.\n\nâI know how many grandchildren I have,â said Hutchinson. âI have seven.â Haley made the story part of a joke about her suggestion that politicians over age 75 should be made to take mental acuity tests â with questions like âhow many grandchildren do you have?â\n\nThe People magazine story cited a source who framed Bidenâs extended refusal to engage with his granddaughter as partially driven by not wanting to interfere in her parentsâ extended court case â one that has now been resolved.\n\nPence sat down with Semafor on Friday to talk through a number of issues playing out in the GOP primary.

      "text": "Pence Is First VP to Run Against His Former Boss in 83 Years\n\nT he 2024 presidential campaign field, which already features the first former U.S. President ever to be criminally indicted , is about to get even more unprecedented. On Monday, Mike Pence filed paperwork to run for President, making him the first former Vice President to run against the President under whom he served in over 80 years, and only the third ever to do so. He will hold his first rally on Wednesday in Iowa , where the first Republican primary caucus will be held early next year.\n\n\"We haven't had anything like this before,\" says Joel Goldstein, an expert on the history of American Vice Presidents and law professor emeritus at Saint Louis University.\n\nThe earliest example of a sitting Vice President challenging a sitting President is arguably the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson challenged John Adams. In 1796, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were elected President and Vice President, though they were leaders of opposite parties. But the electoral system was completely different back then; the candidate with the most votes was elected President, and the candidate with the second most votes became Vice President. The 12th Amendment got rid of that system in 1804.\n\nThe closer parallel to the Trump-Pence situation is when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ran for a third term in 1940, and Vice President John Nance Garner challenged him for the Democratic nomination. Six years into the job, Garner-a Texan nicknamed \"Cactus Jack\"-came to represent a group of conservative Democrats who had grown disenchanted with FDR's liberal New Deal, which they believed expanded the role of the federal government too much. Nancy Beck Young, professor of History at the University of Houston, who consulted on a PBS documentary about Garner, tells TIME that Garner's \"biggest\" concerns were that the federal government was supporting auto workers striking against General Motors in Michigan and deficit spending, which he said needed to be reigned in. Garner also opposed FDR's effort to increase the number of justices on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nTIME magazine summed up the tensions in a Mar. 20, 1939, cover story on the intraparty split headlined \"undeclared war\": \"Party rebellion is no new thing in U.S. history...Rebellion by the substantial leaders of a party against their leader-in-chief is rarer. And the rebellion which John Nance Garner now leads is rarer still in that it is, save in small things, almost intangible-less a rebellion than a resistance. It is nonetheless the biggest political struggle now going on in Washington.\"\n\nAt the 1940 Democratic National Convention, FDR received 946 of the delegate votes, while Garner received 61. \"At the end of the day, Garner's challenge to FDR was not substantive,\" as Young puts it. Since the Nazis invaded Poland in September 1939, World War II was ramping up, and FDR's two terms as commander-in-chief made him the clear frontrunner. FDR was re-elected with Henry Wallace as his running mate, and Garner retired from public life.\n\nPence was the governor of Indiana when Trump asked him to be his running mate in 2016. The public split between the two men happened near the end of Trump's term, amid his efforts to overturn Joe Biden's election victory. Citing false claims of voter fraud, Trump asked Pence not to perform his constitutional duty and certify the 2020 election results on Jan. 6, 2021. Pence insisted he had no legal power to comply Trump's request, and as a riot of Trump supporters broke out at the Capitol, some chanted \"Hang Mike Pence.\"\n\nWhile Trump and Pence are both running to return to the White House, the race between Garner and FDR was different as both were running against each other while still in office. In addition, FDR was running for a third term-before the 22nd Amendment made that illegal in 1951-while Trump is eligible to serve a second term.\n\nSome analysts have called Pence's presidential bid a longshot . Goldstein says Vice Presidents who run for President are in a unique position, arguing, \"most Vice Presidents may have problems running for President. You inherit the baggage of your administration. You're perceived as being a follower, not a leader. But one of the advantages is that you tend to inherit the support of people in the administration and the supporters of the President.\"\n\nWith reporting by Melissa August\n\nWrite to Olivia B.

      "text": "Pence, Who Couldn't Derail Trump, Is Looking at Who Might\n\nThis article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME's politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nIt took him a beat longer than a lot of folks, but former Vice President Mike Pence got there eventually-and, perhaps significantly, early enough to force his fellow Republicans to take a clear-eyed look at their party and its trajectory.\n\n\"It's become clear to me: This is not my time,\" Pence told donors in Las Vegas on Saturday. The audience, of course, gasped, a reaction similar to the one Mitt Romney drew in 2008 when he announced the end of his bid at CPAC. Pence suspended his campaign and took a not-so-veiled swipe at his former boss, ex-President Donald Trump: \"I urge all my fellow Republicans here, give our country a Republican standard bearer that will, as Lincoln said, appeal to the better angels of our nature.\" He then added that the nominee should be someone who can lead the country with \"civility.\"\n\nPence becomes the first major candidate to exit the GOP chase of the deeply uncivil Trump. Pressure is being applied behind the scenes for others to follow suit. When Ted Cruz was the last non-Trump Republican standing eight years ago, many held their nose and rallied behind him. By then , it was too late .\n\nIt might be too late now. Trump is faring better today than even when he was on the cusp of the nomination in 2016, when the highest he ever got was 49% support in the final CNN poll, released the first week of May 2016. Today, the former President has been consistently parked north of 50% since April. Even if everyone not named Trump joined forces like a super Transformer robot on Team Ron DeSantis, they still cannot overtake Trump.\n\nWhich presents a two-fold challenge for Pence, the committed conservative who has said Trump must \"never\" be allowed to return to power. Most immediately, his advisers say Pence is considering his options for an endorsement of a one-time rival. He is likely to pray on the decision and consider who is most plausible to block Trump from the nomination.\n\nBut in the most likely scenario, with that last-ditch effort failing and Trump becoming the GOP nominee for a third time, Pence will be faced with how to use his remaining political capital. Backing Trump would be viewed as a blatant betrayal of his longtime supporters not to mention his ideals, while stopping short-or the least likely scenario, endorsing Joe Biden-would seem to leave his relatively new fans in a lurch. While Pence was well known before 2016 among conservatives, he wasn't exactly a household name more broadly. But he's not exactly ready to shelve his ambition for one more promotion. And a last-ditch effort by Pence to stop Trump might actually animate the very forces he's trying to short-circuit. The heart may be in the right mode but the technique may be slightly off.\n\nFor his part, Pence has been consistent in his measured critique of Trump, a larger-than-life figure inside the GOP and a dream Republican nominee inside some Democratic circles. During their arranged political marriage in 2016, Pence understood the tradeoffs incumbent on linking arms with someone whose own sense of right and wrong were anathema to Pence's deep Christianity. If Trump was an archetype of pompous, Pence was the answer in piety.\n\nAs a running mate, Pence was reluctant to defend Trump. He focused his efforts during his lone 2016 debate to protect his own reputation in case Trump lost. When the famous Access Hollywood tape threatened to detonate the entire Trump-Pence ticket, Pence benched himself for a day to consider just how much of a role he wanted to play in putting Trump in control of all of America's might.\n\nStill, Trump seemed to forgive it all. \"One of my great decisions in life was choosing Mike Pence to be my running mate,\" Trump told TIME after his 2016 election. \"He is truly a high-quality human being, first class in every respect. He is also a talented politician who loves people and wants to help them every step of the way.\"\n\nThat view-like so many of Trump's-quickly shifted when loyalty seemed to dry up.\n\nPence's experience on Jan. 6, 2021, cemented his antipathy toward Trump and Trumpism. While Pence was pinned down at the Capitol as Congress tried to certify the Trump-Pence ticket's defeat in 2020, his boss did little to quell a rabid mob that he had encouraged to march to Capitol Hill. Pence has been critical of various people's actions that day, although not so much as to offend the party base he presumably thought he could win as converts. Pence picked targets smartly during last year's midterms and collected chits that could have come in handy.\n\nUltimately, though, campaigns need cash and backers, and Pence came up in short supply on both. Trump's chokehold on the GOP has proven more durable than even some of his supporters had expected. The NeverTrump lane of the primary has been dominated by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson; neither of them has ever broken into double-digits. Others who have been strategic in their criticism like Trump's former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley , Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, and tech investor Vivek Ramaswamy of Ohio have similarly struggled to make the move into the top tier. Haley has been the most viable to emerge as an alternative to DeSantis, and next week's debate in Miami may afford her one of her last primetime chances to prove to the GOP it doesn't actually have to stomach Trump or a MAGA clone.\n\nPence refused to engage in any of the shenanigans that help with money and polling. Having lost his first two bids for office after running, by his own admission, mean-spirited and bare-knuckled campaigns, he swore off negative campaigning. But since launching in June, Pence raised just $3.3 million; only Hutchinson has raised less. He ended September with $1.2 million banked, a debt of $620,000, and a $150,000 hole in his own checkbook for his self-financing-all with fewer than 100 days until Iowa, where even his advisers concede things were not going as planned as evangelicals seemed enthralled with a return to Trump. Looking downstream, deadlines are quickly approaching for getting on other states' election calendars, and those filings are not cheap.\n\nAttending the former VP's events were like a flashback to another era, but not altogether in a bad way. His operations have always been polished, dating to his days as then-House Speaker John Boehner's \"conservative whisperer.\" He counts some of the sharpest minds in the Republican Party as parts of his brain trust-and, unusual for Washington, he actually listened to their advice. Even among the K Street crowd that finds his Christian lens for governing a bit saccharine, they still take his call because they know he is coming through the door in good faith. He's definitely from another era, but certainly not one in which staying seated when a woman walks into a room is acceptable.\n\nA 12-year veteran of the House, a one-term Governor of Indiana, and Trump's VP simply didn't get him across the credibility threshold. As TIME's Alex Altman wrote the day Trump selected Pence: \"Pence is a foreign policy hawk with ironclad fiscal credentials, a squeaky-clean image, and extensive ties to the religious right. And while he's more comfortable in the church pews than the C-suite, he's also a favorite of super-rich GOP donors like the billionaire Koch brothers, who have so far refused to crack open their wallets for Trump.\" Those, it turns out, are no longer sufficient qualities in a GOP that seems obsessed with celebrity, culture wars, and embracing incivility over inspiration. That, it has to be said, should be a warning gong for a party that may end up celebrating a soon-to-be-felon at its convention in Milwaukee this summer.\n\nOr beyond.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington.

      "text": "From Taunts and Lies to an Angry Mob: Jan. 6 Panel Details Trump's Pressure Campaign Against Pence\n\nO n the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, Mike Pence was praying with his staff inside the Vice Presidential residence at the Naval Observatory compound in Washington. They knew it was going to be a difficult day, so they asked for wisdom and guidance. That's when President Trump called.\n\nTrump was berating Pence for continuing to maintain that the Vice President had no legal power to reject the Electoral College votes in Congress later that day, a move that would have handed Trump the election. White House staff and family members around Trump in the Oval Office during his call with Pence described to the Jan. 6 committee how Trump's tone got \"heated.\" Trump called Pence a \"wimp\" and \"the P-word,\" witnesses said, and told Pence he had made the wrong decision picking Pence for Vice President.\n\nPence came back to the prayer circle looking \"steely,\" \"determined\" and \"grim,\" recalled Pence's legal counsel Greg Jacob. The day would only get harder for the Vice President.\n\nThroughout Thursday's hearing of the House Select Committee investigating the attack on the Capitol, witnesses laid out how Trump pressured Pence in public and private to try and overturn the election. That campaign, the committee argued, included Trump recklessly endangering Pence's life.\n\nHours before the Capitol attack, Trump riled up his supporters at a rally on the Ellipse near the White House. Officials involved testified to the committee that Trump ad-libbed lines about Pence in the speech, saying \"If Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election,\" and \"I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do and I hope he doesn't listen to the RINOS and the stupid people that he's listening to.\"\n\nThe pressure continued as the day progressed. Witnesses testified that Trump had been told a violent mob had breached the Capitol before he tweeted at 2:24 pm that Pence \"didn't have the courage to do what was necessary.\" The committee showed video of Trump supporters on the steps of the Capitol reading Trump's tweet aloud, their anger growing at the Vice President, who they believed had \"betrayed\" Trump. The committee then showed video of the crowd chanting \"hang Mike Pence\" and a noose set up outside the Capitol building.\n\nSarah Matthews, a former deputy press secretary under Trump, described in taped testimony seeing Trump's tweet about Pence and thinking Trump \"was pouring gasoline on the fire.\"\n\nBased on video evidence of where the mob had penetrated the building, the committee determined that rioters had gotten within 40 feet of Pence as he was evacuating from the Senate chamber to an underground loading dock in the Capitol complex where his motorcade was staged, according to Rep. Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat on the committee.\n\n\"Make no mistake about the fact the vice president's life was in danger,\" Aguilar said.\n\nOnce Pence reached the underground parking structure, he declined instructions by the Secret Service to load into his motorcade. \"The Vice President had refused to get into the car,\" Jacob recalled. Pence, Jacob said, \"did not want to take any chance that the world would see the Vice President fleeing the Capitol.\" Pence waited in that underground location for more than two hours while rioters roamed the Capitol building, some of them looking specifically for him. It had been a close call. The committee also showed snippets of an affidavit from an FBI informant who said members of the Proud Boys had intended to kill Pence if they had found him that day.\n\nAs he waited for the riot unfolding above him to end, Pence was in contact with the acting secretary of defense. He also checked on the safety of other officials. But throughout the ordeal, Trump did not contact his Vice President. Pence and his wife, Karen Pence, expressed \"frustration\" that Trump hadn't checked on their safety, Jacob said.\n\nPence stayed in the Capitol Building until the Senate Chamber had been cleared of the mob.\n\nLater that night, Pence resumed the only activity he had the power to do under the Constitution, which was to preside over the congressional counting of the Electoral College tallies as they were sent by the states. At 3:46 a.m., he formally declared the presidential election for Biden.\n\nFor weeks Pence had been getting legal advice and had determined that the framers of the Constitution, after revolting against the tyranny of King George and creating a government based on the separation of powers, would not have intended for the Vice President to be able to influence the outcome of a presidential election. Marc Short, Pence's chief of staff, said that was what Pence believed when he met with Trump on Jan. 5, the day before the riot. Yet soon after that meeting, Trump dictated a statement saying Pence believed he had the power to overturn the election results. Short said Trump's statement was a lie.\n\nThe committee showed video testimony of Trump's aide Jason Miller saying Trump himself dictated the Jan. 5 statement. \"He dictated most of it,\" Miller told the committee. \"Ultimately the way this came out was the way he wanted it to.\" Despite Trump lying about Pence's view of his role in a public statement, the Vice President didn't succumb to the pressure, a decision that multiple committee members praised on Thursday.\n\n\"Our system nearly failed and our democratic foundation nearly failed,\" Rep. Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming and the committee's vice chair, said during Thursday's hearing. \"Trump's pressure campaign to stop the electoral count did not end with Vice President Pence-it targeted every tier of federal and state elected officials.\"\n\nWhile waiting in the secure location under the Capitol complex, Pence's legal counsel Jacobs recalled reading his Bible about Daniel refusing an order from the Babylonian king. \"I felt that's what played out that day,\" Jacob said.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "'It's Clear He's Going to Testify': Pence Has Central Role in Trump's Prosecution\n\nO ut of all the Republican presidential candidates, none may pose a greater threat to Donald Trump's future than Mike Pence. That's not because the former Vice President is mounting much of a challenge for the GOP nomination. He's trailing Trump by nearly 50 points in the polls. It's because Pence may be the most important witness in Special Counsel Jack Smith's prosecution against Trump for trying to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nIn a four-count, 45-page indictment unsealed on Tuesday, federal prosecutors alleged that Trump knowingly spread lies of a stolen election and engaged in an illicit, multi-faceted effort to remain in power. A substantial portion of Smith's case hinges on the former President's pressure campaign against Pence leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of rioters disrupted the Congressional certification of the Electoral College.\n\nIn one of their phone calls in the days before the attack, Trump allegedly told Pence that he was \"too honest\" after his second-in-command refused to unilaterally reject the election results. In another, Pence called Trump on Christmas Day to wish him a happy holiday, but the President quickly turned the conversation to Jan. 6, pressing his Veep to nullify Joe Biden's election victory. Prosecutors drew both scenes-which until now have not been part of the public record-from contemporaneous notes that Pence provided to the Special Counsel.\n\nThe revelations reflect the unprecedented scenario revolving around Pence, who is not only running against his old boss for the 2024 GOP nomination, but serving as a central player in the prosecution against the President under whom he served.\n\n\"It's clear he's going to testify,\" Harry Litman, a former U.S. Attorney, tells TIME. \"Pence is the most integral fact witness. He was the sitting Vice President of the United States. It's an extremely dramatic moment-I'd say even a historic one-for the former Vice President to take the stand. That will be a seismic moment in what's already the most important prosecution in U.S. history.\"\n\nAfter a lengthy investigation, the Special Counsel brought four charges against Trump, including conspiracy to defraud the government, conspiracy against the right to vote, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, and obstruction of an official proceeding.\n\nShortly after the Jan. 6 indictment was announced on Tuesday, Pence differentiated himself from many other prominent Republicans, who were quick to characterize Trump's latest legal setback as part of a \"deep-state\" conspiracy to prevent him from reclaiming the White House. \"Today's indictment serves as an important reminder: anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be President of the United States,\" Pence said in a statement.  \"On Jan. 6, former President Trump demanded that I choose between him and the Constitution. I chose the Constitution and I always will.\"\n\nFor months, Pence has said that Trump will be held accountable in the eyes of history for his role on Jan. 6. But he has not explicitly said whether he would testify against the former President who egged on his supporters who stormed the Capitol that day chanting \"Hang Mike Pence.\" The two have not spoken since Trump left office. Despite their falling out, Trump has told associates in recent weeks to hold their fire against Pence, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. \"He's kind of left Mike Pence alone,\" a source close to Trump tells TIME. \"Even on the documents stuff, he was telling people to leave Mike Pence alone,\" referring to the former Vice President having discovered classified materials in his Indiana home in January, which he turned over to the FBI.\n\n\"I feel badly for Mike Pence, who is attracting no crowds, enthusiasm, or loyalty from people who, as a member of the Trump Administration, should be loving him,\" Trump posted Wednesday on his social media platform Truth Social, adding \"The V.P. had power that Mike didn't understand.\"\n\nTrump is more offended by Ron DeSantis, the source says, who is running against him after Trump's endorsement helped to secure his GOP nomination for Florida Governor five years ago. \"With Pence, it's more of a principles thing. Trump respects that he has some values to an extent. But he sees DeSantis as a power-grabbing, brazen, disloyal rat. I think that's the difference.\"\n\nTrump's fiercest allies have cast Smith's prosecution as the manifestation of a political witch hunt. Pence's role in the indictment, they say, is part of a ploy to divide the GOP. \"The whole Mike Pence strategy is to drive a wedge between Republicans,\" Mike Davis, a Trump confidante who founded the conservative Article III Project, tells TIME. \"It's not illegal for President Trump to put pressure on his Vice President to not certify the election. Some people might think it's boorish, but that doesn't make it a felony.\" Davis, who speaks to Trump regularly, also said that he doesn't hold an ongoing personal animus against Pence. \"I don't think there's any ill will between Trump and Pence. He sees Mike Pence as a boy scout, and Trump's used to dealing with New York construction crews.\"\n\nThe indictment is the latest in a long string of Trump's legal woes. He's also facing charges from a separate special counsel investigation by Smith alleging he hoarded national-security secrets and obstructed the government's efforts to retrieve them. In New York, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg indicted Trump in April over allegations that he falsified business records to conceal hush-money payments to a porn star.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump is set to appear before U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan , a 2014 Obama appointee, in Washington, D.C. Smith's prosecutors are expected to seek a speedy trial. That's why some legal experts suspect the indictment listed six unnamed co-conspirators but did not indict any of them-hoping a lean indictment focused on Trump would have a better chance of making it to trial before the November 2024 election. Some also suspect that Smith will try to flip some of those alleged co-conspirators in the weeks to come.\n\nYet legal experts believe that Pence's testimony would carry more weight than most others. \"There are witnesses in Mr. Trump's other cases that have real credibility issues,\" says Anna Cominsky, a professor at New York Law School. \"There are potential witnesses in this case that have credibility issues. Former Vice President Pence is certainly someone who comes across with a lot of credibility. If Pence were to testify, it would be much harder for the defense attorneys to attack his credibility.\"\n\nIt's the reason Pence poses more of a danger to Trump in a courtroom than on the campaign trail. \"The biggest threat is Trump to himself,\" Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor and Democratic U.S. Senator, tells TIME. \"It is and always has been, but obviously, he has put Mike Pence in a position where he will be a central character in any prosecution going forward. I don't think Mike Pence chose to be in that position. But he will take it and he will deal with it.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Pence Challenges GOP to Ditch Trump's Populism for Reagan-Era Conservatism\n\nThis article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME's politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nThere's a dividing line in the Republican Party, and you can find it right around 1975. That's the year when a former Governor of California decided to challenge a sitting President of his own party and remake the entire GOP.\n\nWelcome to Ronald Reagan's reboot. While most of the Republican field will be sure to invoke the Gipper in a few weeks when they travel to his resting place in Simi Valley, Calif., for their second debate, one of the contenders got something of a headstart on Wednesday, using a speech in New Hampshire to renew rivalries born out of Cold War necessity.\n\nSpeaking at Saint Anselm College on the outskirts of Manchester, former Vice President Mike Pence rang the gong of old-school conservatism like only a former radio host could, channeling Ol' Ronnie just enough. And it signaled, in an ever-so-nuanced way, that the fight in 2024 had plenty of echoes to 1976's race: a powerful de facto incumbent was not inevitable, the party favorite may still prevail but deserves a challenge, and a reboot of the party is at foot even if its footing is unsteady at the moment.\n\n\"Should the new populism of the right seize and guide our party, the Republican Party as we have long known it will cease to exist,\" Pence said on campus, doing his best Thatcherite channeling. \"And the fate of American freedom would be in doubt.\"\n\nAs much as Democrats want 2024 to be a fight over the fate of a post- Roe world and a microchip economy and a skid into life-after- Putin or - Xi , it may well be the contest that is dictated by the confines of era when David Bowie topped the charts. The ghosts of the post-Watergate era haunt the current Republican Party, and there's no reason to think anything loyalists can expunge those spirits. The fondue is hot, the leggings are tight, and the rhetoric is hotter-even if the colors from those original VHS cassettes were fading.\n\nEverything old is new again, and everything new is too newfangled. Which is perfect proving ground for Pence, whose posture on Wednesday was one he had been inching toward for over a year.\n\nWith an ex-President trying to mount a comeback far more audacious than anything Dick Nixon imagined with his David Frost interviews, the Republican Party is being forced to face a gut check of its own making. Sure, Trump is a fundraising behemoth , but he's also a pugilistic bully . For every comma he adds to the red-hatted ledger, he adds a scarlet demerit for decency. No one really knows what cardinal ordinance this march is heading toward.\n\nAnd this is where Pence matters. For all of his self-righteous bluster and his indulgent image of himself as a guardian of the high ground, Pence remains an unimpeachable (and unimpeached ) weathervane of the conservative movement. During his first tour of Washington as a member of Congress, Pence was the baseline for conservative orthodoxy. In Leadership, he was House Republicans' gut check on whether a notion was sufficiently fair game. Never one to scream, his side eye could scuttle any idea well before it made its way to the clerks, the bean counters, or pollsters.\n\nYears later, Pence-and particularly his testimony-may be what saves the modern Republican Party from re-nominating Trump, a criminal defendant for all and political pariah for much of this country. As Trump's lieutenant for four years-and target-for-lynching for a day back on Jan. 6 -Pence has an inside track on what went down that terrifying day at the Captiol, when deputized political thugs of the then-President tried to subvert democracy to keep Trump in power.\n\nBut that quality-his unbending fealty to the Constitution and wise counsel that told him he couldn't heed Trump's demands to, at best, bend the law-may also be his undoing politically. Pence is at the fore, but only of the second tier. He is still polling in single digits with no real obvious moment to break out of that slump. He has tried to embrace the legacy of the Trump record without saddling himself with everything unseemly about the era. For a devout man devoid of vice, Pence is trying to have his cake and eat it, too.\n\nPence's new pitch paints Trump as a populist on par with the likes of Howard Dean or Bobby Kennedy. Pence argues he and Trump governed from a crouch of conservatism but that Trump elected to a second term would be unmoored, unable to promise that he'd go forward with such an instinct. Implicit in the caution: Voters don't know what version of Trumpism they'd be buying in 2024. And, without Pence as a guardrail V.P., they can't risk it.\n\nPence, ultimately, may not matter. He's a well-funded polling trailer at the moment, and his very, very smart team hasn't yet cracked how to break the Republican Party's fervent fever dream of Trumpist hallucinations. Pence is as strong as a true conservative as the field could be at the moment, but he's punching up, up, up. Once the mob sought him out for the gallows on Jan. 6, Pence's political fate may have been sealed.\n\nStill, it's not for nothing that Pence showed up to tell his fellow conservatives that they don't have to be hostage to Trumpism. As much as the Republican Party ambled into Gerald Ford in the wake of Nixon's resignation-and the half-century of consternation that followed his scandals of his own making-there is still a chunk of this country that holds the ideological ground for it. Trumpism may dominate the GOP, but it isn't the only identity that can flourish on the right. Pence may well be on a doomed mission to win the nomination, but his goal may be more important, more idealized: to remind Republicans that there was an era before the populist, Trumpian bullhorn; there once was a mild-mannered man from the Midwest (Reagan from Illinois, Pence from Indiana) who remade the GOP in his conservative image. The party may yet survive.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C. Brief newsletter .\n\nWrite to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com"

      "text": "Mike Pence Is Trying to Clear a Lane For Himself in a Party Exhausted by Trump\n\nThis article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME's politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nAs Mike Pence arrived at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, with a retinue of aides packed into the fast-moving motorcade, the Vice President turned in the back of his armored suburban to his daughter with a mix of frustration and compassion for the thousands of people already gathered at the East Front of the building. \"God bless those people,\" he told Charlotte Pence. \"They're gonna be so disappointed.\"\n\nThus begins a harrowing climax to the former Vice President's memoirs, released Tuesday and chronicling plenty of contradictions in his rise to power. So Help Me God is the most complete and credible defense to date of the Trump administration's four years in power from one of its senior members. Pence writes much of his story through the lens of his most natural constituency, white Evangelicals, and a close reader can find ample efforts to persuade that demographic away from the ex-President.\n\nClocking in at more than 500 pages, Pence's missive is as much about what has come before as what may come after. He describes in detail how he came to sign up with a presidential nominee whose temperament could hardly have been more anathema to the Bible-quoting former Rush-Limbaugh-on-Decaf, as Pence likes to describe his days on talk radio. But it's clear the Indiana Republican had not shelved his ambitions then and seems primed now to launch his own 2024 White House bid, regardless of what Trump may do Tuesday night in Florida. With many in the party blaming Trump for a disappointing showing last week, the prospect of Pence as a Trump-without-baggage option could find receptive ears-as long as there is sufficient respect for the father of the movement.\n\nPence seems keenly aware of the limits of the MAGA movement's transference, let alone his turn-key ability to harness it. Meeting with Trump in the Oval Office on Jan. 5, 2021, as crowds were already gathering for the rally the next day, the President told his understudy that \"those people love us.\" Pence, without missing a beat, replied factually: \"Those people love you, Mr. President.\" At a follow-up meeting, Trump didn't quite seem to understand what he had created or unleashed: \"Those people who broke into the Capitol might've been supporters, but they are not our movement,\" Pence writes he told Trump.\n\nAnd when asked by ABC News this week if Trump should serve again as President, Pence was as diplomatic as ever: \"I think that's up to the American people. But I think we'll have better choices in the future.\"\n\nPence never overtly suggests Trump's followers are misled in their devotion in his book. But he hints at times that Trump is not the populist he sells himself as on the trail. For instance, Pence writes that Trump heard about \"the forgotten man\" over an audition breakfast in Indianapolis where the nominee jotted down the phrase-taken from a much-discussed economic history of the Great Depression by the same name-on a napkin. It became a staple of the campaign messaging and even found its way into Trump's inaugural address. And after one of their final meetings at the White House, Trump seemed eager to be done with Pence, who urged Trump to find time to pray.\n\nThe modern Republican Party is highly unlikely to nominate an openly NeverTrump pick for much of anything. But there are establishment-minded conservatives who have had it with the current state of the GOP. Pence has long counted friends in that corner of the party, as well as its religious camp, possibly making him a suitable compromise in 2024. It certainly helps to explain how Trump and his team wound up selecting Pence over options that were more closely aligned with Trump's style of antagonism.\n\nPence's book on its own is unlikely to break the fever of the current Republican Party, but it could shake Trump's seemingly invincibility among the white Evangelicals who somehow believe a thrice-married New York billionaire accused of a whole raft of improprieties is one of them. Pence starts each chapter with a Bible quote, peppers in Scripture in explaining his choices, and has the steady zeal of a preacher that might splinter the faithful from The Donald. Pence even implies divine intervention in describing how he beat expectations on the first two holes at Trump National during his tryout as VP: \"It was proof of the existence of God.\"\n\nAll of which is why reading So Help Me God has utility in understanding how at least some in the GOP see the path to power in a post-2020 world, one in which election denialism can help a candidate win Trump's endorsement but not necessarily a seat with any power. Pence does little to dispel the thesis that Trump has taken the Republican Party hostage-a notion TIME's Brian Bennett explores smartly here -but the former VP does chip away at some of its grouting, although readers definitely have to search for it.\n\nFor instance, Pence says Trump was wrong to criticize Khizr and Ghazala Khan, two Gold Star parents who were supporters of Hillary Clinton in 2016: \"No Gold Star family will ever be\" fair game, Pence writes. He also says Trump erred in picking his then-buddy Jeff Sessions as Attorney General given Sessions' involvement in a campaign-era meeting with the Russian ambassador and subsequent obfuscation about it. Pence similarly writes with frustration about how Trump directly contradicted Pence's denial that the decision to fire then-FBI Director James Comey had anything to do with the investigations into Russia.\n\nAll of those moments leave readers reminded of Trump's character flaws, where petty grievance and transactional needs triumph over soul-deep beliefs. Put another way, character matters, and Trump's may not be compatible with those in the party exhausted of excuse-making for Trump's excesses.\n\nBut Pence also dutifully defends some of Trump's most notorious moments that rile up conservatives such as visiting Lafayette Square after protesters had overrun the stretch north of the White House. Pence is technically correct when he says he \"watched as the media went wild, suggesting that the U.S. Park Police had tear-gassed protesters\"; an inspector-general report, however, found D.C. police had, in fact, used tear gas that day, and that Park Police had on previous days but not at that moment. He takes a similar stance when defending Trump's response to the Covid-19 pandemic: \"I know we saved millions of lives,\" Pence writes. (Some 377,000 Americans died by the end of 2020, although many conservatives to this day think the numbers are overblown and the government-especially Dr. Anthony Fauci-overstated the threats.)\n\nThus is the perhaps-accidental brilliance of Pence's book: he isn't wrong, but he isn't entirely forthcoming in his accounting for his time. Pence is a seasoned pol, having risen in House leadership before moving into the Indiana governor's mansion, a perch from which his socially conservative policies made him simultaneously a star on the right and a threat on the left. Anyone questioning Pence's assertions can quickly Google to find that he's accurate in his specific words but missing the larger Truth with a capital T. It's a classic wink-and-a-nod posture so common in political memoirs, where readers can find what they need. Pence has clearly mastered it, at one point saying Trump complained that Pence was \"too honest\" in describing the 2020 results.\n\nWhile So Help Me God is hardly a love letter to Trump, Pence still carries plenty of water for Trumpism throughout. He calls Rep. Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman who played a key role in both of Trump's impeachments, a peddler of \"misinformation,\" and defends Trump's embrace of Vladimir Putin as part of the former's effort to appear \"to be on welcoming terms with all world leaders.\"\n\nIt may be a lesson Pence learned in his four years at Trump's side: perception matters more than facts, and just maybe Pence is developing his own off-label brand of Trumpism, where two contradicting realities can exist and each can be deployed when helpful. Describing a meeting with Trump five days after protesters pinned Pence and his family in a loading dock under the Capitol, the VP says Trump expressed regret for how things unfolded. \"It's too terrible to end like this,\" Trump told Pence during a 90-minute session, in Pence's sympathetic telling. And Pence replied of his presidency: \"It's not over yet.\"\n\nThat sentiment describes to this day Trump's hold on the GOP-and Pence's quiet intention to break it.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington.

      "text": "Mike Pence's Secret Service Agents Thought They Might Not Survive Jan. 6\n\nThis article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME's politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nThe Secret Service is perhaps the most elite security force in the world, a group of trained professionals whose skills are matched only by their finely honed and celebrated paranoia. If you can picture a worst-case scenario, there are terrific odds that the team that lives on earpiece vibrations can beat your dystopian fantasy. It's literally their job to ask what can possibly go wrong and then shift course to ensure their charges can make it through another day. If their issue wants to visit a war zone, the Secret Service can, with sufficient warning, get the package in and out before potential threats even know they're in the theater. When those in the backseats are the President, Vice President, their families and-at times-their senior staffers, there's not a lot of room for simply hoping for the best. Success is the only acceptable option.\n\nThis is why the testimony heard Thursday night about the Secret Service agents assigned to protect Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, 2021, is as shocking as it is terrifying. The Jan. 6 committee used part of its second primetime hearing to play audio from a White House security official who described how those agents thought they were about to die as a mob of supporters of President Donald Trump inched closer to the office in the Capitol where they were hiding.\n\n\"Members of the V.P. detail at this time were starting to fear for their own lives. There was a lot of yelling-a lot of very personal calls over the radio. It was very disturbing. I don't like talking about it,\" the official, who was provided anonymity to be candid, told the committee. \"There were calls to say goodbye to family members. For whatever reason on the ground, the V.P. detail thought that this was about to get very ugly.\"\n\n\"About to get very ugly.\" At the U.S. Capitol. During what should have been a routine rubber-stamp of the 2020 election results. Panicked calls from the House Republican Leader to the President, and later his kids. The Speaker of the House and Senate Majority Leader bunkered down and asking for a security assessment of their fiefdom from the Pentagon's chief. The President trying to hijack his motorcade and, when that failed, keeping it idling in the White House drive as he searched for a single yes man to let him head to the Hill. If you're an adherent of America First political ideology, such a stab to the country's standing as a functioning republic runs quite counter to the slogan.\n\nTo be crystal clear: Nothing about that day was normal, and the bipartisan group of House lawmakers trying to get to its bottom isn't leaving any stones unturned. In fact, it now seems like the plans of wrapping up their query by the end of this month may slip -and for good reason.\n\nAs committee members and staffers learn more, they have more questions . Why , for instance, wouldn't Trump admit the election was over even on Jan. 7? Why was he vamping on a recorded video and resisting his scripted call for peace? Ultimately, what responsibility does Trump have for a day that left him mostly sitting on the sidelines as he literally watched TV coverage of the violence unfolding in his backyard? And to what end ?\n\nMost Americans have long assumed that the shell that the Secret Service builds around its protectees is impenetrable-even if agents have proven in recent years capable of epic failures in judgment and, in recent days, been shown to mount a colossal bungling of its own records.\n\nThe testimony aired Thursday evening of the agents' state of mind, coupled with the footage from that day of a scurrying Pence, laid bare the very real risk the presidential backup faced. Such a flaking of confidence is not only bad for the Secret Service. It's bad for the projection of America's might.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee has already crushed expectations. The narrative around that failed insurrection is being preserved in testimony and evidence. While it's easy for Trumpists to shout nuh-uh when confronted with the facts, the committee has the receipts. For a brief time Thursday night, House Republicans even used their main Twitter account to attack a Republican Hill staffer testifying against her former boss-proving once again that the GOP is making a short-term bet on appeasing Trump over getting right by history.\n\nFor much of Washington, the fragile nature of democracy on Jan. 6 has an uneasy echo to the days after the Sept. 11 attacks. The country's arrogance on 9/11 melted-briefly-as one brand of extremism sought to humble Americans. It isn't a stretch to think a similar radicalization primer found receptive ears 20 years later in the homegrown extremists bent on derailing Americans' exercise of democratic norms.\n\nAnd with the Secret Service now confirmed to have feared that it might not have been able to defend the Vice President from a lynching, yet another stress fracture in American confidence emerges.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington.

      "text": "The Persistent Passion of Vice President Mike Pence\n\nL ike everyone else in official Washington, Vice President Mike Pence sometimes struggles to keep track of what is happening inside the White House. So he knew people would be closely watching when he traveled north on May 20 to deliver a commencement address for graduates of Pennsylvania's Grove City College, a devoutly Christian school where chapel attendance is mandatory and federal student aid is rejected, freeing the institution to ignore nondiscrimination laws.\n\n\"Servant leadership, not selfish ambition, must be the animating force of the career that lies before you,\" Pence told the graduates. The words were cribbed from his evangelical beliefs, but they also described the mission that Pence has adopted for himself, as the only person in President Donald Trump's West Wing orbit who cannot be fired. \"Don't fear criticism,\" the Vice President continued. \"Have the humility to listen to it. Learn from it. And most importantly, push through it. Persistence is the key.\"\n\nPersistence in the face of criticism has been a central tenet of the 10 months Pence has spent at Trump's side. He wields incredible influence within the Administration and has leveraged his deep relationships in town to help the President, guiding him through much of the haggling over a left-for-dead Obamacare replacement in the House and helping steer a number of executive moves that were cheered by groups that oppose abortion and promote Christian education.\n\nIt hasn't all been smooth. At least twice, he has allowed himself to be dispatched to dispute stories with facts that are later shown to be incomplete at best. He wrongly trusted National Security Adviser Mike Flynn's denial that he had been in touch with his Russian counterparts. Pence was later left out to dry when he tried to defend the President's decision to can FBI Director James Comey.\n\nThe risk for Pence is that standing too close to Trump could hobble his political future. The Vice President is 57 years old, and his advisers doubt this is his last role in public life, even as they rightly cast talk of Trump's impeachment or resignation as far-fetched. In fact, they recently helped him start a political action committee to help him boost his profile.\n\n\"He needs to get a leftover tightrope from Ringling Bros., because that's what he has to walk-between being a good soldier, helping fight for the President and his agenda, while also keeping his distance from the whole Russia mess,\" said Michael Steel, a Republican strategist and former top spokesman to then House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nTo date, Pence has followed the advice he offered the graduates, hunkering down, reaffirming his loyalty and modesty, serving the man who elevated him from the Indiana governor's mansion to the White House. His advisers say the public embarrassments haven't registered with voters, especially Trump's loyal supporters.\n\nNor have the stumbles made Pence any less in demand. Though he did not travel overseas with the President, he is often Trump's companion back home, sharing meals with the President and spending hours in the Oval Office. Lobbyists who want to meet with Pence find it wise to clear several hours to fit in a 10-minute chat, since there is always a good chance Trump will ask him to an unscheduled meeting or photo op. So they wait on the red couches in the White House lobby or the gold-and-blue armchairs in Pence's West Wing suite, believing that the inconvenience is worth it.\n\nPence very much needs to stay in the President's good graces in order to speak on his behalf. In recent weeks alone, he has been trying to cajole the House to take up a White House-backed version of tax reform, pushing the Senate to take the next steps to scrap Obamacare and leaning on the entire Congress to make good on the promise to pass an actual, honest-to-goodness budget that does more than punt hard choices to the next fiscal year. Amid it all, he is on his cell phone with lawmakers who want to check in on this parochial issue or that, knowing Pence will always take the call from friends, old and new alike.\n\nIt keeps Pence busy, as well as focused on what is possible. Fighting with Trump is seldom a wise course, and you don't change a 70-year-old man. Trying to settle scores in this leak-prone White House is a losing proposition. So Pence dutifully pads to the end of the hallway when called, makes one turn and finds himself in the Oval showroom where the President entertains guests during freewheeling conversations that drive schedulers and political advisers bonkers. Pence is happy to take his spot in the gallery to watch the performance, a loyal and selfless servant with the goal in his sights.\n\nWrite to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com"

      "text": "Mike Pence Is No Ordinary Wingman\n\nH ouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi kept her fingers interlocked on the polished table, a smile fixed to her face. This was not how she had hoped to spend the weeks after the 2016 election, sitting next to Vice President-elect Mike Pence. But the voters had called the shot. If there was any consolation to the awkward scene, it was that the two power brokers had known each other for years, well enough that when Pelosi dropped protocol to call him \"Mike,\" he laughed and welcomed the informality. \"You're going to be a very valuable player in all of this,\" she said to Pence, \"because you know the territory, and I know-with no disrespect for the sensitivity and knowledge of the President-elect-you know the territory. So in that territory, we will try to find our common ground where we can.\"\n\nIt's a good bet that Pelosi intended to throw some shade on President-elect Donald Trump. But Pence let it blow by because he knew what he was there to do. There is no one in America, save the President-elect himself, who has more responsibility to make Trump's first term a success. Key among Pence's tasks, after staffing the new Administration and keeping the peace with conservative activists, is finding a way to reach across party lines to make the government work. Perhaps that's why he described his meeting with Pelosi as the first of many, called her \"a worthy opponent\" and reflected fondly on their debates over the years in the House. That same day, he offered incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer his personal cell-phone number with an open invitation to call. \"Politics is the art of the possible, and knowing people and having relationships is finding out what is possible,\" Pence told TIME weeks later during a brief interview at Trump Tower.\n\nAfter 12 years in Washington as a Congressman (before becoming governor of Indiana), Pence has been putting a lot of his relationships to work. \"If the President-elect is wise enough to use him very extensively, I think he will serve himself very well,\" former Indiana governor Mitch Daniels tells TIME. \"So much of what Vice President Pence brings fills gaps in President Trump's background.\"\n\nPence has already made a mark. \"One of my great decisions in life was choosing Mike Pence to be my running mate,\" Trump tells TIME. \"He is truly a high-quality human being, first class in every respect. He is also a talented politician who loves people and wants to help them every step of the way.\"\n\nPence installed allies to head the CIA and the Department of Health and Human Services and the Medicare and Medicaid systems. He elevated a fellow Republican governor to become the envoy to the United Nations and another to run the Energy Department. He camped out on cable TV to make the incoming Administration's case. His goal, as the right hand to a man he once opposed-and still disagrees with on tactics and tone-is to become invaluable. \"I don't think Donald knew him very well,\" former House Speaker John Boehner says of Trump's running mate. \"But he has found out over these last four months that he made a much better decision than he realized.\"\n\nLittle on Pence's résumé suggests he was destined for his current role. The small-government conservative who fought George W. Bush on a prescription-drug bill now finds himself defending decisions like the Carrier jobs deal, which Tea Party stalwarts call \"cronyism and corporate welfare.\" The devout evangelical who routinely describes himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order\" helped America elect someone who, before he started running for the White House, might have failed all three tests. A party leader who tried to pass a comprehensive immigration bill that was decried at the time as amnesty stood next to a rabble-rouser who won the White House on the promises of deporting immigrants and building a wall along the Mexican border.\n\nBut then, this isn't the first time Michael Richard Pence, 57, who grew up in a middle-class Democratic house where his family displayed pictures of John F. Kennedy, has surprised. His path has never followed a straight line. He arrived on Indiana's Hanover College campus in 1977 as a fairly typical young person: somewhat liberal, open-minded and curious about what lay beyond his experiences at the St. Columba parish in Columbus, Ind., where he spent at least six days a week as an altar boy. His family didn't talk politics at home, but Pence had an interest. He collected a box full of news clippings about JFK, and at age 15 he was a volunteer for the Bartholomew County Democrats. \"Dad didn't like politicians or lawyers,\" he told the Indianapolis Business Journal in 1994. Pence would become both.\n\nDespite his Catholic heritage, he gravitated toward the evangelical groups on campus-because they were more fun and seemed to have a more personal relationship with Jesus, he says. \"I gave my life to Jesus Christ, and that's changed everything,\" Pence said in 2010. Even as he came to describe himself as an evangelical, he continued to attend Mass, where he met his future wife Karen, with whom he would have three children. At the same time, Pence was growing uncomfortable with his Democratic Party's support for abortion rights. (He still voted for Jimmy Carter over Ronald Reagan in 1980.)\n\nAfter college, he considered graduate school and even the priesthood. Instead he settled on law school and spent four years as a corporate attorney. Yet the political bug kept nipping at him, and in 1988, at age 29, he decided to challenge Democratic incumbent Phil Sharp in the state's then Second Congressional District. Pence launched a scrappy first campaign, riding his single-speed bicycle across the district, but the thing Hoosiers remember more than his glad-handing is his stomach for negative ads. One flyer featured a picture of rolled-up cash, razor blades and white powder that looked like cocaine. There's something Phil Sharp isn't telling you about his record on drugs, it read. On the next page, spelled out in fauxcaine: it's weak.\n\nPence lost by more than 6 percentage points. He tried again two years later, with another viciously negative strategy. In one Pence ad, a man dressed in Arab garb thanked Sharp for keeping the U.S. reliant on Mideast oil. Pence supporters posed as members of an environmental group and called neighbors to tell them, incorrectly, that Sharp was turning his family farm into a nuclear-waste dump. Pence, who claimed not to know about the scheme, would later recognize the calls as \"a manifestly dumb idea.\"\n\nIn the end, only 42% of voters backed him, and Pence went home a deeply disappointed man with a guilty conscience. As penance, he wrote Sharp an apology letter and later published a manifesto against negative campaigns. \"Christ Jesus came to save sinners, among whom I am foremost of all,\" Pence wrote, quoting Scripture. These \"Confessions of a Negative Campaigner\" became a guiding principle for his future campaigns, still a decade away, and the next step of his career as a conservative policy thinker and talk-radio host. In an era of red-meat radio, Pence cast himself as a calmer alternative, \"Rush Limbaugh on decaf,\" he said. The remake worked, allowing him to finally win the House seat in 2000.\n\nPence arrived in Washington a year later determined to rise through the ranks, but not by playing along. He was one of 34 Republicans who voted against the Bush education overhaul branded No Child Left Behind, which increased federal control over grade school, and in 2003 he was one of 25 Republicans who voted against a Medicare program for seniors' drugs, which added to the deficit. Both, he said, smacked of Big Government. Outside the halls of Congress, he joined a lawsuit seeking to overturn the McCain-Feingold campaign-finance law. John McCain, Pence said in one contentious meeting, was \"so deep in bed with the Democrats on this issue that his feet are coming out of the bottom of the sheets.\"\n\nLeaders at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue noted his independent streak and uncanny ability to attract press. Those close to Pence attribute his early success to a strong moral compass. After all, Pence kept a Bible within arm's reach in his office and often cited Scripture to explain his votes. As public opinion was shifting on same-sex marriage, Pence did not waver. \"For Mike, it's more about the right thing to do than the expedient thing to do,\" said John Hostettler, a former Congressman from Indiana.\n\nIn 2006, Pence tried to midwife an immigration bill that would have offered a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. The plan won applause from Bush, who invited him to the White House to give his effort some juice. Conservatives called it a betrayal, and the bill never got off the ground.\n\nEven so, Pence caught the eye of party bigwigs. Boehner, then the Republican leader, gave him minor tasks to test both his competence and his loyalty. Pence passed, and in late 2008, Boehner phoned Pence and urged him to throw his name into the race for the No. 3 spot in the GOP leadership, chairman of the House Republican conference. \"Really?\" came Pence's reply. \"Can I call you back?\"\n\nBoehner says Pence called him back an hour later and said he would do it. \"It was one of the best decisions I made,\" Boehner says. \"Pence and his team were constant sources of support and good counsel.\"\n\nThat's not to say Pence had curbed his independence. Rather, when he disagreed with Boehner, he did so quietly so as not to embarrass his friend, who was struggling to hold together a Republican Party being tugged in competing directions by Bush-style conservatism and the rising Tea Party. It's a fight that no one has yet won, and one Pence will now try to referee among the shrinking GOP establishment, Trump's country-club plutocrats and Rust Belt populists who want what they were promised. It may be Pence's toughest assignment.\n\nPence's fans started talking him up as Indiana's next governor, if not President. He genuinely enjoyed working as Boehner's eyes and ears among conservatives but also was looking at his next moves. \"You can't have your heart in two places,\" Boehner told him.\n\nSo Pence returned home to Indiana, knowing that Republicans like to nominate governors over legislators as presidential nominees. Pence went to all corners of the state. This time, it was a Big Red Truck Tour instead of a single-speed bike. He ditched the lawyer's pinstripes for a leather bomber jacket. He kept his social conservatism in check, preferring to stick to his talking points that promised to take his state \"from reform to results.\" His campaign had tinges of Make America Great Again.\n\nPence and Trump first got to know each other on the back nine of the billionaire's club in Bedminster, N.J., over the Fourth of July holiday, when Trump's odds of becoming President seemed more certain than Pence's of winning a second term. In his time as governor of Indiana, he had stumbled, declining in approval ratings and struggling with missteps. \"In Washington, where he cut his political teeth, they talk in big ideas. In the states, you have to have results. There's no place to hide,\" says Indiana senate president David Long, a fellow Republican who considers Pence a pal.\n\nPence had proposed a state-run news agency that drew ire from all corners, not just for its perceived affront to free press but also because of its price tag. He clashed with the Republican-led legislature on the budget and was forced to scale back his cherished cuts in corporate and personal income taxes. Most damaging, he signed a law that supporters said defended their religious freedoms by allowing them to deny services to gays, lesbians and those who are transgender or bisexual. The vocal critics called it discrimination. \"Indiana is a state of crisis,\" the Indianapolis Star's editors wrote in a rare Page One editorial. Pence caved, provoking outrage from Christian conservatives who thought he had gone wobbly.\n\nBut as the two men approached the 17th hole, Trump wanted to talk about himself and his campaign. He asked Pence how this campaign might end. Pence had no hesitation, he recounted in an interview. \"You're going to be President of the United States,\" Pence said.\n\n\"Well, that's pretty definitive,\" Trump said in reply. The businessman started seeing the appeal in Pence's pedigree as a Washington insider, social crusader and state leader. Pence's stock rose further when he told an NBC News journalist that Trump had \"beat me like a drum\" on the course.\n\nA few weeks later, Trump came knocking. Literally. His plane just happened to break down in Indianapolis, and the Pences invited Trump and his three eldest children to breakfast at their home the next day. Pence, who in public can be rather stilted, delivered an impassioned indictment of both Bill and Hillary Clinton that was reminiscent of his days as a talk-radio host. By the evening, Trump was signaling that he was inclined to go with Pence, campaign aides told reporters.\n\nPence's selection for the ticket proved to be an antidote for the summer's #NeverTrump fever. Republicans, especially those with Establishment footing, had gnashed their teeth over their nominee for months, fearing Trump was unelectable or, even worse, uncontrollable. But with the mild-mannered Pence at the table, it was acceptable. Trump also dispatched Pence during the campaign to begin to lay the groundwork for an Administration, which the Trump team had always avoided. \"We spent exactly zero days in Washington,\" Trump's first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, says these days. Pence would play catch-up.\n\nBack at the Capitol, GOP Senators made a request to Pence: come to lunch every Tuesday. Republicans in the upper chamber usually hashed out strategy and policy over meals just off the Senate floor every week. Of course he'd be there, he told them during the summer.\n\nAcross the Capitol, Pence's task was to mend fences. A pal of Paul Ryan's, Pence successfully negotiated the détente between the feuding House Speaker and party nominee. Like a Sunday-school teacher, Pence told the pair to knock it off and get back to the same hymnal. Then after the election, when conservatives threatened Ryan's role as Speaker, Pence was on the phone calling potential naysayers to tell them that Trump wanted to keep Ryan in that role. And when the full House Republican conference welcomed him back to the panel he once chaired on Nov. 17, he received an extended standing ovation. Pence returned the favor with a strong selfie game, raising an iPhone up a selfie stick. The resulting snapshot was mocked for featuring so many white men. It wasn't just good manners or efficient photography. It was a down payment to the partners who could help the Trump-Pence Administration. \"Buckle up,\" he told his former colleagues.\n\nPence in action over the past few months has been a man who has advanced from Trump's outer orbit to the center of his inner circle. He defends Trump's tweet storms, excuses his false statements and backs hires like chief strategist Steve Bannon, who once published blistering criticism of Pence on the website Breitbart. Pence stayed silent when Trump contradicted him during debates and at rallies, and maintained that the President-elect was behind a deal that saved 700 jobs at one Indiana factory. Without Indiana's economic-development dollars, which Pence still controls, the deal would have been DOA. Loyalty is the ultimate qualification inside Trump Tower, and Pence was rich in that commodity.\n\nIn recent weeks, Pence has been the central figure inside Trump's Administration-in-waiting, interviewing candidates for roles large and small. So much of actually running the government happens in assistant secretaries' offices, not in the showy spectacles. Pence understands this and is comfortable keeping his hand on the rudder in these offstage moments. For instance, he doled out his cell-phone number to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's board of directors at a recent meeting in Washington. In private, Pence can mellow his billionaire boss.\n\nThe question will be, to borrow a phrase Hillary Clinton once said of herself, just how high a pain threshold Pence possesses. His political future hinges on Trump's fortunes, and his identity could be determined by the policy positions Trump takes. Pence simply cannot run for President in four or eight years if the Trump Administration is a failure. To have a chance at the top job, Pence has to make Trump a winner. And for Pence to maintain his political identity, he has to keep Trump on a conservative path.\n\nBut Pence is ultimately a man of faith. As he said in a 2012 farewell speech to the House, things don't just happen by chance. \"When you see a turtle on a fence post,\" he said, \"one thing you know for sure is that he didn't get there on his own.\" It will be up to Trump how to treat his new tortoise, the slow and steady plodder who might prove a winner in the end. And for now, Mike Pence is fine with that.\n\nThis appears in the December 26, 2016 issue of TIME.\n\nWrite to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com"

      "text": "Trump back in Florida; Pence hails administration's 'good start'\n\nWEST PALM BEACH - President Donald Trump arrived back in Florida Friday evening, just hours after his previous vice president said during a lunchtime talk just miles from the Winter White House that the new administration is \"off to a good start,\" but counseled it to hew to traditional conservative principles.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence , who parted political paths with Trump over the 2020 election, lauded the administration's Cabinet and staff hires, particularly Floridians Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, and Michael Waltz, national security adviser, and for ending the \"crisis\" at the southern border with Mexico.\n\n\"The key for me is I want to see the administration hew to, essentially, the path that we hewed to,\" Pence said during an appearance at the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches. \"I really do believe the Trump-Pence record was a conservative record.\"\n\nSpecifically, Pence said he opposed \"broad-based\" tariffs and worried that his former boss is surrounded by aides who favor a return to a 19th-century worldview on global commerce. He also called for maintaining military aide to embattled Ukraine and a commitment to America's post-World War II leadership role.\n\n\"There is no substitute for America in the free world. America is the leader of the free world,\" Pence said. \"And if America is not leading, the free world is not being led.\"\n\nHe called Russia's invasion \"brutal\" and said he held \"no doubt\" that allowing Russian President Vladimir Putin to overrun Ukraine will inevitably lead to the Russian leader crossing a \"border where our men and women will have to go fight him.\" That echoed a sentiment Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed to Trump during a tense confrontation in the White House last month.\n\nTrump landed at Palm Beach International Airport after 8 p.m. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Elon Musk were aboard Air Force One as well, according to reporters traveling with the president.\n\nThe White House touted a series of achievements ahead of Trump's sixth weekend visit to his Palm Beach club.\n\nThe administration cheered what it said were the arrests by federal immigration agents of \"32,809 illegal immigrants,\" the bulk of whom were accused or convicted criminals. Officials said the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency logged the \"biggest day of deregulation\" ever, including canceling the Biden administration's electric vehicle mandate and \"assault on power plants, and eliminating costly emissions standards.\"\n\nBefore departing Washington, the president spoke at the U.S. Justice Department, now headed by fellow Floridian Pam Bondi. There he repeated past grievances about the criminal indictments and charges filed against him in 2023.\n\n\"Our predecessors turned this Department of Justice into the department of injustice,\" he said. \"But I stand before you today to declare those days are over, and they are never going to come back. They are never going to come back.\"\n\nThe administration, which marked 50 days in office this past week, has watched gauges of Wall Street and Main Street confidence plummet and erode. The declines have been fueled by uncertainty over how the jettisoning of government employees by the tens of thousands, coupled with a mushrooming tariff world war the president launched, will impact the U.S. economy.\n\nThe University of Michigan's survey of consumer sentiment, released on Friday, fell by 7 points over the past month to 57.9, its lowest level since November 2022.\n\nA series of surveys also show erosion of belief in what was a Trump strength in his first term - management of the economy. A CNN/SRSS study found that just 28% said they believe the new administration's policies have improved their finances, while only 39% approved of his trade and tariff measures. Some 57% of respondents, including one-in-three Republicans, in a Reuters/IPSOS query viewed Trump's economic initiatives as erratic and unsteady.\n\nOn Wall Street, three broad indices were in a tailspin all week but recorded significant gains Friday, perhaps encouraged by a budget deal in Congress that averted a government shutdown. Nonetheless, the Dow Jones industrial average alone is down more than 3,500 points from its high of 45,073.63 in December. Shares in Musk's Tesla Inc. have lost almost half their value.\n\nThe markets have also been spiraling in large measure over fears, analysts have said, from rising odds for a recession. The administration's constant shifting of positions on tariffs - from leverage on border security to retaliation for grievances to a mechanism to raise money for the U.S. Treasury to rebuild U.S. manufacturing - and confusion bred over the apparent fits and starts on their application have not inspired confidence among investors.\n\nWhen pressed in an interview on Sky News, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro shot back in frustration.\n\n\"Sir, you don't understand what a negotiation looks like,\" retorted Navarro, who grew up in Palm Beach County. \"The president is negotiating strategically. So stop with the rhetoric, OK? Just stop that crap.\"\n\nTrump was particularly triggered by criticism in an editorial by the Wall Street Journal. The news organization noted that a danger in starting trade wars is \"they can quickly escalate and get out of control.\"\n\nThe Journal then fired a salvo saying the president is acting \"as if his manhood is implicated because a foreign nation won't take his nasty border taxes lying down.\" It then concluded: \"We said from the beginning that this North American trade war is the dumbest in history, and we were being kind.\"\n\nTrump fired back that the Journal's \"thinking is antiquated and weak.\"\n\nPence, speaking at the Kravis Center, said he was \"proud\" of the successes of the first Trump term.\n\n\"We rebuilt our military, we stood with our allies, we stood up to our enemies, we were willing to use force against those who threatened our interests and our allies around the world,\" he said, adding the administration was the \"most\" pro-Israel presidency.\n\nDomestically, Pence cited the 2017 tax cuts, the increase in energy production, nominations of conservatives to the federal courts and bringing order to the southern border.\n\nBut he questioned the new Trump government's tilt toward \"broad-based\" tariffs.\n\nHe said he supported targeted duties on China to wrest more access to Asian giant's markets and to cajole Beijing on issues like intellectual property rights. He recalled how Trump successfully used duties as leverage with Canada to increase U.S. dairy exports and to require Mexico to cooperate on immigration.\n\n\"I've seen him use tariffs as a leverage. I support that, the guy who wrote the 'Art of the Deal' knows how to make a deal,\" he said. \"What I think markets are responding to, and what we're going to be pushing back on, is the idea of broad-based industrial policy on tariffs.\"\n\nPence worried about the \"voices and thinkers\" around the president who he said seek a return to the \"19th-century days\" where products entering the country paid across-the-board tariffs. He warned that tariffs will be paid by U.S. importers, not foreign exporters, and those costs will be passed on to consumers.\n\n\"My concern is about inflation. It's about stifling growth in the economy,\" he said.\n\nInstead, Pence said the administration should prioritize extending the tax cuts enacted in the first term to avoid what he said would amount to a $5 trillion tax hike.\n\nBefore the acrimony between Trump and Pence over the latter's refusal to help overturn the 2020 election results, the former vice president said he had a \"great working relationship\" with the 45th president and they \"parted amicably.\" The two, Pence added, exchanged a warm greeting at President Jimmy Carter's funeral in January.\n\nYet, when asked, Pence revealed he did not receive an invite to visit Trump at Mar-a-Lago while in town.\n\nAt the Forum Club, Pence again asserted his constitutional duty was to count the ballots on Jan. 6, 2021, and could not think of a more \"un-American\" action than to have thrown out the votes.\n\nWhile he believed there were irregularities with the presidential election vote, Pence again stated that there was \"ultimately no evidence of any widespread fraud that changed the outcome of the election.\"\n\nAnd he bluntly criticized the pardons Trump issued to those who engaged in the violence on Capitol Hill four years ago. \"I believe that no one who assaulted a police officer or vandalized the U.S. Capitol should ever have been pardoned,\" he said.\n\nDespite the improved prospects for a resolution to the war in Ukraine, Trump on Friday called on Putin to spare what he said were thousands of Ukrainian troops surrounded by the Russian military.\n\n\"I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared,\" Trump revealed on social media. \"This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II.\"\n\nNonetheless, it was the volatile dispute over trade that dominated the week. Trump railed on Truth Social that the \"Entire World is RIPPING US OFF!!\"\n\nOn Thursday, Trump called the European Union \"one of the most hostile and abusive\" tariff and taxing entities. He demanded that a 50% tariff on U.S. whiskey be lifted and threatened to retaliate with a 200% duty on \"all alcoholic beverages,\" including wine and champagne, coming from the Old World.\n\nThe president again disparaged Canada - one of Florida's biggest trading partners - saying it \"only works\" as a U.S. state. Trump's home state imports roughly $5.8 billion from Canada.\n\n\"We don't need their cars. We don't need their energy. We don't need their lumber. We don't need anything that they give,\" Trump insisted from the Oval Office. \"We do it because we want to be helpful. We don't need anything they have.\"\n\nWhile at Mar-a-Lago on March 1, Trump issued an order to \"fully exploit\" the United States' woodlands and forests to, he said, address \"significant vulnerabilities\" from relying on imports of timber, lumber and other products.\n\nThis week, the president also again expressed his desire to annex Greenland, the world's largest island that is an autonomous territory governed by Denmark.\n\n\"We need it for international security. We have to have protection,\" Trump said in a White House meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. \"We're going to have to make a deal on that.\"\n\nAntonio Fins is a politics and business editor at The Palm Beach Post , part of the USA TODAY Florida Network.

      "text": "In Trump's Washington, Mike Pence Is Odd Man Out\n\nManage your account\n\nIt's a sign of the times that Mike Pence can make news with pronouncements that a decade ago would've been about as controversial as saying that the sky is blue.\n\n\"Mr. President, Ukraine did not 'start' this war,\" Donald Trump's former vice president posted on Twitter February 19. \"Russia launched an unprovoked and brutal invasion claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. ... The Road to Peace must be built on the Truth.\"\n\nLater that day, Pence spoke to The Dispatch in the offices of Advancing American Freedom, the political organization he launched after leaving office in 2021, about how he sees his mission in politics for the next four years. \"Our role here is really just to promote a broad, mainstream conservative agenda at home and abroad,\" Pence said. \"The president may simply have misspoke ... but facts matter, and that's why I weighed in today.\"\n\nA Pence aide told The Dispatch after this story was published that \"the refusal of numerous members of the administration and the president to acknowledge that Russia had started the war confirmed Pence's initial concern\" that the president's first comments were not a misstatement.*\n\nSince Trump was elected to a second term, Pence has proven himself to be one of the last remaining institutional voices of traditional conservatism in a party and movement willing to go along with whatever Trump wants. Beyond calling for continued U.S. support for Ukraine to repel the Russian invasion, Pence and AAF have urged the implementation of the law requiring TikTok to divest from Chinese ownership, while Trump has tried to give TikTok a reprieve. When Trump posted on social media that \"He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,\" Pence posted his essay from 2010 on the importance of adhering to the Constitution. Perhaps most notably, less than a day after Trump named Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his pick to be secretary of health and human services, Pence urged senators to vote \"no.\"\n\nThe notion that Kennedy, an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist and trial lawyer with a far-left record on abortion and health care reform, should not be the country's top public health official would have been obvious to almost all Republicans a decade- or even a year -ago. But in Trump's Washington, Pence stood almost alone in his campaign against Kennedy. He spoke directly to multiple senators urging them to vote against Kennedy. But in the end, Mitch McConnell, the former Senate majority leader, was the only Republican in the chamber to vote \" no .\"\n\n\"I was disappointed that we didn't have more company in the end. I will tell you that the chorus of voices that reached out to us offering quiet encouragement was fairly deafening,\" Pence told The Dispatch . \"People appreciated the stand that we took and the case that we made, and the way we equipped members of the Senate with not just the life issue, but now-Secretary Kennedy's long record of liberal activism.\"\n\nIn a separate interview, Tim Chapman, the president of Advancing American Freedom, told The Dispatch that the message he heard privately not only from activist groups and donors but also senators themselves was: \"You guys are right. We appreciate you're doing it. We just can't be there with you right now.\"\n\nThe reason? \"If they pop their head up, they get their head taken off on Twitter,\" Chapman said.\n\n\"We don't necessarily feel an obligation to win every policy fight that we engage in, but we do feel very strongly that we have an obligation to raise the issues and that there is a benefit downstream from that, even if you lose,\" Chapman added. \"I actually believe that RFK Jr. is going to be more pro-life at HHS because we raised the issue, and I think he's on a shorter leash on that particular issue.\"\n\nChapman said his thinking about the role of Advancing American Freedom is informed by his time working for nearly 15 years at the Heritage Foundation and its advocacy outfit Heritage Action before leaving Heritage in 2020. With only 16 employees focused on an array of issues related to policy and legal advocacy, Advancing American Freedom is just a fraction of the size of Heritage but hopes to punch above its weight. When the conservative movement was \"at its best, it has tried to pull [GOP] leadership more to the right and tether them to principle on different debates.\" Chapman observed that while Heritage sought during Trump's first term to synthesize conservatism and populism, under pressure from the likes of Tucker Carlson it simply threw in the towel and became \"more of a populist enforcer of the MAGA agenda, rather than a principled and independent outside organization trying to pull them to conservative true north.\" Chapman now hopes to fill that void left by the Heritage Foundation.\n\nBut don't expect Pence to join the anti-Trump Resistance anytime soon. Or ever. \"I do think the administration is off to a good start with the Cabinet overall,\" Pence told The Dispatch on February 19 when asked for the best and worst aspects of the first month of Trump's second term. \"I think the best things are reinstituting the policies that we had in effect at the southern border, and taking the strong stand that they have on the cartels, the collaboration, even the cooperation, with the Mexican government,\" he continued. \"A close runner-up is I'm very impressed with what my friend Elon Musk is doing with the Department of Government Efficiency. Identifying wasteful government spending and outright fraud is a great first step\" that ought to be followed by congressional action.\n\nAnd the worst parts of the last month? Pence takes a long pause. \"I've had some issues with some personnel, and been disappointed in that, but ... overall, President Trump and the administration are off to a good start,\" he said. \"Our goal here is to really be a constructive, credible voice for conservatism.\"\n\nWhat's the point of Pence making the case for traditional conservatism when the man leading the Republican Party has such personal animosity toward him over his decision to fulfill his constitutional duty to count Electoral College votes on January 6, 2021? \"The conservative agenda's been the calling of my life,\" Pence replied. \"While the most prominent voice in our party occasionally signals a different direction ... I'm not yet convinced the president is interested in departing from the agenda that we governed on. But some of those prominent voices in and around the party would take us in a more populist vein. I don't believe that's what most Republican voters believe.\"\n\nOn the personal level, it's no secret that Trump and Pence's relationship has been virtually nonexistent since Trump inspired a mob to ransack the U.S. Capitol and rioters shouted chants to hang Pence. \"We don't talk as often as we used to,\" Pence said. \"In fact, we've only spoken once in the past four years.\" At the funeral for Jimmy Carter on January 9, Pence and Trump had what he described as a \"cordial exchange\" with Trump: \"He greeted me. I stood up, extended my hand, and I said, 'Congratulations, Mr. President.' He softened and said, you know, 'Thanks, Mike.'\"\n\nStill, Pence thinks he can have influence with the president again. \"While we don't talk the way we used to, I have every reason to believe he still listens to me,\" Pence added.\n\nAnd he had advice for those inside the administration hoping to influence Trump in a more traditionally conservative direction: \"I have great confidence in Secretary of State [Marco] Rubio and the National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. I just encourage them to take the opportunities to offer clear, quiet counsel, because in all my years of experience with President Trump ... he does listen. He takes in a variety of viewpoints, but I think he appreciates people who are candid and forthright with him, even if it doesn't necessarily square with the position he appears [to be] intending to take on any given issue.\"\n\nWhile Vice President J.D. Vance is obviously pushing against much of the agenda that Pence supports, Pence at first had only praise for the new vice president when asked for his opinion of Vance's first month in office. \"I thought he gave a very good speech at the Munich Security Conference, speaking about shared values,\" Pence said. \"I appreciated him talking about ... particularly efforts against pro-life people in the U.K. and suppression of free speech in Europe .\" Pence went on to note he \"mostly focused on Russia, and notably China\" when he spoke at that security conference. \"The great challenges that we are facing in the world today really require the president and the vice president to focus energy on standing with our allies and standing up to our enemies,\" he said.\n\nAsked if he expects Vance to be the 2028 GOP nominee and whether he could support him, Pence suggested there will be a seriously contested primary. \"I pray often for the president and the vice president. I don't know the vice president personally, and he was a pretty harsh critic of our administration during our four years, and only emerged in politics after we'd left office,\" he said. \"The Republican party has a deep bench. We have a lot of men and women of great talent ... Over the next four years, we're going to be faced with a very important choice, whether we stay committed to our traditional conservative path of strong national defense, American leadership in the world, limited government, fiscal responsibility, right-to-life and values, or whether we follow the siren song of populism unmoored to conservative principles.\"\n\nWhile Pence sounds like a man saying the sky is blue when describing the current GOP's inconsistencies with long-held Republican principles, he begins to sound more like a man who says clouds are made of marshmallows when discussing what he thinks the party will look like going forward: \"I have a sense that the Republican nominee in the next election will be someone who embraces that traditional Republican conservatism.\"\n\nIs there a chance Pence himself might run for president again in 2028? \"I never say never.\"\n\nEditor's Note, February 24, 2025: This story has been updated with an additional comment from a Pence aide.\n\nRead more at The Dispatch\n\nThe Dispatch is a new digital media company providing engaged citizens with fact-based reporting and commentary, informed by conservative principles.

Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services due to Kennedy's past support of abortion rights.\n\nPence issued the statement on Friday through Advancing American Freedom , the political organization he founded, writing that the Trump-Pence administration was \"unapologetically pro-life\" and the HHS office can lead the country \"toward a respect for life or away from it.\"\n\n\"I believe the nomination of RFK Jr. To serve as Secretary of HHS is an abrupt departure from the pro-life record of our administration and should be deeply concerning to millions of Pro-Life Americans who have supported the Republican Party and our nominees for decades,\" Pence said in the statement.\n\nTrump, who won the 2024 election last week to return to the White House , has begun rolling out nominations for his next administration.

      "text": "Mike Pence tears into Donald Trump at 2024 campaign launch\n\nFormer US vice-president Mike Pence has offered his most forceful repudiation of Donald Trump to date during a speech launching his 2024 campaign.\n\nThe Republican accused Mr Trump of being unfaithful to the US constitution and of abandoning conservative values.\n\nThe former Indiana governor and congressman formally commenced his White House campaign on Wednesday.\n\nThe move pits him against his two-time running mate, who he served under in the White House from 2017-21.\n\nAt a speech in Ankeny, Iowa, Mr Pence argued that Mr Trump had encouraged the mob that attacked the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, and had incorrectly asserted that Mr Pence had the power to overturn the election result.\n\n\"But the American people deserve to know that on that day, President Trump also demanded that I choose between him and the constitution,\" he said.\n\n\"Now, voters will be faced with the same choice: I chose the constitution and I always will.\"\n\nHe added that Mr Trump's actions on 6 January should disqualify him from returning to power.\n\n\"I believe that anyone who puts themselves over the constitution should never be president of the United States,\" he said.\n\n\"And anyone who asked someone else to put them over the constitution should never be president of the United States again.\"\n\nMr Pence, 64, also took shots at Democratic President Joe Biden as well, arguing that neither he nor Mr Trump are similar to average Americans who know how to \"treat each other with kindness and respect even when we disagree\".\n\nMuch of his speech focused on his disagreements with Mr Trump, but he also hit out at another Republican 2024 rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.\n\n\"Donald Trump and others who would seek the presidency would walk away from our traditional role on the world stage,\" he said, hitting out at Mr DeSantis for his recent remarks about the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn a later CNN town hall, he continued attacking his rivals, critising Mr Trump for having previously called Russian President Vladimir Putin a \"genius\".\n\n\"I know the difference between a genius and a war criminal, and I know who needs to win in the war in Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nBut he also condemned prosecutors for investigating Mr Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office, saying \"indicting a former president in the United States sends a terrible message to the world\".\n\nIt comes after Mr Pence was cleared of wrongdoing last week by prosecutors over his own handling of classified info.\n\nMr Pence was one of eight Republican presidential candidates who appeared at a fundraising event at the Iowa state fairground, known as the Roast and Ride, last weekend.\n\nHe arrived on a Harley Davidson along with another couple of hundred bikers who rode in convoy, raising money for military veterans. But that was not enough to provoke much excitement around his candidacy.\n\nAn energetic Ron DeSantis got the most enthusiastic response as he promised to \"fight the woke\" wherever he finds it.\n\nMr Pence's speech, by comparison, was flat and lacklustre, perhaps demonstrating why a former vice-president with nationwide name recognition is trailing badly in opinion polls.\n\nAccording to a Reuters-Ipsos survey released last month, Mr Pence is polling at 5%, compared to 44% for Mr Trump.\n\nOne former Trump voter, Todd Wilson, said he felt Mr Pence \"needs to be a little bit stronger\".\n\nThe candidate's humility was a plus, he said, \"but I think if you're going to be the president, you got to have to have a little bit of a bulldog in you. So I'm looking for that out of Pence.\"\n\nThe Republican field for the 2024 nomination is increasingly crowded.\n\nOn Tuesday, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie launched a bid. On Wednesday, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum also announced that he was entering the race.\n\nWho are the Republican hopefuls not named Trump?\n\nMr Pence was seen as an unswervingly loyal deputy to Mr Trump through much of their four years in office.\n\nBut he has distanced himself since the riot at the US Capitol.\n\nMr Trump pressured Mr Pence to overturn Joe Biden's election victory when he presided over the certification of results in Congress and admonished him for lacking \"courage\" when he refused.\n\nSome rioters were heard chanting \"hang Mike Pence\" as they stormed the halls of Congress, and many Trump loyalists view him as a traitor.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "The one thing Mike Pence needs to beat his old boss in 2024\n\nIn a traditional American political world, Mike Pence's 2024 presidential campaign would have a lot going for it.\n\nA politician with experience in both Congress and as a state governor. A former vice-president who had multiple high-profile administration roles and four years to build connections with his party's grass-roots. A methodical but reasonably charismatic public speaker who has a track record of strong debate performances and a stint as a popular conservative radio host.\n\nThis is not, however, a normal political world anymore - and it hasn't been since Donald Trump barrelled his way to the Republican presidential nomination and the White House in 2016.\n\nInstead, 2024 will be yet another precedent-setting moment in modern American politics - the first time a former vice-president and his former president will compete for their party's presidential nomination.\n\nIn a campaign video that quoted Ronald Reagan and Abraham Lincoln, Mr Pence launched his new mission on Wednesday.\n\n\"Pence is a traditional conservative,\" says David Oman, former chair of the Iowa Republican Party. \"He's just not a loud one.\"\n\nFor the moment, Mr Pence's former boss has almost all the advantages. He has a massive campaign war chest, high approval ratings among Republican voters and unwavering support from roughly 30% of his party's voters.\n\nThat loyal Trump base also views Mr Pence with scepticism that veers toward animosity. They consider his decision not to back the former president's attempt to overturn their 2020 electoral defeat an error at best and, frequently, as a betrayal.\n\nLast month, Mr Pence was compelled to testify before a federal grand jury investigating the former president's role in the January 6th attack on the US Capitol and efforts to reverse the 2020 results.\n\nAnd in March, Mr Pence said that Mr Trump's \"reckless words\" put his family in danger on that day, adding that \"history will hold Donald Trump accountable\".\n\nFor the moment, however, it appears Mr Trump's supporters are the ones passing judgement on Mr Pence.\n\nTo succeed in his presidential bid, Mr Pence will need the former president to falter. But if that happens it is much more likely that his supporters go to someone like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.\n\nThere is an area where Mr Pence has an edge over his former running mate, however.\n\nAs a devout Christian, the Indiana politician has a long history of close ties to the US evangelical community. One of the reasons Mr Trump chose him for his 2016 ticket was because his campaign advisers believed Mr Pence would assuage the concerns of Christian voters who might be reluctant to support the thrice-married New Yorker with considerable personal baggage.\n\nMr Pence was effectively the Trump administration's ambassador to the Christian right, touting wins on high-profile cultural issues like abortion and religious freedom.\n\nNow he hopes to capitalise on that history and peel away the former president's evangelical voters. That's particularly important in Iowa, the state that holds the first Republican presidential nomination contest and where Christian conservatives hold considerable sway.\n\n\"It's a good bloc of 30 plus percent of the Republican voters who will show up on caucus night in early 2024,\" says Mr Oman. \"So it's a bloc that candidates have to take seriously.\"\n\nThe challenge for Mr Pence is there will be other candidates also competing for the evangelical vote. They include Mr DeSantis - who has championed conservative cultural issues in Florida - and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. The more the field is crowded and divided, the greater the chance that no one will be able to defeat Mr Trump.\n\n\"Pence starts off with a decent part of a Republican base that will not support him,\" Mr Oman says. \"He has to talk about the kind of governor he was, be among those who talk about ideas for the future, someone who can show some common sense and give people a credible alternative to his former partner, Donald Trump.\"\n\nMr Pence has been manoeuvring for a presidential bid for more than a year - well before Mr Trump made his White House ambitions clear. And given that another former vice-president currently sits in the Oval Office, his presidential dreams are not unimaginable - even if the path he would have to take to get to the White House is without precedent.\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Mike Pence testifies in criminal probe of Trump and Capitol riot\n\nFormer US Vice-President Mike Pence has testified as part of a criminal investigation into alleged efforts by Donald Trump to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election.\n\nMr Pence, 63, sat for more than seven hours before a federal grand jury in Washington DC, sources told the BBC's US partner CBS News.\n\nHe was issued with a subpoena to testify under oath earlier this year.\n\nThe questioning by prosecutors took place behind closed doors.\n\nHis appearance on Thursday came just hours after an appeals court rejected a last-ditch bid by Mr Trump's legal team to stop Mr Pence from testifying.\n\nMr Pence's lawyers had also sought unsuccessfully to challenge the subpoena, arguing that his role as president of the Senate during his time in office meant he had congressional immunity.\n\nHis eventual testimony, which had been sought for months, is a major milestone in the two-year investigation which is being led by special counsel Jack Smith, a former war crimes prosecutor who was appointed to the role by Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nThe investigation has been gathering evidence about whether Mr Trump and his allies broke federal law in their efforts to challenge the result of the 2020 election, which was won by President Joe Biden.\n\nIt is also investigating the US Capitol riot on 6 January 2021, when Mr Trump's supporters stormed the building in an effort to prevent the election result from being certified.\n\nMr Pence, who like all vice-presidents was also president of the Senate - a mostly ceremonial role - could in theory have derailed the final certification of the election result and delayed the transfer of power.\n\nMr Trump publicly pressured his vice-president to do so, and his refusal led him to lash out at Mr Pence.\n\nTrump supporters then chanted \"hang Mike Pence\" as they stormed Congress and marauded through the corridors of the Capitol building as politicians, including Mr Pence, sheltered inside.\n\nMr Pence is considered a key witness in the investigation and, while it is not immediately clear what he told the grand jury, prosecutors will likely have asked him about his interactions with Mr Trump and his team in the days and weeks leading up to the riot.\n\n\"We'll obey the law, we'll tell the truth,\" Mr Pence said in an interview with CBS on Sunday. \"The story that I've been telling the American people all across the country... that'll be the story I tell in that setting.\"\n\nMr Pence has spoken publicly about the Capitol riot and the pressure he faced to challenge the election result. \"President Trump is wrong. I had no right to overturn the election,\" he said in a speech in February.\n\nIn his memoir, So Help Me God, Mr Pence wrote that Mr Trump had attempted to pressure him into blocking the certification of the election result on the morning of the riot. \"You'll go down as a wimp,\" the then-president apparently told Mr Pence.\n\nHe has also accused Mr Trump of endangering his family as well as others who were at the Capitol, saying history will hold him \"accountable\".\n\nMr Pence is reportedly considering a presidential bid of his own in 2024, which would see him challenge his former boss directly for the Republican nomination.\n\nMr Trump, who has already launched his bid to return to the White House, was in New Hampshire on Thursday for a campaign event. When asked by NBC News about Mr Pence's testimony, he commented: \"I don't know what he said, but I have a lot of confidence in him.\"\n\nThe former president is facing other legal issues, including another federal investigation led by Mr Smith into the potential mishandling of classified documents.\n\nThere is also a separate investigation in Georgia into alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election result.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Regulations require such files to be stored securely.\n\nA \"small number of documents bearing classified markings\" were \"inadvertently boxed and transported\" to Mr Pence's home at the end of Mr Trump's presidency, his lawyer wrote in a letter shared with US media.\n\nThe latest development emerged after Mr Pence sought legal help from specialists in handling classified documents \"out of an abundance of caution\".\n\nHe asked for help \"after it became public that documents with classified markings were found in President Joe Biden's Wilmington residence\", the letter read.\n\nLawyers found \"a small number of documents that could potentially contain sensitive or classified information\", which were locked by the former vice-president in a safe.\n\nAn aide to Mr Pence told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, the documents were stored in boxes in an insecure area of Mr Pence's home. The aide said they were taped shut.\n\nAccording to US media, the documents are believed to have first been taken to Mr Pence's home in Virginia before later being sent to Indiana.\n\nAfter the letter became public, Mr Trump came to Mr Pence's defence, taking to his Truth Social social media platform to say that he is \"an innocent man\".\n\n\"He never did anything knowingly dishonest in his life,\" Mr Trump wrote.  \"Leave him alone!!!\"\n\nMr Pence had repeatedly said over the last months that he did not believe he was in possession of classified documents.\n\nEarlier this month, he told CBS that he was confident reviews of documents in his home were done \"in a thorough and careful way\".\n\nMr Biden previously said he had \" no regrets \" over not going public before the midterm elections with the news that classified documents had been discovered in his private office.\n\nSix more classified files were found during a 13-hour search of President Biden's home in Delaware on Friday, his lawyer Bob Bauer said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nThe documents unearthed so far are believed to be related to Mr Biden's eight-year tenure as vice-president under former President Barack Obama.\n\nMr Biden offered access \"to his home to allow DoJ [the Department of Justice] to conduct a search of the entire premises for potential vice-presidential records and potential classified material\", Mr Bauer added.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr Biden's lawyers said a first batch of classified documents had been found on 2 November at the Penn Biden Center, a think tank that the president founded in Washington DC.\n\nA second batch of records was found on 20 December in the garage at his Wilmington home, while another document was found in a storage space at the house on 12 January, his lawyers said.\n\nRepresentatives for former Presidents Obama and George W Bush told Reuters on Tuesday that their administrations had turned over all documents to the National Archives after leaving office.\n\nThe discoveries at the homes of Mr Pence and Mr Biden come as Mr Trump faces a special counsel inquiry over his alleged mishandling of documents.\n\nHundred of classified records were found at Mr Trump's Florida Mar-a-Lago residence - Mr Trump and his lawyers resisted handing over the documents until the FBI raided the Florida holiday home last August.\n\nHe denied any wrongdoing, alleging that President Biden was being treated more favourably by the FBI.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Mr Trump has already started his campaign.\n\nMr Pence, a former Indiana governor, had previously resisted testifying to the Democratic-led House of Representatives committee investigating the Capitol riot. That panel has since disbanded.\n\nThe latest move by the justice department could set up a fight over executive privilege - the legal doctrine that shields some presidential communications.\n\nIt is unclear if investigators will also seek to question Mr Pence about confidential files.\n\nIn January, aides to Mr Pence told US officials they had found classified documents at the former vice-president's home.\n\nThe search was conducted after similar documents were discovered at President Joe Biden's home in Delaware and at an office he used in Washington. Another special counsel, Robert Hur, is investigating the Biden files.\n\nMarc Short, the former chief of staff to Mr Pence, told CNN on Wednesday that the FBI was expected to search the ex-vice-president's house for any additional documents \"not too far off into the future\".\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Prayer.\n\nThe day began, surrounded by aides, with a prayer for God's guidance.

Log in to hide ads .\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated July 14, 2022, 12:35 p.m. ET | Atkinson, N.H.\n\nIt was a pivotal moment for the vice president - and the nation. Pro-Trump rioters were rampaging through the Capitol building yelling \"Hang Mike Pence,\" as Mr. Pence and his family huddled in an underground parking bay. But when a Secret Service agent asked him to get into a waiting car, he refused.\n\n\"He was determined that we would complete the work that we had begun that day,\" Mr. Pence's legal counsel, Greg Jacob, told the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack.\n\nThat work, of course, was the certification of Joe Biden as the next president.\n\nCredited with averting a constitutional crisis, the former vice president faces the ire of Trump allies. But for a No. 2 perpetually in his boss's shadow, it could turn out to be the opening Mr. Pence needed.\n\nMr. Pence's emergence as one of the heroes of the Jan. 6 hearings - which detailed how he resisted an intense pressure campaign by former President Donald Trump to get him to block the counting of electoral votes - has placed him in a singular political position. After four years of loyal service, he's now spurned by Trump allies as a turncoat, even as Democrats and some former Trump aides see him as a savior of democracy. During Tuesday's hearing, Trump White House attorney Pat Cipollone testified that Mr. Pence had done the \"courageous thing\" and deserved a Presidential Medal of Honor.\n\nAs the jockeying for 2024 heats up, with Mr. Trump rumored to be nearing a formal announcement, Mr. Pence is laying the groundwork for a run that could pit him against his former boss.\n\nAt best, he faces a difficult balancing act. The former vice president, who was booed at a gathering of conservative activists last year, has been touting the Trump administration's policy achievements and has refrained from criticizing Mr. Trump - even after the Jan. 6 hearings revealed the president's lack of concern for his safety.\n\nYet for a vice president who was perpetually in Mr. Trump's shadow and never seemed destined to inherit the MAGA mantle, it's also possible Jan. 6 has given Mr. Pence the opening he needed.\n\nIn some ways, the former Indiana governor represents a throwback to the GOP of old, before Mr. Trump jettisoned much of its post-Reagan orthodoxy and norms of governance. Beneath the Midwestern humility is a deeply conservative policy agenda, undergirded by close ties to Charles Koch and other GOP donors. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Mr. Pence pointedly called for a nationwide abortion ban. Next week, he's heading to South Carolina, a key early primary state, to give a talk about \"the post-Roe world.\"\n\nMr. Pence's evangelical faith also goes hand in hand with an emphasis on decency and decorum that contrasts sharply with Mr. Trump's performative pugilism.\n\n\"He's never made an enemy in his life - with one notable exception,\" says one Indiana Republican, who asked for anonymity so he could talk freely.\n\nIf Mr. Pence can build a coalition of religious conservatives, Trump-weary Republicans, and just enough MAGA devotees who don't hold Jan. 6 against him, it could be enough to emerge from a crowded field. It's also conceivable he could wind up as a kind of consensus candidate, the elder statesman to whom the party turns if flashier front-runners flame out - not unlike Mr. Biden in 2020.\n\n\"Mike's greatest advantage is that people underestimate him,\" says John Gregg, an Indiana Democrat who lost a 2012 gubernatorial race to Mr. Pence. \"He's tireless, and he's focused. I've never met anyone who stays on message more than Mike Pence.\"\n\nDespite Mr. Trump's popularity among the base, polls and focus groups indicate that many Republican voters are open to or might even prefer a different candidate as their party's nominee in 2024 . As a result, an ever-growing number of would-be candidates are already testing the waters.\n\nThose making the rounds in New Hampshire include Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Tim Scott of South Carolina, former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who leads the pack of Trump alternatives in early GOP primary polls, has so far stayed away.\n\nIn May, Mr. Pence spoke to a sold-out dinner at a New Hampshire winery, hosted by the Rockingham County GOP chapter. He extolled the Trump administration's conservative record, including the appointment of three Supreme Court justices and 300 federal judges. It was, he boasted, \"the most pro-life administration in American history.\"\n\nWhat went unsaid by Mr. Pence was what he did to usher out that administration on Jan. 6. Much of the GOP base is still upset by Mr. Trump's defeat and not inclined to cut Mr. Pence any slack.\n\nJ. David Bernardy, a Republican state legislator who attended the dinner, concedes that Mr. Pence was constitutionally bound to certify the 2020 election results - but says allegations of fraud should have been investigated more fully. (Senior Trump administration officials, including former Attorney General Bill Barr, testified to the committee that they investigated and found no evidence of widespread fraud.)\n\nThe bigger issue, to Mr. Bernardy, is what he sees as Mr. Pence's passivity. \"The defining issue for me is strength against a virulent Democratic Party,\" he says, arguing that Mr. Pence failed to stand up to public health officials when he ran the White House COVID-19 task force. Mr. Pence is \"a very nice, soft-spoken, and genial guy,\" he concludes, but he's not the best choice to \"counter the absolute horror going on in Washington now.\"\n\nSrinivasan Ravikumar, a retired engineer and another local GOP official, says he appreciates Mr. Pence's temperate style and conservative values. But he's unhappy that the vice president \"rubber stamped\" Mr. Biden's electors. \"I think he went into survival mode after the election, and that doesn't strike me as right,\" he says.\n\nSuch attitudes are common among GOP voters here, say party strategists. The vice president \"always gets a respectful welcome\" in New Hampshire, says Jerry Sickels, who worked for the Trump campaign in 2016. But Mr. Pence's role on Jan. 6 will unquestionably hang over any presidential run. \"It's a hurdle for him to overcome with the rank and file, no question about that,\" he says.\n\nIt's possible lingering anger over the 2020 election will fade as Republicans start to look to 2024. And the blows to Mr. Trump's credibility from the House committee hearings and his exposure to potential criminal charges could weaken him.\n\nBut even if some GOP voters are growing wary of another Trump campaign, they seem to be leaning toward Trump-like alternatives. A UNH Granite State Poll found Governor DeSantis statistically tied with Mr. Trump among likely Republican primary voters. These voters \"have a basically positive attitude towards the former president,\" says Dante Scala, a politics professor at the University of New Hampshire. But \"they're open to moving on.\"\n\nMr. Pence trailed far behind in third place in the same poll, which was taken in June after the first televised Jan. 6 hearings. Of 13 potential candidates polled, he was the only one with a negative favorability rating. \"For core Trump voters, he's seen as a traitor,\" Professor Scala says.\n\n\"I think he's dead in the water. He may not realize it,\" says Thomas Patterson, a professor of government at Harvard University.\n\nMike Pence never set out to make political enemies. Quite the opposite, says Mr. Gregg, who first met him at law school and has remained on cordial terms with him, even after their hard-fought campaign for governor.\n\nWhen Mr. Pence became a conservative talk-radio host in the 1990s, he would regularly interview Mr. Gregg, then Democratic speaker of the Indiana House. Their policy debates were always respectful, he says. \"There was never anyone more professional, kinder, and more appreciative,\" he says.\n\nRadio proved a perfect fit for the mellifluous tones of Mr. Pence, who called himself \"Rush Limbaugh on decaf.\" It also gave him statewide name recognition, and in 2000 he won an open primary and was elected to the U.S. House. Raised a Roman Catholic, he converted to evangelicalism in college and would become a dogged advocate against abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\nHis six-term legislative record in Congress was thin; he never wrote a successful bill. But Mr. Pence was among the first to try to cut off federal funding for abortion services, says Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. \"It was a time when touching Planned Parenthood was the third rail. He was really a pioneer,\" she says.\n\nBy 2008, Mr. Pence had risen to the third rank in House Republican leadership. He had also drawn the attention of the Koch brothers and other conservative donors in their network, which favored candidates who opposed taxes and regulations, particularly on fossil fuel industries.\n\nMarc Short, his chief of staff in the House and later in the White House, arranged for Mr. Pence to speak at a Koch fundraising retreat in 2009, according to a 2017 New Yorker article. Mr. Short, who has testified to the Jan. 6 committee and was with Mr. Pence that day, later became president of the Kochs' \"dark-money\" political organization. Other former Pence staffers also worked for Koch political and corporate entities.\n\nAfter Mr. Pence was elected governor of Indiana in 2012, he continued to build a national profile, leaning into cultural war issues and fueling speculation of a future presidential run. \"There was never any doubt in my mind that Mike wanted to go [back] to Washington, D.C. Being the governor was just a steppingstone,\" says Mr. Gregg.\n\nIn 2015, Mr. Pence signed a controversial religious freedom bill that critics said permitted companies to discriminate against LGBTQ individuals. The bill, later rescinded, sparked corporate boycotts of Indiana that soured some donors on Mr. Pence's social agenda and set up an unexpectedly tough rematch against Mr. Gregg.\n\n\"A lot of people thought his time as governor was winding down,\" says Andrew Downs, a political science professor at Indiana's Purdue University Fort Wayne.\n\nThen, Mr. Pence was handed an opportunity. In July 2016, after several other mainstream Republicans had taken a pass, Mr. Trump announced him as his running mate, reportedly praising Mr. Pence backstage as \"straight from central casting.\"\n\nIn joining the ticket, Mr. Pence's goal may not have been to play second fiddle in the White House as much as it was to set himself up as a presidential contender in 2020, says Joel Goldstein, professor emeritus of law at St. Louis University and an expert on the vice presidency.\n\nAt that stage, a Trump presidency seemed to most observers a long shot. \"His calculation was that he would inherit Trump supporters and join that to the religious right support that he had,\" Mr. Goldstein says. \"What he didn't bargain on is that he would win.\"\n\nOnce elected, Vice President Pence served as a loyal lieutenant, displaying a solidarity that critics likened to sycophancy. During Mr. Trump's most controversial moments, such as when he seemed to offer praise for neo-Nazis or shared discredited COVID-19 treatments, Mr. Pence never betrayed any public discomfort. He defended Trump policies and deflected all criticisms.\n\nEven now, after breaking with Mr. Trump over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, Mr. Pence can't seem to decide whether to bury or praise Caesar. He hasn't testified before the Jan. 6 committee, though has made clear he does not believe he had the authority to do what Mr. Trump asked of him on Jan. 6. The closest he's come to a direct rebuke was in a February speech to the Federalist Society, in which he said: \"I heard this week that President Trump said I had the right to overturn the election. President Trump is wrong.\"\n\nTaking a stronger stand against Mr. Trump would probably carry too big a cost, says the Indiana Republican. \"You can do that. But you can't be president,\" he says.\n\nLast year, Mr. Pence set up an Indianapolis-based advocacy organization, Advancing American Freedom, that he has used to raise money and support GOP candidates. In May, he notably campaigned for Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a fellow conservative who drew Mr. Trump's ire when he refused to overturn his state's 2020 electoral results. Despite a barrage of attacks from the former president, Governor Kemp never returned fire, focusing instead on his own record. He handily defeated his Trump-backed primary opponent.\n\nMr. Pence \"believes that the Republican Party is the party of the future and will continue to crisscross the country in support of conservative candidates that will return America to a path of safety and prosperity,\" says a spokesman for the former vice president.\n\nThe advisory board of Advancing American Freedom has several Trump administration alumni and prominent national conservatives. Among them is Ms. Dannenfelser of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, who praises Mr. Pence's actions on Jan. 6. \"He's a man who stood with principles and dignity. He did what his conscience told him to do. He does the hard things,\" she says.\n\nAnother board member is former Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Mr. Pence recently met with the DeVos family and other influential donors in Michigan, The Washington Post reported .\n\nMr. Pence's advisers are reportedly focused on South Carolina and its evangelical voters as key to a possible 2024 campaign. That strategy may run up against the reality that the former president remains extremely popular with white evangelicals who in 2016 decided to look past Mr. Trump's personal sins in pursuit of larger political goals. By putting three anti-abortion justices on the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump can say he delivered on his promises.\n\nOn the day Mr. Pence's legal counsel testified before the Jan. 6 committee, the Faith and Freedom Coalition held its annual gathering in Nashville, Tennessee. A year earlier, Mr. Pence had been booed at the same event in Orlando, and he skipped it this time. So he wasn't present when Mr. Trump dismissed the hearings as \"a complete and total lie,\" dangling pardons for convicted riot participants, and blasting Mr. Pence for certifying the 2020 electoral count.\n\n\"Mike Pence had a chance to be great. He had a chance to be frankly historic. But just like Bill Barr and the rest of these weak people, Mike - and I say it sadly because I like him - but Mike did not have the courage to act,\" Mr. Trump said .\n\nStill, the 2024 election is more than two years away, and Mr. Pence has time to try to win back alienated Trump supporters. And as longtime political observers know, any number of things could happen between now and then to scramble the race.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

While Mr. Trump was speaking, Mr. Pence's motorcade carried him through a heavily-secured Washington toward the Capitol, where thousands of Trump supporters were marching.\n\nMr. Pence has no unilateral power under the Constitution and congressional rules that govern the count. It is up to the House and Senate to voice objections, and states' electors were chosen in accordance with state law, not fraudulently.\n\nBeginning at 1 p.m., Mr. Pence began to open the certificates of the electoral votes from each state and present them to the appointed \"tellers\" from the House and Senate in alphabetical order. At the end of the count, Mr. Pence, seated on the House of Representatives' rostrum, has the task of announcing who has won the majority of votes for both president and vice president.\n\nDespite his largely ceremonial assignment, Mr. Pence has faced intense pressure from the president and legions of supporters who want the vice president to use the moment to overturn the will of the voters in a handful of battleground states.\n\nMr. Pence told Mr. Trump during their weekly lunch in the West Wing on Tuesday that he did not believe he had the power to unilaterally overturn electoral votes, according to a person briefed on the one-on-one conversation. This person was not authorized to publicly discuss the private discussion, which was first reported by The New York Times, and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nMr. Trump denied the report in a statement late Tuesday in which he continued to falsely assert Mr. Pence has powers he does not. But the vice president, whose office declined to discuss his plans, was not expected to deliver on Mr. Trump's request to overturn the electors, acknowledging he has no such unilateral power.\n\nMr. Pence has spent hours with staff and the Senate parliamentarian to prepare for Wednesday's joint session, including studying the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which governs the proceedings, and relevant legal opinions.\n\nIn fulfilling one of the few formal responsibilities of the vice presidency, Mr. Pence risks compromising his own political future. Mr. Pence is eyeing a run for the White House in 2024 and is banking on his years of loyalty to Mr. Trump, who could be a political kingmaker for years to come, to help him stand out in what is expected to be a crowded field.\n\nDespite claims by Mr. Trump and his allies, there was not widespread fraud in the election. This has been confirmed by a range of election officials and by William Barr, who stepped down as attorney general last month. Neither Mr. Trump nor any of the lawmakers promising to object to the count have presented credible evidence that would change the outcome.\n\nNevertheless, more than 100 House Republicans and a dozen Senate Republicans have said they will challenge the electoral votes of at least one state. Majorities in both chambers are required to reject the will of voters, but enough Republican lawmakers have said they will join with Democrats to reject the last-ditch move by Mr. Trump's allies.\n\nBy early afternoon Wednesday, thousands of people, riled up after President Donald Trump addressed the the crowd with his baseless claims of election fraud, descended on the U.S. Capitol as Congress prepared to vote to affirm Joe Biden's 2020 presidential win. The proceedings were halted when protestors breached the U.S. Capitol, erupting the House chambers into confusion and chaos.\n\nAs he faced growing pressure from allies to condemn the violence Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump tweeted, \"No violence!\" adding: \"Remember, WE are the Party of Law & Order - respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers repeatedly called for Mr. Trump to more vocally condemn the violence and to call to an end to the occupation.\n\nMr. Pence called on protesters to leave the Capitol immediately, going further than Mr. Trump who merely called for his supporters to \"remain peaceful.\"\n\nIn a tweet Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Pence said, \"This attack on our Capitol will not be tolerated and those involved will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nMore than two hours after protesters stormed the Capitol, Mr. Trump, in a video message, is urged supporters to \"go home\" but is also keeping up false attacks about the presidential election.\n\nMr. Trump opened his video, saying, \"I know your pain. I know your hurt. But you have to go home now.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

And so, six days after a deadly riot in the Capitol - spurred on by the fighting words of President Trump and crowd chants of \"Hang Mike Pence,\" followed by the vice president's certification of Joe Biden's victory - he is back to doing what he's always done: serving as the low-key, level-headed ballast to a mercurial president who both excited and repelled the American electorate.\n\nVice President Pence could never be another Trump, and that was the point. Mr. Trump made him running mate precisely because he would not overshadow the boss or try to usurp his power. And therein lies the paradox of Mr. Pence: He loyally served a president who proved to be perhaps the most controversial in history, and thus Mr. Pence himself may be finished in politics.\n\nMike Pence's top task as Donald Trump's vice president was to be loyal. Now, his loyalty to the Constitution has put him in a political no man's land.\n\n\"Pence clearly did his constitutional and legal duty, and he deserves credit for that,\" says Joel Goldstein, an expert on the vice presidency and law professor emeritus at St. Louis University. But until last week, he adds, Mr. Pence had gone \"way overboard in his public praise of Trump, diminishing the office and diminishing himself.\"\n\nA former Pence aide pushes back on the idea that the vice president is too politically damaged to run for president in 2024. \"Never say never,\" says the former aide, speaking on background. \"I'm not predicting, but I would anticipate that the vice president would do all the things necessary to preserve the right to say yes to running, if that's what he's called to do.\"\n\nConsider the incoming president. Mr. Biden himself served as vice president to a more charismatic boss and seemed finished in politics when he left office four years ago. But he rose to become the man for the moment, enough voters decided, both in the Democratic primaries and on Nov. 3, and in eight days, he will become the 46th president of the United States.\n\nMr. Biden's political ascension surely was not lost on Mr. Pence last week when he sat in the Senate chamber, presiding over the counting of Electoral College votes that elevated his predecessor to the presidency.\n\nAfter the insurrection, Mr. Pence was given the opportunity to take action against Mr. Trump, with calls for him to invoke the 25th Amendment of the Constitution on the grounds that the president is mentally unstable. Under its terms, the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet could implement that amendment, making Mr. Pence president temporarily. Mr. Trump would have recourse to fight the move.\n\nBut by all indications, Mr. Pence will not go that route. Instead, the House is poised to impeach Mr. Trump tomorrow for \"incitement of insurrection,\" which would make him the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice. When a trial would take place in the Senate remains uncertain.\n\nTuesday morning, as Mr. Trump prepared to take off on Air Force One for a visit to the border wall in Alamo, Texas, he called the second impeachment a \"continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics.\"\n\nIt was Mr. Trump's first public appearance since the siege of the Capitol, and his banning by Twitter and other social media, yet the day felt like business as usual. Mr. Pence, too, has gone back to his routine, presiding Monday over a meeting of the coronavirus task force, and on Tuesday, leading a video conference with governors on COVID-19 response and distribution of vaccines.\n\n\"He will do his duty until noon on Jan. 20,\" says the former Pence aide.\n\nUnlike Mr. Trump, the first president to skip his successor's inauguration in 152 years, Mr. Pence will also attend Mr. Biden's swearing-in, and is being received as an honored guest.\n\nTo some political analysts, the White House since Election Day has appeared consumed by politics and less focused on the day to day of governing.\n\n\"We've had a huge vacuum\" of leadership, says Susan Stokes, a political scientist at the University of Chicago and director of the school's Chicago Center on Democracy.\n\nIn one striking example last Friday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she spoke to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff about making sure an \"unhinged\" Mr. Trump didn't launch a nuclear attack.\n\n\"As a practical reality, Trump has absented himself since the election, and really a little before, from the business of being president,\" says Professor Stokes. \"He has shown no interest in the least, despite the cruelty of the pandemic.\"\n\nThe Biden transition team, in fact, has seemed to fill a bit of the vacuum - increasingly focused on messaging around the pandemic, reassuring the public that they will hit the ground running when they take office, amid a shaky start to the public vaccination program. On Friday, the Biden team announced a plan to release all available doses as soon as possible.\n\nPerhaps in response, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced Tuesday that the administration would no longer hold back the second shots of vaccine, to speed protection of as many Americans as possible.\n\nFor Mr. Pence, prominently filling any leadership vacuum was never on the table. He knows his lane, and sticks to it. That modus operandi has mostly worked for him, but last week it went terribly awry. Mr. Trump effectively threw Mr. Pence under the bus Jan. 6 when he urged his vice president to overturn the election result.\n\n\"I've never seen Pence as angry as he was today,\" his friend GOP Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma told the Tulsa World last Wednesday night. \"I had a long conversation with him. He said, 'After all the things I've done for [Trump].'\"\n\nAfter the Capitol riot, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence reportedly didn't speak for five days, ending the estrangement on Monday.\n\nIn reality, since then-Governor Pence of Indiana was named as running mate, the two have never been an easy fit. Mr. Trump is a thrice married, not-always-conservative populist known for making his own rules. The vice president calls himself \"a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican - in that order.\"\n\nMr. Pence pulled back from Mr. Trump in October 2016, when a tape of the GOP nominee bragging about sexually assaulting women came to light. At the time, he even reportedly told the Republican National Committee he'd be willing to serve at the top of the ticket, a move seen as almost coup-like.\n\nMemories of that episode have lingered. \"Trumpites never liked [Mr. Pence] nor forgave him for saying he should've replaced Trump,\" says a Republican source close to the White House. Also, nonevangelical and Roman Catholic Republicans have distrusted his \"religious side,\" the source adds, alluding to Mr. Pence's conversion away from Catholicism and to evangelicalism when he met his future wife.\n\nIn the end, if Trump enthusiasts and mainstream Republicans alike don't trust Mr. Pence, he could wind up without much of a base.\n\nBut, as his former aide says, 2024 is a ways off and there's no clear Trump heir apparent. Even if the Capitol rioters were ready to \"hang Pence,\" the aide says, they represent the radical fringe, not the mainstream.\n\nIt may well be that Mr. Pence's long association with Mr. Trump would doom him in 2024 - both because he stuck with Mr. Trump so long and then ultimately defied him.\n\nOr it may be that, just like the Democrats in 2020, the GOP will look for something other than a charismatic outsider at the top of its ticket. How the Republicans do in the 2022 midterms, with both Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence expected to campaign for candidates, could be telling.\n\nAnd, says former GOP Rep. Gregg Harper of Mississippi, who served alongside Mr. Pence in the House, his friend can point to the \"successes\" of the Trump years if he runs, including tax reform, moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and Middle East peace agreements.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

On Thursday, the Jan. 6 committee credited Mike Pence with demonstrating a strength of character far above what the authors of the Constitution were counting on when they designed a system of government they hoped would withstand the excesses of human ambition and a lust for power.\n\nIn its third hearing this month, the committee laid out how then-Vice President Pence resisted a weeks-long pressure campaign by Donald Trump to overturn or at least delay the certification of Joe Biden as president. The committee contrasted Mr. Pence's fidelity to the Constitution with what they portrayed as Mr. Trump's flagrant disregard for it.\n\nThey depicted Mr. Trump as using the Constitution at best as a fig leaf for his own wounded pride, personal ambition, and desire for revenge. Though some conservative scholars took issue with states' rapid and sweeping changes to election laws that led to unprecedented mail-in voting in 2020, the then-president based his call to \"Stop the Steal\" on unfounded claims of outright fraud. When that failed in the nation's courts, he brought on a lawyer who advanced a dubious claim that the Constitution authorized the vice president to disrupt Congress's counting of the electoral votes - but resorted to insults rather than legal reasoning when Mr. Pence refused.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee portrayed the republic as riding on the fidelity of individuals to the Constitution, whose checks and balances are being severely tested in an age of disinformation and rising political violence.\n\n\"The president latched on to a dangerous theory and would not let go because he was convinced it would keep him in office,\" said committee member Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat who led Thursday's hearing. \"We witnessed firsthand what happened when the president of the United States weaponized this theory.\"\n\nAs in the first two hearings, the committee on Thursday relied on Trump administration officials and other Republican witnesses to make its case, using video clips of committee depositions with Mr. Pence's chief of staff, Trump legal advisers, and Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.\n\nRetired conservative Judge J. Michael Luttig, who testified in person, called the Trump team's legal arguments \"beguiling and frivolous,\" saying they had \"no basis in the Constitution or the laws of the U.S.\"\n\nNone of the testimony or featured clips provided a defense of Mr. Trump or of the legal reasoning underpinning his strategy, spearheaded by scholar John Eastman, who pleaded the Fifth Amendment in his deposition with the committee.\n\nThe nine-member committee has been criticized on the right for excluding dissenting views. It includes just two Republicans, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused to seat two GOP members who had voted against certifying some states' electors, leading Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy to pull all five of his appointees. Mr. McCarthy, along with several other Republican lawmakers, has refused to cooperate with the committee despite being served with a subpoena.\n\nMr. Luttig warned that while Mr. Pence had prevented the country from plunging into \"revolution\" in January 2021, the former president and his allies \"are executing that blueprint for 2024 in open and plain view of the American public.\"\n\nIn 2019, Ohio State law professor Edward Foley warned of a potential constitutional crisis if Mr. Trump, in the wake of a close election, sought to manipulate the Jan. 6 congressional proceedings to try to get himself declared the rightful winner. That idea gained currency in Mr. Trump's circles at least two months before the November 2020 elections, and by early December Mr. Trump began actively lobbying Vice President Pence.\n\nUnder the 12th Amendment, Mr. Pence was to preside over a joint session of Congress to count the electoral votes from each state. As dozens of Mr. Trump's suits alleging election fraud and irregularities failed to gain traction in the nation's courts, the president argued that Mr. Pence could and should disrupt the counting.\n\nFrom the beginning, Mr. Pence's instinct was that the Constitution did not grant him the authority to do what Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman had laid out.\n\n\"The truth is, there's almost no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president,\" said Mr. Pence in a speech last summer, admitting that while it was disappointing to lose the election, more was at stake. \"If we lose faith in the Constitution, we won't just lose elections. We'll lose our country.\"\n\nMuch of the testimony in Thursday's hearing centered around the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which Congress passed after it had to intervene in a disputed presidential election eight years earlier. The law was meant to avoid such chaos from happening again, but Mr. Luttig and others say the wording is ambiguous and could be exploited by someone less scrupulous than Mr. Pence.\n\nGreg Jacob, the vice president's chief counsel, who also testified in person on Thursday, described to the Jan. 6 committee how he and his team had reviewed every electoral vote count in America's history, the 1876 disputed election, the legislative history of the Electoral Count Act, and every law review article written about its constitutionality. They also fended off two lawsuits filed against the vice president to compel him to \"exercise imagined extraconstitutional authority\" and essentially decide the election himself.\n\nTwo days before the joint session, Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman met with Mr. Pence and his top aides and laid out a pair of scenarios to provide Mr. Trump a path to victory: Reject the electors of key swing states outright, or send them back to the state legislatures, buying Mr. Trump time to pressure legislators to put forward new slates of electors who would certify him as the rightful winner.\n\nMr. Eastman recommended the latter course of action. However, Mr. Jacob testified that Mr. Eastman, when pressed, admitted that if that scheme was brought before the Supreme Court, it likely would be thrown out 9-0.\n\nWhite House lawyers also disagreed with Mr. Eastman's legal analysis, according to multiple Trump and Pence insiders. Mr. Kushner told the committee that he took White House Counsel Pat Cipollone's threats to resign as \"whining.\"\n\nThat night, Mr. Pence's outside counsel called Mr. Luttig for help. The retired judge, a conservative heavyweight in legal circles whom George W. Bush had reportedly considered nominating for the Supreme Court, had recently opened a Twitter account. With the help of his son, he published a thread of tweets that provided Mr. Pence the legal framework to dissent from the Trump-Eastman line of reasoning.\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 6, Mr. Trump called Mr. Pence and made one final push to change his mind. In a video clip played by the committee, Ivanka Trump testified that the conversation became \"heated,\" adding that it was \"a different tone\" than she'd heard her father take with Mr. Pence before.\n\nSeveral hours later, in his \"Save America\" rally speech, Mr. Trump called on Mr. Pence to \"do the right thing.\" \"All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to re-certify, and we become president, and you are the happiest people in the world,\" he said, urging his supporters to march on the Capitol to encourage lawmakers to support only the \"lawfully slated\" electors. \"Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy.\"\n\nAt the Capitol, rioters chanted \"Hang Mike Pence,\" and breached the Senate side of the building as the vice president was overseeing a challenge to Arizona's electors. Secret Service whisked him out of the chamber to his nearby office, then hurried him down a stairway just around the corner from rioters. They took him to a loading dock and urged him to evacuate. Nearly all of his entourage got in vehicles to depart the complex.\n\n\"But he looked at that and said: 'I don't want the world seeing the vice president leaving the Capitol in a 15-car motorcade,' \" his then-chief of staff Marc Short told CNN this week. \" 'This is the hallmark of democracy. And we're going to complete our work.' \"\n\nAround 8 p.m., Mr. Pence gaveled Congress back into session. Just before midnight, Mr. Eastman made one last plea to go through with their plan. Mr. Pence resisted to the last, and shortly before 4 a.m. Congress declared Joe Biden and Kamala Harris the winners of the 2020 election.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But as a president-in-waiting, he also has to walk a fine line as he seeks not to overstep his bounds.\n\nLoading...\n\nAug. 07, 2017, 3:25 p.m. ET | Washington\n\nOne is brash and unpredictable, the other a polite, reliable conservative. One is a novice at governing, the other a seasoned legislator and governor. And despite - or perhaps because of - their stark differences, President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have carved out a relationship that appears to work.\n\nMr. Trump has come to rely on Mr. Pence's advice and guidance, say people familiar with the workings of the West Wing, who add that Pence is often at his side. He is in many ways the \"anti-Trump,\" a reassuring presence to conservatives who are wary of the president, or even hostile. And until now, Pence has managed to escape the palace intrigues that have dominated Trump's first 200 days in office.\n\nThat's why the weekend story in The New York Times reporting that Pence may be quietly preparing to run for president himself in 2020, should Trump not be on the ballot, was so explosive. It suggested a hint of disloyalty by a vice president who has been vocally supportive of Trump from the day he was named to the ticket. Top presidential advisers have vigorously pushed back on the story. Pence himself issued a statement denouncing the article as \"disgraceful and offensive\" and calling it \"fake news.\"\n\nBut beneath the latest West Wing kerfuffle lies a deeper reality: that Pence has embarked on perhaps the most challenging vice presidency in history.\n\n\"He's facing a very complicated situation,\" says Joel Goldstein, a law professor at St. Louis University and author of the book \"The White House Vice Presidency: The Path to Significance, Mondale to Biden.\"\n\nThe office of vice president gained real stature only 40 years ago. It was President Jimmy Carter's VP, Walter Mondale, who established up front the role of a true governing partner, not just a successor. Every vice president since has operated on that model. But Pence is the first to play that role in a White House that is unusually light on governing experience. Pence has named George H.W. Bush as his model - which, perhaps not coincidentally, turns Trump into Ronald Reagan and Pence into a vice president who goes on to become president.\n\nPence's experience - 12 years in Congress and four years as governor of Indiana - makes him an essential asset. But as a president-in-waiting, Pence also has to walk a fine line as he seeks not to overstep his bounds.\n\nAnd in that, Pence has had to display a type of leadership that some call \"followership\" - to both induce people to follow him and also be a good follower himself, in the context of a Trump presidency that is pursuing policies and tactics that at times differ from his own approach.\n\nSo far, Pence has earned high marks from Republican regulars.\n\n\"He was born to be vice president,\" says Cam Savage, a Republican consultant from Indiana. \"He's a team player, he gives a great speech, he's easy to get along with, he's hard-working, he'll never embarrass you.\"\n\n\"You need someone to go halfway around world to make a good impression at a foreign leader's funeral? Slam dunk,\" Mr. Savage adds. \"You need a guy to hit the campaign trail and stump for a week at a time? He's your man. You need a guy to talk to a group of big-shot donors? Piece of cake. You need a guy to go on 'Meet the Press'? He's great on TV.\"\n\nThe challenge comes when the issue of succession becomes significant. \"It drives a wedge between the president and vice president, and their two teams,\" says Professor Goldstein.\n\nUnlike the Clinton presidency, in which the Lewinsky scandal broke in the second term, Trump's presidency has been tumultuous from the start - sparking early chatter about succession and jokes about \"President Pence.\"\n\nFor Pence, the role he plays for Trump is no laughing matter. And for a president adamant about his own primacy, any hint that Pence is thinking about anything other than Trump's needs is anathema. Yet it's clear that Pence has an eye on his political future. He recently replaced his chief of staff with a veteran political operative, Nick Ayers. And in May, he became the first sitting vice president to launch a leadership political action committee.\n\nThe new PAC, called Great America Committee, can be seen two ways: Its stated goal is to raise money to support Trump's reelection and congressional candidates who support Trump's agenda. But it also creates for Pence a separate power center that could further his own political career. The timing of its creation, a week after Trump fired the head of the FBI, has raised eyebrows.\n\n\"He claims he is doing it to help 2018 candidates,\" says a Republican strategist with ties to the White House. \"Normally you would raise [money] for the party, not your PAC. Notice he did it roughly one week after the Comey firing. This is about Pence's political future even if they don't outwardly say it.\"\n\nPence has long had his eye on the presidency, and is seen as a prospect for 2024. But the turmoil of Trump's early months in office has spawned what the Times called a GOP \"shadow campaign\" for 2020 - not just Pence, but also Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. Visits to early primary and caucus states by these politicos and others have fueled speculation.\n\nFor Pence, the layers of complication are many. If the Trump presidency crashes and burns, he will surely be tarnished. For the most part, Pence has managed to maintain enough separation from Trump that he hasn't been consumed by West Wing controversies. During the early flap over Trump's first national security adviser, Mike Flynn, Pence said he was \"out of the loop\" over Mr. Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador.\n\nAnd so Pence has managed to have it both ways - to be Trump's anchor but also absent at times.\n\nThe irony is, if Pence had run for president in 2016, Trump would certainly have eviscerated him, as he did the rest of the field. Instead, Trump plucked Pence from a gubernatorial reelection race that he was in danger of losing, and turned him into a presidential player.\n\n\"In a lot of ways, Trump and Pence are yin and yang - on matters of style and faith, and in how they operate,\" says Barry Bennett, who was a senior adviser to the Trump campaign. \"Pence loves details, Trump wants one-page memos.\"\n\nMr. Bennett adds that \"Pence's leash is quite long,\" and that he has earned Trump's respect. \"I think he trusts Mike Pence implicitly.\"\n\nThat is evident, for example, on Washington's posture toward Russia. Last week, while Trump was bashing Congress for imposing new sanctions on Russia, Pence praised the bill as sending an important message during a trip to three Eastern European countries.\n\nHis primary task has been to work Capitol Hill, where he rose to the House Republican leadership while in Congress. Marc Short, Trump's legislative affairs director, worked for Pence when he chaired the House Republican Conference.\n\nPence is a regular on the Hill, and not just to break ties in the Senate - the veep's only real constitutional power. Like the last Republican vice president, Dick Cheney, Pence often attends his party's Tuesday Senate lunches.\n\n\"He's appreciated here for his understanding of how the system works and what's possible,\" says Sen. Roy Blunt (R) of Missouri, who has known Pence for two decades.\n\nBut it may be the little things that capture the essence of Pence. In late July, as he was about to take off for his trip to Eastern Europe, a press pool report noted that he and his wife, Karen, held hands as they walked toward Air Force Two.\n\nOnce on board, the Pences make a surprise trip to the back of the plane, bearing cupcakes and brownies with red, white, and blue sprinkles, and birthday wishes for a reporter. Pence shook hands with every member of the press, welcoming them to his official plane and inquiring if everyone was comfortable.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The peaceful transfer of power is a hallmark of American history.\"\n\nTrump's remarks reflect his frustration with \"the obvious bias in the national media\" reporting in the last month of the election allegations that Trump sexually assaulted several women. Trump says all of the allegations are \"lies.\"\n\n\"When he talks about a rigged election, he's not talking about the fact that it's going to be rigged at the polls,\" former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani said. \"What he's talking about is that 80 percent to 85 percent of the media is against him.\"\n\nIn fact, Trump did warn, without evidence, about vote fraud in a tweet sent after his surrogates tried to reframe his remarks.\n\n\"The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD,\" Trump tweeted later Sunday.\n\nThe election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD\n\nGiuliani went on to say on CNN : \"I'm sorry, dead people generally vote for Democrats rather than Republicans,\" the former New York City mayor told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\" \"You want me to (say) that I think the election in Philadelphia and Chicago is going to be fair? I would have to be a moron to say that.\"\n\nHe added that the amount of cheating would only influence the outcome of  extremely close races. For example, if either Trump or Hillary Clinton won Pennsylvania by \"5 points,\" the cheating he claims would happen would not change the outcome.\n\nMuch of the cleanup duty falls to Pence, the Indiana governor trying to support the mercurial Trump without damaging his own future presidential prospects. On Sunday, that meant putting distance between himself and Trump over the very legitimacy of the Nov. 8 election after Trump on Saturday revived the claim that the FBI should have brought charges against Hillary Clinton over her use of a homebrewed email server.\n\n\"Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and should be in jail. Instead she is running for president in what looks like a rigged election,\" Trump tweeted to his 12 million followers on Saturday.\n\nHillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and should be in jail. Instead she is running for president in what looks like a rigged election\n\nAnswered Pence Sunday: \"We'll accept the will of the American people. You bet.\"\n\nThreatening to jail a political opponent and fueling public distrust of a popular election - to explain his loss, should that happen - was a striking breach of faith in American democracy. He has repeatedly claimed, without offering evidence, that election fraud is a serious problem and encouraged his mostly white supporters to \"go and watch\" polling places in certain areas to make sure things are \"on the up and up.\"\n\nTrump is struggling to shift the focus away from mounting accusations that he sexually assaulted women in ways similar to behavior he is recorded describing on a recently released video.\n\nThat puts Pence in the position of putting air between himself and the man at the top of the ticket.\n\nTrump, for example, has fought back against the allegations of sexual abuse by saying some of the accusers aren't attractive enough for him to assault, and by calling all of the charges \"lies.\"\n\nBut Pence on Sunday declined to make any such attacks.\n\n\"I wouldn't say anything to disparage any woman who believes they've had an experience like this,\" he said on NBC, adding that he believes Trump's denials.\n\nOn another subject, Pence was asked if he agrees with Trump's statement Saturday that Clinton was on drugs during the second debate and calling for drug testing before Wednesday's third and final showdown.\n\n\"All I know for sure is that Donald Trump is going to be ready for the debate on Wednesday night,\"Pence replied.\n\nAnd unlike Trump, Pence acknowledged Sunday - for the second time in recent weeks -  that evidence points to Russia being behind the hacking of Democratic emails. \"I think there's more and more evidence that implicates Russia and there should be serious consequences,\" he said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has denied any government sanctioned hacking of the US elections.\n\nPence appeared on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and \"Fox News Sunday.\" Giuliani was on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nPence is starting the week with campaign stops in Ohio. Pence is scheduled to hold rallies in Mason and Columbus on Monday afternoon.\n\nAfter a lull last month, high-level campaigning has accelerated in the perennial battleground state.\n\nRepublican Donald Trump campaigned here Thursday, while President Barack Obama and former president Bill Clinton also followed Democrat Hillary Clinton's return to the state last week.\n\nThe state's role this year shapes up to be potential spoiler for Trump's chances of reaching 270 electoral votes.\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton appears to have paths to the total needed for election without Ohio, the state's 18 votes are considered crucial for Trump.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Pence's AOL account was subjected to a phishing scheme last spring, before he was chosen by Donald Trump to join the GOP presidential ticket. Pence's contacts were sent an email falsely claiming that the governor and his wife were stranded in the Philippines and needed money.\n\nAs Trump's running mate, Pence frequently criticized rival Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server as former President Barack Obama's secretary of State, accusing her of purposely keeping her emails out of public reach and shielding her from scrutiny.\n\nSarah Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, doubled down on that defense, stressing to reporters on Air Force One that state and federal laws are different and claiming that his efforts to turn over the messages to be archived are \"why anybody even knows about the account.\"\n\n\"He did everything to the letter of the law,\" she said.\n\nPence spokesman Marc Lotter added that \"the comparison is absurd\" because Mrs. Clinton had set up a private server in her home at the start of her tenure at the State Department and, unlike Clinton, Pence did not handle any classified material as Indiana's governor.\n\nThe governor moved to a different AOL account with additional security measures, but is no longer using the new personal account since he was sworn-in as vice president, Mr. Lotter said.\n\nLotter said Pence \"maintained a state email account and a personal email account\" like previous governors in the state. At the end of his term Pence directed outside counsel to review all of his communications to ensure that state-related emails were transferred and properly archived by the state, the spokesman said.\n\nThe newspaper reported that the office of Pence's successor, Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb, released more than 30 pages from Pence's AOL account, but declined to release an unspecified number of emails because they were considered confidential.\n\nPublic officials are not barred from using personal email accounts under Indiana law, but the law is interpreted to mean that any official business conducted on private email must be retained to comply with public record laws.\n\nThe state requires all records pertaining to state business to be retained and available for public information requests. Emails involving state email accounts are captured on the state's servers, but any emails that Pence may have sent from his AOL account to another private account would need to be retained.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Mike Pence, the Republican vice presidential candidate, visited with House Republicans on Tuesday he was clearly happy to be among his peeps.\n\nThe former six-term member of the House called it \"an emotional return.\" Likewise, the House GOP leadership, particularly Speaker Paul Ryan, beamed alongside their former colleague at a joint press conference with Governor Pence, who came to the Hill to reassure skeptical House and Senate Republicans about their presidential standard bearer.\n\n\"We may not know Donald Trump, but we know Mike Pence, and we're glad that Mike Pence is here,\" said Rep. Dennis Ross (R) of Florida, a tea party favorite, speaking with reporters after the morning huddle.\n\nMany Republicans believe that Pence can serve as an important conduit between a politically inexperienced President Trump and Republicans on the Hill. He's well liked and has strong conservative credentials. Some view Pence, who once led House conservatives and served as No. 3 in the House GOP leadership, as particularly helpful with hard-line Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus.\n\n\"I think Pence can be the Freedom Caucus whisperer,\" says John Feehery, former spokesman for Republican Dennis Hastert of Illinois, when he was House speaker in the 2000s. The biggest challenge for a President Trump, says Mr. Feehery, will be the House, which has become dysfunctional due to the intra-party split with hardliners.\n\n\"If Trump wants to get anything done, he'll have to go through the House first,\" Feehery says. \"Pence is really, really important to a strategy to get any kind of agenda through.\"\n\nEvery White House needs to build bridges to Congress to accomplish anything of significance. That can be particularly challenging when an \"outsider\" occupies the Oval Office - though the liaison need not always be the vice president.\n\nWhen a peanut farmer and former governor of Georgia named Jimmy Carter moved to Pennsylvania Avenue in 1977, he relied heavily on Vice President Walter Mondale, a former senator, to connect him with members of his own party. Same for President Reagan, who turned to his vice president, George H. W. Bush, the consummate Washington insider and a former member of Congress.\n\nPresidents such as Reagan and Bill Clinton can become their own most effective lobbyists on the Hill, as Reagan was with Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill and President Clinton was with former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Indeed, if Hillary Clinton is elected, she could well be a hands-on negotiator, given her policy chops and senatorial background, observers say.\n\nDespite the turnover since Pence left Congress in 2013, when he become Indiana's governor, \"he knows how the House operates, and could play a role there,\" particularly as a conduit of Republican members' views back to a President Trump, says Norman Ornstein, a longtime congressional and political observer at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington.\n\nBut Mr. Ornstein and others caution about overestimating the powers of Pence.\n\nThe former congressman may be popular among Republicans for his conservative views and integrity, but \"it's not as if he's going to have connections with or be persuasive with any Democrats, and he doesn't really know the Senate,\" Ornstein says.\n\nHe doubts, for instance, that Pence would have the cross-party cachet of Vice President Joe Biden, who served in the Senate for more than three decades. The vice president became known as the \"the McConnell whisperer\" for his ability to cut budget and fiscal deals with Sen. Mitch McConnell (R) of Kentucky, who is now the Senate majority leader.\n\nWhen visiting the Senate Tuesday, Pence gave out his cellphone number to GOP senators and encouraged them to call him, Sen. Bob Corker (R) of Tennessee told the Associated Press.\n\nAt the same time, Ornstein wonders whether Pence and a President Trump would develop a very close relationship or continue the longstanding tradition of weekly lunches between the president and vice president to discuss strategy. Trump and Pence are getting to know each other, but they've largely campaigned separately.\n\n\"There's no sense that Trump has people in his entourage who he sees as equals or peers,\" says Ornstein. \"They're subordinates.\"\n\nAnother asterisk to Pence as congressional interlocutor is the \"huge vacuum\" in the White House that's likely to result from Trump's lack of political experience and knowledge about Congress, says John Pitney, a congressional expert and professor of political science at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif.\n\n\"That means a lot of infighting and political scrambling for position,\" says Mr. Pitney. \"If Trump picks a chief of staff with congressional experience, that person would probably fight to be the main contact with Congress.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nWhat would make things particularly challenging for Republicans on the Hill is \"the extent to which Trump really doesn't have connections to the Republican party,\" Pitney points out. The billionaire was once a Democrat and has supported Democrats in the not too distant past.\n\n\"Pence could whisper all he wants, but the question is, will Trump listen?\" he adds.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Pro-Trump rioters were rampaging through the Capitol building yelling \"Hang Mike Pence,\" as Mr. Pence and his family huddled in an underground parking bay. But when a Secret Service agent asked him to get into a waiting car, he refused.\n\n\"He was determined that we would complete the work that we had begun that day,\" Mr. Pence's legal counsel, Greg Jacob, told the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack.\n\nThat work, of course, was the certification of Joe Biden as the next president.\n\nCredited with averting a constitutional crisis, the former vice president faces the ire of Trump allies. But for a No. 2 perpetually in his boss's shadow, it could turn out to be the opening Mr. Pence needed.\n\nMr. Pence's emergence as one of the heroes of the Jan. 6 hearings - which detailed how he resisted an intense pressure campaign by former President Donald Trump to get him to block the counting of electoral votes - has placed him in a singular political position. After four years of loyal service, he's now spurned by Trump allies as a turncoat, even as Democrats and some former Trump aides see him as a savior of democracy. During Tuesday's hearing, Trump White House attorney Pat Cipollone testified that Mr. Pence had done the \"courageous thing\" and deserved a Presidential Medal of Honor.\n\nAs the jockeying for 2024 heats up, with Mr. Trump rumored to be nearing a formal announcement, Mr. Pence is laying the groundwork for a run that could pit him against his former boss.\n\nAt best, he faces a difficult balancing act. The former vice president, who was booed at a gathering of conservative activists last year, has been touting the Trump administration's policy achievements and has refrained from criticizing Mr. Trump - even after the Jan. 6 hearings revealed the president's lack of concern for his safety.\n\nYet for a vice president who was perpetually in Mr. Trump's shadow and never seemed destined to inherit the MAGA mantle, it's also possible Jan. 6 has given Mr. Pence the opening he needed.\n\nIn some ways, the former Indiana governor represents a throwback to the GOP of old, before Mr. Trump jettisoned much of its post-Reagan orthodoxy and norms of governance. Beneath the Midwestern humility is a deeply conservative policy agenda, undergirded by close ties to Charles Koch and other GOP donors. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Mr. Pence pointedly called for a nationwide abortion ban. Next week, he's heading to South Carolina, a key early primary state, to give a talk about \"the post-Roe world.\"\n\nMr. Pence's evangelical faith also goes hand in hand with an emphasis on decency and decorum that contrasts sharply with Mr. Trump's performative pugilism.\n\n\"He's never made an enemy in his life - with one notable exception,\" says one Indiana Republican, who asked for anonymity so he could talk freely.\n\nIf Mr. Pence can build a coalition of religious conservatives, Trump-weary Republicans, and just enough MAGA devotees who don't hold Jan. 6 against him, it could be enough to emerge from a crowded field. It's also conceivable he could wind up as a kind of consensus candidate, the elder statesman to whom the party turns if flashier front-runners flame out - not unlike Mr. Biden in 2020.\n\n\"Mike's greatest advantage is that people underestimate him,\" says John Gregg, an Indiana Democrat who lost a 2012 gubernatorial race to Mr. Pence. \"He's tireless, and he's focused. I've never met anyone who stays on message more than Mike Pence.\"\n\nDespite Mr. Trump's popularity among the base, polls and focus groups indicate that many Republican voters are open to or might even prefer a different candidate as their party's nominee in 2024 . As a result, an ever-growing number of would-be candidates are already testing the waters.\n\nThose making the rounds in New Hampshire include Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Tim Scott of South Carolina, former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who leads the pack of Trump alternatives in early GOP primary polls, has so far stayed away.\n\nIn May, Mr. Pence spoke to a sold-out dinner at a New Hampshire winery, hosted by the Rockingham County GOP chapter. He extolled the Trump administration's conservative record, including the appointment of three Supreme Court justices and 300 federal judges. It was, he boasted, \"the most pro-life administration in American history.\"\n\nWhat went unsaid by Mr. Pence was what he did to usher out that administration on Jan. 6. Much of the GOP base is still upset by Mr. Trump's defeat and not inclined to cut Mr. Pence any slack.\n\nJ. David Bernardy, a Republican state legislator who attended the dinner, concedes that Mr. Pence was constitutionally bound to certify the 2020 election results - but says allegations of fraud should have been investigated more fully. (Senior Trump administration officials, including former Attorney General Bill Barr, testified to the committee that they investigated and found no evidence of widespread fraud.)\n\nThe bigger issue, to Mr. Bernardy, is what he sees as Mr. Pence's passivity. \"The defining issue for me is strength against a virulent Democratic Party,\" he says, arguing that Mr. Pence failed to stand up to public health officials when he ran the White House COVID-19 task force. Mr. Pence is \"a very nice, soft-spoken, and genial guy,\" he concludes, but he's not the best choice to \"counter the absolute horror going on in Washington now.\"\n\nSrinivasan Ravikumar, a retired engineer and another local GOP official, says he appreciates Mr. Pence's temperate style and conservative values. But he's unhappy that the vice president \"rubber stamped\" Mr. Biden's electors. \"I think he went into survival mode after the election, and that doesn't strike me as right,\" he says.\n\nSuch attitudes are common among GOP voters here, say party strategists. The vice president \"always gets a respectful welcome\" in New Hampshire, says Jerry Sickels, who worked for the Trump campaign in 2016. But Mr. Pence's role on Jan. 6 will unquestionably hang over any presidential run. \"It's a hurdle for him to overcome with the rank and file, no question about that,\" he says.\n\nIt's possible lingering anger over the 2020 election will fade as Republicans start to look to 2024. And the blows to Mr. Trump's credibility from the House committee hearings and his exposure to potential criminal charges could weaken him.\n\nBut even if some GOP voters are growing wary of another Trump campaign, they seem to be leaning toward Trump-like alternatives. A UNH Granite State Poll found Governor DeSantis statistically tied with Mr. Trump among likely Republican primary voters. These voters \"have a basically positive attitude towards the former president,\" says Dante Scala, a politics professor at the University of New Hampshire. But \"they're open to moving on.\"\n\nMr. Pence trailed far behind in third place in the same poll, which was taken in June after the first televised Jan. 6 hearings. Of 13 potential candidates polled, he was the only one with a negative favorability rating. \"For core Trump voters, he's seen as a traitor,\" Professor Scala says.\n\n\"I think he's dead in the water. He may not realize it,\" says Thomas Patterson, a professor of government at Harvard University.\n\nMike Pence never set out to make political enemies. Quite the opposite, says Mr. Gregg, who first met him at law school and has remained on cordial terms with him, even after their hard-fought campaign for governor.\n\nWhen Mr. Pence became a conservative talk-radio host in the 1990s, he would regularly interview Mr. Gregg, then Democratic speaker of the Indiana House. Their policy debates were always respectful, he says. \"There was never anyone more professional, kinder, and more appreciative,\" he says.\n\nRadio proved a perfect fit for the mellifluous tones of Mr. Pence, who called himself \"Rush Limbaugh on decaf.\" It also gave him statewide name recognition, and in 2000 he won an open primary and was elected to the U.S. House. Raised a Roman Catholic, he converted to evangelicalism in college and would become a dogged advocate against abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\nHis six-term legislative record in Congress was thin; he never wrote a successful bill. But Mr. Pence was among the first to try to cut off federal funding for abortion services, says Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. \"It was a time when touching Planned Parenthood was the third rail. He was really a pioneer,\" she says.\n\nBy 2008, Mr. Pence had risen to the third rank in House Republican leadership. He had also drawn the attention of the Koch brothers and other conservative donors in their network, which favored candidates who opposed taxes and regulations, particularly on fossil fuel industries.\n\nMarc Short, his chief of staff in the House and later in the White House, arranged for Mr. Pence to speak at a Koch fundraising retreat in 2009, according to a 2017 New Yorker article. Mr. Short, who has testified to the Jan. 6 committee and was with Mr. Pence that day, later became president of the Kochs' \"dark-money\" political organization. Other former Pence staffers also worked for Koch political and corporate entities.\n\nAfter Mr. Pence was elected governor of Indiana in 2012, he continued to build a national profile, leaning into cultural war issues and fueling speculation of a future presidential run. \"There was never any doubt in my mind that Mike wanted to go [back] to Washington, D.C. Being the governor was just a steppingstone,\" says Mr. Gregg.\n\nIn 2015, Mr. Pence signed a controversial religious freedom bill that critics said permitted companies to discriminate against LGBTQ individuals. The bill, later rescinded, sparked corporate boycotts of Indiana that soured some donors on Mr. Pence's social agenda and set up an unexpectedly tough rematch against Mr. Gregg.\n\n\"A lot of people thought his time as governor was winding down,\" says Andrew Downs, a political science professor at Indiana's Purdue University Fort Wayne.\n\nThen, Mr. Pence was handed an opportunity. In July 2016, after several other mainstream Republicans had taken a pass, Mr. Trump announced him as his running mate, reportedly praising Mr. Pence backstage as \"straight from central casting.\"\n\nIn joining the ticket, Mr. Pence's goal may not have been to play second fiddle in the White House as much as it was to set himself up as a presidential contender in 2020, says Joel Goldstein, professor emeritus of law at St. Louis University and an expert on the vice presidency.\n\nAt that stage, a Trump presidency seemed to most observers a long shot. \"His calculation was that he would inherit Trump supporters and join that to the religious right support that he had,\" Mr. Goldstein says. \"What he didn't bargain on is that he would win.\"\n\nOnce elected, Vice President Pence served as a loyal lieutenant, displaying a solidarity that critics likened to sycophancy. During Mr. Trump's most controversial moments, such as when he seemed to offer praise for neo-Nazis or shared discredited COVID-19 treatments, Mr. Pence never betrayed any public discomfort. He defended Trump policies and deflected all criticisms.\n\nEven now, after breaking with Mr. Trump over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, Mr. Pence can't seem to decide whether to bury or praise Caesar. He hasn't testified before the Jan. 6 committee, though has made clear he does not believe he had the authority to do what Mr. Trump asked of him on Jan. 6. The closest he's come to a direct rebuke was in a February speech to the Federalist Society, in which he said: \"I heard this week that President Trump said I had the right to overturn the election. President Trump is wrong.\"\n\nTaking a stronger stand against Mr. Trump would probably carry too big a cost, says the Indiana Republican. \"You can do that. But you can't be president,\" he says.\n\nLast year, Mr. Pence set up an Indianapolis-based advocacy organization, Advancing American Freedom, that he has used to raise money and support GOP candidates. In May, he notably campaigned for Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a fellow conservative who drew Mr. Trump's ire when he refused to overturn his state's 2020 electoral results. Despite a barrage of attacks from the former president, Governor Kemp never returned fire, focusing instead on his own record. He handily defeated his Trump-backed primary opponent.\n\nMr. Pence \"believes that the Republican Party is the party of the future and will continue to crisscross the country in support of conservative candidates that will return America to a path of safety and prosperity,\" says a spokesman for the former vice president.\n\nThe advisory board of Advancing American Freedom has several Trump administration alumni and prominent national conservatives. Among them is Ms. Dannenfelser of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, who praises Mr. Pence's actions on Jan. 6. \"He's a man who stood with principles and dignity. He did what his conscience told him to do. He does the hard things,\" she says.\n\nAnother board member is former Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Mr. Pence recently met with the DeVos family and other influential donors in Michigan, The Washington Post reported .\n\nMr. Pence's advisers are reportedly focused on South Carolina and its evangelical voters as key to a possible 2024 campaign. That strategy may run up against the reality that the former president remains extremely popular with white evangelicals who in 2016 decided to look past Mr. Trump's personal sins in pursuit of larger political goals. By putting three anti-abortion justices on the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump can say he delivered on his promises.\n\nOn the day Mr. Pence's legal counsel testified before the Jan. 6 committee, the Faith and Freedom Coalition held its annual gathering in Nashville, Tennessee. A year earlier, Mr. Pence had been booed at the same event in Orlando, and he skipped it this time. So he wasn't present when Mr. Trump dismissed the hearings as \"a complete and total lie,\" dangling pardons for convicted riot participants, and blasting Mr. Pence for certifying the 2020 electoral count.\n\n\"Mike Pence had a chance to be great. He had a chance to be frankly historic. But just like Bill Barr and the rest of these weak people, Mike - and I say it sadly because I like him - but Mike did not have the courage to act,\" Mr. Trump said .\n\nStill, the 2024 election is more than two years away, and Mr. Pence has time to try to win back alienated Trump supporters. And as longtime political observers know, any number of things could happen between now and then to scramble the race.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "Mike Pence is set to launch his presidential campaign next week\n\nMike Pence plans to enter the GOP presidential nomination fray June 7 with a campaign video and a kickoff speech in Des Moines, Iowa, according to a person familiar with his launch schedule.\n\nThe former vice president, a longtime advocate of the priorities of traditional conservatives on social and economic issues, will join the race at a time when his onetime boss, former President Donald Trump, claims a majority in most national polls and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is in a clear second place.\n\nRedefining himself to Republican voters, most of whom know him primarily as Trump's vice president, will be a challenge.\n\nBut the Indiana-bred Pence views his fellow Midwesterners in the Iowa GOP, and their first-in-the-nation caucuses, as a hospitable home for his brand of politics. Typically, the Iowa caucuses play a winnowing role in the nomination fight, providing rocket fuel to a handful of candidates while burying the hopes of the rest.\n\n\"We view this race as absolutely wide open, and Iowa is really going to solidify itself as the pivotal player,\" the person familiar with Pence's plans said. \"It's a place that values Mike Pence's principles - traditional conservative principles - deep-rooted faith and uncommon character.\"\n\nThe former vice president will campaign in all 99 Iowa counties before the caucuses, the person said, adding that the campaign \"will do the things that put Mike Pence in an advantageous position.\"\n\nThat includes a lot of retail politicking, from town hall-style meetings with Iowans to drop-by sessions at restaurants. In those sessions, he will have to explain to Republican voters why he split from Trump and certified their 2020 election loss Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nA pro-Trump mob sacked the U.S. Capitol that day in an effort to stop the certification, and some of the rioters chanted \" hang Mike Pence .\"\n\nRead more on NBC News\n\nAs he weighed a campaign in recent months, Pence showed a willingness to separate himself from Trump on policy for the first time since becoming his running mate in 2016. In particular, Pence has unequivocally backed U.S. support for Ukraine and said that Congress and the White House should consider cuts to Medicare and Social Security - positions at odds with those articulated by Trump.\n\nPence, who served a dozen years in the House and four years as Indiana's governor, has long been one of the Republican Party's most vocal leaders pushing the priorities of social conservatives on everything from abortion to LGBTQ rights . His record also shows a Reagan-era affinity for lower taxes, less regulation and robust defense spending.\n\nDespite their falling out, Pence's criticism of Trump has generally been indirect. The same goes for his approach to DeSantis, with whom he also disagrees on U.S. engagement in Ukraine. Still, the former vice president's entrance into the race injects someone who has been defined for many Americans - for better and worse - by his decision to stand up to Trump when the presidency and the rule of law were on the line.\n\nThe field of contenders is growing more crowded by the week, with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum set to jump into the race in the coming days. That's a testament to Trump's failure to convince Republican rivals that he is invincible and DeSantis' inability to establish himself as Trump's sole rival.\n\nFor Pence, winning the nomination would represent a long and improbable path back to prominence. He'll take the first step in Des Moines next Wednesday, June 7, which is also his 64th birthday.\n\n\"What better place to do your announcement than a place that's going to be so pivotal in the future of the nation,\" the person familiar with his plans said. \"It certainly conveys the importance that we're placing on the state.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

The Court's landmark and historic ruling affirmed for the first time in history that the Speech or Debate Clause extends to the Vice President of the United States.

      "text": "Mike Pence rejects Trump's call to let U.S. default as he hints at 2024 White House bid\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday highlighted sharp differences with his former boss, rejecting ex-President Donald Trump 's stances on the debt ceiling and Ukraine while stoking more speculation about his 2024 presidential ambitions.\n\n\"When it comes to the debt ceiling, failure is not an option,\" Pence said on CNBC's \" Squawk Box .\" \"We can't accept default, we can't minimize the impact that would have on American families and American credibility in the world.\"\n\nPence's remarks came in response to a question about Trump's recent call for Republicans to let the U.S. default on its debt if Democrats will not agree to \"massive\" spending cuts. The White House and congressional leaders are in deep negotiations to prevent a default by early June, which is when the government could run out of money to pay its bills.\n\nThe former vice president also accused Trump and President Joe Biden of holding \"identical\" spending-heavy fiscal policy views, even as he called to make permanent the \"Trump-Pence tax cuts\" of 2017.\n\nBut when he was asked about whether defense spending cuts could be part of a plan to return to \"fiscal solvency,\" Pence balked.\n\n\"At a time when China is literally floating a new battleship every month and continuing military provocations across the Asia-Pacific and Russia's waging an unprovoked war in Eastern Europe, the last thing we ought to be doing is cutting defense spending,\" Pence said.\n\nPence is openly weighing a campaign for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, and his remarks Wednesday morning - delivered from the key primary state of New Hampshire, where he was set to appear at multiple events this week - offered more hints about his plans.\n\n\"We'll let our intentions be known, I'm confident, before the end of June,\" Pence said of his possible presidential campaign announcement. \"The reason I came here to New Hampshire in part is because when you're in New Hampshire, it seems like you get a little bit more attention when you're talking about things that matter.\"\n\nTrump is currently the clear polling favorite in the Republican primary field, even when including figures like Pence and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is expected to mount a competitive presidential bid in the coming weeks.\n\nPence reaffirmed his view that there will be \" better choices \" than Trump for president in 2024, before rattling off a number of his policy disagreements with the front-runner.\n\n\"The [former] president and I have a difference in terms of American leadership in the world. I think we need to lean in and support the Ukrainian military and repel the Russian invasion. I think that's in our interest and the interest of the free world,\" Pence said.\n\nTrump has called for an immediate end to the conflict in Ukraine , which began when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion into the neighboring nation. Trump, who in the past has praised Putin, has offered few details about how that peace could be achieved. In a recent CNN town hall, Trump would not say which nation he thought should win the war, and refused to say if he thought Putin was a war criminal.\n\nPence said that backing Ukraine \"also sends a decisive message to China with their military provocations.\"\n\nOn foreign policy and domestic issues, the U.S. has \"got to demand leadership that will stand firm and achieve these things,\" Pence said, before touting his lengthy record in politics. \"I know what can get done.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

That's the share of voters who support Pence for the GOP nomination in hypothetical primary matchups, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling average.\n\nPence filed candidacy paperwork Monday with the Federal Election Commission and debuted his campaign in a video Wednesday in which he made a veiled reference to Trump, noting \"different times call for different leadership.\" Pence, who bills himself as the traditional Republican candidate in the race and leans into his Christian faith, said in the video America needs a leader \"that'll appeal, as Lincoln said, to the better angels of our nature.\" He also accused President Joe Biden and \"the radical left\" of weakening \"America at home and abroad,\" citing rising inflation, declining wages and what he said was a looming recession (though the U.S. jobs market continues to post better-than-expected monthly gains that have cooled recession fears). Most of Pence's previous condemnations of Trump has centered around his actions in the lead up to January 6, though over the weekend, at an event in Iowa, Pence took a swipe at Trump for his positive rhetoric about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and repeated the criticism in his Wednesday speech.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum also announced they were joining the growing field for the GOP nomination this week, bringing the total number of Trump challengers to at least nine. Trump leads in most 2024 primary polls, but his closest rival is Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nDespite his criticism of Trump, Pence told Fox News he would support the Republican nominee for president, \"especially if it's me,\" he said following his speech.

Pence's memoir \"So Help Me God,\" provided $1.4 million in advance payments. He got another $3.4 million from delivering 32 speeches.\n\nPence conducts his speaking, writing and consulting through a company called Hoosier Heartland LLC. The disclosure listed business income for that entity of $1.8 million. Pence also noted a $381,000 salary from Hoosier Heartland.\n\nThe disclosure also shows two family trusts, one of which is worth more than $1 million and has kicked off somewhere between $100,000 and $1 million of income since the start of 2022. The second trust is much smaller, worth just $50,000 to $100,000.\n\nIt's big money for Pence, a 64-year-old former radio host, who wasn't all that rich when he served as vice president. Forbes estimated his fortune at $1 million in 2019. Virtually all of that came from state and federal pensions, the result of 18 years in public life, first as a U.S. representative, then as Indiana's governor, then as the country's vice president. Based on his first fourteen years as a federal employee, Pence was eligible to collect an estimated $50,000 per year for the rest of his life. For his four years of gubernatorial work, he was entitled to at least 30% of his salary, or about $35,000 annually.\n\nBack in 2019, Pence didn't even appear to own a home of his own, having lived in the Indiana Governor's mansion before settling into Number One Observatory Circle in Washington, D.C., where vice presidents have resided for decades. Pence returned to Indiana and snapped up a five-acre estate in 2021 for $1.9 million.\n\nOther than that home, which he was not required to disclose on the recent filing, Pence and his wife listed more than $1.7 million of assets, including the two family trusts. The couple appears to have divested a broad stock portfolio in one of the trusts ahead of Pence's presidential run. They now hold at least $1 million between a money market account and a Fidelity index fund that tracks the broader market. The next biggest asset listed on the disclosure is Hoosier Heartland, which is valued at least $500,000. The Pences' 401(k) plans through the company are worth at least another $95,000."

More Legion Hall Post 27 in Londonderry, New Hampshire, on August 4, 2023. (Photo by Joseph Prezioso / AFP) (Photo by JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nI have a lot more to cover on the recently released Statistical Review of World Energy. But today I need to make a digression, albeit one with a tie-in to the Review.\n\nPresidential hopeful Mike Pence has just released a new campaign ad on energy policy. You can view the ad here , and you can read all about Pence's energy plans here . The ad is so misleading, it must be addressed.\n\nPence has been widely ridiculed for a couple of obvious issues in the video. He doesn't select a grade. He doesn't pay for the gas. You can hear the sound of the pump beeping as he pretends to pump, but he doesn't actually squeeze the handle at all. Those aren't the substantive issues, though.\n\nThe video starts out with Pence asking, \"Remember $2.00 a gallon gas? And then Joe Biden became President of the United Sates and launched his war on energy. Since that time, gasoline prices are up 60%.\"\n\nLet's take this first. If he's speaking strictly of gas at $2.00 a gallon, the only time that happened during his term as Vice President was when the Covid-19 pandemic briefly crashed the economy in the first half of 2020. (Gasoline pricing data can be found here ).\n\nWhen all the stay-at-home orders were implemented in 2020, the demand for gasoline crashed, oil prices briefly went negative, and gasoline prices fell to around $2.00 a gallon for two months. Afterward, they began rising sharply, and by the time Trump and Pence left office the following January, the price had escalated back to nearly $2.50 a gallon.\n\nIf Pence is talking loosely in the $2.00 a gallon range, the average gasoline price during the four years while Pence was Vice President was $2.57 a gallon. Prices did indeed rise sharply after Biden took office, but it wasn't due to any war on energy. More on this is discussed below.\n\nThe price of gasoline surged as the world started recovering from the Covid pandemic, commencing in mid-2020. This occurred because a substantial amount of oil production had been shut down in 2020 due to crashing oil prices, but then the demand began to rebound faster than supply could respond.\n\nThis scenario wasn't exclusive to the U.S.; every country around the world experienced a significant spike in gasoline prices. Furthermore, when Russia invaded Ukraine, prices spiked once again. Once more, this repercussion was observed in every nation globally.\n\nNone of that is meant to imply that the Biden Administration has passed policies friendly to the oil and gas industry. For the most part, the administration has been fairly hostile. However, that's not why gasoline prices shot higher.\n\nHowever, this isn't the worst of Pence's ad. While we could engage in a debate about the reasons for the rise in gasoline prices, some might argue that it was due to Biden's energy policies. Nonetheless, it would be quite peculiar to believe that Biden's energy policies could lead to an increase in gasoline prices worldwide.\n\nIn fact, in 2021 a friend from Uganda told me that gasoline prices had risen by 50% there. I asked him who the people blame. \"Our President.\" So, it's probably common in every country to blame political leaders for high gasoline prices, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are the actual cause.\n\nIn the video clip, Pence went on to say that he has just launched a new energy plan \"that will not only put the U.S. back on the path to energy independence, but by 2040 we will reclaim America's role as the leading producer of energy in the world.\"\n\nThis is where he goes completely off the rails. Someone needs to ask Pence, \"How are you defining energy independence?\" I have covered this before. See my previous article for a deeper dive into this topic.\n\nIf energy independence is defined to be \"We don't import any energy\", then we haven't been energy independent in at least 70 years. We haven't even been close, because we import a lot of oil that gets refined and then reexported as finished products.\n\nBut if Pence defines the phrase to mean \"We produce more energy than we consume\", then we were more energy independent in 2022 than we been in at least 70 years.\n\nSecond, his claim about reclaiming America's role as the leading energy producer is highly misleading and requires a great deal of context.\n\nPresently, the U.S. is the leading producer of oil in the world. According to the 2023 Statistical Review , in 2022 the U.S. produced 17.8 million barrels oil per day (bpd). This includes the category of lease condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs), and I will do a deeper dive on this in the next article.\n\nThe second and third leading oil producers were Saudi Arabia (12.1 million bpd) and Russia (11.2 million bpd). China produced only 4.1 million bpd. You will see below why I am including China.\n\nThe U.S. is also the world's leading natural gas producer. In 2022, the U.S. produced an average of 94.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d). Russia was second at 59.8 bcf/d, Iran was third at 25.1 bcf/d, and China was fourth at 21.5 bcf/d.\n\nThe U.S. is the world's leading producer of nuclear power. We produced about 30% of the world's nuclear power in 2022, which was about twice China's production.\n\nThe one area where China has a substantial lead is in coal production. Last year China produced 4.56 billion metric tons of coal. The U.S. produced 539 million metric tons.\n\nIf you convert everything into the same energy units, China does have the overall lead, but only because of their massive coal production. The U.S., however, leads in the far more important categories of oil and natural gas production. We produce more than quadruple China's oil and natural gas production.\n\nPence's plan is almost exclusively focused on oil and natural gas production. Coal is barely mentioned in the plan, but massive coal production is the only reason China is ahead in overall energy production.\n\nThis is certainly not what Pence implies, which is why the ad, and his energy policy plan are so misleading. Pence implies that the U.S. is falling behind on oil and gas production, when we lead the world by far in both categories. You certainly wouldn't think that from Pence's ad.\n\nThe U.S. set a new oil production record in 2022 (again, including condensate and NGLs). But if you omit the NGLs, the U.S. was still the top producer, and still nearly set a new record in 2022 (and is on a path to set a new record this year). For natural gas, the U.S. set new records in 2021 and 2022, after Covid caused a small decline in 2020.\n\nHere's the bottom line. On the one hand, the Biden Administration's energy policies haven't been friendly to the oil and gas industry. Nevertheless, the industry continues to set new production records. Further, the industry itself made more money in two years under President Biden than it did in four years under Vice President Pence.\n\nSo, it's hard to make a case that Biden's energy policies have created havoc in the industry. Sure, the oil and gas industry would like friendlier policies. But Pence doesn't give an accurate picture of the current status of the U.S. oil and gas industry."

      "text": "How Mike Pence Became A Millionaire From Government Pensions\n\nBy Chase Peterson-Withorn\n\nBy Chase Peterson-Withorn ,\n\nForbes Staff.\n\nThis is the first in a series that explores the personal fortunes of President Trump's cabinet officials . See more on William Barr , Steven Mnuchin , Wilbur Ross and Betsy DeVos .\n\nM ike Pence doesn't have all that much to his name. He doesn't appear to own a home, and he hasn't saved much besides $65,000 in index funds, at most, and less than $15,000 in a bank account.\n\nLuckily, Pence works for the government. That means taxpayers are on the hook to fund the 60-year-old vice president's retirement through his state and federal pensions. Those pensions, which will likely pay Pence at least $85,000 per year for the rest of his life, are worth a combined $1.2 million-enough to push Pence's net worth to an estimated $1 million after factoring in his six-figure student loan debt.\n\nRead more in our series: Attorney General Bill Barr's $40 Million Fortune\n\nUnlike Wilbur Ross and Steven Mnuchin, who built immense portfolios, or even Betsy DeVos, who grew up with one business fortune and married into another, Mike Pence has little notable experience in the private sector. Instead he has spent two decades earning government paychecks and banking on hefty, taxpayer-funded plans to cover his retirement.\n\nThese programs, long exploited by career politicians, have drawn conservative ire for years. \"Most people don't get that kind of golden handshake,\" says Grover Norquist, president of the right-leaning Americans for Tax Reform. \"It's a good deal for Congress and it's not a good deal for taxpayers.\"\n\nThe son of a Korean War veteran, Pence spent a few years at a small law firm before mounting an unsuccessful campaign for Congress in 1988. A second attempt two years later erupted in scandal after he used political donations to cover a mortgage, credit card and even grocery bills. \"I'm not embarrassed that I need to make a living,\" he told the press at the time. Such personal spending was legal then (though it has since been banned) but proved unpopular with voters.\n\nDefeated again, Pence joined a conservative think tank and established himself as a local radio star, billed as \"Rush Limbaugh on decaf.\" He offered his take on the news of the day (\"Is adultery no longer a big deal in Indiana and in America?\" he asked during a 1997 national sex scandal ) and chatted with state and local politicians. By 2000, Pence was a minor celebrity in the conservative Midwest. He made a third run for Congress and won.\n\nWith no significant business experience, he ranked among the Capitol's poorer members, with few assets besides stock in an Indiana gas station and convenience store chain called Kiel Bros. Oil Co. Pence likely inherited the shares from his father, who was an early employee. The future vice president helped out at Kiel Bros. growing up, but he never went into the business. In the early 2000s, the company had grown to more than 200 locations and Pence's brother Greg was president. When profit margins on gas and tobacco products fell, the debt-burdened Kiel Bros., also dealing with a handful of environmental fines, was forced to file for bankruptcy.\n\nPence, then in his second term in Congress, watched his nest egg crack. In 2004 he disclosed owning a stake in Kiel Bros. worth between $200,000 and $450,000. The next year, with the company bankrupt, the value of those shares dropped to zero. Pence, who had only a few thousand dollars in savings, accumulated more than $600,000 in losses from the business going under, according to his 2006 tax returns.\n\nThe government came to the rescue. In 2006, Pence hit his fifth year of federal service-making him eligible for a federal pension, a guaranteed stream of income in retirement.\n\nPence would further benefit from an act of Congressional self-dealing. A 1986 federal law based pension payouts for members of Congress and their staffers on a higher percentage of their annual pay than regular federal workers' pensions. Pence voted in favor of closing this benefit for future Congressmen in 2012, though he remains one of many lawmakers grandfathered into the older, more lucrative pensions.\n\n\"They're almost twice as valuable as a regular federal pension,\" says Tim Voit, a financial analyst who runs a firm that specializes in pensions. \"Congress passes laws for their own benefit, and they'll never shortchange themselves.\"\n\nBetween the 12 years Pence served in the House and his two years as vice president, he is currently eligible to collect an estimated $50,000 per year from the federal government for the rest of his life. If he were able to sell that annuity today, he could get around $700,000 for it.\n\nThen there's his state pension. Pence left Congress in 2013 to become governor of Indiana. He served a single term in the statehouse before being elected vice president. For those four years of gubernatorial work, he's entitled to 30% of his salary for the rest of his life. (If he waits until he's 65 to retire, he can get 40%.) Pence earned nearly $112,000 in his final year as governor, so Indiana will owe him around $35,000 per year starting at age 62, an income stream worth at least $500,000. A spokesperson for Pence declined to comment for this story.\n\nThe rest of his assets stem almost entirely from the government as well. Pence disclosed two Indiana state-run retirement accounts, worth up to $65,000. He has also likely been saving a chunk of his federal salary through the Thrift Savings Plan, essentially a 401(k) for government employees. If Pence has been making regular contributions, he could have hundreds of thousands in additional funds stashed in a plan that ethics laws do not require public officials to disclose.\n\nMeanwhile, Pence and his wife owe between $100,000 and $245,000 across eight Parent PLUS student loans they took out to help put their three children through college. By 2013, around the time the couple moved into the Indiana governor's mansion, they had sold their modest, three-bedroom home outside D.C. and their 1,400-square-foot residence in their hometown of Columbus, Indiana. Four years later, they essentially moved right from the governor's mansion in Indianapolis to the United States Naval Observatory, the vice president's official residence. The Pences are likely expected to pay for their own household items and meals, but taxpayers foot the bill for their major living expenses.\n\nAnd when Pence leaves office in 2021 or 2025, the public will remain on the hook-even if he follows his predecessor, Joe Biden, and rakes in millions from books and speeches-since Pence will be right at the government's retirement age, ready to start cashing in on his government pensions."

      "text": "Mike Pence Falsely Gives Credit To Trump For Pfizer Vaccine Success\n\nVice President Mike Pence has misleadingly credited President Donald Trump's \"leadership\" and Operation Warp Speed, the administration's program to accelerate development and delivery of a coronavirus vaccine, for a vaccine developed by Pfizer, despite the fact that the company received no support from the U.S. government beyond an agreement to buy an initial 100 million doses.\n\nVice President Mike Pence falsely gives credit to President Donald Trump for Pfizer's vaccine ... More success.\n\nAfter Pfizer and partner BioNTech announced final results from trials of their vaccine showing it to be 95% effective, much higher than the 50% the Food and Drug Administration had said it was willing to accept, Pence tweeted, \"Because of [Trump's] leadership & Operation Warp Speed, Pfizer completed its trial with a vaccine that is 95% effective on patients, including Seniors,\" he wrote .\n\nWhile Pfizer does have a deal with Operation Warp Speed - $1.95 billion to secure an initial 100 million doses, enough to vaccinate 50 million people - this was to ensure that there would be a market for the vaccine and to incentivize the company's research, with no money paid out until the vaccine is approved.\n\nSince announcing promising early results from the trial last week, Pfizer has repeatedly and publicly emphasized its independence from Operation Warp Speed while Trump and his allies have tried to take credit for the work.\n\nIn a recent press release announcing tests of delivery methods for its vaccine Tuesday, the company said the vaccine's development and manufacturing \"have been entirely self-funded, with billions of dollars already invested at risk.\"\n\nWhen preliminary results were announced last week, Dr. Kathrin Jansen, Pfizer's head of vaccine research and development, told the New York Times that their team \"were never part of the Warp Speed\" and had \"never taken any money from the U.S. government, or from anyone.\"\n\nAfter Pfizer and BioNTech announced early data that showed their Covid-19 vaccine to be 90% effective, Ivanka Trump was swift to praise the news and misleadingly credit Operation Warp Speed and her father for the vaccine's success. Others in her father's circle followed suit , including the Vice President and former UN ambassador Nikki Haley. Donald Trump himself - in between false declarations of election victory and voter fraud - took responsibility for vaccine's success, later accusing Pfizer of deliberately delaying the results of its preliminary analysis for political purposes and to deny him a pre-election \"WIN.\" In announcing the final results Wednesday, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla issued a thinly veiled rebuttal against these accusations, saying that \"We continue to move at the speed of science to compile all the data collected thus far.\"\n\nModerna, which trails Pfizer closely in the race to develop a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine, announced early data that showed its Covid-19 vaccine to be 94.5% effective Monday. Its storage requirements are less onerous than Pfizer's, which could give it an edge when it comes to distribution and overall rollout. Final results from its Phase 3 trial can be expected within the next few weeks.\n\nFull coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus\n\nOne Community. Many Voices.

More October 19, 2022.\n\nPence adviser Devin O'Malley told the Associated Press the Department of Justice completed an \"Unrestricted search of five hours\" and removed \"one document with classified markings and six additional pages without such markings.\"\n\nThese documents were not found during the initial review by Pence's team, O'Malley said.\n\nA private attorney for the former vice president was at Pence's Carmel, Indiana, residence while the search took place, CNN reported.\n\nPence is currently on the West Coast, after the birth of his second grandchild, a spokesperson told CNN.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Forbes , while Pence could not be reached for comment.\n\nPolice secure the entrance to the neighborhood of former Vice President Mike Pence's Indiana home, ... More Friday, Feb. 10, 2023 in Carmel, Ind.\n\nIn mid-January a lawyer for Pence found about a dozen documents marked classified at Pence's home. In a letter to the National Archives, Pence's attorney said he was \"unaware of the existence of the records.\" The National Archives then referred the matter to the Justice Department. The documents were previously stored at Pence's temporary home in Virginia before they were moved to his Indiana home, CNN reported. And Pence isn't alone. The FBI reportedly searched Biden's former office at the Penn Biden Center in November, after the president's staff found classified documents in the office (the FBI search was consensual, but it wasn't disclosed to the public until January ). Last week, the Justice Department searched Biden's vacation property in Rehoboth, Delaware, and did not find any classified documents. A number of classified records were also recovered during an August FBI raid of Trump's home Mar-A-Lago. Prosecutors said Trump had spent months avoiding a subpoena that required him to over those records. While both the former and the current president are said to have held classified documents in their private spaces, Biden said his lawyers voluntarily alerted authorities that he had the documents.\n\nOn Thursday Pence received a subpoena from a special counsel investigating Trump, according to to multiple reports , as part of the Department of Justice's probe into the January 6 attack on the Capitol. During last year's House January 6 committee hearings , Pence was brought up repeatedly as a force working against Trump's plans to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The former vice president criticized Trump's January 6 actions in an ABC interview , calling him \"reckless\" and saying in part that \"it was clear he decided to be part of the problem.\" It's unclear what documents special counsel Jack Smith has requested. The Justice Department's probe, spearheaded by Smith, is a different investigation from the House's January 6 committee.\n\nClassified Documents Found At Mike Pence's Home (Forbes)\n\nBiden's Team Finds Another Batch Of Government Records After Discovering Classified Docs In Private Office, Report Say (Forbes)"

      "text": "\n\nMike Pence becomes highest-ranking Trump lieutenant to testify before Jan. 6 grand jury\n\nListen\n\n(4 min)\n\nListen\n\n(4 min)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Former Vice President Mike Pence testified Thursday before a federal grand jury investigating efforts by then-President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nDon't miss: Pence testifies before 2020 election grand jury after Trump and his former vice president exhaust efforts to scuttle subpoena\n\nPence's appearance before a grand jury in Washington scrutinizing the president he once loyally served is a milestone in the Justice Department's investigation and likely gives prosecutors a key first-person account about certain conversations and events in the weeks preceding the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. It also carries significant political implications, coming as Pence hints at entering the 2024 presidential race and a potential run against Trump, the Republican front-runner.\n\nFrom the archives (March 2023): Pence sharply condemns Jan. 6 riot: 'History will hold Donald Trump accountable'\n\nThe testimony, confirmed by a person familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss a secret grand-jury matter, came hours after a federal appeals court in a sealed order rejected a bid by Trump's lawyers to block Pence's appearance.\n\nPence was subpoenaed to testify earlier this year, but Trump's lawyers objected, citing executive privilege concerns. A judge in March refused to block Pence's appearance, though he did side with the former vice president's constitutional claims that he could not be forced to answer questions about anything related to his role as presiding over the Senate's certification of votes on Jan. 6.\n\n\"We'll obey the law, we'll tell the truth,\" Pence said in an interview with CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that aired Sunday. \"And the story that I've been telling the American people all across the country, the story that I wrote in the pages of my memoir, that'll be the story I tell in that setting.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear what Pence may have told the grand jury, but he is the most high-profile Trump administration official to be summoned before the panel. Inside the federal building where the grand jury has been meeting, just blocks from the U.S. Capitol, security was high because of Pence's appearance with an unusual amount of activity from U.S. Marshals.\n\nPence has spoken extensively about Trump's pressure campaign urging him to reject Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election victory in the days leading up to Jan. 6, including in his book, \"So Help Me God.\" Pence, as vice president, had a ceremonial role overseeing Congress' counting of the Electoral College vote but did not have the power to affect the results, despite Trump's contention otherwise.\n\nPence, a former Indiana governor and congressman, has said that Trump endangered his family and everyone else who was at the Capitol that day and history will hold him \"accountable.\"\n\n\"For four years, we had a close working relationship. It did not end well,\" Pence wrote, summing up their time in the White House.\n\nTrump was speaking in New Hampshire when news broke of Pence's grand jury appearance. Asked at a diner if he was concerned about his testimony, Trump responded, \"No I'm not and I don't know anything about it.\"\n\nLawyers for Pence had raised their own, more narrow challenge to the subpoena. They argued that because Pence was serving in his capacity as president of the Senate as electoral votes were being counted in Congress on Jan. 6, he was protected from being forced to testify about that process under the Constitution's \"speech or debate\" clause, which is intended to protect members of Congress from being questioned about official legislative acts.\n\nA judge agreed with that argument, effectively narrowing the scope of his expected testimony.\n\nThe Justice Department special counsel leading the investigation, Jack Smith, has cast a broad net in interviews and has sought the testimony of a long list of former Trump aides, including ex-White House counsel Pat Cipollone and former adviser Stephen Miller.\n\nSmith is separately investigating Trump over the potential mishandling of hundreds of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's residence and private membership club, as well as possible efforts to obstruct that probe.\n\nIt is not clear when either of the special counsel's investigations will end or who, if anyone, will be charged.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nCopyright © 2025 MarketWatch, Inc.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump 's sweeping new global tariffs will cost the average American family more than $3,500 per year, according to an analysis from a group founded by former Vice President Mike Pence .\n\nAdvancing American Freedom, a conservative advocacy group, said the additional costs associated with the president's proposed international tariffs will make the \"American Dream unaffordable.\"\n\nNewsweek has contacted the White House and Advancing American Freedom for comment via email outside of regular working hours.\n\nTrump's plan to impose more tariffs on goods imported into the U.S has unsettled markets and risks sparking a global trade war. The president said the \"Liberation Day\" announcement will boost the U.S. economy and encourage companies to manufacture domestically.\n\nTrump confirmed his next wave of tariffs Wednesday afternoon, affecting dozens of countries. This includes a baseline of 10 percent, with other tariffs that he calls reciprocal having higher rates of up to 50 percent for some nations.\n\nAmong the major U.S. trade partners heavily affected by Trump's new tariff plans are China (34 percent, in addition to 20 percent tariffs already put in place by the Trump administration), the European Union (20 percent), and Japan (24 percent).\n\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro previously suggested Trump's tariff plans could raise about $600 billion in revenue for the United States annually.\n\nPence and Advancing American Freedom have come out against the new tariff plans, suggesting they amount to a major tax hike.\n\nThe analysis, shared on social media, suggests raising tariffs on imported goods in such a broad manner will cost American families more than $3,500 per year.\n\nThe group cited previous analysis from the Goldman Sachs financial group. In November 2024, Goldman Sachs said Trump's original plan to impose a 25 percent tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada and a 10 percent levy on China would generate just under $300 billion in revenue annually. The analysis warned that this would also cause a nearly 1 percent rise in inflation, resulting in higher costs for American consumers.\n\nOther analysts have long warned that tariff plans would force companies to pass the increased costs on to customers globally, though the potential financial impact varies.\n\nWhile criticizing Trump's tariff plans Wednesday, Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer said they would cost the average American family around $5,000 more each year.\n\nING Economics said this could cost $1,800 per person, or $7,200 for a family of four, though a $1,350 rise for every American is more \"probable.\"\n\nThe Budget Lab at Yale University said that Trump's imposing a previously cited potential 20 percent baseline tariff would cost American families as much as $4,200 a year.\n\nPence's relationship with Trump fell apart in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. MAGA figures have criticized Pence for speaking out against the president's tariff plans.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence posting on X, formerly Twitter: \"The Trump Tariff Tax is the largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history. These tariffs are nearly 10x the size of those imposed during the Trump-Pence administration and will cost American families over $3,500 per year.\"\n\nAdvancing American Freedom posted: \"These extra costs will make the American Dream unaffordable, as everyday Americans are still recovering from four years of Bidenflation.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump in a Wednesday speech : \"For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike. Our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it's not going to happen anymore.\"\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin in a statement: \"Donald Trump is actively driving the economy off the rails-and he doesn't care how much 'pain' he's causing in the process. Instead of trying to reel back the tailspin he's plunging the U.S. economy into with his chaotic and reckless agenda, Trump continues to set working families' hard-earned dollars on fire.\"\n\nScott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, in a statement on Wednesday: \"Today's trade action prioritizes domestic manufacturers and America's workers. These hardworking men and women have seen unfair trade cut the ground from beneath their feet for decades. They deserve a fighting chance. Our workers can outcompete anyone in the world, but they need a level playing field to do it. This trade reset is a necessary step in the right direction.\"\n\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick posted on X: \"Mike Pence is just bitter. These tariffs are the definition of America First, which is a concept he doesn't understand.\"\n\nRepublican Ohio Senator Bernie Moreno wrote: \"Career politicians like Mike Pence are part of the problem. They did nothing for decades while our industrial sector was gutted. President Trump is finally reversing their failed policies and fighting back for American workers.

Some of the administration's positions have deviated from this record.\"\n\nThe post included a link to a Monday Fox News article, which quoted Pence speaking to a group of reporters in Washington D.C. about the need for America to take an active role on the world stage.\n\n\"There have been voices of isolationism that have been emerging in our party of late,\" the article reported Pence as saying. \"I'm not yet convinced that they represent the president's views.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has promised to withdraw the U.S. from \"endless wars\" abroad, has suggested withdrawing from NATO , and in his first week in office froze almost all the U.S. foreign aid programs across the world.\n\n\"Whatever remains of my bully pulpit, is to be an anchor to windward for traditional conservatism within the Republican Party,\" Pence said, according to Fox News.\n\nHe also suggested the Trump administration \"doesn't fully appreciate\" the dangers of Chinese-owned TikTok , which the President temporarily unbanned on his first day in office.\n\n\"The [Chinese Communist Party] thinks the principal value of TikTok is the ability to impact public opinion at a critical moment,\" Pence said, according to Fox News. \"People that are in their 20s and 30s today could be in the Senate , in the House in 10 years. The fact that the Chinese Communist Party is collecting data on Americans, whatever their age or experience is, is not something to be dismissed.\"\n\nOn the issue of defending Taiwan, if China were to invade the self-governed island Beijing views as part of its territory, Pence was reported as saying: \"There's an old saying, 'Never say what you'll never do.'\n\n\"We ought to have one hand extended in friendship in exchange, and the other hand resting comfortably on the holster of the arsenal of democracy.\"\n\nGunther Eagleman, a MAGA commentator with 1.2 million followers , on X: \"You are a traitor Mike! An irrelevant sellout.\"\n\nDonald Trump, to Bloomberg in July , casting doubt over whether he would defend Taiwan from China: \"Taiwan is 9,500 miles away. It's 68 miles away from China.\" He added in reference to the U.S. support of the island: \"I don't think we're any different from an insurance policy.\"\n\nPence and his nonprofit Advancing American Freedom will likely seek to influence the direction of the GOP in favor of traditional conservatism during Trump's second term. Meanwhile, Trump will use his majorities in the House, the Senate, and a conservative majority on the Supreme Court to implement his populist agenda .\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nFlynn Nicholls is a Newsweek reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on U.S. politics and society.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence took a swipe at his former boss, President Donald Trump , on Wednesday over Trump's comments about Ukraine and Russia.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Pence and the White House via email for comment.\n\nThough Pence and Trump started out as allies, the former vice president became a pariah in the MAGA world at the end of Trump's first term after he refused to block Congress from certifying Joe Biden 's victory in the 2020 election.\n\nPence and Trump's icy relationship has since thawed a bit, most notably when the two shook hands while attending former President Jimmy Carter 's funeral.\n\nPence also attended Trump's inauguration and said on X (formerly Twitter ), in part, \"We encourage all our fellow Americans to join us praying for President Trump and Vice President Vance as they assume the awesome responsibility of leading this great Nation.\"\n\nAppearing at a news conference Tuesday, Trump spoke about the Russia-Ukraine war and falsely suggested Ukraine had initiated the conflict. Russia annexed parts of Ukraine in 2014 and launched a military invasion against its neighbor in 2022.\n\nUkraine \"Should've ended [the war] in three years,\" Trump said Tuesday. \"You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.\"\n\nResponding to Trump's comment, Pence said on X, \"Mr. President, Ukraine did not 'start' this war. Russia launched an unprovoked and brutal invasion claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. The Road to Peace must be built on the Truth.\"\n\nPence also linked to a Fox News article with the headline, \"Russia invades Ukraine in largest European attack since WWII.\"\n\nTrump also took aim at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Truth Social on Wednesday, criticizing him over his handling of the conflict and lambasting him over his poll numbers. Trump also called for Ukraine to hold an election during the war, which it cannot do since the country is under martial law.\n\n\"I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died - And so it continues.....,\" Trump concluded in his post.\n\nDillard University Professor Robert Collins told Newsweek via text on Wednesday: \"This is basically just a case of Trump parroting the propaganda, talking points from Putin. But this should not surprise anyone. Putin and Trump have had a close personal relationship for many years, starting during Trump's first term. Trump has always argued that it is in the best interest of the US for him to maintain a close personal relationship with Putin, because that is how he can avoid any sort of military conflicts with Russia.\n\n\"Long-term, down the road, there will be negative political consequences simply because the majority of Republicans in Congress do not share Trump's affection for Putin. Eventually, Trump will start losing Republican votes on foreign policy issues, simply because Republican members of Congress understand they have to run for reelection, so they cannot appear to be sympathetic to Putin. Trump never has to run another election. So he's not worried about the political fallout,\" Collins said.\n\nCNN anchor Jim Sciutto responded on X to Pence's remarks: \"When has a former vice president so directly contradicted the president he served under?\"\n\nDemocratic Senator Chuck Schumer of New York wrote on X Wednesday: \"Trump's comments about the war in Ukraine sounded straight from a Russian propaganda playbook. It's disgusting. The Ukrainian people did not start this war. Vladimir Putin did. The staggering suffering and destruction they have endured is all because of Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nDonald Trump Jr. wrote on X on Wednesday: \"Zelenskyy should really just go win the war without our endless $$$. Let's see how that works out.\"\n\nTrump said Tuesday that he may meet with Russian President Vladmir Putin this month to discuss an end to the war. Zelensky, meanwhile, has sharply criticized the U.S. for shutting Ukraine out of peace talks over its own future.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nAnna Commander is a Newsweek Editor and writer based in Florida.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence refused to say who he is voting for in this year's presidential election when confronted on CBS News' Face The Nation on Sunday.\n\nPence, who served under the Donald Trump administration, told Fox News on Friday that he would not be endorsing his former political partner in the 2024 presidential election. However, when asked on Sunday if he would vote for Trump, who is the presumed GOP nominee, he evaded the question.\n\nPence, who suspended his own campaign for president in October 2023 after failing to gain significant Republican support, said during a Fox News interview on Friday that he was \"proud\" of his record with Trump, but \"it should come as no surprise\" that he would not endorse a second Trump presidency.\n\n\"Donald Trump is pursuing and articulating an agenda that is at odds with the conservative agenda that we governed on during our four years,\" he said. \"And that's why I cannot in good conscience endorse Donald Trump in this campaign.\"\n\nA pivotal moment in the now-estranged relationship between Trump and Pence was on January 6, 2021. On that day, a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., to stop the certification of Joe Biden 's 2020 election win. The riot erupted following claims from Trump that the election was stolen via widespread voter fraud. There is no evidence to support these claims.\n\nPence, in his role as president of the Senate , had to preside over Congress ' certification of the results of the election. Despite Trump claiming to his supporters that Pence had the authority to overturn the election results, he did not. Pence ultimately carried out his duty and Biden's election win was certified.\n\nOn Sunday, Pence told Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan: \"The fact that the president continues to insist that I had the right to overturn the election that day is a fundamental difference, but I want to be clear, I've forgiven the president in my heart for what happened that day. As a Christian I'm required to do that.\"\n\nHe added: \"The issue of fealty to the Constitution is not a small matter but it's not just that. The reason that I cannot in good conscience endorse Donald Trump this year also has to be with the fact that he is walking away...[from] a commitment to fiscal responsibility, a commitment to the sanctity of life, a commitment to American leadership in the world.\"\n\n\"Is that the final word from you? Can you be persuaded, if he changes tacts, to vote for him? Would you vote for him?\" Brennan asked.\n\n\"I won't be endorsing Donald Trump this year. I respect the right of Republican voters who've made clear who they are for,\" Pence said. \"What I'm gonna focus my energies on is...what we should be for.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's and Biden's campaigns via email for comment.\n\nHosts from MSNBC 's The Weekend discussed Pence's refusal to endorse Trump on Saturday, pointing out the uncertainty of where Pence's support really lies.\n\nFormer Republican National Committee (RNC) chair Michael Steele told his co-hosts and guests: \"Everybody assumes that means I'm not voting for him-Uh, uh. That's not how that works. So, I think clarity from everybody in this moment is important.\"\n\nHe added: \"For me, it's a matter of saying, I'm not endorsing him, I'm standing with Joe Biden.\"\n\nPence made it clear during his Fox News' interview on Friday that he would \"never vote for Joe Biden.\"\n\nHost Symone Sanders-Townsend added: \"If there are Republicans who are at least unwilling to support Trump, fine, don't support him. But nowhere, did you hear the former vice president use the term, I'm not gonna support him. He said 'I'm not endorsing him' and that is very, very different.\"\n\nNovember will likely be a rematch between Trump and Biden, the Democratic incumbent. Democrats have claimed that democracy is on the ballot this year, reminding Americans of January 6 and Trump's alleged role in it . Meanwhile, Republicans have been taking aim about Biden's tenure, complaining about his handling of the economy, which has been on the rise, and the influx of migrants crossing into the United States from the southern border .\n\nUpdate 3/17/24, 11:29 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate 3/17/24, 11:53 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nRachel Dobkin is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

We embraced America's role as the leader of the free world. We invested trillions to rebuild our military, restoring America's strength. And our administration was proudly pro-life.\"\n\nThese \"traditional conservative priorities,\" Pence claimed, propelled the Republicans to a \"historic\" victory in 2016.\n\nPence also took aim at the \"protectionist tariffs\" on foreign goods, arguing that these will make products more expensive for all Americans.\n\nIn what appeared to be a slight against his former running mate, Pence argued that Republicans should run on the foreign policy promise to \"deliver peace through strength,\" repeating Ronald Reagan 's famous paraphrasing of George Washington , and reject \"isolationism and the abandonment of American leadership.\"\n\nPence lost favor with former President Trump's base after refusing to reject the results of the 2020 election, resulting in threats against the then-vice president during the ensuing January 6 Capitol riots .\n\nIn March, Pence claimed that he could not \"in good conscience\" endorse his former boss, citing \"profound differences\" between the two on several issues, as well as the events that transpired in January.\n\nHe added on Monday that Republicans should \"unashamedly recommit to the pro-life cause,\" described as \"the great moral calling of our era,\" while pledging to adopt \"responsible budgets that fix America's broken entitlement programs\" and framing the GOP as \"the party of the constitution.\"\n\n\"Republicans will win by embracing traditional conservative priorities,\" Pence continued. \"If the party abandons these positions, it will fail to motivate our voters.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence said he \"can't defend\" the \"very serious\" allegations made against Donald Trump in his federal indictment over the handling of classified documents.\n\nPence made the comments Tuesday during an interview with The Wall Street Journal 's editorial board. The position marks a reversal for Pence, who last week said he hoped the U.S. Department of Justice would not bring federal charges against Trump, arguing that the move would send a \"terrible message to the world.\"\n\nTrump, through his attorney Todd Blanche, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to 37 federal felony counts. The indictment, brought by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith , accuses the former president of mishandling sensitive presidential records and obstructing government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nTrump has maintained his innocence and accused federal prosecutors of investigating him for political reasons. He is the first former U.S. president to be federally indicted.\n\n\"Having read the indictment, these are very serious allegations. And I can't defend what is alleged,\" Pence told the Journal . \"But the president is entitled to his day in court. He's entitled to bring a defense, and I want to reserve judgment until he has the opportunity to respond.\"\n\nPence then seemed to criticize the Justice Department for its previous probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, which found no links to Trump's campaign.\n\n\"After years of politicization,\" Pence said of the classified documents indictment, \"it's hard for me to believe that politics didn't play some role in this decision.\"\n\nHe also told the newspaper that \"no one is above the law\" but added that \"as Americans you're innocent until proven guilty.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to a spokesperson for Pence via email for comment.\n\nEarlier this month, Pence announced he's running for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. He entered a crowded field of GOP hopefuls, which already included former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley , South Carolina Senator Tim Scott , former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Less than 24 hours after Pence's announcement, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie also began his presidential campaign.\n\nPence currently trails his former running mate, according to multiple national polls . Trump holds a sizable lead in the 2024 Republican field, while Florida Governor Ron DeSantis follows behind at a distant second place.\n\nDays before he kicked off his presidential run, Pence was informed by the Justice Department that he will not face charges for his own handling of classified documents that he had taken with him after leaving office.\n\nWhen news broke that Pence would not be charged, Trump celebrated the decision.\n\n\"Just announced that they are not going to bring charges against Mike Pence on the document hoax. That's great, but when am I going to be fully exonerated, I'm at least as innocent as he is,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nGOP strategist John Feehery referenced Pence's documents controversy when asked about Pence's comments to The Wall Street Journal .\n\n\"I think he wants to make the distinction about what he did with the classified documents and what Trump did (which he obviously thinks is worse),\" Feehery told Newsweek . \"And at some point he has to start running hard against Trump. If they aren't fundamentally different, why would voters pick him over Trump?\"\n\nUpdate 06/14/23 1:55 p.m. ET: This story has been updated to include comments from John Feehery.\n\nJon Jackson is a News Editor at Newsweek based in New York.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence has warned against the rise of populism influencing the Republican Party following Donald Trump 's election victory.\n\nIn a speech at Lakewood's Colorado Christian University on November 15, Pence questioned whether Republicans would continue on the path of \"the traditional conservative agenda\" that has defined the GOP throughout history or follow the \"siren song of populism unmoored to conservative principles,\" reported ChurchLeaders.com on Monday.\n\nPence ran and challenged Trump in the GOP primary. During the campaign, he had used similar rhetoric, casting the 2024 election as a fight for the future of conservatism and, in September 2023, already calling on fellow Republicans to reject the \"siren song of populism\" associated with Trump.\n\nNewsweek has contacted Pence's office, Trump's transition team and the RNC for comment via email.\n\nThe former vice president, whose relationship with Trump fell apart in the wake of the January 6 attack on the Capitol, said during his Colorado speech that he had called to congratulate the president-elect over his 2024 victory while also noting other Republicans had achieved \"monumental victories\" this year. Along with the White House, the GOP also won control of the House and Senate .\n\nHe added the \"new majorities and new leadership\" must \"hew to our roots\" of traditional conservative values, which include opposing abortion and believing marriage should only be between one man and one woman, reported The Denver Post.\n\nPence said these beliefs should be defended against the \"rising populist center\" that threatens to undermine \"traditional conservatism with an agenda fueled in many ways by personal grievance.\" Pence did not mention any specific person or policy.\n\n\"More and more populists would deliberately erode norms of...time-honored principles to achieve their ends, even walking away from a commitment to limited government and free markets to achieve what they believe to be honorable ends,\" Pence added.\n\n\"I believe conservatism begins from a place of gratitude,\" Pence said. \"Gratitude for what we've inherited from the brilliant and flawed people who wrestled with the challenges of having a free society for generations past.\n\n\"Populism begins from a different place altogether,\" he added. \"It comes ultimately from the depths of frustration and, oftentimes, anger toward perceived wrongs and injustices-some real, some imagined-and a subsequent desire to bring about a leveling change.\"\n\nPence said he understands the \"frustrations that have fueled populism\" in recent years, but the movement's means to fix societal issues are \"wrong.\"\n\n\"Some would say there are times when we ought to do other than the limited government principles of the Constitution,\" Pence said. \"But I submit to you that if we ever lose faith in our Constitution, we won't just lose elections. We'll lose our country forever.\"\n\nPence previously cited the Constitution as the reason why he could not support Trump's belief that the former vice president had the authority to not certify the 2020 election results during his ceremonial role as presiding officer of the Senate on January 6, 2021.\n\n\"[M]y oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,\" he said in a statement at the time.\n\n\"Our country is more important than one man. Our Constitution is more important than any one man's career,\" Pence posted on X, formerly Twitter , in August 2023, after Trump was federally indicted over his alleged attempt to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\n\"On January 6, former President Trump demanded that I choose between him and the Constitution.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence testified behind closed doors Thursday before the grand jury investigating ex-President Donald Trump 's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, according to reports from Reuters and other media outlets.\n\nPence was subpoenaed by Special Counsel Jack Smith in February following months of negotiations between prosecutors and the former vice president's legal team. Smith is leading two criminal probes by the Department of Justice (DOJ) into Trump, including the former president's efforts to remain in office after losing to President Joe Biden . Smith is also heading the DOJ's investigation of the classified documents found in Trump's Florida estate in August.\n\nTrump previously attempted to block his former vice president from testifying in the special counsel's probe, arguing that the information being sought was protected by executive privilege. According to a report from CNN on Wednesday, however, a federal judge denied Trump's request to halt the subpoena.\n\nA source close to the matter told Reuters that an increased security presence conducted a sweep of the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., prior to Pence's arrival Thursday. Politico added in its report that the former vice president was escorted into the courthouse's main entrances without being spotted by cameras.\n\nPence's appearance before the grand jury was also confirmed by two sources who spoke with Politico on Thursday, although the individuals were not authorized to discuss the vice president's testimony publicly.\n\nAccording to media reports, Pence spent more than five hours in front of the grand jury. The former vice president is considered a key witness in Smith's probe into Trump's actions leading up to January 6, 2021, including pressuring Pence to throw out the 2020 election results while Congress certified the Electoral College votes. Trump repeatedly claimed that Pence had the power to block Congress' certification progress, although Pence has disputed the argument.\n\nPence also attempted to fight the DOJ's subpoena, and was granted limitations by the judge overseeing the grand jury about what could be discussed during his testimony. According to The New York Times , Pence was not forced to discuss any matters related to his role as president of the Senate on January 6, but he did have to testify about potential criminal actions by Trump.\n\nThursday's testimony comes as Pence is exploring a challenge to his former running mate in the 2024 presidential election. Trump is the front-runner for the GOP nomination in several hypothetical matchups, including after he was dealt a 34-felony count indictment in Manhattan court last month.\n\nWhile speaking to CBS News' Face the Nation over the weekend, Pence said that he will make an official decision about running for president \"well before late June.\"\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Trump's press team via email for comment.\n\nKaitlin Lewis is a Newsweek reporter on the Night Team based in Boston, Massachusetts.

      "text": "Mike Pence's Sensible (and Probably Doomed) Plan To Fix the National Debt\n\nDebt\n\nEric Boehm | 8.9.2024 2:00 PM\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence is leading a new effort to convince federal lawmakers to address the spiraling national debt.\n\nThe debt surpassed the $35 trillion threshold in late July , less than eight months after hitting the $34 trillion mark . The upward trend won't stop anytime soon: the Congressional Budget Office expects the debt to hit $56 trillion by 2034, at which point the debt will be 122 percent the size of the U.S. economy .\n\nWith the country veering into uncharted and dangerous territory, Pence's newly launched nonprofit, Advancing American Freedom (AAF), is asking lawmakers to steer back towards calmer fiscal waters.\n\n\"After decades of ignoring the significance of profligate federal spending, the consequences are finally starting to catch up to us,\" argues the nonprofit in an eight-page document that outlines some basic strategies for getting the debt under control. \"America faces a bleak future as interest payments crowd out spending on basic government functions, our economy stagnates under the drag of an unsustainable burden, and we're put at a strategic disadvantage internationally.\"\n\nTo get the debt under control, AAF points out that lawmakers cannot simply focus on the discretionary part of the federal budget-which accounts for less than 30 percent of all federal spending . Meanwhile, so-called \"mandatory spending\" accounts for more than 60 percent (the rest is interest payments on the debt).\n\nMost of the mandatory spending category is made up of Social Security and Medicare, but several other programs also run on autopilot, including food stamps, federal worker retirement benefits, Obamacare's health insurance subsidies, and veterans' benefits.\n\n\"Mandatory spending is the biggest driver of the national debt because there is no restriction on the unchecked growth of these programs,\" argues AAF's debt report.\n\nAmong the proposals to bring mandatory spending under control, the group argues for means-testing future Social Security cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for individuals making more than $1 million annually, stopping President Joe Biden's student loan cancellation plans, ending Obamacare's insurance subsidies for wealthy Americans, and the formation of a congressional commission to propose spending cuts.\n\nThe group also calls for ending so-called \"tax expenditures,\" which are forms of spending hidden in the tax code-for example, corporate green energy subsidies delivered in the form of renewable tax credits.\n\nThe new document picks up where Pence left off in his failed Republican primary campaign last year. On the campaign trail, Pence talked up the importance of sane fiscal policy and condemned his former boss -Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump-for ignoring the threat posed by runaway borrowing and unsustainable entitlement programs.\n\nOf course, Pence's campaign never got off the ground in any meaningful sense. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley had a little more success , but there's clearly not much of a constituency for serious talk about the debt.\n\nStill, it's important to try. In an essay published by Reason last year , Pence urged conservatives to \"resist the temptation to put what is popular over what is wise.\" In that case, he was criticizing the ongoing trend of prominent Republicans abandoning free market principles and embracing will-to-power politics as a solution to America's problems. But he might as well have been talking about debt, too. Much of that $35 trillion borrowing has occurred because leaders prioritized what is popular (government spending) over what is wise (spending only as much as you're willing to raise in taxes).\n\nPence is not totally blameless in this, of course. He seems to have had little influence in the Trump administration. Nonetheless, he was a major figure in a presidential administration that added more than $8 trillion to the debt in just four years-a record that Biden is now working hard to equal. As a member of the House of Representatives for a dozen years starting in 2001, Pence arrived in Washington when the federal budget was nearly balanced. He supported two costly foreign wars (though he opposed an expensive expansion of Medicare during the George W. Bush administration).\n\nIt's tempting to dismiss all this as meaningless-after all, Pence is a pariah within his own party and likely has even less influence with Democrats. He holds no elected office, and there's no reason to believe that will change anytime soon.\n\nBut none of the people who have political power seem willing to engage with the question of what to do about the national debt-at least not in public or on the record. Pence has nothing to lose, and that means he's free to say the things that others won't. I hope he keeps talking.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

So Far, It Isn't Helping Him.\n\nElection 2024\n\nStephanie Slade | 9.28.2023 9:50 AM\n\nIn 2015, when GOP presidential contenders took the stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum, the 40th president's legacy loomed large. Debaters mentioned Reagan nearly four dozen times, according to Fortune .\n\nEight years later, the Gipper's reputation has taken a beating in some quarters. The illiberal right treats \"Zombie Reaganite\" as a go-to insult for old-school conservatives and libertarians, deriding the Reaganesque emphasis on free markets, limited government, and \"peace through strength\" as quaint at best. The GOP is \"probably more of a Trump party\" than a Reagan party at this point, one attendee of a soiree at the Reagan Library told Politico a couple of weeks ago.\n\nNonetheless, former Vice President Mike Pence has made it clear that he believes GOP primary voters still have an appetite for a candidate in the Reagan mold. At the second primary debate of the season last night, also held at the Reagan Library, he defended \"the conservative agenda that Ronald Reagan brought forward in this party, of a strong national defense, standing with our allies, standing up to our enemies, supporting limited government and traditional values.\"\n\n\"Frankly, our party does face a time for choosing,\" he said, referring to an iconic speech delivered by Reagan at the 1964 Republican National Convention. It's a choice of \"whether we're going to stand on the foundation of that conservative agenda that Ronald Reagan poured , or whether we're going to follow the siren song of populism unmoored to conservative principles.\"\n\nEarlier this week, four former Reagan administration officials, including former Heritage Foundation President Ed Feulner, released an open letter \"wholeheartedly\" endorsing Pence as the \"candidate who embodies the spirit and principles of Ronald Reagan.\"\n\nRepublican voters are, in fact, slightly more likely to name Reagan than Donald Trump as the best recent president, according to Pew . In June, Gallup found that Reagan enjoys a 69 percent approval rating overall, more than 20 points higher than Trump's.\n\nFor all that, of course, it's Trump who is dominating the primary field. Pence is currently in fifth place, with less than 5 percent in the RealClearPolitics polling average . Republican voters still love the idea of Reagan, but at a moment when culture war concerns seem to rule , their preference in 2024 may be for an angry warrior over a happy one.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "No, Mike Pence, We Should Not Make It Easier To Execute Mass Shooters\n\nMike Pence\n\nEmma Camp | 9.28.2023 4:50 PM\n\nDuring last night's Republican presidential debate, former Vice President Mike Pence had a startling answer to a question about what he would do to reduce gun violence.\n\n\"I am sick and tired of these mass shootings happening in the United States of America,\" said Pence. \"And if I'm president of the United States, I'm going to go to the Congress of the United States, and we're going to pass a federal expedited death penalty for anyone involved in a mass shooting so that they will meet their fate in months, not years. It is unconscionable that the Parkland shooter...is actually going to spend the rest of his life behind bars in Florida. That's not justice. We have to mete out justice and send a message to these would-be killers that you are not going to live out your days behind bars. You're going to meet justice.\"\n\nThis plan is not just unlikely to reduce mass shootings; it would leave lots of accused criminals without important procedural protections. While \"mass shooting\" doesn't have a set legal definition, one common definition puts it as any shooting with at least four victims, including people who were injured rather than killed. By that metric, over 3,500 mass shootings occurred from 2015 to 2022. Roughly 95 percent of these shootings resulted in fewer than four deaths, according to Everytown for Gun Safety's data . That includes a lot of crimes that do not look like Parkland-crimes in which there could be serious doubts about whether the accused is in fact guilty.\n\nPence is presumably thinking of those who commit the worst deliberate mass shootings But trying to exact even harsher punishments for the very few who commit such terrible violence will primarily end up affecting those accused of, say, drive-by shootings where the perpetrator isn't obvious.\n\nFor this reason, expediting the execution process would massively increase the risk that the state executes a wrongfully convicted person. Pence complained that it takes decades to actually execute someone after a conviction, but that time is typically spent exhausting legal appeal or clemency options. Sometimes, these decades of legal appeals help overturn wrongful convictions, such as in 192 cases of death-row exonerations recorded by the Death Penalty Information Center. In total, one 2014 study estimated that as many as 4 percent of those sentenced to death in America are innocent.\n\nIn addition to the increased risk of wrongful execution, making it easier to execute someone sentenced to death would likely not affect the number of people killed by gun violence-or even the number of people killed by mass shootings. There's considerable debate over whether harsher sentences can deter crime in some circumstances. However, it's difficult to see how a swifter death penalty will deter those who plan to commit the worst and rarest mass shootings, considering just how often these shootings end in suicide or the shooter being killed by police or bystanders.\n\nSo while Pence and one other Republican presidential candidate are all too excited to make it easier for the state to execute people, expediting the death penalty would be anything but just.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Mike Pence Comes Out Against Marijuana Banking Bill That Would Actually Save Taxpayers Money\n\nMarijuana\n\nScott Shackford | 8.13.2020 1:05 PM\n\nVice President Mike Pence took to Lou Dobbs Tonight on Fox News earlier this week to gripe that Democrats were attempting to include legislation related to marijuana and banking in the latest coronavirus relief bill.\n\n\"I heard the other day the bill mentions marijuana more than it mentions jobs,\" Pence said to Dobbs. \"The American people don't want some pork-barrel bill coming out of the Congress when we've got real needs for working-class families.\"\n\nMaybe he's trying to remind everybody that Joe Biden isn't the only vice president who's still resisting marijuana legalization?\n\nThere are two ironies here. First, the bill Pence is complaining about makes it possible for cannabis businesses to safely engage in banking in states where cannabis is legal, which helps those \"working-class families\" who rely on the cannabis industry. Second, the bill he's referring to will actually save taxpayers money, unlike much of the rest of this relief legislation .\n\nThe \"Secure and Fair Enforcement Act of 2019,\" a.k.a. the \"SAFE Banking Act ,\" would allow legally operating cannabis businesses to have the same legal access to banks, loans, and deposit protections as other legal businesses. Because the sale and possession of marijuana are still forbidden by federal law, banks are reluctant to have any dealings with dispensaries and growers, even when they're legally operating within their home states.\n\nThis is not a pork-barrel bill. While the marijuana industry would love to have access to federal coronavirus relief, the SAFE Banking Act would allow them only to use banking services the way other businesses do. According to the Congressional Budget Office , passing the bill would actually reduce the federal deficit by $2-3 million dollars a year. This is small potatoes in the grand scheme of things (the federal deficit for 2020 stands so far at $2.8 trillion ), but as Reason Foundation Policy Analyst Jacob James Rich observes , legal banking creates a framework for the expansion of the cannabis industry and also improves bookkeeping and revenue and income reporting. Both of those actions ultimately lead to more commerce and more revenue for the government:\n\nIssues of underreported marijuana income are endemic across all municipalities and states that have regulated cannabis. This should come as no surprise since cash-based businesses tend to underreport their incomes by 50% in general, which might be even larger in the marijuana industry as suppliers transition from illegal to regulated markets. Additionally, employees of cash-based businesses tend to report less than 20% of their incomes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The best way to address these issues would be to allow marijuana businesses access to banking services, which provide much better records for accounting purposes.\n\nThe country is in a recession and experienced an unprecedented 32.9% drop in gross domestic product (GDP) for the second quarter of 2020-due largely to the coronavirus pandemic and the economic lockdowns many state and local governments implemented. While seeking to grapple with the pandemic, recession-and eventually needing to confront the nation's unsustainable spending, both conservative and liberal policymakers in Congress should consider provisions, like marijuana banking law reforms, that could help the economy, state and local governments, small businesses, and be a net positive to the federal budget.\n\nPence and Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) are using the SAFE Banking Act as a cudgel to accuse House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) of including \"non-germane\" content in coronavirus relief legislation. Back in May, when the House previously attempted to add the SAFE Banking Act to coronavirus legislation, McConnell took the same approach as Pence is taking now, mocking the bill for referencing \"cannabis\" more than it references \"jobs,\" which is a cheap and lazy way to score points. The number of times a bill uses a particular word is not a good indicator of what the bill does.\n\nThe SAFE Banking Act passed the House last September, 321-103 . Only one Democrat (Terri Sewell of Alabama) voted against it, while 90 Republicans supported it. Thanks to McConnell, it hasn't been taken up by the Senate, despite having the support of fellow Republican and Kentuckian Sen. Rand Paul, who tweeted in support of it just yesterday.\n\nWhile there are myriad issues with the federal government's coronavirus relief efforts, allowing state-legal cannabis businesses to use banking services is not one of them.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Mike Pence's Sensible (and Probably Doomed) Plan To Fix the National Debt\n\nDebt\n\nEric Boehm | 8.9.2024 2:00 PM\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence is leading a new effort to convince federal lawmakers to address the spiraling national debt.\n\nThe debt surpassed the $35 trillion threshold in late July , less than eight months after hitting the $34 trillion mark . The upward trend won't stop anytime soon: the Congressional Budget Office expects the debt to hit $56 trillion by 2034, at which point the debt will be 122 percent the size of the U.S. economy .\n\nWith the country veering into uncharted and dangerous territory, Pence's newly launched nonprofit, Advancing American Freedom (AAF), is asking lawmakers to steer back towards calmer fiscal waters.\n\n\"After decades of ignoring the significance of profligate federal spending, the consequences are finally starting to catch up to us,\" argues the nonprofit in an eight-page document that outlines some basic strategies for getting the debt under control. \"America faces a bleak future as interest payments crowd out spending on basic government functions, our economy stagnates under the drag of an unsustainable burden, and we're put at a strategic disadvantage internationally.\"\n\nTo get the debt under control, AAF points out that lawmakers cannot simply focus on the discretionary part of the federal budget-which accounts for less than 30 percent of all federal spending . Meanwhile, so-called \"mandatory spending\" accounts for more than 60 percent (the rest is interest payments on the debt).\n\nMost of the mandatory spending category is made up of Social Security and Medicare, but several other programs also run on autopilot, including food stamps, federal worker retirement benefits, Obamacare's health insurance subsidies, and veterans' benefits.\n\n\"Mandatory spending is the biggest driver of the national debt because there is no restriction on the unchecked growth of these programs,\" argues AAF's debt report.\n\nAmong the proposals to bring mandatory spending under control, the group argues for means-testing future Social Security cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for individuals making more than $1 million annually, stopping President Joe Biden's student loan cancellation plans, ending Obamacare's insurance subsidies for wealthy Americans, and the formation of a congressional commission to propose spending cuts.\n\nThe group also calls for ending so-called \"tax expenditures,\" which are forms of spending hidden in the tax code-for example, corporate green energy subsidies delivered in the form of renewable tax credits.\n\nThe new document picks up where Pence left off in his failed Republican primary campaign last year. On the campaign trail, Pence talked up the importance of sane fiscal policy and condemned his former boss -Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump-for ignoring the threat posed by runaway borrowing and unsustainable entitlement programs.\n\nOf course, Pence's campaign never got off the ground in any meaningful sense. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley had a little more success , but there's clearly not much of a constituency for serious talk about the debt.\n\nStill, it's important to try. In an essay published by Reason last year , Pence urged conservatives to \"resist the temptation to put what is popular over what is wise.\" In that case, he was criticizing the ongoing trend of prominent Republicans abandoning free market principles and embracing will-to-power politics as a solution to America's problems. But he might as well have been talking about debt, too. Much of that $35 trillion borrowing has occurred because leaders prioritized what is popular (government spending) over what is wise (spending only as much as you're willing to raise in taxes).\n\nPence is not totally blameless in this, of course. He seems to have had little influence in the Trump administration. Nonetheless, he was a major figure in a presidential administration that added more than $8 trillion to the debt in just four years-a record that Biden is now working hard to equal. As a member of the House of Representatives for a dozen years starting in 2001, Pence arrived in Washington when the federal budget was nearly balanced. He supported two costly foreign wars (though he opposed an expensive expansion of Medicare during the George W. Bush administration).\n\nIt's tempting to dismiss all this as meaningless-after all, Pence is a pariah within his own party and likely has even less influence with Democrats. He holds no elected office, and there's no reason to believe that will change anytime soon.\n\nBut none of the people who have political power seem willing to engage with the question of what to do about the national debt-at least not in public or on the record. Pence has nothing to lose, and that means he's free to say the things that others won't. I hope he keeps talking.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Meet Mike Pence, Possible Donald Trump Vice President\n\nElection 2016\n\nNick Gillespie | 7.12.2016 9:03 PM\n\nRepublican Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, says the Washington Times , has a \"95 percent probability\" of being named Donald Trump's vice presidential candidate.\n\nSo what kind of pol is the 57-year-old Pence, who has a law degree in his back pocket? He served five terms as a congressman from the Hoosier State, where he distinguished himself as a budget-cutter and a hard-core social conservative before succeeding Mitch Daniels as governor of Indiana in a tight election (he won with less than 50 percent of the vote in 2012). He's locked in a tough re-election battle and has to file papers by the end of the week if he wants to be the GOP's vice presidential nominee. He describes himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.\"\n\nSome highlights-and lowlights-from his public career so far:\n\nSo where does all of this leave libertarians? Pence is pretty damn good on spending issues and unlike a lot of Republican governors, his tax cuts haven't bankrupted his state (take a bow, Sam Brownback). That's not a small achievement and neither was his willingness to vote down Medicare prescription drugs and No Child Left Behind when he was in Congress. At one point while in Congress, he proposed an immigration plan that would have allowed illegals to apply for legal status but only after they removed themselves from the U.S. of A. Conservatives screamed that \"touchback amnesty\" was just as bad as letting foreigners stay here. By the same token, he's hostile to marriage equality and laissez-faire lifestyle issues more generally (including the war on drugs), hawkish on foreign policy, and truly terrible on government surveillance . He hates Syrian refugees, of course, and while he really hates the federal government, his first budget as governor included federal dollars covering 35 percent of outlays .\n\nWhich is to say that Pence is not the worst of the Republican bunch but he's not the best, especially from a libertarian perspective. He is very much a modal Republican and, as such, is hardly going to be a game-changer one way or the other. There's a reason only 26 percent of Americans identify as Republican and Pence's various positions help to explain why. Whatever the benefits of his economic positions, coupling them with generally reactionary cultural positions and abject servility to state surveillance and an interventionist foreign policy leaves more and more people-and certainly libertarians-stone cold.\n\nExactly what he would bring to the GOP ticket electorally is anybody's guess but generally speaking, there's no reason to believe that a ny vice-presidential candidate matters very much in terms of winning or losing elections . Even Sarah Palin in 2008, a pick that at least kept the McCain campaign wheezing along for at least a few extra weeks, essentially had no positive or negative influence on the outcome, according to most analysts. And there's certainly no reason to think that Pence is going to matter very much to many people when it comes to pulling the lever this way or that.\n\nHere's a 2008 Reason TV video with Pence at the Republican National Convention in which the governor lays out the case for why libertarians should support the GOP candidate John McCain.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Mike Pence's Towering Hypocrisy\n\nMike Pence\n\nSteve Chapman | 7.18.2016 12:01 AM\n\nIn November 2010, Mike Pence gave a lecture at The Federalist Society's National Lawyers Convention, and I happened to be there for my first exposure to his oratory. I remember the speech because it was an exercise in pomposity and sanctimony so insufferable that I walked out before he was done. Only now do I realize it was also a towering specimen of hypocrisy.\n\nPence's subject that day was the presidency, a topic on which he had-I can't say \"has\"-uncompromising opinions. His mission was to instruct his audience on the proper characteristics and conduct of anyone holding the office. Though he largely avoided the name \"Barack Obama,\" it was clear he thought the 44th president is an affront to the Framers.\n\nThe presidency's \"powers are vast and consequential, its requirements-from the outset and by definition-impossible for mortals to fulfill without humility and insistent attention to its purposes as set forth in the Constitution of the United States,\" declared Pence, his gaze steely and his jaw firmly set.\n\nOf power, he said, \"Those who are entrusted with it must educate themselves in self-restraint.\"\n\n\"A true statesman lives in what Churchill called a continuous 'stress of soul,'\" Pence informed his audience. \"And that's why you must always be wary of a president who seems to float upon his own greatness.\"\n\nPence told a story to illustrate the humanity and humility of Calvin Coolidge. \"A sensibility like this-and not power-is the source of presidential dignity, and it must be restored,\" he said. \"It depends entirely upon character, self-discipline and an understanding of the fundamental principles that underlie not only the republic but life itself.\n\n\"It communicates that the president feels the gravity of his office and is willing to sacrifice himself, that his eye is not upon his own prospects but upon the storm of history, through which it is his responsibility to navigate with the specific powers accorded to him and the limitations placed upon them not merely by man but by God.\"\n\nFor those who feared Obama's presidency would bring about the destruction of America, Pence solemnly invoked the \"great generations\" that have gone before us: \"They are silent now, but from the eternal silence of every patriot grave, there is yet an echo that says, 'It's not too late. Keep faith with us. Keep faith in God. And do not, do not ever despair of this republic.'\"\n\nI had interviewed Pence once and found him mild and affable, so the fire and brimstone surprised me. At the Federalist Society convention, he sounded like a politician slightly unhinged by Obama and trying to establish a reputation as a profound thinker.\n\nBut when Pence accepted the second spot on a ticket with Donald Trump, he made clear that he didn't believe a word he said. The address is full of lines that would disqualify Trump from a moment's consideration.\n\nTrump has not the slightest trace of the humility and dignity Pence once deemed essential, and it's hard to imagine his being constrained by the limits of presidential authority. As for the Constitution, Trump thinks it contains an \"Article 12\" and wants to censor the internet without regard for the First Amendment. \"Somebody will say, 'Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech,'\" he snorted. \"These are foolish people.\"\n\nDoes Pence think Trump has ever endured \"stress of soul\" or even has a soul to be stressed? Does he think Trump has \"character, self-discipline and an understanding of the fundamental principles that underlie not only the republic but life itself\"?\n\nPence warned us against any \"president who acts like, speaks like and is received as a king\"-a contemptuous description he used with Obama in mind. But no candidate has ever behaved with a more brazen air of royal prerogative than Trump. And a party whose principles have almost nothing in common with his views has meekly submitted to his majesty.\n\nDoes Pence think Trump would be a president who \"feels the gravity of his office and is willing to sacrifice himself\"? Does he believe Trump would exercise his powers with respect for \"the limitations placed upon them not merely by man but by God\"? It's enough to make a cat laugh.\n\nIf Pence would listen for the words echoing now from those patriot graves, this is what he would hear: \"OK, now despair for the republic.\"\n\n© Copyright 2016 by Creators Syndicate Inc.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

The GOP is \"probably more of a Trump party\" than a Reagan party at this point, one attendee of a soiree at the Reagan Library told Politico a couple of weeks ago.\n\nNonetheless, former Vice President Mike Pence has made it clear that he believes GOP primary voters still have an appetite for a candidate in the Reagan mold. At the second primary debate of the season last night, also held at the Reagan Library, he defended \"the conservative agenda that Ronald Reagan brought forward in this party, of a strong national defense, standing with our allies, standing up to our enemies, supporting limited government and traditional values.\"\n\n\"Frankly, our party does face a time for choosing,\" he said, referring to an iconic speech delivered by Reagan at the 1964 Republican National Convention. It's a choice of \"whether we're going to stand on the foundation of that conservative agenda that Ronald Reagan poured , or whether we're going to follow the siren song of populism unmoored to conservative principles.\"\n\nEarlier this week, four former Reagan administration officials, including former Heritage Foundation President Ed Feulner, released an open letter \"wholeheartedly\" endorsing Pence as the \"candidate who embodies the spirit and principles of Ronald Reagan.\"\n\nRepublican voters are, in fact, slightly more likely to name Reagan than Donald Trump as the best recent president, according to Pew . In June, Gallup found that Reagan enjoys a 69 percent approval rating overall, more than 20 points higher than Trump's.\n\nFor all that, of course, it's Trump who is dominating the primary field. Pence is currently in fifth place, with less than 5 percent in the RealClearPolitics polling average . Republican voters still love the idea of Reagan, but at a moment when culture war concerns seem to rule , their preference in 2024 may be for an angry warrior over a happy one.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "What Do Recent COVID-19 Trends Tell Us About the Merits of Lockdowns?\n\nCoronavirus\n\nJacob Sullum | 6.17.2020 2:40 PM\n\nIs it misleading to cite expanded COVID-19 testing as one possible explanation for the post-lockdown increases in confirmed cases that some states have seen? Or is it misleading to cite post-lockdown increases in confirmed cases without taking expanded testing into account?\n\nI am inclined to think the latter is more true than the former. But maybe you should not trust me, since I have long been skeptical of sweeping restrictions on movement and economic activity as a response to the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\nBy the same token, however, you should not trust The New York Times , which has long supported such policies in its news coverage as well as its opinion pages. \"Pence Misleadingly Blames Coronavirus Spikes on Rise in Testing,\" says the headline over a recent Times story . But judging from the evidence presented in the story, that is not what Vice President Mike Pence actually did.\n\n\"I would just encourage you all, as we talk about these things, to make sure and continue to explain to your citizens the magnitude of increase in testing,\" Pence said during a call with governors, according to a recording obtained by the Times . \"And that in most of the cases where we are seeing some marginal rise in number, that's more a result of the extraordinary work you're doing.\"\n\nIn other words, Pence thinks we should take expanded testing into account when we look at recent COVID-19 trends. He did not say that was the sole explanation for what is happening-just that it is an important factor to consider, especially when an increase in cases is \"marginal,\" which is true.\n\n\"Seven-day [case] averages in several states with coronavirus outbreaks have increased since May 31,\" the Times says, \"and in at least 14 states, positive cases have outstripped the average number of tests that have been administered.\" Since every state that imposed a lockdown has at this point lifted or loosened it, those numbers hardly seem like conclusive evidence in favor of those policies, or against reopening the economy. Nationwide, new cases have been declining since the end of March, and that downward trend continued as lockdowns were lifted.\n\nBy contrast, in Texas, where I live, the daily number of new confirmed cases has been rising since late May, from 1,083 on May 26 to 4,246 yesterday-a fourfold increase. The seven-day rolling average of new cases has more than doubled, from 928 on May 26 to 2,386 on June 16. During the same period, daily COVID-19 hospitalizations rose from 1,534 to 2,518-a 64 percent increase. By comparison, the number of viral tests performed each day had risen by just 29 percent as of June 15.\n\nThe increase in testing during this period clearly cannot account for the increases in cases and hospitalizations. Furthermore, the percentage of tests that were positive, based on a seven-day average, rose from 4.3 percent on May 26 to 6.7 percent on June 15, which reinforces the point that Texas is seeing a real and substantial increase in infections. So yes, The New York Times is right to suggest that emphasizing increased testing can be misleading, although the paper is wrong to dismiss the issue out of hand.\n\nUnless you think lockdowns were completely ineffectual, it makes sense that COVID-19 infections would rise as restrictions on movement and economic activity were loosened. Yet Texas started doing that on April 30, and it did not see notable upward trends in cases and hospitalizations until this month, weeks after you would expect to see some impact from lifting the lockdown.\n\nOne popular explanation of the timing is that the new infections we are seeing now can be traced to gatherings on Memorial Day weekend, when people who may not have seen each other for months got together, often in close quarters without regard to social distancing guidelines. Around the same time, Texas also saw mass protests against police brutality in reaction to the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nThose factors are plausible explanations in light of what we know about the outsized role of \"superspreading\" events in the epidemic. In Hong Kong, epidemiologists Dillon Adam and Benjamin Cowling found , \"just 20 percent of cases, all of them involving social gatherings, accounted for an astonishing 80 percent of transmissions.\" Another 10 percent of carriers \"accounted for the remaining 20 percent of transmissions,\" meaning that 70 percent of people infected by the virus did not pass it on to anyone. Those findings, Adam and Cowling note, are consistent with the results of other studies.\n\nThe implication is that targeted measures aimed at curtailing superspreading-such as masks, social distancing rules, and restrictions on large, crowded gatherings, especially indoors-are likely to be more cost-effective than broad business closures and stay-at-home orders. The latter approach not only imposes enormous economic costs but tests the patience of people whose cooperation is required to make control measures work. If Texas never had a general lockdown, Texans might have been less inclined to flout social distancing rules on Memorial Day or more willing to wear masks in public-precautions that are far less onerous than the mass quarantines nearly all states imposed.\n\nThose orders, especially insofar as they drew distinctions between permissible and prohibited activities that made little or no sense, left people exhausted by arbitrary dictates . In this context, it is hardly surprising that some Texans rebel even at relatively modest precautions when they are recommended by the same public officials who deprived them of their livelihoods and confined them to their homes. That reaction, while understandable, poses a real problem as we settle in for the long haul and wait for a vaccine to save us. Precautions that might have been sustainable without lockdowns may prove less tolerable after that bitter experience.\n\nThere is some (relatively) goods news in the data from Texas. The seven-day average of daily COVID-19 deaths has actually fallen since the lockdown was lifted, although it is higher now than it was in late May. That positive trend may reflect improvements in treatment and/or changes in the preexisting health status of newly infected people.\n\nYouyang Gu's epidemiological model , which has an impressive track record of projecting COVID-19 fatalities, shows daily deaths in Texas gradually declining through September. The model's estimate of the reproductive number for Texas-the average number of people a carrier infects-has fluctuated only slightly since April 30, sometimes dipping below one and sometimes rising a bit above that threshold, which indicates a continuing epidemic. The model's projections suggest that the reproductive number in Texas will remain slightly below one during the next few months, indicating an epidemic on the wane.\n\nWhether that actually happens depends on how Texans behave now that they are free to move about and return to work. The lockdowns, whatever their marginal contribution to slowing the spread of the coronavirus (still a matter of much dispute ), may simply have delayed COVID-19 deaths rather than preventing them. The eventual death toll will depend on people's willingness to follow sensible guidelines, and it seems that many of them are in no mood to do that.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "In Trump's Washington, Mike Pence Is Odd Man Out\n\nThe former vice president wages a lonely battle for Reaganism, but don't expect him to join the Resistance.\n\nIt's a sign of the times that Mike Pence can make news with pronouncements that a decade ago would've been about as controversial as saying that the sky is blue.\n\n\"Mr. President, Ukraine did not 'start' this war,\" Donald Trump's former vice president posted on Twitter February 19. \"Russia launched an unprovoked and brutal invasion claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. ... The Road to Peace must be built on the Truth.\"\n\nLater that day, Pence spoke to The Dispatch in the offices of Advancing American Freedom, the political organization he launched after leaving office in 2021, about how he sees his mission in politics for the next four years. \"Our role here is really just to promote a broad, mainstream conservative agenda at home and abroad,\" Pence said. \"The president may simply have misspoke ... but facts matter, and that's why I weighed in today.\"\n\nA Pence aide told The Dispatch after this story was published that \"the refusal of numerous members of the administration and the president to acknowledge that Russia had started the war confirmed Pence's initial concern\" that the president's first comments were not a misstatement.*\n\nSince Trump was elected to a second term, Pence has proven himself to be one of the last remaining institutional voices of traditional conservatism in a party and movement willing to go along with whatever Trump wants. Beyond calling for continued U.S. support for Ukraine to repel the Russian invasion, Pence and AAF have urged the implementation of the law requiring TikTok to divest from Chinese ownership, while Trump has tried to give TikTok a reprieve. When Trump posted on social media that \"He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,\" Pence posted his essay from 2010 on the importance of adhering to the Constitution. Perhaps most notably, less than a day after Trump named Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his pick to be secretary of health and human services, Pence urged senators to vote \"no.\"\n\nThe notion that Kennedy, an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist and trial lawyer with a far-left record on abortion and health care reform, should not be the country's top public health official would have been obvious to almost all Republicans a decade- or even a year -ago. But in Trump's Washington, Pence stood almost alone in his campaign against Kennedy. He spoke directly to multiple senators urging them to vote against Kennedy. But in the end, Mitch McConnell, the former Senate majority leader, was the only Republican in the chamber to vote \" no .\"\n\n\"I was disappointed that we didn't have more company in the end. I will tell you that the chorus of voices that reached out to us offering quiet encouragement was fairly deafening,\" Pence told The Dispatch . \"People appreciated the stand that we took and the case that we made, and the way we equipped members of the Senate with not just the life issue, but now-Secretary Kennedy's long record of liberal activism.\"\n\nIn a separate interview, Tim Chapman, the president of Advancing American Freedom, told The Dispatch that the message he heard privately not only from activist groups and donors but also senators themselves was: \"You guys are right. We appreciate you're doing it. We just can't be there with you right now.\"\n\nThe reason? \"If they pop their head up, they get their head taken off on Twitter,\" Chapman said.\n\n\"We don't necessarily feel an obligation to win every policy fight that we engage in, but we do feel very strongly that we have an obligation to raise the issues and that there is a benefit downstream from that, even if you lose,\" Chapman added. \"I actually believe that RFK Jr. is going to be more pro-life at HHS because we raised the issue, and I think he's on a shorter leash on that particular issue.\"\n\nChapman said his thinking about the role of Advancing American Freedom is informed by his time working for nearly 15 years at the Heritage Foundation and its advocacy outfit Heritage Action before leaving Heritage in 2020. With only 16 employees focused on an array of issues related to policy and legal advocacy, Advancing American Freedom is just a fraction of the size of Heritage but hopes to punch above its weight. When the conservative movement was \"at its best, it has tried to pull [GOP] leadership more to the right and tether them to principle on different debates.\" Chapman observed that while Heritage sought during Trump's first term to synthesize conservatism and populism, under pressure from the likes of Tucker Carlson it simply threw in the towel and became \"more of a populist enforcer of the MAGA agenda, rather than a principled and independent outside organization trying to pull them to conservative true north.\" Chapman now hopes to fill that void left by the Heritage Foundation.\n\nBut don't expect Pence to join the anti-Trump Resistance anytime soon. Or ever. \"I do think the administration is off to a good start with the Cabinet overall,\" Pence told The Dispatch on February 19 when asked for the best and worst aspects of the first month of Trump's second term. \"I think the best things are reinstituting the policies that we had in effect at the southern border, and taking the strong stand that they have on the cartels, the collaboration, even the cooperation, with the Mexican government,\" he continued. \"A close runner-up is I'm very impressed with what my friend Elon Musk is doing with the Department of Government Efficiency. Identifying wasteful government spending and outright fraud is a great first step\" that ought to be followed by congressional action.\n\nAnd the worst parts of the last month? Pence takes a long pause. \"I've had some issues with some personnel, and been disappointed in that, but ... overall, President Trump and the administration are off to a good start,\" he said. \"Our goal here is to really be a constructive, credible voice for conservatism.\"\n\nWhat's the point of Pence making the case for traditional conservatism when the man leading the Republican Party has such personal animosity toward him over his decision to fulfill his constitutional duty to count Electoral College votes on January 6, 2021? \"The conservative agenda's been the calling of my life,\" Pence replied. \"While the most prominent voice in our party occasionally signals a different direction ... I'm not yet convinced the president is interested in departing from the agenda that we governed on. But some of those prominent voices in and around the party would take us in a more populist vein. I don't believe that's what most Republican voters believe.\"\n\nOn the personal level, it's no secret that Trump and Pence's relationship has been virtually nonexistent since Trump inspired a mob to ransack the U.S. Capitol and rioters shouted chants to hang Pence. \"We don't talk as often as we used to,\" Pence said. \"In fact, we've only spoken once in the past four years.\" At the funeral for Jimmy Carter on January 9, Pence and Trump had what he described as a \"cordial exchange\" with Trump: \"He greeted me. I stood up, extended my hand, and I said, 'Congratulations, Mr. President.' He softened and said, you know, 'Thanks, Mike.'\"\n\nStill, Pence thinks he can have influence with the president again. \"While we don't talk the way we used to, I have every reason to believe he still listens to me,\" Pence added.\n\nAnd he had advice for those inside the administration hoping to influence Trump in a more traditionally conservative direction: \"I have great confidence in Secretary of State [Marco] Rubio and the National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. I just encourage them to take the opportunities to offer clear, quiet counsel, because in all my years of experience with President Trump ... he does listen. He takes in a variety of viewpoints, but I think he appreciates people who are candid and forthright with him, even if it doesn't necessarily square with the position he appears [to be] intending to take on any given issue.\"\n\nWhile Vice President J.D. Vance is obviously pushing against much of the agenda that Pence supports, Pence at first had only praise for the new vice president when asked for his opinion of Vance's first month in office. \"I thought he gave a very good speech at the Munich Security Conference, speaking about shared values,\" Pence said. \"I appreciated him talking about ... particularly efforts against pro-life people in the U.K. and suppression of free speech in Europe .\" Pence went on to note he \"mostly focused on Russia, and notably China\" when he spoke at that security conference. \"The great challenges that we are facing in the world today really require the president and the vice president to focus energy on standing with our allies and standing up to our enemies,\" he said.\n\nAsked if he expects Vance to be the 2028 GOP nominee and whether he could support him, Pence suggested there will be a seriously contested primary. \"I pray often for the president and the vice president. I don't know the vice president personally, and he was a pretty harsh critic of our administration during our four years, and only emerged in politics after we'd left office,\" he said. \"The Republican party has a deep bench. We have a lot of men and women of great talent ... Over the next four years, we're going to be faced with a very important choice, whether we stay committed to our traditional conservative path of strong national defense, American leadership in the world, limited government, fiscal responsibility, right-to-life and values, or whether we follow the siren song of populism unmoored to conservative principles.\"\n\nWhile Pence sounds like a man saying the sky is blue when describing the current GOP's inconsistencies with long-held Republican principles, he begins to sound more like a man who says clouds are made of marshmallows when discussing what he thinks the party will look like going forward: \"I have a sense that the Republican nominee in the next election will be someone who embraces that traditional Republican conservatism.\"\n\nIs there a chance Pence himself might run for president again in 2028? \"I never say never.\"\n\nEditor's Note, February 24, 2025: This story has been updated with an additional comment from a Pence aide.\n\nJohn McCormack is a senior editor at The Dispatch and is based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "Mike Pence's 2024 Gamble\n\nHe's not convinced the Republican Party is as Trumpified as conventional wisdom suggests.\n\nSIOUX CITY, Iowa-Don't look now, but at the moment former Vice President Mike Pence is becoming the most interesting candidate for president.\n\nIt's understandable if that's hard to fathom. Donald Trump has far more star power than his former running mate, along with leads in every national and early state primary poll. Those same polls show Gov. Ron DeSantis in a far better position to challenge Trump. And rivals like former Gov. Chris Christie and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy are doing a better job grabbing media attention than Pence, who has never been known for his charisma.\n\nYet Pence is doing something unusual, even radical, within the 2024 GOP field: He's running as a movement conservative, a traditional Republican, and an experienced politician in a party whose recent history suggests little appetite for any of that. But the Pence campaign has challenged the conventional wisdom: What if the party isn't really all that enthralled by Trump and Trumpism?\n\n\"I'm running because the things that I've always been about, the things that our administration was about, I'm going to continue to be about,\" Pence tells The Dispatch in Sioux City. \"American leadership in the world, fiscal responsibility and reform, the right to life. And frankly, the [former] president is walking away from those things overtly, and others are walking away from it. And I'm going to continue to stand on the conservative ideas and values that I've always stood on, and give Republican voters a choice.\"\n\nAfter three disappointing national election cycles for the GOP, the nationalist and populist forces elevated by Trump persist. Most of his primary rivals are trying to sell themselves as more saleable versions of Trump, while some like Christie focus almost entirely on making the moral and practical cases against renominating him.\n\nPence, on the other hand, thinks Republicans mostly retain their pre-Trump views on issues from government spending to foreign policy to abortion. Yet he also recognizes that the movement and the party have absorbed some of Trump's more populist views on immigration and trade. It's a dynamic the Hoosier Republican is perhaps most comfortable with, even as his path to the nomination remains unclear.\n\nThe Pence pitch.\n\nAs he crisscrosses Iowa, the state where he launched his presidential campaign in June, Pence makes a remarkably straightforward sell to Republican caucusgoers: vote for a consistent Reagan-style conservative with a career to prove it. His message is one of reassurance, not revolution.\n\n\"I know how the Congress works. I've run a state and know what it takes to get a state growing, I know the things that states are supposed to do, not the federal government. And I've been in an administration that demonstrated when we put conservative principles into practice, great things happen,\" Pence says to voters in Boone, near Ames. \"I think this is no ordinary time, no time for on-the-job training.\"\n\nHe talks up his pushback, as a member of the U.S. House, against increased spending during the George W. Bush administration. He mentions holding the line as governor of Indiana with his Republican-controlled legislature to get tax cuts and defending his state's religious freedom law when it came under fire from the national media. He even touts the most conservative policies on immigration enforcement and global trade of the \"Trump-Pence administration.\"\n\nIn a few key areas, Pence makes his rejection of Trump-style populism explicit. He speaks at length on the fiscal necessity of reforming old-age entitlement programs, while telling The Dispatch that \"the former president's position on this issue is identical to Joe Biden's.\" Although some national Republicans argue against American support for Ukraine, Pence calls for more-the same message he had while visiting Ukraine last month.\n\n\"I think they're following a sentiment among a minority of Republicans. But they're not leading,\" Pence tells The Dispatch . \"This is a moment, I think, where you've got to be willing to square your shoulders and tell people the truth. I've never had any illusions about Putin. In the 2016 vice presidential debate, I called him a small, bullying leader of Russia.\"\n\nOn perhaps the most defining moment of Pence's vice presidency-his refusal to comply with Trump's demand to stop the counting of electoral votes on January 6, 2021-he remains resolute that he was right and Trump was wrong.\n\nA woman at an event in Sioux City asks him to explain his refusal to \"send the votes back to the states.\" This issue \"continues to be misunderstood,\" Pence calmly responds. \"I know, by God's grace, I did exactly what the Constitution of the United States required of me that day, and I kept my honor.\" And over the course of 3 days in Iowa, several Republican voters expressed their admiration for Pence's actions on January 6, unprompted by The Dispatch .\n\nPence's position on January 6, and a host of other issues, are notable, especially given the direction the GOP has taken in recent years. Trump's victory in 2016 convinced many observers that the new president's ideological deviations and uncouth style showed the future of Republican politics. In this telling, Pence's addition to the ticket was nothing more than a nod to the dying conservative establishment.\n\nBut Pence is counting on Republican voters-or, for starters, Republican voters in Iowa-having a renewed taste for the conventional.\n\nPence's pathway.\n\nIn national polls, Pence is currently running at a distant third behind Trump and DeSantis, with a RealClearPolitics polling average of just 6 percent. It's even worse in the early states, where scant polling in Iowa and New Hampshire indicate Pence is also behind the top two candidates and somewhere in the mix of other \"also-runnings\" in the low single digits.\n\nBut it's early, and there's reason to believe Pence has been underestimated so far. His renown as the former vice president, for example, is an underappreciated asset. His appearance last week at the Independence Day parade in a suburb of Des Moines left many people looking starstruck-or something close to it.\n\nThere was the murmur as onlookers began to recognize the unmistakable white hair. People waved and shouted, phones in the air to capture the sighting of a true VIP. One father whose young son has just taken his picture with Pence tells The Dispatch that he's a Democrat and won't be at a Republican caucus next year-\"but, I mean, it's Mike Pence!\"\n\nThe former vice president regularly talks on the campaign trail about how he and his wife Karen are \"well known, but not known well.\" It's a convenient way for Pence to retell the story of his personal life and his decades in public service. But it's not quite right to say he isn't known well: For four years Americans got to know the mild-mannered Hoosier largely by how he contrasted with the bombastic New York mogul he served alongside in the White House.\n\nThat contrast has persisted on the campaign trail. While Trump insults his enemies and dismisses his critics, Pence talks about wanting to \"restore a threshold of civility\" in political discourse.\n\n\"He's a common, ordinary man,\" says Wilmer Hulstein, a comment which gets approving nods from the table of senior citizens outside a coffee shop in Sioux Center. When Pence stops by, Hulstein's friend Carol Apol tells the candidate that she's praying for him. None of the group say they will support Trump again in the caucuses.\n\nTo have any hope of winning the nomination, Pence will need to win-or, at the very least, do better than Trump-at the Iowa caucuses in January. To do that, he'll have to win over all of these voters who admire him and then some. Those close to Pence say that coalition looks a little like those of Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Rick Santorum in 2012, both of whom won the caucuses with the support of evangelical Christians and social conservative voters. But Pence will also need the more Main Street-type Republicans, based in the suburbs of Des Moines, looking to move the party beyond Trump. Competition for those caucusgoers will be fierce.\n\nWhile Pence may have just as good a claim on the non-Trump Republican vote, the question still remains: How many of these voters still exist in the party? For those opposed to Trump, there's a discouraging symbol along U.S. 169 not far outside of Boone, where Pence had such a warm reception among small business owners. The very large sign clearly once read, \"Trump-Pence 2020.\" But Pence's name has been deliberately and completely cut out, exposing the brown wooden fence underneath.\n\nMichael Warren is a senior editor at The Dispatch and is based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "Mike Pence Plots His Presidential Bid\n\nBut some question what the former vice president's electoral path to the White House looks like.\n\nSometime on or before June 30, Mike Pence will likely launch a White House bid in his home state of Indiana. The former vice president would then immediately travel to Iowa to compete for the support of Republican caucus-goers, who have the first say in the GOP's 2024 nominating contests.\n\nPence plans to campaign as the traditional conservative he is, eschewing momentary cultural flashpoints that inflame passions and attract eyeballs on cable television and social media, such as the uproar over Bud Light's marketing partnership with transgender TikTok star Dylan Mulvaney. The former vice president will instead focus on wonky topics fraught with political peril, like how to address the ballooning federal debt and reforming popular programs like Social Security and Medicare.\n\nOn abortion, Pence is eager to highlight his opposition-and his commitment to signing federal legislation limiting the procedure.\n\nIn doing so, sources say, Pence would aim fire directly at former President Donald Trump. The strategy, which Pence hinted at during an April 14 speech to Republican National Committee donors, is to cast his old boss as a backward, grievance-fueled populist who cannot defeat President Joe Biden while touting his own agenda as positive, future-oriented, and the antidote to what ails a GOP that has faltered in three consecutive national elections.\n\n\"If 2022 taught us anything, it's that candidates that were focused on the challenges facing American families did well. But candidates focused on the past, on litigating the last election, did not do well,\" Pence said. \"We must resist the temptation to put what is popular over what is wise, and resist the politics of personality and the lure of populism unmoored to timeless conservative values.\"\n\nIn preparation for a campaign, Pence is accelerating his travel to the key early primary states and beyond.\n\nThis Saturday, Pence hits Iowa for a candidate forum catering to social conservatives; the next day he's in Atlanta for an event at a megachurch as part of an ongoing national \"church tour.\" More trips to Iowa, plus New Hampshire and South Carolina, are on tap for May. As has been the case recently, expect Pence to run a campaign that puts him in regular contact with reporters and emphasizes town-hall style events.\n\nThe former vice president wants to prioritize getting out from behind the podium and engaging with voters in question-and-answer sessions and one-on-one conversations.\n\nPence's political team declined to comment Thursday. But Republicans close to him expect Pence to seek the White House despite long odds in the primary. Another indication: Pence is expected to travel to Las Vegas in October to address the Republican Jewish Coalition, which is gathering for a conference described as a \"cattle call\" for GOP presidential candidates.\n\n\"When Mike Pence was a third -or fourth-term member of Congress he was giving speeches at conservative events in Iowa,\" said a Republican insider in Indiana. \"Mike Pence has been thinking about running for president-probably since high school.\"\n\nPence, 63, has a sterling resume: unassailable conservative bona fides; former high-ranking congressman; former Indiana governor; 48th vice president and loyal Trump running mate through two elections. Pence never undermined the 45th president during myriad White House scandals, and his addition to the Republican ticket in 2016 helped convince suspicious conservative voters to take a chance on a thrice-married television personality and wealthy businessman who jettisoned key aspects of party dogma.\n\nThe elephant in the room, to borrow an apt cliché, is that Pence's path to the 2024 nomination appears uncertain.\n\nPence has been met with far more applause than boos while traveling the country, first on behalf of Republican candidates in 2022 and now on his presumed presidential bid. But party insiders are hard pressed to figure out how Pence emerges from an acrimonious falling out with Trump and deep resentment from a crucial segment of the GOP because he refused the former president's unconstitutional demand to overturn results of the 2020 election on January 6, 2021. That has left Pence languishing below 5 percent support in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls gauging voter sentiment in the primary contest, far behind Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\n\"I like Mike Pence, I think he's a heck of a good guy. I just don't see how he wins,\" a veteran Republican operative said. \"What are people going to learn about him that they don't already know?\"\n\nOther Republicans, especially those who have known him for several years, say it's too soon to write him off.\n\nFor more than two decades, the former vice president has cultivated relationships across all factions of the GOP, and is advised by a team of senior Republican operatives with years of experience in party politics: Josh Pitcock, his first chief of staff in the West Wing; Chip Saltsman, a well-connected Republican strategist who understands the terrain in the key early primary states; Marc Short, his last chief of staff and enforcer; and lawyer Greg Jacob.\n\nJacob, who Pence has come to lean on for more than legal advice, was Pence's counsel in the vice president's office. Pence relied on Jacob to arm him with the constitutional research and reasoning he used-in vain-to explain to Trump and his acolytes that the vice president was not empowered to ignore the outcome of the 2020 election and hand the commander in chief a second term.\n\nBut the main reason some Republicans aren't ready to close the door on Pence 2024 is fundraising. \"He is a prolific fundraiser,\" a Republican operative fond of Pence said. \"Unlike other candidates, he should have the resources and infrastructure when others start dropping out.\"\n\nDavid M.

      "text": "Can Mike Pence Make Fusionism Cool Again?\n\nPlus: GOP operatives weigh in on how-or whether-GOP challengers can still take Trump down.\n\nHappy Wednesday! If you've always wanted to buy official campaign merchandise of Joe Biden shooting laser beams out of his eyes, have we got good news for you .\n\nHere's the conventional wisdom on the right these days: The Trump era showed that the old conservative policy program-fusionism to its old friends, \"Zombie Reaganism\" to its recent enemies-is an electoral dead end. But as he mulls a run for president, former Vice President Mike Pence is arguing that rumors of fusionism's death may be exaggerated-even among the MAGA base that supposedly deposed it.\n\n\"All I can tell you is, I spoke at more Trump rallies than I can remember-generally just before the headliner,\" Pence told the Dispatch Podcast in an extensive interview this week. \"And I talked about a strong national defense, about American leadership in the world, about standing with our allies, standing up to enemies. I talked about less taxes, less regulation, American growth, fiscal responsibility. I talked about conservatives on our courts, traditional values. And look, I may not be the most scintillating speaker in the world, but the roof blew off every time I talked about these things.\"\n\n\"This is a movement,\" Pence said, \"that I believe in my heart of hearts is still animated by the same things.\"\n\nWe'll find out soon if that's true. The political operations of the current Republican frontrunners, Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, have spent the early days of the cycle racing away from old conservative orthodoxy on economic issues-and trying to outpace each other. Trump and his supporting MAGA PAC have accused DeSantis of harboring a secret desire to slash Medicare and Social Security benefits; DeSantis has denied this, while a PAC that supports him has resurfaced an old clip of Trump saying that he'd take a look at entitlement cuts \"at some point\" in a second term.\n\nBut Pence argued that Republicans need to recapture their confidence that fiscal prudence can be a winning message. He related the story of how, while serving in Congress during the George W. Bush years, he initially faced blowback in his district from seniors over his endorsement of Bush's plan to partially privatize Social Security:\n\n\"I had a thousand people gathered at a nursing home waiting to talk to me. And I stood up and I just explained, number one, this has nothing to do with anyone in this room,\" Pence said. \"But for younger Americans, for your grandkids, for your kids, we've just gotta make the system whole. We've gotta fix it so it's there for them. I was reelected in 2006-which was a tough year anyway-resoundingly. We got tremendous support.\"\n\nThe challenges he and Bush were trying to tackle, Pence said, have not gone away in the intervening years. \"The immense growth of entitlements actually threatens our ability to provide support in traditional anti-poverty programs, traditional infrastructure, and most importantly it continues to crowd out our ability to provide for the national defense. We just have to do it.\"\n\nThe full Dispatch Podcast interview with Pence will be available later today.\n\nLosing didn't do it. Fomenting a riot at the Capitol and attempting to overturn an election didn't do it. Indictment, and the threat of more indictments, didn't do it. If you're a Republican contending for the 2024 presidential nomination, what do you say to beat Donald Trump?\n\n\"That's the million dollar question, right?\" said Alex Conant, a Republican operative in Washington. \"There's no silver bullet message.\"\n\nConant has experienced this strategic dilemma firsthand. In 2016, during Trump's first GOP primary, he was a senior communications adviser to a rival, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. Nearly eight years later, the former president might be a diminished political figure. Yet in competition for the White House versus other Republicans, it seems not much has changed.\n\nTrump is the strong frontrunner for the nomination despite a litany of disadvantages: losing reelection to President Joe Biden; leading his party to disappointing finishes in three consecutive national elections, punctuated by Democratic overperformance in 2022; his role in the events of January 6; his mounting legal woes; his age (he turns 77 in June); and the fact that he would be a termed-out, lame-duck president even if he overcame the odds to win the 2024 general election.\n\nSome Republican insiders supporting Trump's current and likely primary opponents are watching this dynamic unfold with dread and befuddlement. Even if the former president's rivals follow the advice of many GOP strategists and mount sustained, head-on attacks-similar to how Trump treats competitors-those same GOP strategists aren't sure which attacks will pry grassroots Republicans away from Trump. In interviews with The Dispatch , they offered recommendations, but little consensus.\n\n\"It's tricky,\" said a Republican consultant in the Midwest. \"He is vulnerable on not being able to win again. But the base doesn't want to hear about how you can win among squishy moderates. 'They won't let him win' can be effective. But if 'they' will let you win, maybe you aren't so great. You have to convince them you can stand up to 'them' as well or better than Trump did.\"\n\n\"You have hit on the main problem,\" a Republican pollster added. \"Ideologically, to contend with Trump, your message has to be smack-dab in the middle of conservative populism-just like Trump. But how do you differentiate? How do you draw a contrast that favors you over Trump?\"\n\nThis is the conundrum facing the other Republicans seeking the nomination. According to the RealClearPolitics polling average, Trump leads among GOP primary voters nationally with 51.3 percent support, followed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis at 23.6 percent, former Vice President Mike Pence at 4.5 percent, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley at 4.1 percent.\n\nMost Republican strategists agree that any GOP candidate who hopes to defeat Trump has to punch him in the mouth. Committed primary voters want a fighter-a standard-bearer they trust to take on the Democrats, the media, foreign adversaries, large corporations and (especially) Republicans in Washington prone to compromise.\n\n\"Someone has to approach this from the place of 'bullying the bully,'\" a Republican operative said. Other suggestions for undermining Trump from professional Republicans include:\n\nBut doubts abound that any of these messages can sway GOP voters, and some wonder if standing up to Trump will move the needle at all.\n\nThat's because the 45th president brings certain attributes to the table difficult to compete with, or replicate. Republican primary voters are well aware of his flaws and many don't care-or don't buy them. Indeed, according to fresh polling from Morning Consult, Republican voters nationally believe Trump is their most electable option versus Biden.\n\nAnd even if Republican voters harbor doubts, Trump benefits from what one GOP campaign guru describes as a \"hierarchy of values.\" Primary voters value \"relentless confrontation with Democrats\" and a determination not to let the GOP regress into the party it was before Trump. Satisfy these concerns, and maybe Republican voters will entertain arguments questioning the former president's electability.\n\n\"Trump is an apex predator,\" this Republican said. \"It's understated how much Republican primary voters hate the political system-including the Republican Party. Anyone who succeeds Trump will also show disdain for the Republican Party, and that's something that does not come natural to them.\"\n\n\"So, I think it's very important, as you have heard from so many incredible leaders, for us at every moment in time, and certainly this one, to see the moment in time in which we exist and are present and to be able to contextualize it - to understand where we exist in the history and in the moment as it relates not only to the past but to the future.\"\n\n-Vice President Kamala Harris at a Howard University \"Rally for Reproductive Rights,\" Tuesday, April 25\n\n*Correction, April 27, 2023: This newsletter originally misstated the total Fox News agreed to pay Dominion News Services to settle its defamation suit.\n\nDavid M.

      "text": "Candidate Pence Takes on Donald Trump\n\nAt his campaign launch the former vice president offered a scathing indictment of his old boss.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence declared his old running mate unfit for the White House, using his 2024 campaign launch to call out Republican frontrunner Donald Trump and make the case to GOP voters for his own brand of constitutional conservatism.\n\n\"I believe anyone who puts themselves over the Constitution should never be president of the United States. And I believe anyone who asks others to put them over the Constitution should never be president of the United States again,\" Pence told a crowd of supporters in Ankeny, Iowa, Wednesday afternoon.\n\nPence proudly ticked off the list of accomplishments achieved by what he called the \"Trump-Pence administration.\" But in unequivocal terms, Pence also defended his critical decision to refuse Trump's demand that he help overturn the 2020 election while presiding over the joint session of Congress that met January 6, 2021, to certify President Joe Biden's Electoral College victory. In announcing his presidential bid, Pence cast the 2024 race as a similar inflection point for the GOP.\n\n\"President Trump also demanded that I choose between him and the Constitution,\" he said. \"Now voters will be given the same choice. I chose the Constitution, and I always will.\"\n\nPence stuck to the same script during a nationally televised CNN town hall with Iowa voters Wednesday evening, differentiating himself from Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is running second in the GOP primary, by ruling out pardoning people convicted of participating in the riot at the Capitol on January 6. However, Pence declined to take a position on whether he would pardon Trump of any possible convictions related to alleged wrongdoing being investigated by federal authorities.\n\nAdditionally, the former vice president suggested he would prefer the Justice Department pass on prosecuting Trump regardless of the merits of any particular case because doing so would be too politically explosive. \"No one is above the law. But with regard to the unique circumstances here,\" Pence said, \"I would just hope that there would be a way for them to move forward without the dramatic and drastic and divisive step of indicting a former president of the United States. We've got to find a way to move our country forward.\"\n\nComing after nearly a quarter-century in elected office and on the day he turned 64, Pence's campaign kickoff fulfills his career ambition to seek the White House. But the events of January 6 now define Pence's political profile. His 2024 strategy, to make not just a practical case against Trump but a moral argument, reflects this new reality for the former congressman and ex-Indiana governor. The result was perhaps the most scathing indictment of Trump from any Republican contender.\n\nPence joined his case against Trump's fitness for office with a broader critique of the direction the former president and other Republicans are taking the party: He accused Trump of \"retreating from the cause of the unborn\" and treating the pro-life position as an \"inconvenience\"; he claimed Trump and Biden have the same position against reforming insolvent entitlement programs; he even said Trump would \"walk away\" from America's role as leader of the free world as demonstrated by his praise for dictators like Russia's Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"When Donald Trump ran for president in 2016, he promised to govern as a conservative. Together we did just that,\" Pence said. \"Today he makes no such promise.\"\n\nPence's broader argument is that Trump has abandoned the party's supposed affinity for constitutional order and conservative values. The former vice president's hope is to reassert the primacy of his brand of Reaganesque conservatism-a major theme of his campaign announcement video -which he credits for the success of their 2016 campaign, the party's last successful outing in a national election.\n\n\"I know we can beat Joe Biden,\" Pence said. \"But we must resist the politics of personality and the siren song of populism unmoored to conservative principles, and we must stand firm on a traditional Republican agenda of a strong national defense, fiscal responsibility, and traditional values that led us to victory in the past and will lead us to victory again.\"\n\nAlthough fresh acquaintances and polar opposites personally and temperamentally seven years ago, the future 45th president and his running mate formed an effective political marriage. Trump, the pugilistic populist, attracted white working class former Democrats and low propensity voters into the Republican coalition. Pence, the traditional conservative who prizes civility, vouched for the billionaire real estate mogul and reality television star with skeptical GOP regulars, keeping them in the fold.\n\nThrough the myriad controversies that roiled Trump's presidency, Pence refused to break ranks with his boss publicly. The loyal Hoosier stuck with advice gleaned from George H.W. Bush's biography-that a vice president should keep disagreements with the commander in chief private. The plan, no doubt, was to win reelection in 2020 and mount a presidential bid four years later as Trump's heir apparent. But the loss to Biden, and January 6, made it untenable for Pence to be the one to take up Trump's mantle.\n\nIn Iowa on Wednesday, Pence laid bare his break from Trump over the counting of electoral votes on January 6.\n\n\"My former running mate continues to insist that I had the right to overturn the election. But President Trump was wrong then, and he's wrong now,\" he said. \"I will always believe, by God's grace, I did my duty that day. I kept my oath to ensure the peaceful transfer of power under the Constitution of the United States of America.\"\n\nPolling shows Republican voters largely agree with Trump on the matter of the 2020 election, believing it was illegitimate or at the very least, conducted unfairly. But Pence is trying to appeal to the better, more constitutional angels of the Republican Party's nature.\n\n\"I had hoped he would come around and see that he had been misled about my role that day. But that was not to be,\" Pence said. \"So let me say, I stand before you today as a candidate for president to say to the Republican party, the Republican party must be the party of the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nThe glaring question is whether there's a market for that sort of talk, and Pence's brand of principled, but civil conservative Republicanism, among today's GOP voting base.\n\nMichael Warren is a senior editor at The Dispatch and is based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "Pence Allies Launch Super PAC Ahead of White House Bid\n\nThe political operation will focus on messaging and ground games in early primary states.\n\nIn front of a group of more than a dozen high-dollar Republican donors and fundraisers gathered in Dallas earlier this month, former Vice President Mike Pence made a bold pitch: As a full-spectrum conservative with a proven record of accomplishment at all levels of public service, he was best positioned to win both the Republican nomination in 2024 and the general election.\n\nAs Pence prepares to launch his White House bid in the coming weeks, his allies want to amplify that message and cast him as a movement conservative more in the mold of Ronald Reagan than of Donald Trump. A new super PAC, called Committed to America, will support Pence through both a messaging campaign and what its organizers claim will be a robust ground game in early primary states.\n\n\"This campaign is going to reintroduce Mike Pence to the country as his own man, not as vice president, but as a true economic, social, and national security conservative-a Reagan conservative,\" said Scott Reed, a veteran Republican strategist who helped start Committed to America.\n\nReed, who served as Bob Dole's campaign manager in 1996 and for several years was the political director for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, will co-chair the PAC alongside former Rep. Jeb Hensarling, a close friend of Pence's from their shared time in the House of Representatives. Among the initial staff hires are Executive Director Bobby Saparow and Communications Director Mike Ricci.\n\nThe group plans to focus its initial efforts on organizing in Iowa, the site of the first nominating contest and home to a socially conservative Republican electorate. According to people familiar with the plans, Committed to America will get involved in the other early states, including New Hampshire and South Carolina, but efforts will be primarily based in the Hawkeye State.\n\n\"Iowa is the first and most important defining event for our effort,\" said Reed. \"We're going to organize Iowa, all 99 counties, like we're running him for county sheriff.\"\n\nThat's the task at hand for Saparow, who most recently served as Brian Kemp's campaign manager in the Georgia governor's successful 2022 reelection campaign. Kemp's paid voter-contact effort there helped boost him to a big win in a competitive primary race as well as in the general election against Democrat Stacey Abrams.\n\n\"You will see that what we built out with Gov. Kemp is going to be taken to the national stage. So we will also be doing a very extensive paid voter contact program through Committed to America,\" Saparow said. \"We have all the confidence in the world that the results that we were able to garner for Gov. Kemp we can duplicate for the vice president.\"\n\nWhile federal campaigns have strict fundraising limits, super PACs are allowed to take unlimited contributions, allowing them to fund some of the more expensive aspects of modern presidential races. That includes labor- and data-intensive voter outreach, which officials at Never Back Down, a super PAC supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have said they also expected to perform in place of the campaign itself. Federal election rules limit coordination between super PACs and the candidates they support.\n\nOn the messaging itself, Committed to America will be trying to reintroduce Pence to Republican primary voters as a trustworthy conservative leader with a political profile apart from and with wider appeal than Trump.\n\n\"People know Mike Pence,\" said Reed. \"They just don't know him well.\"\n\nBut it's unclear how the pro-Pence super PAC will be able to compete in Iowa or the other early primary states against the well-funded efforts to support DeSantis and Trump. The group and those close to it declined to share any information about its fundraising so far. In total, Never Back Down and other pro-DeSantis committees have an estimated $110 million to spend, while Trump's super PAC, MAGA Inc., ended last year with $55 million in the bank.\n\nAnd despite Pence's social conservative credentials, his position with Iowa Republican voters leaves much to be desired. In the Des Moines Register 's Iowa poll this spring, 26 percent of self-identified Republicans said they had an unfavorable view of Pence, higher than Trump (18 percent), DeSantis (6 percent) or Nikki Haley (8 percent). And some with experience in Iowa GOP politics say it will be hard for the former vice president to break out of the pack.\n\n\"I'm not sure the path for Pence is there right now,\" said David Kochel, a veteran Iowa Republican strategist. \"I do see signals that some of the old guard social conservative crowd is waiting to see what DeSantis does.\"\n\nAnd as voters begin to see candidates and potential candidates up close, the mood toward Pence appears vaguely positive but somewhat skeptical.\n\n\"I love Mike Pence as a man and as a person but I don't think he's electable,\" said Mark Hulst, 70, a physical therapist and likely caucusgoer who echoed others among the approximately 700 people who packed a classic car museum to hear from DeSantis last weekend. \"Pence is too nice a guy. We need a man who can be really tough in the White House in dealing with the swamp that's there.\"\n\nOthers were more open to a Pence 2024 campaign, including a husband and wife in their early 40s, Sean and Samantha Hallowell, who prefer almost any Republican over Trump. They voted for the former president twice but say the former vice president had a lot to do with that. \"I like Pence, he was actually the validator for us to vote for Trump in '16,\" Sean Hallowell said. \"If it hadn't been for him picking Pence, we probably would never have considered it.\"\n\nIf there is an opening for Pence in Iowa, it would likely require DeSantis' recent slide in the polls to continue. One former Trump administration official who worked in proximity to both Pence and the former president said Pence would be wise to take advantage of DeSantis' struggles by presenting himself as the most viable counter to the 45th president.\n\n\"If you want Trump/Pence policies without Trump, there's one name left,\" this former Trump administration official said. \"I think if he were strategic right now, he'd pick off donors and members of Congress and opinion leaders who thought the alternative to Trump was DeSantis.\"\n\nWith reporting from David M.

      "text": "Pence Tries to Have It Both Ways Regarding January 6\n\nHe says history will hold Donald Trump responsible, but he has little interest in helping history reach its conclusion.\n\nOn Saturday night, Mike Pence unleashed his anger at Donald Trump.\n\n\"History will hold Donald Trump accountable for January 6,\" Pence declared at the Gridiron Dinner, a normally jovial event for prominent journalists. \"Make no mistake about it: What happened that day was a disgrace, and it mocks decency to portray it in any other way. President Trump was wrong. His reckless words endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day.\"\n\nNow, Pence is right to be angry about January 6. Trump put his exceedingly loyal vice president in a horrible position: Be faithful to the president and his base or be loyal to the Constitution and the country.\n\nThis was, no doubt, a painful choice for Pence. And Pence did the right thing by refusing to play along with Trump's scheme. But it's worth remembering that Pence's decision on January 6 was shocking to a lot of people because he spent four years being a loyal cheerleader for Trump, through the president's countless scandals.\n\nIt's also worth remembering that, really, it was the least Pence could do.\n\nSo, while I am glad and grateful for what he did, some of the praise feels excessive. If all your friends decide to rob a bank but you refuse to go along, that's great. But there's no heroism in choosing not to rob a bank. After all, not all painful choices are necessarily hard choices.\n\nThat's what makes his show of anger at Trump now so discomfiting. He says \"history will hold Donald Trump accountable\" for the events of January 6. I am confident he's right. But it will take longer for that to happen because Pence has little interest in helping history reach its conclusion.\n\nFor over a year, he's held back on expressing his anger about Trump putting his life in danger and inviting a constitutional crisis. Why? It seems hard to believe he was waiting for new facts to emerge since he was in possession of many of those facts.\n\nPence wanted nothing to do with the House January 6 committee, insisting that it had no right to his testimony. \"I believe it will establish a terrible precedent for the Congress to summon a vice president of the United States to speak about deliberations that took place at the White House,\" he said in November.\n\nYet when the Justice Department issued a subpoena for his testimony, he found another excuse: He couldn't help with that investigation because he was a member of the legislative branch on January 6.\n\n\"On the day of January 6, I was acting as president of the Senate, presiding over a joint session, described in the Constitution itself,\" Pence said last month. \"And so, I believe that that Speech and Debate Clause of the Constitution actually prohibits the executive branch from compelling me to appear in a court, as the Constitution says, or in any other place. And we'll stand on that principle and we'll take that case as far as it needs to go, if need be to the Supreme Court of the United States, because to me, it's-it's an issue of the separation of powers.\"\n\nIn other words, when the legislative branch wanted him to explain what he knows, he said he couldn't because he's a member of the executive branch. When the executive branch asked, Pence was suddenly a member of the legislative branch.\n\nNow, as a constitutional matter, neither argument alone is ridiculous. But taken together, he's basically trying to be the Schrödinger's cat of vice presidents.\n\nIf he were really interested in helping history hold Trump accountable, I'm sure the Justice Department-or the January 6 committee before it-would have been happy to rescind the subpoenas in exchange for his voluntary testimony.\n\nAnd there's the problem of asking \"history\"-which has a lot of stuff on its plate-to do the job he's unwilling to do. He knows the facts. He knows that since January 6, Trump has called for the suspension of the Constitution to reinstall him as president.\n\nWhile he hasn't formally declared he's running for president, his team all but admits preparing the ground, about how he's better positioned than Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the like.\n\nShouldn't someone running for president be able to tell the truth-and vent his anger-without so much hemming and hawing and political calculation?\n\nJonah Goldberg is editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Dispatch, based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "Mike Pence Bows Out\n\nThe former vice president urged American leadership in the world in his Republican primary valediction.\n\nHappy Monday! Mike Pence is out, and you know what that means-it's time for Asa Hutchinson to catch a wave.\n\nLAS VEGAS-Mike Pence pulled the plug on his presidential campaign this weekend with one final effort to convince fellow Republicans to reject the isolationists in their midst and recommit to supporting American leadership abroad.\n\n\"As war rages in Eastern Europe and Israel, and China continues its provocations in the Asia Pacific, a new populist movement in the Republican Party says that America should retreat from our leadership position, turn inward and focus solely on domestic concerns,\" the former vice president said Saturday, just before shocking a gathering of the Republican Jewish Coalition by announcing the suspension of his bid for the GOP nomination.\n\n\"I believe we've come to a Republican time for choosing,\" Pence added. \"Now more than ever, the American people, and the world, need the Republican party to stand tall for freedom.\"\n\nPence chose a friendly crowd to deliver the news. The annual Republican Jewish Coalition conference at an upscale casino resort along the Las Vegas strip was dominated by concerns about rising antisemitism in the U.S. and the war in Israel fomented by Hamas' October 7 terrorist attack that targeted civilians for murder and torture and left more than 1,400 dead. Attendees heard from several prominent Republicans-presidential contenders and top congressional leaders-nearly all of whom promised robust U.S. financial and military support for Israel.\n\nThere were few isolationists here. Republican Jewish Coalition members, including political activists and donors, are generally outspoken advocates for American global leadership, rendering Pence's plea to \"embrace a generation of leaders who will continue America's commitment to leadership at home and abroad\" redundant. But it was a fitting coda for the former vice president's 2024 campaign.\n\nPence spent four-plus months as a candidate attempting to turn Republican voters away from the \"siren song of populism,\" as he described it in his farewell speech, and back toward the traditional conservatism popularized in 1980 with the election of Ronald Reagan . Throughout, Pence seemed ill-suited to lead a party that since 2016 has shifted its gaze from the 40th president to the 45th-his old boss, Donald Trump. The former president is the frontrunner for the GOP nod; it's not even close.\n\n\"Pence didn't fail because of his ideology; he failed because he was too Trumpy for Trump's detractors and not Trumpy enough for Trump's admirers,\" says Brad Todd, a Republican strategist in Washington. \"The future of the Republican movement is a fusion of conservatism and populism.\"\n\nPence exits the Republican primary with 3.5 percent in the RealClearPolitics average of both national polls and surveys of voters in Iowa , whose January 15 caucuses the former vice president hoped would vault him into contention. His fundraising was anemic, and it was unclear that he would meet the polling and small-dollar donor thresholds for the next debate, scheduled for November 8 in Miami. Perhaps in the end, as Todd suggests, Pence was simply caught in a political no-man's land.\n\nPence was always going to be persona non grata to Trump's loyal voting base. After all, he refused the 45th president's demands to ignore the Constitution and overturn the 2020 election during the joint session of Congress convened to certify Joe Biden's Electoral College victory. Meanwhile, for Republican voters wishing to move on from Trump, Pence seemed equally unacceptable, a product of his unfailing fidelity to the former president, through myriad scandals, up until that moment on January 6, 2021.\n\nIt might just be that Pence was the wrong man for his time. Republican voters lately seem to have little appetite for the Midwestern congeniality and principled ideology of a politician who for years was fond of saying that he was conservative but \" not angry about it .\" Rather, Republicans have gravitated toward combative, populist culture warriors like Trump-and others-who better demonstrate their ability to deliver on GOP voters' number-one priority: to fight.\n\nPence alluded to the mismatch in his final remarks to the Republican Jewish Coalition. \"The Bible tells us, there's a time for every purpose under heaven,\" Pence said. \"Traveling across the country over the past six months, I came here to say, it's become clear to me, this is not my time.\"\n\n\"If Trump's not running, I would have to look to see what [the other candidates] stand for. Otherwise, it's Trump all the way. He's my hero. Him and Jesus are my heroes.\"\n\n-Iowa Republican Dennis Canarsky, 73, to the Des Moines Register , October 30, 2023\n\nDavid M.

      "text": "Pence Confronts Trump\n\nPlus: Republicans see a chance to knock off Maine's Rep. Jared Golden.\n\nHappy Friday! Eight years ago tomorrow, real estate magnate Donald Trump descended a golden escalator at Trump Tower in Manhattan to announce he was running for president. Who knows: Maybe eight years from now we'll be remarking on the anniversary of Francis Suarez getting in!\n\nMike Pence isn't a political cage fighter or a fire-breathing rhetorician, and he isn't running for president to repudiate the MAGA era. But the former vice president has made it clear since launching his presidential campaign that there's one subject on which he's willing to hit his old boss Donald Trump hard: his contempt for the Constitution and the rule of law.\n\nSo perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that, in the wake of Trump's indictment this week on federal charges of mishandling classified documents and obstruction of justice, Pence has gone farther than many of his competitors in criticizing the former president's alleged behavior. And he's pointedly refused to join with some competitors, like Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, who are vowing to pardon if they win the White House (and the former president is convicted).\n\nTo be sure, Pence leavens his concerns about the allegations against Trump by acknowledging Republican suspicions about double standards at the Department of Justice and the FBI, two agencies he promises to overhaul if elected president. But his stubborn refusal to absolve Trump before the matter has been adjudicated has irked Trump loyalists and sparked testy interviews this week in conservative media.\n\n\"These are serious charges. And as I said, I can't defend what's been alleged. But the president does deserve to make his defense,\" Pence told radio host Clay Travis on Wednesday. \"I've been a former governor. I've actually granted pardons to people, and I take the pardon authority very seriously. It's an enormously important power of someone in an executive position. I just think it's premature to have any conversation about that right now.\"\n\nTravis wasn't pleased. \"What I'm hearing is, you're fine with Donald Trump being put in prison, sir, and that-to me, since you were his vice president-feels pretty disrespectful,\" he said. Pence didn't flinch, telling the talk show host: \"We don't know what the president's defense here is ... Let's take it one step at a time ... Let's follow the facts.\"\n\nEven Larry Kudlow, Pence's West Wing colleague in the Trump White House, pressed the former vice president in an interview on Fox Business to explain why he is leaving open the possibility that the 45th president might be getting exactly what he deserves. \"Every American is entitled to be presumed innocent, until proven guilty,\" Pence said. \"That being said, I looked at this indictment over the weekend ... I can't defend what is alleged.\"\n\nThis hard line might flop with voters. Pence trails Trump, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, significantly in state and national polls.\n\nBut Pence's expansive public comments on the matter are key components of a deliberate campaign strategy to confront the issue head on. As a former vice president, he can speak with authority on the commander-in-chief's responsibility to protect American secrets. Additionally, Pence has two close family members-a son and a son-in-law-serving in the military, giving him particular credibility on the subject of how cavalier treatment of U.S. intelligence can harm personnel on the front lines.\n\n\"Mike Pence doesn't need to 'navigate' indictment questions because they allow him to build off the foundation that he established in his announcement speech: to always stand on the Constitution and rule of law and because standing in the pocket and giving genuine answers allows him to draw contrasts that other candidates can't or aren't willing to make,\" a Pence adviser tells The Dispatch .\n\nHouse Republican campaign operatives have long eyed Maine's 2nd Congressional District as a top 2024 target. Now comes the tricky part: recruiting the right Republican to make the race competitive on Election Day.\n\nThe GOP primary field to take on Blue Dog Democratic Rep. Jared Golden is still wide open. But early indicators suggest the race is likely to be competitive. Only 11 percent of registered Maine voters think the country is heading in the right direction, according to a spring survey conducted by polling firm Digital Research, Inc.\n\nThat same poll pegs Golden's constituent favorability rating at just 39 percent and his disapproval rating at 31 percent-more than double his unfavorability rating in 2019 according to the same pollster. And Republicans flipped a Democrat-held swing state house seat this week, giving party operatives hope that independent-leaning voters are tiring of Democratic policies.\n\nBut winning Maine's 2nd Congressional District is a different ballgame. Golden knows his district well: He split his vote in Trump's first impeachment trial, stays out of the limelight, and regularly bucks the party line. And he's now a battle-tested incumbent, having ridden the 2018 blue wave into his first term and winning reelection by six points in both 2020 and 2022. His 2020 victory was particularly impressive given Trump carried the district that year by the same margin -what amounts to a double digit electoral crossover gap.\n\nThis district is \"pretty idiosyncratic and parochial,\" says J. Miles Coleman, an election analyst at Sabato's Crystal Ball. \"Even though it's increasingly trending Republican, its voters march to the beat of their own drum which I think plays in Golden's favor.\"\n\n\"Maybe some good news for Republicans is that they have a pretty deep bench there in the legislature,\" adds Coleman. \"Any successful Republican is going to have to get a big vote in the French Canadian north and hold Golden's margins down in the southern part. I'm fully expecting Trump to carry the district again but they can't just rely on his coattails.\"\n\nRepublicans are still waiting on a formal announcement from former GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin, whom Golden ousted in 2018 and who ran unsuccessfully again in 2020. Conventional wisdom holds that he won't run. \"According to everyone that I've spoken with, he's not going to run or even looking at it,\" says one Republican strategist familiar with the race.\n\nThe former House Republican did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but one of Poliquin's former colleagues thinks he would do well to sit this one out. \"Losing two in a row is hard to bounce back from and the odds get worse each run after a loss,\" says one current House Republican who requested anonymity to speak freely.\n\nPrevious cycles suggest Republicans will spend heavily in this race. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Kevin McCarthy-aligned super PAC, spent $6.2 million on the district last cycle alone. The National Republican Congressional Committee spent $5.5 million.\n\nSpokesmen for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Golden declined to comment.\n\n\"REALLY BIG FUNDRAISING, EVEN GREATER POLLS, SINCE THE RADICAL LEFT INDICTMENT HOAX WAS INITIATED BY THE MISFITS, MUTANTS, MARXISTS, & COMMUNISTS! THANK YOU.\"\n\n-Donald Trump, posting on Truth Social following his federal indictment, Wednesday, June 14\n\nDavid M. Drucker is a senior writer at The Dispatch and is based in Washington, D.C.

He suspended his campaign in October 2023 after he failed to gain significant traction.\n\n\"Look, I'm incredibly proud of the record of our administration,\" Mr. Pence went on during the interview. \"It was a conservative record that made America more prosperous, more secure, and saw conservatives appointed to our courts and a more peaceful world. But that being said, during my presidential campaign, I made it clear that there were profound differences between me and President Trump on a range of issues.\"\n\nThe former vice president went on to say that he believes President Trump has turned away from some of the tenants his administration supported, including lowering the national debt, sufficiently supporting the sanctity of life, and his tough-on-China policies that would force a sale of the social media app TikTok.\n\n\"In each of these cases, Donald Trump is pursuing and articulating an agenda that is at odds with the conservative agenda that we governed on during our four years,\" Mr. Pence said. \"And that's why I cannot in good conscience endorse Donald Trump in this campaign.\"\n\nIt is expected that President Trump will be the Republican nominee for the election to take place in November, which would result in a rematch with President Joe Biden.\n\nOver the past three years, Mr. Pence has consistently stated that he did not possess the ability to reject the results of the 2020 election on Jan. 6, 2021, despite pressure put on him to do so.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, who both dropped out of the Republican presidential primary, are among the former candidates who have not yet endorsed President Trump.\n\nAdvancing American Freedom (AAF), a Washington-based organization founded by Mr. Pence, announced the American Solutions Project on Feb. 20. Its mission is to defend traditionally conservative policies and values against \"liberal attacks and media distortions,\" according to a statement from the organization.\n\n\"Advancing American Freedom plans to build on the success of the last four years by promoting traditional Conservative values and promoting the successful policies of the Trump Administration,\" Mr. Pence said in a 2021 statement.\n\n\"Conservatives will not stand idly by as the radical Left and the new administration attempt to threaten America's standing as the greatest Nation in the world with their destructive policies.\"\n\nThe organization seeks to influence political majorities by providing conservative policies for political candidates, championing conservative legislation on domestic and foreign issues, and defending conservative principles.\n\nIn 2024, AAF plans to allocate $20 million to advance its goals, consisting of $8 million for The American Solutions Project, $7 million for AAF's operating expenses, and $5 million for the AAF Foundation's operating expenses."

Mr. Pence, who served under President Donald Trump, dropped his bid for the Republican Party's presidential nomination in October 2023.\n\nAccording to the FEC, Mike Pence For President still owes more than $1.3 million in debts. The committee is indebted to numerous consultants for services rendered during his brief run.\n\nIt is not clear how much money, in total, Mr. Pence may receive through the federal program.\n\nAn FEC official told The Epoch Times after a candidate's date of ineligibility-Mr. Pence was assigned a date of Oct. 28, 2023-a candidate may only receive matching payments to the extent that the candidate's committee has net outstanding campaign obligations.\n\nTherefore, according to the official, the campaign's obligations for qualified campaign expenses, including winding down costs, are balanced against the total of the campaign's cash on hand, the value of capital assets, and amounts owed to the campaign.\n\nAccording to the FEC, Mike Pence, For President, had about $584,000 in cash on hand at the end of March.\n\nAccording to a release from the FEC, Mr. Pence's campaign fell within the requirements to receive public matching funds. It raised at least $100,000 by collecting $5,000 in 20 different states and agreed to spending limits set by the FEC.\n\nThe spending limits call for limiting spending on all primary elections to $10 million, plus a cost-of-living adjustment, and then restricting overall campaign spending in each state to either $200,000 or to a \"specified amount based on the number of voting-age individuals in the state.\"\n\nThe Commission also calls for documentation and auditing of campaign expenditures.\n\nAccording to the FEC, Mike Pence For President spent more than $4.7 million during his four-month campaign. By comparison, the principal campaign committee for Donald Trump, now the presumptive Republican nominee, spent more than $68.7 million between January 2023 and March 2024, according to the FEC.\n\nFew major candidates choose to pursue partial public funding for their campaign. According to data shared by the FEC, only Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Democratic Party candidate Martin O'Malley participated in 2016. Mr. O'Malley is the current commissioner of the Social Security Administration.\n\nAccording to the FEC, Mr. Pence is the only presidential candidate to ask for and receive federal funds in the 2024 cycle.\n\n\"The presidential public funding program is financed through the $3 check-off that appears on individual income tax returns,\" a release from the FEC said. \"The program has two elements: matching payments to participating candidates during the primary campaign and grants available to nominees to pay for the general election campaign.\"\n\nA letter signed by the FEC's Chairman Sean Cooksey, a Republican, addressed to Mr. Pence said the money given by the Treasury must only be used for \"the limited purpose of defraying net outstanding campaign obligations, plus estimated necessary winding down costs.\"\n\nIn February, Mr. Pence announced he was starting a policy and advocacy initiative called the American Solutions Project through a 501(c)(4) non-profit he founded, Advancing American Freedom Inc. The project said it wanted to spend $20 million in 2024.\n\nRepresentatives of Mr. Pence did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Epoch Times."

      "text": "Mike Pence Says Trump Conviction Sends a 'Terrible Message' and Divides Americans\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence on Friday made his first public comments on the guilty verdict handed down to former President Donald Trump earlier in the week, joining a growing list of Republicans-including those that have been critical of the former president-in condemning the conviction as a political hit job.\n\n\"The conviction of former President Trump on politically motivated charges is an outrage and disservice to the nation,\" Mr. Pence told Fox News on May 31, a day after a jury found the former president guilty of falsifying business records to hide non-disclosure payments, supposedly to sway the 2016 election in which he was a candidate and Mr. Pence his running mate.\n\n\"No one is above the law, but our courts must not become a tool to be used against political opponents,\" Mr. Pence continued. \"To millions of Americans, this was nothing more than a political prosecution driven by a Manhattan DA who ran for office on a pledge to indict the former president and this conviction undermines confidence in our system of justice.\"\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg charged President Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in order to conceal an alleged $130,000 non-disclosure payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Mr. Bragg alleged that the records fraud was used to cover up or commit another underlying crime, namely a conspiracy to promote or prevent an election by \"unlawful means.\"\n\nThe allegation that the records fraud was committed in furtherance of the underlying crime is how Mr. Bragg elevated what would normally have been a misdemeanor into a felony. A number of legal experts, including retired Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, have said this legal maneuver was unsound.\n\nMr. Pence struck a similar tone in his criticism on Friday, saying that the Trump conviction drove yet another wedge between Americans on two sides of a political and cultural divide.\n\n\"This conviction also sends a terrible message to the wider world about the American justice system and only further divides us at a time when the American people are struggling under the failed policies of the Biden administration at home and abroad,\" Mr. Pence said.\n\nThe former vice president expressed confidence that the conviction wouldn't stand.\n\n\"Having been convicted in a court of law, the former president has every right to appeal this conviction and I trust it will be overturned on appeal in a manner that will restore public confidence in our system of justice and equal treatment under the law,\" Mr. Pence said.\n\nAmid widespread allegations that the trial was politically driven and riddled with bias, there have even been some calls for the Supreme Court to intervene at an earlier stage, before the state appeals process is exhausted. For instance, the House speaker said recently that the Supreme Court should \"step in\" and overturn the conviction, with the speaker arguing that the circumstances of the case have dangerously undermined confidence in the judicial system.\n\nSeveral legal experts told The Epoch Times that, in general, all possible appeals in the New York state court system must first be exhausted before an appeal ends up before the Supreme Court. However, there may be a way to accelerate the process if the Trump legal team bypasses the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court and directly asks the highest court in the state, the New York Court of Appeals, to hear an expedited appeal.\n\nShort of a successful appeal, President Trump could now be facing such penalties as jail time, probation, or fines."

It was a riot, the way it broke out, and I have never seen it any other way.\"\n\nPresident Trump held a rally near the White House on Jan. 6, 2021, in which he made statements encouraging his supporters to march to the Capitol, where Congress was certifying the results of the presidential election.\n\nEven though he said in his Jan. 6 speech that protesters should \"peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard,\" his critics have seized on a portion of his remarks in which he said, \"If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore\" as a call for violence.\n\nLabeling the violent confrontation with police on that day as an \"insurrection\" has been at the heart of efforts to block President Trump from appearing on state ballots. His detractors cite Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, a post-Civil War provision that prohibits people from running from office if they engaged in an \"insurrection.\"\n\n\"And while I said that the president's words were reckless-and I believe that history and the American people will hold him ultimately to account for his role in that day-I think these efforts to take the decision away from the American people are really antithetical to the very democracy that President Biden and many Democrats talk about wanting to defend,\" Mr. Pence said.\n\n\"I'm very confident that the American people will choose wisely. I'm confident that we'll run our elections. But removing the former president or any other candidate from the choice of the American people, I don't believe, is in the interests of the country.\n\n\"And I have reason to be confident that the Supreme Court of the United States will see it that way,\" he added.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith has charged Mr. Trump with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, one count of conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding-the certification of the electoral vote-and conspiracy against the rights of citizens.\n\n\"The reason why Vice President Pence will be so important to the defense is ... number one, he agrees that John Eastman, who gave legal advice to President Trump, was an esteemed legal scholar,\" Mr. Lauro told the outlet.\n\n\"Number two, he agrees that there were election irregularities, fraud, unlawful actions at the state level. All of that will eviscerate any allegation of criminal intent on the part of President Trump,\" he added.\n\nMr. Lauro added that Mr. Pence believed doubts around the 2020 election were legitimate enough to warrant debate during the proceedings on Jan. 6, 2021, when lawmakers assembled on Capitol Hill to certify the Electoral College vote.\n\nAhead of the events of Jan. 6, 2021, Mr. Pence's chief of staff said that the former vice president welcomed an effort by some lawmakers to raise objections that day as Congress convened to certify the electoral votes.\n\n\"Vice President Pence shares the concerns of millions of Americans about voter fraud and irregularities in the last election,\" said Marc Short, who was then Mr. Pence's chief of staff, in a statement on Jan. 2, 2021."

      "text": "Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb Endorses Mike Pence in 2024 Presidential Race\n\nIndiana Gov. Eric Holcomb has endorsed Mike Pence for U.S. president in 2024, marking his highest-profile endorsement so far.\n\nThe former vice president, who officially entered the race on June 7, announced Holcomb's endorsement in a lengthy statement posted to Twitter in which he thanked his \"fellow Hoosier\" for his support.\n\n\"Karen and I are truly humbled by Governor Holcomb's endorsement as we set out to make America stronger and more prosperous,\" said Pence, an Indiana native.\n\n\"Governor Holcomb was a steadfast partner as we cut taxes, achieved record employment, expanded school choice, and stood for the right to life here in the Hoosier State, and I am grateful for his unwavering support,\" he added.\n\nHolcomb, meanwhile, said he has known Pence for \"decades\" and praised the former vice president's honesty and experience.\n\nPence served as governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2017 while Holcomb served under him as lieutenant governor from 2016 to 2017. Pence then left to serve as vice president in the Trump administration and Holcomb went on to succeed him as governor of the state.\n\n\"Never once has he sacrificed an ounce of integrity in service to our state and nation as Congressman, Governor, and Vice President,\" Holcomb said of Pence.\n\n\"Mike's long been known to be forthright on the issues of the day, convicted in thought, and a consistent messenger regarding America's role, at home and abroad, as a powerful force for good,\" Holcomb continued.\n\nPence announced he was entering the presidential race earlier this month with a video released on Twitter in which he criticized President Joe Biden and the \"radical left\" for weakening the United States both at home and abroad and dragging down the economy.\n\nHis video stopped short of making any reference to the former president and current Republican competitor Donald Trump, whom Pence staunchly supported throughout his first two presidential campaigns and most of his presidency, but whom the Republican has sought to distance himself from recently.\n\nTrump announced in November that he is running for president again.\n\nSpeaking at a CNN town hall in Des Moines, Iowa on June 7 after announcing his 2024 bid, Pence took a different stance to Trump on issues such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, government spending, and the Jan. 6 breach of the U.S. Capitol in an effort to distinguish himself from his competitor, who has already garnered vast support.\n\n\"I have no interest or no intention of pardoning those that assaulted police officers or vandalized our Capitol. They need to be answerable to the law,\" Pence said.\n\nHe also criticized Trump for describing Putin as a \"genius\" for his invasion of Ukraine and took aim at Trump's questioning of the 2020 election results.\n\nPolls show that Trump is currently leading among Republican primary voters despite his court appearance earlier this month as part of the federal government's classified document case.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 37 felony charges related to his alleged improper possession of classified records at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nMeanwhile, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is polling in second place among GOP candidates while Pence is polling in third place, polls show.\n\nPence has also been endorsed by his brother, Greg Pence, and speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives, Todd Huston."
