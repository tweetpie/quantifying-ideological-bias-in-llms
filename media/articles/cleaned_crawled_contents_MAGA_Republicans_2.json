      "text": "The End Will Come for the Cult of MAGA\n\nThe next generation isn't buying it.\n\nUpdated at 12 p.m. ET on September 12, 2023\n\nThis article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from The Atlantic , Monday through Friday. Sign up for it here.\n\nIn October of last year, Donald Trump filed a defamation suit accusing CNN of calling him a lot of bad names, the first on the lengthy list being \"like a cult leader.\" One could assume that Trump would be flattered by that, because cult leaders are usually depicted in pop culture as charismatic masters with near-divine power over the lives of their followers. Jimmy Breslin once called then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani a \"small man in search of a balcony.\" If so, then Trump is a large man in search of a compound.\n\nHe stands in front of massive crowds festooned with insignia proclaiming their allegiance, chanting his name and accompanying him on the familiar refrains: \"Lock her/him up!\" \"Build the wall!\" They will countenance no criticism of their idol and accept his version of events without question. The same, of course, can be said about Taylor Swift, although no mob of Swifties has sacked the Capitol. Because she hasn't asked them to. Yet.\n\nThose who call Trumpism a cult can point to his popularity with Republican voters increasing with each of his four criminal indictments. A CBS poll in late August revealed that the most trusted source of information among those voters-more than conservative media, family members, or clergy-is that famed straight shooter Donald J. Trump .\n\nPeter Wehner: The indictment of Donald Trump-and his enablers\n\nAt this point, as the nation faces a series of trials both literal and metaphorical, what label to apply to his movement doesn't matter. The important question isn't whether or not Trumpism is a cult. It's whether the study of cults provides us with any path out of here.\n\nTrump's suit against CNN was thrown out of court, but Diane Benscoter, the cult expert and former cult member (a \"Moonie\" of the Unification Church) who compared Trump to a cult leader on CNN, still believes what she said. She's been working with two incarcerated January 6 participants at the request of their lawyers, not so much to persuade them to recant as to help them with their behavior and attitude while in court-for example, no shouted accusations about the \"deep state.\" The work is difficult and slow, she told me, even more difficult than her recent efforts to \"deprogram\" India Oxenberg, one of the high-profile women caught up in NXIVM, the sex cult masquerading as a self-improvement course.\n\nIt's so difficult, in fact, that she sees greater hope in attacking the demand side of cultism, calling for government programs that would treat disinformation and indoctrination as a kind of public-health emergency-a Sanitary Commission of the Mind. If enough people can be taught how indoctrination works, she thinks, they will be able to see it coming for them before it's too late. Set aside the legal and ethical questions about assigning the government that sort of expansive role; what if it's already too late? Educating people so they won't join a political cult, in 2023, is like closing the barn door after the horse has attacked the West Portico of the Capitol with bear spray.\n\nSteven Hassan, another former cult member (also a Moonie), published his book The Cult of Trump in 2019, long before the attack on the Capitol, even before Trump persuaded thousands of his followers to gather indoors unmasked during the worst airborne pandemic in a century. Hassan told me that the MAGA movement checks all the boxes of his \"BITE\" model of cult mind control-behavior, information, thought, and emotional control. Like all cult leaders, he argues, Trump restricts the information his followers are allowed to accept; demands purity of belief (beliefs that can change from moment to moment, as per his whims and needs); and appeals to his followers through the conjuring of primal emotions-not just fear but also joy.\n\nHis rallies, as so many have reported, are ecstatic events; people cheer and laugh as their various enemies are condemned and insulted. Hassan will be the first to tell you that being part of a cult means you're empowered, special, one of the elect, close to the person who has all the answers/will lead us to paradise/will \"make America great again.\" That, in fact, may be the greatest disincentive to turn away from Trump: Nothing is more fun than knowing that you and your friends are the ones who are right about everything.\n\nIn the four years since the publication of The Cult of Trump , Hassan believes, the movement has gained strength through de facto alliances with other \"authoritarian cults\" such as QAnon, as well as with groups like the Council for National Policy, a secretive networking organization of powerful conservatives, and the New Apostolic Reformation, a theological movement calling for Christian dominion over politics. The danger is metastasizing, Hassan said, thanks primarily to digital and social media, which take the place of sermons and indoctrination sessions. \"We're on our phones 10 hours a day. People are up all night getting fed YouTube videos,\" he said. \"You don't need a compound anymore.\"\n\nAs cults became more prominent in the 1970s, self-styled \"deprogrammers,\" paid by desperate family members, would sometimes abduct cult members and keep them isolated and disoriented until they gave up their beliefs. That tended to backfire: What better proof that everyone outside the cult is a dangerous enemy, to a cult member indoctrinated in that belief, than being snatched up and locked in a hotel room? Whether or not the strategy ever worked, it was clearly unethical and even criminal; some deprogrammers served time for kidnapping.\n\nToday it's clearly not an option: It would take half the country kidnapping the other half of the country, and then who would feed the pets?\n\nOn cable TV, liberal pundits offer up regular factual rebuttals to Trump's claims, as if his followers could be lectured into seeing the truth. But at this point, Trump's supporters have been with him for up to eight years, through countless scandals, two impeachments, and now four indictments. What facts could anyone possibly conjure that they haven't heard and dismissed before? Besides, to admit they're wrong about any one thing would imply that they've been wrong the whole time. As anyone who's been taken in a game of three-card monte and then played again to win their money back will know, the hardest thing in the world to admit is that you've been conned.\n\nInstead, Hassan advocates \"respectful, curious questioning.\" He advised that friends and relatives of those deep in MAGA try reconnecting with them, approaching them without judgment, to remind them of the relationship you had before they turned. Then, through gentle inquisition, ask them to see things from others' perspectives, to think about occasions when they've seen people intentionally misled by others, to ask themselves what it would be like if that happened to them. Eventually-as Hassan said he did, when he was forced by such questions to examine his allegiance to Reverend Sun Myung Moon-they will free themselves from the spell.\n\nMaybe. Diane Benscoter tried just such an approach in a conversation with a right-wing conspiracy theorist named Michelle Queen, on tape for an NPR story in 2021. First, she found common ground by agreeing that harming children is bad. But then:\n\nDiane Benscoter: Some of the things that are being spread about, you know, babies being eaten and things-I don't think those things are true personally.\n\nMichelle Queen: Um, I do.\n\nAt least, as the NPR correspondent Tovia Smith noted, they agreed to keep talking.\n\nTo Daniella Mestyanek Young, every group of people has a little cult in it, and every person has a bit of a cult follower within. At 36, and with a master's in group psychology from Harvard's Extension School, she's acquired a following via her series of TikTok videos in which-while furiously knitting-she shares insights from her own history. She was born into the Children of God, which many ex-members describe as a sex cult, and then escaped it to join the U.S. Army, only to find that the Army was kind of a cult too. In her view, all organizations are situated somewhere on the \"cultiness spectrum,\" and some celebrated groups, such as the military and Alcoholics Anonymous, are much further toward the dark end than you'd like to believe.\n\nIn her TikToks, she includes various lists and rules of cults in an ever-present text box above her head, one of which reads:\n\nThe first rule of cults is:\n\nyou're never in a cult\n\nThe second rule of cults is:\n\nthe cult will forgive any sin,\n\nexcept the sin of leaving\n\nThe third rule of cults is:\n\neven if he did it,\n\nthat doesn't mean he's guilty.\n\nLike the other cult experts I spoke with, Young doesn't believe that anybody can be argued out of Trumpism (or any other firmly held belief). People can save only themselves, as she did. But she argues that such self-rescues are happening all around us.\n\n\"Twenty years ago,\" she told me, \"when I walked away from a cult, it was much rarer to meet Americans like me, who are completely estranged from their families because they wouldn't follow one leader, one guru, one specific ideology. And now it's very common. The way that cults die without a final, Jonestown-like conflagration is when they can't recruit the next generation, and we are seeing this in the alt-right. We're going to see young children of MAGA Republicans voting for the left.\"\n\nShe said that she hears from young people on TikTok all the time who say \"they're not going to vote for the people who made them do live-shooter drills in schools and at the same time loosened the gun laws.\" There's a trend on TikTok of young people posting what are called \"deconstructing\" songs; they're usually about someone walking away from conservative Christianity. They say things, Young told me, like, \"Screw you. You told me all my friends are going to hell. I'm going to hell with them.\"\n\nIt's possible as well, she thinks, that many formerly avid followers of Trump are themselves just quiet quitting, in a way. They stop posting Facebook memes, put away the MAGA hat, get back into cooking or sports or whatever it was that interested them before Trump. As said, it's tough to admit you've been conned, so they don't publicly denounce their former beliefs-unless, of course, they're trying to get a lighter sentence. Consider the ragged smattering of followers who've appeared at Trump's various arraignments, the desultory showings at his recent rallies, the smaller and sadder group of loyalists who attend him at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAdam Serwer: They are still with him\n\nBut Young believes that the only thing that will truly end Trumpism is what ends everything, eventually: the icy hand of death. Not necessarily the departure of Trump himself; she (like Hassan and Benscoter) believes that if and when he leaves the scene, via jail or one too many Big Macs, various pretenders will rise up to claim his mantle and authority, just as the Unification Church splintered into various factions after the death of Reverend Moon. No, what she means is that the members of the cult itself will die out, and there will be no one, eventually, to replace them.\n\nIn 2020, more than half of voters over the age of 65 went for Trump-it was, in fact, the only demographic group he won outright-while 62 percent of voters aged 18-29 went for Joe Biden. Right now, older voters dominate the electorate, but the passage of time, unlike the counting of electoral votes, can't be stopped by force. Trump will someday be gone, and his following will fade and diminish, just like the millennial cults that used to regularly proclaim the impending end of the world. The world never ends, but political movements do.\n\nWe may not be prepared for whatever takes Trumpism's place, but at least we will no longer be shocked.\n\nThis article originally stated that more than half of Americans over the age of 65 voted for Trump in 2020; in fact more than half of 2020 voters over the age of 65 cast their ballot for Trump."

      "text": "The Atlantic 's June Cover Story: Anne Applebaum on How \"Democracy Is Losing the Propaganda War\"\n\nApplebaum reports that autocratic regimes are making common cause with MAGA Republicans to undermine liberalism and freedom around the world.\n\nFor The Atlantic 's June cover story, \" Democracy Is Losing the Propaganda War ,\" staff writer Anne Applebaum reports on how autocrats in China, Russia, and other places around the world are now making common cause with MAGA Republicans to discredit liberalism and freedom everywhere. Applebaum's story is adapted from her forthcoming book, Autocracy Inc. (publishing July 23), and draws from her exceptional reporting for The Atlantic .\n\nEven in authoritarian states where surveillance is almost total, Applebaum reports, \"the experience of tyranny and injustice can radicalize people. Anger at arbitrary power will always lead someone to start thinking about another system, a better way to run society.\" This has resulted in autocratic regimes slowly turning their repressive mechanisms outward, into the democratic world. Applebaum writes: \"If people are naturally drawn to the image of human rights, to the language of democracy, to the dream of freedom, then those concepts have to be poisoned. That requires more than surveillance, more than close observation of the population, more than a political system that defends against liberal ideas. It also requires an offensive plan: a narrative that damages both the idea of democracy everywhere in the world and the tools to deliver it.\"\n\nTo accomplish this, Applebaum reports, autocracies are now making systematic efforts to influence both popular and elite audiences, including via the use of state-controlled media-most notably China's Xinhua news agency and Russia's RT, but also Venezuela's Telesur network and Iran's Press TV, along with numerous others-to create stories, slogans, memes, and narratives promoting the worldview of the autocracies. These, in turn, are repeated and amplified in other countries, translated into multiple languages, and reshaped for local markets around the world.\n\nWhen these stories make their way to the U.S., Applebaum reports, \"a part of the American political spectrum is not merely a passive recipient of the combined authoritarian narratives that come from Russia, China, and their ilk, but an active participant in creating and spreading them. Like the leaders of those countries, the American MAGA right also wants Americans to believe that their democracy is degenerate, their elections illegitimate, their civilization dying. The MAGA movement's leaders also have an interest in pumping nihilism and cynicism into the brains of their fellow citizens, and in convincing them that nothing they see is true. Their goals are so similar that it is hard to distinguish between the online American alt-right and its foreign amplifiers.\" The State Department has in the past decade created a division to preemptively combat (or \"prebunk\") foreign disinformation operations. But no such agency exists to combat the spread of Russian and Chinese propaganda within the United States.\n\n\"One could call this a secret authoritarian 'plot' to preserve the ability to spread antidemocratic conspiracy theories, except that it's not a secret. It's all visible, right on the surface,\" Applebaum writes. \"Russia, China, and sometimes other state actors-Venezuela, Iran, Hungary-work with Americans to discredit democracy, to undermine the credibility of democratic leaders, to mock the rule of law. They do so with the goal of electing Trump, whose second presidency would damage the image of democracy around the world, as well as the stability of democracy in America, even further.\"\n\n\" Democracy Is Losing the Propaganda War \" was published today in The Atlantic .

      "text": "The New Propaganda War\n\nAutocrats in China, Russia, and elsewhere are now making common cause with MAGA Republicans to discredit liberalism and freedom around the world.\n\nListen to more stories on curio\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here .\n\nOn June 4 , 1989 , the Polish Communist Party held partially free elections, setting in motion a series of events that ultimately removed the Communists from power. Not long afterward, street protests calling for free speech, due process, accountability, and democracy brought about the end of the Communist regimes in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. Within a few years, the Soviet Union itself would no longer exist.\n\nAlso on June 4, 1989, the Chinese Communist Party ordered the military to remove thousands of students from Tiananmen Square. The students were calling for free speech, due process, accountability, and democracy. Soldiers arrested and killed demonstrators in Beijing and around the country. Later, they systematically tracked down the leaders of the protest movement and forced them to confess and recant. Some spent years in jail. Others managed to elude their pursuers and flee the country forever.\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nIn the aftermath of these events, the Chinese concluded that the physical elimination of dissenters was insufficient. To prevent the democratic wave then sweeping across Central Europe from reaching East Asia, the Chinese Communist Party eventually set out to eliminate not just the people but the ideas that had motivated the protests. In the years to come, this would require policing what the Chinese people could see online.\n\nNobody believed that this would work. In 2000, President Bill Clinton told an audience at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies that it was impossible. \"In the knowledge economy,\" he said, \"economic innovation and political empowerment, whether anyone likes it or not, will inevitably go hand in hand.\" The transcript records the audience reactions:\n\nWhile we were still rhapsodizing about the many ways in which the internet could spread democracy, the Chinese were designing what's become known as the Great Firewall of China . That method of internet management-which is in effect conversation management-contains many different elements, beginning with an elaborate system of blocks and filters that prevent internet users from seeing particular words and phrases. Among them, famously, are Tiananmen , 1989 , and June 4 , but there are many more. In 2000, a directive called \" Measures for Managing Internet Information Services \" prohibited an extraordinarily wide range of content, including anything that \"endangers national security, divulges state secrets, subverts the government, undermines national unification,\" and \"is detrimental to the honor and interests of the state\"-anything, in other words, that the authorities didn't like.\n\nFrom the May 2022 issue: There is no liberal world order\n\nThe Chinese regime also combined online tracking methods with other tools of repression, including security cameras, police inspections, and arrests. In Xinjiang province, where China's Uyghur Muslim population is concentrated, the state has forced people to install \"nanny apps\" that can scan phones for forbidden phrases and pick up unusual behavior: Anyone who downloads a virtual private network, anyone who stays offline altogether, and anyone whose home uses too much electricity (which could be evidence of a secret houseguest) can arouse suspicion. Voice-recognition technology and even DNA swabs are used to monitor where Uyghurs walk, drive, and shop. With every new breakthrough, with every AI advance, China has gotten closer to its holy grail: a system that can eliminate not just the words democracy and Tiananmen from the internet, but the thinking that leads people to become democracy activists or attend public protests in real life.\n\nBut along the way, the Chinese regime discovered a deeper problem: Surveillance, regardless of sophistication, provides no guarantees. During the coronavirus pandemic, the Chinese government imposed controls more severe than most of its citizens had ever experienced. Millions of people were locked into their homes. Untold numbers entered government quarantine camps. Yet the lockdown also produced the angriest and most energetic Chinese protests in many years. Young people who had never attended a demonstration and had no memory of Tiananmen gathered in the streets of Beijing and Shanghai in the autumn of 2022 to talk about freedom. In Xinjiang, where lockdowns were the longest and harshest, and where repression is most complete, people came out in public and sang the Chinese national anthem , emphasizing one line: \"Rise up, those who refuse to be slaves!\" Clips of their performance circulated widely, presumably because the spyware and filters didn't identify the national anthem as dissent.\n\nEven in a state where surveillance is almost total, the experience of tyranny and injustice can radicalize people. Anger at arbitrary power will always lead someone to start thinking about another system, a better way to run society. The strength of these demonstrations, and the broader anger they reflected, was enough to spook the Chinese Communist Party into lifting the quarantine and allowing the virus to spread. The deaths that resulted were preferable to public anger and protest.\n\nLike the demonstrations against President Vladimir Putin in Russia that began in 2011, the 2014 street protests in Venezuela , and the 2019 Hong Kong protests , the 2022 protests in China help explain something else: why autocratic regimes have slowly turned their repressive mechanisms outward, into the democratic world. If people are naturally drawn to the image of human rights, to the language of democracy, to the dream of freedom, then those concepts have to be poisoned. That requires more than surveillance, more than close observation of the population, more than a political system that defends against liberal ideas. It also requires an offensive plan: a narrative that damages both the idea of democracy everywhere in the world and the tools to deliver it.\n\nOn February 24, 2022, as Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, fantastical tales of biological warfare began surging across the internet. Russian officials solemnly declared that secret U.S.-funded biolabs in Ukraine had been conducting experiments with bat viruses and claimed that U.S. officials had confessed to manipulating \"dangerous pathogens.\" The story was unfounded, not to say ridiculous, and was repeatedly debunked .\n\nNevertheless, an American Twitter account with links to the QAnon conspiracy network-@WarClandestine-began tweeting about the nonexistent biolabs , racking up thousands of retweets and views. The hashtag #biolab started trending on Twitter and reached more than 9 million views. Even after the account-later revealed to belong to a veteran of the Army National Guard-was suspended, people continued to post screenshots. A version of the story appeared on the Infowars website created by Alex Jones, best known for promoting conspiracy theories about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and harassing families of the victims. Tucker Carlson, then still hosting a show on Fox News, played clips of a Russian general and a Chinese spokesperson repeating the biolab fantasy and demanded that the Biden administration \"stop lying and [tell] us what's going on here.\"\n\nChinese state media also leaned hard into the story. A foreign-ministry spokesperson declared that the U.S. controlled 26 biolabs in Ukraine: \"Russia has found during its military operations that the U.S. uses these facilities to conduct bio-military plans.\" Xinhua, a Chinese state news agency, ran multiple headlines: \"U.S.-Led Biolabs Pose Potential Threats to People of Ukraine and Beyond,\" \"Russia Urges U.S. to Explain Purpose of Biological Labs in Ukraine,\" and so on. U.S. diplomats publicly refuted these fabrications. Nevertheless, the Chinese continued to spread them. So did the scores of Asian, African, and Latin American media outlets that have content-sharing agreements with Chinese state media. So did Telesur, the Venezuelan network; Press TV, the Iranian network; and Russia Today, in Spanish and Arabic, as well as on many Russia Today-linked websites around the world.\n\nThis joint propaganda effort worked. Globally, it helped undermine the U.S.-led effort to create solidarity with Ukraine and enforce sanctions against Russia. Inside the U.S., it helped undermine the Biden administration's effort to consolidate American public opinion in support of providing aid to Ukraine. According to one poll, a quarter of Americans believed the biolabs conspiracy theory to be true. After the invasion, Russia and China-with, again, help from Venezuela, Iran, and far-right Europeans and Americans-successfully created an international echo chamber. Anyone inside this echo chamber heard the biolab conspiracy theory many times, from different sources, each one repeating and building on the others to create the impression of veracity. They also heard false descriptions of Ukrainians as Nazis, along with claims that Ukraine is a puppet state run by the CIA, and that NATO started the war.\n\nOutside this echo chamber, few even know it exists. At a dinner in Munich in February 2023, I found myself seated across from a European diplomat who had just returned from Africa. He had met with some students there and had been shocked to discover how little they knew about the war in Ukraine, and how much of what they did know was wrong. They had repeated the Russian claims that the Ukrainians are Nazis, blamed NATO for the invasion, and generally used the same kind of language that can be heard every night on the Russian evening news. The diplomat was mystified. He grasped for explanations: Maybe the legacy of colonialism explained the spread of these conspiracy theories, or Western neglect of the global South, or the long shadow of the Cold War.\n\nBut the story of how Africans-as well as Latin Americans, Asians, and indeed many Europeans and Americans-have come to spout Russian propaganda about Ukraine is not primarily a story of European colonial history, Western policy, or the Cold War. Rather, it involves China's systematic efforts to buy or influence both popular and elite audiences around the world; carefully curated Russian propaganda campaigns, some open, some clandestine, some amplified by the American and European far right; and other autocracies using their own networks to promote the same language.\n\nTo be fair to the European diplomat, the convergence of what had been disparate authoritarian influence projects is still new. Russian information-laundering and Chinese propaganda have long had different goals. Chinese propagandists mostly stayed out of the democratic world's politics, except to promote Chinese achievements, Chinese economic success, and Chinese narratives about Tibet or Hong Kong. Their efforts in Africa and Latin America tended to feature dull, unwatchable announcements of investments and state visits. Russian efforts were more aggressive-sometimes in conjunction with the far right or the far left in the democratic world-and aimed to distort debates and elections in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and elsewhere. Still, they often seemed unfocused, as if computer hackers were throwing spaghetti at the wall, just to see which crazy story might stick. Venezuela and Iran were fringe players, not real sources of influence.\n\nSlowly, though, these autocracies have come together, not around particular stories, but around a set of ideas, or rather in opposition to a set of ideas. Transparency, for example. And rule of law. And democracy. They have heard language about those ideas-which originate in the democratic world-coming from their own dissidents, and have concluded that they are dangerous to their regimes. Their own rhetoric makes this clear. In 2013, as Chinese President Xi Jinping was beginning his rise to power, an internal Chinese memo, known enigmatically as Document No. 9 -or, more formally, as the Communiqué on the Current State of the Ideological Sphere-listed \"seven perils\" faced by the Chinese Communist Party. \"Western constitutional democracy\" led the list, followed by \"universal human rights,\" \"media independence,\" \"judicial independence,\" and \"civic participation.\" The document concluded that \"Western forces hostile to China,\" together with dissidents inside the country, \"are still constantly infiltrating the ideological sphere,\" and instructed party leaders to push back against these ideas wherever they found them, especially online, inside China and around the world.\n\nFrom the December 2021 issue: The bad guys are winning\n\nSince at least 2004, the Russians have been focused on the same convergence of internal and external ideological threats. That was the year Ukrainians staged a popular revolt, known as the Orange Revolution -the name came from the orange T-shirts and flags of the protesters-against a clumsy attempt to steal a presidential election. The angry intervention of the Ukrainian public into what was meant to have been a carefully orchestrated victory for Viktor Yanukovych, a pro-Russian candidate directly supported by Putin himself, profoundly unnerved the Russians. This was especially the case because a similarly unruly protest movement in Georgia had brought a pro-European politician, Mikheil Saakashvili, to power the year before.\n\nShaken by those two events, Putin put the bogeyman of \"color revolution\" at the center of Russian propaganda. Civic protest movements are now always described as color revolutions in Russia, and as the work of outsiders. Popular opposition leaders are always said to be puppets of foreign governments. Anti-corruption and prodemocracy slogans are linked to chaos and instability wherever they are used, whether in Tunisia, Syria, or the United States. In 2011, a year of mass protest against a manipulated election in Russia itself, Putin bitterly described the Orange Revolution as a \"well-tested scheme for destabilizing society,\" and he accused the Russian opposition of \"transferring this practice to Russian soil,\" where he feared a similar popular uprising intended to remove him from power.\n\nPutin was wrong-no \"scheme\" had been \"transferred.\" Public discontent in Russia simply had no way to express itself except through street protest, and Putin's opponents had no legal means to remove him from power. Like so many other people around the world, they talked about democracy and human rights because they recognized that these concepts represented their best hope for achieving justice, and freedom from autocratic power. The protests that led to democratic transitions in the Philippines, Taiwan, South Africa, South Korea, and Mexico; the \"people's revolutions\" that washed across Central and Eastern Europe in 1989; the Arab Spring in 2011; and, yes, the color revolutions in Ukraine and Georgia-all were begun by those who had suffered injustice at the hands of the state, and who seized on the language of freedom and democracy to propose an alternative.\n\nThis is the core problem for autocracies: The Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians, and others all know that the language of transparency, accountability, justice, and democracy appeals to some of their citizens, as it does to many people who live in dictatorships. Even the most sophisticated surveillance can't wholly suppress it. The very ideas of democracy and freedom must be discredited-especially in the places where they have historically flourished.\n\nIn the 20th century, Communist Party propaganda was overwhelming and inspiring, or at least it was meant to be. The future it portrayed was shiny and idealized, a vision of clean factories, abundant produce, and healthy tractor drivers with large muscles and square jaws. The architecture was designed to overpower, the music to intimidate, the public spectacles to awe. In theory, citizens were meant to feel enthusiasm, inspiration, and hope. In practice, this kind of propaganda backfired, because people could compare what they saw on posters and in movies with a far more impoverished reality.\n\nA few autocracies still portray themselves to their citizens as model states. The North Koreans continue to hold colossal military parades with elaborate gymnastics displays and huge portraits of their leader, very much in the Stalinist style. But most modern authoritarians have learned from the mistakes of the previous century. Freedom House, a nonprofit that advocates for democracy around the world, lists 56 countries as \"not free.\" Most don't offer their fellow citizens a vision of utopia, and don't inspire them to build a better world. Instead, they teach people to be cynical and passive, apathetic and afraid, because there is no better world to build. Their goal is to persuade their own people to stay out of politics, and above all to convince them that there is no democratic alternative: Our state may be corrupt, but everyone else is corrupt too. You may not like our leader, but the others are worse. You may not like our society, but at least we are strong. The democratic world is weak, degenerate, divided, dying.\n\nInstead of portraying China as the perfect society, modern Chinese propaganda seeks to inculcate nationalist pride, based on China's real experience of economic development, and to promote a Beijing model of progress through dictatorship and \"order\" that's superior to the chaos and violence of democracy . Chinese media mocked the laxity of the American response to the pandemic with an animated film that ended with the Statue of Liberty on an intravenous drip . China's Global Times wrote that Chinese people were mocking the January 6 insurrection as \"karma\" and \"retribution\": \"Seeing such scenarios,\" the publication's then-editor wrote in an op-ed , \"many Chinese will naturally recall that Nancy Pelosi once praised the violence of Hong Kong protesters as 'a beautiful sight to behold.' \" (Pelosi, of course, had praised peaceful demonstrators , not violence.) The Chinese are told that these forces of chaos are out to disrupt their own lives, and they are encouraged to fight against them in a \"people's war\" against foreign influence.\n\nRead: I watched Russian TV so you don't have to\n\nRussians, although they hear very little about what happens in their own towns and cities, receive similar messages about the decline of places they don't know and have mostly never visited: America, France, Britain, Sweden, Poland-countries apparently filled with degeneracy, hypocrisy, and Russophobia . A study of Russian television from 2014 to 2017 found that negative news about Europe appeared on the three main Russian channels, all state-controlled, an average of 18 times a day. Some of the stories were obviously invented ( European governments are stealing children from straight families and giving them to gay couples! ), but even the true ones were cherry-picked to support the idea that daily life in Europe is frightening and chaotic, that Europeans are weak and immoral, and that the European Union is aggressive and interventionist. If anything, the portrayal of America has been more dramatic. Putin himself has displayed a surprisingly intimate acquaintance with American culture wars about transgender rights, and mockingly sympathized with people who he says have been \"canceled.\"\n\nThe goal is clear: to prevent Russians from identifying with Europe the way they once did, and to build alliances between Putin's domestic audience and his supporters in Europe and North America, where some naive conservatives (or perhaps cynical, well-paid conservatives) seek to convince their followers that Russia is a \"white Christian state.\" In reality, Russia has very low church attendance, legal abortion, and a multiethnic population containing millions of Muslim citizens and migrants. The autonomous region of Chechnya, which is part of the Russian Federation, is governed, in practice, by elements of Sharia law . The Russian state harasses and represses many forms of religion outside the state-sanctioned Russian Orthodox Church, including evangelical Protestantism. Nevertheless, among the slogans shouted by white nationalists marching in the infamous Charlottesville, Virginia, demonstration in 2017 was \" Russia is our friend .\" Putin sends periodic messages to this constituency: \"I uphold the traditional approach that a woman is a woman, a man is a man, a mother is a mother, and a father is a father,\" he told a press conference in December 2021, almost as if this \"traditional approach\" would be justification for invading Ukraine.\n\nMichael Carpenter: Russia is co-opting angry young men\n\nThis manipulation of the strong emotions around gay rights and feminism has been widely copied throughout the autocratic world, often as a means of defending against criticism of the regime. Yoweri Museveni, who has been the president of Uganda for more than three decades, passed an \"anti-homosexuality\" bill in 2014, instituting a life sentence for gay people who have sex or marry and criminalizing the \"promotion\" of a homosexual lifestyle. By picking a fight over gay rights, he was able to consolidate his supporters at home while neutralizing foreign criticisms of his regime, describing them as \"social imperialism\": \"Outsiders cannot dictate to us; this is our country,\" he declared. Viktor Orbán, the prime minister of Hungary, also ducks discussion of Hungarian corruption by hiding behind a culture war. He pretends that ongoing tension between his government and the U.S. ambassador to Hungary concerns religion and gender: During Tucker Carlson's recent visit to Hungary , Carlson declared that the Biden administration \"hates\" Hungary because \"it's a Christian country,\" when in fact it is Orbán's deep financial and political ties to Russia and China that have badly damaged American-Hungarian relations.\n\nThe new authoritarians also have a different attitude toward reality. When Soviet leaders lied, they tried to make their falsehoods seem real. They became angry when anyone accused them of lying. But in Putin's Russia, Bashar al-Assad's Syria, and Nicolás Maduro's Venezuela, politicians and television personalities play a different game. They lie constantly, blatantly, obviously. But they don't bother to offer counterarguments when their lies are exposed. After Russian-controlled forces shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014, the Russian government reacted not only with a denial, but with multiple stories, plausible and implausible: It blamed the Ukrainian army, and the CIA, and a nefarious plot in which dead people were placed on a plane in order to fake a crash and discredit Russia. This tactic-the so-called fire hose of falsehoods-ultimately produces not outrage but nihilism. Given so many explanations, how can you know what actually happened? What if you just can't know? If you don't know what happened, you're not likely to join a great movement for democracy, or to listen when anyone speaks about positive political change. Instead, you are not going to participate in any politics at all.\n\nAnne Applebaum: The American face of authoritarian propaganda\n\nFear, cynicism, nihilism, and apathy, coupled with disgust and disdain for democracy: This is the formula that modern autocrats, with some variations, sell to their citizens and to foreigners, all with the aim of destroying what they call \"American hegemony.\" In service of this idea, Russia, a colonial power, paints itself as a leader of the non-Western civilizations in what the analyst Ivan Klyszcz calls their struggle for \" messianic multipolarity ,\" a battle against \"the West's imposition of 'decadent,' 'globalist' values.\" In September 2022, when Putin held a ceremony to mark his illegal annexation of southern and eastern Ukraine, he claimed that he was protecting Russia from the \"satanic\" West and \"perversions that lead to degradation and extinction.\" He did not speak of the people he had tortured or the Ukrainian children he had kidnapped. A year later, Putin told a gathering in Sochi: \"We are now fighting not just for Russia's freedom but for the freedom of the whole world. We can frankly say that the dictatorship of one hegemon is becoming decrepit. We see it, and everyone sees it now. It is getting out of control and is simply dangerous for others.\" The language of \"hegemony\" and \"multipolarity\" is now part of Chinese, Iranian, and Venezuelan narratives too.\n\nIn truth, Russia is a genuine danger to its neighbors, which is why most of them are re-arming and preparing to fight against a new colonial occupation. The irony is even greater in African countries like Mali, where Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group have helped keep a military dictatorship in power, reportedly by conducting summary executions, committing atrocities against civilians, and looting property. In Mali, as in Ukraine, the battle against Western decadence means that white Russian thugs brutally terrorize people with impunity.\n\nAnd yet Mali Actu, a pro-Russian website in Mali, solemnly explains to its readers that \"in a world that is more and more multipolar, Africa will play a more and more important role.\" Mali Actu is not alone; it's just a small part of a propaganda network, created by the autocracies, that is now visible all over the world.\n\nThe infrastructure of antidemocratic propaganda takes many forms, some overt and some covert, some aimed at the public and some aimed at elites. The United Front, the fulcrum of the Chinese Communist Party's most important influence strategy, seeks to shape perceptions of China around the world by creating educational and exchange programs, controlling Chinese exile communities, building Chinese chambers of commerce, and courting anyone willing to be a de facto spokesperson for China. The Confucius Institutes are probably the best-known elite Chinese influence project. Originally perceived as benign cultural bodies not unlike the Goethe-Institut, run by the German government, and the Alliance Française, they were welcomed by many universities because they provided cheap or even free Chinese-language classes and professors. Over time, the institutes aroused suspicion, policing Chinese students at American universities by restricting open discussions of Tibet and Taiwan, and in some cases altering the teaching of Chinese history and politics to suit Chinese narratives. They have now been mostly disbanded in the United States. But they are flourishing in many other places, including Africa, where there are several dozen.\n\nThese subtler operations are augmented by China's enormous investment in international media. The Xinhua wire service, the China Global Television Network, China Radio International, and China Daily all receive significant state financing , have social-media accounts in multiple languages and regions, and sell, share, or otherwise promote their content. These Chinese outlets cover the entire world, and provide feeds of slickly produced news and video segments to their partners at low prices, sometimes for free, which makes them more than competitive with reputable Western newswires, such as Reuters and the Associated Press. Scores of news organizations in Europe and Asia use Chinese content, as do many in Africa, from Kenya and Nigeria to Egypt and Zambia. Chinese media maintain a regional hub in Nairobi, where they hire prominent local journalists and produce content in African languages. Building this media empire has been estimated to cost billions of dollars a year.\n\nFor the moment, viewership of many of these Chinese-owned channels remains low; their output can be predictable, even boring. But more popular forms of Chinese television are gradually becoming available. StarTimes, a satellite-television company that is tightly linked to the Chinese government, launched in Africa in 2008 and now has 13 million television subscribers in more than 30 African countries. StarTimes is cheap for consumers, costing just a few dollars a month. It prioritizes Chinese content-not just news but kung-fu movies, soap operas, and Chinese Super League football, with the dialogue and commentary all translated into Hausa, Swahili, and other African languages. In this way, even entertainment can carry China-positive messages.\n\nThis subtler shift is the real goal: to have the Chinese point of view appear in the local press, with local bylines. Chinese propagandists call this strategy \"borrowing boats to reach the sea,\" and it can be achieved in many ways. Unlike Western governments, China doesn't think of propaganda, censorship, diplomacy, and media as separate activities. Legal pressure on news organizations, online trolling operations aimed at journalists, cyberattacks-all of these can be deployed as part of a single operation designed to promulgate or undermine a given narrative. China also offers training courses or stipends for local journalists across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, sometimes providing phones and laptops in exchange for what the regime hopes will be favorable coverage.\n\nThe Chinese also cooperate, both openly and discreetly, with the media outlets of other autocracies. Telesur, a Hugo Chávez project launched in 2005, is headquartered in Caracas and led by Venezuela in partnership with Cuba and Nicaragua. Selectively culled bits of foreign news make it onto Telesur from its partners, including headlines that presumably have limited appeal in Latin America: \"US-Armenia Joint Military Drills Undermine Regional Stability,\" for example, and \"Russia Has No Expansionist Plans in Europe.\" Both of these stories, from 2023, were lifted directly from the Xinhua wire.\n\nIran, for its part, offers HispanTV, the Spanish-language version of Press TV, the Iranian international service. HispanTV leans heavily into open anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial: One March 2020 headline declared that the \"New Coronavirus Is the Result of a Zionist Plot.\" Spain banned HispanTV and Google blocked it from its YouTube and Gmail accounts, but the service is easily available across Latin America, just as Al-Alam, the Arabic version of Press TV, is widely available in the Middle East. After the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, an international group dedicated to fighting disinformation, found that Iran was creating additional hacking groups to target digital, physical, and electoral infrastructure in Israel (where it went after electoral rolls) and the United States. In the future, these hacking operations may be combined with propaganda campaigns.\n\nRT-Russia Today-has a bigger profile than either Telesur or Press TV; in Africa, it has close links to China . Following the invasion of Ukraine, some satellite networks dropped RT. But China's StarTimes satellite picked it up, and RT immediately began building offices and relationships across Africa, especially in countries run by autocrats who echo its anti-Western, anti-LGBTQ messages, and who appreciate its lack of critical or investigative reporting.\n\nRT-like Press TV, Telesur, and even CGTN-also functions as a production facility, a source of video clips that can be spread online, repurposed and reused in targeted campaigns. Americans got a firsthand view of how the clandestine versions work in 2016, when the Internet Research Agency-now disbanded but based then in St. Petersburg and led by the late Yevgeny Prigozhin, more famous as the mercenary boss of the Wagner Group who staged an aborted march on Moscow-pumped out fake material via fake Facebook and Twitter accounts, designed to confuse American voters. Examples ranged from virulently anti-immigration accounts aimed at benefiting Donald Trump to fake Black Lives Matter accounts that attacked Hillary Clinton from the left.\n\nSince 2016, these tactics have been applied across the globe. The Xinhua and RT offices in Africa and around the world-along with Telesur and HispanTV-create stories, slogans, memes, and narratives promoting the worldview of the autocracies; these, in turn, are repeated and amplified in many countries, translated into many languages, and reshaped for many local markets. The material produced is mostly unsophisticated, but it is inexpensive and can change quickly, according to the needs of the moment. After the October 7 Hamas attack, for example, official and unofficial Russian sources immediately began putting out both anti-Israel and anti-Semitic material, and messages calling American and Western support for Ukraine hypocritical in light of the Gaza conflict. The data-analytics company Alto Intelligence found posts smearing both Ukrainians and Israelis as \"Nazis,\" part of what appears to be a campaign to bring far-left and far-right communities closer together in opposition to U.S.-allied democracies. Anti-Semitic and pro-Hamas messages also increased inside China, as well as on Chinese-linked accounts around the world. Joshua Eisenman, a professor at Notre Dame and the author of a new book on China's relations with Africa, told me that during a recent trip to Beijing, he was astonished by how quickly the previous Chinese line on the Middle East-\"China-Israel relations are stronger than ever\"-changed. \"It was a complete 180 in just a few days.\"\n\nNot that everyone hearing these messages will necessarily know where they come from, because they often appear in forums that conceal their origins. Most people probably did not hear the American-biolabs conspiracy theory on a television news program, for example. Instead, they heard it thanks to organizations like Pressenza and Yala News. Pressenza, a website founded in Milan and relocated to Ecuador in 2014, publishes in eight languages, describes itself as \"an international news agency dedicated to news about peace and nonviolence,\" and featured an article on biolabs in Ukraine. According to the U.S. State Department, Pressenza is part of a project, run by three Russian companies, that planned to create articles in Moscow and then translate them for these \"native\" sites, following Chinese practice, to make them seem \"local.\" Pressenza denied the allegations; one of its journalists, Oleg Yasinsky, who says he is of Ukrainian origin, responded by denouncing America's \"planetary propaganda machine\" and quoting Che Guevara.\n\nLike Pressenza, Yala News also markets itself as independent. This U.K.-registered, Arabic-language news operation provides slickly produced videos, including celebrity interviews, to its 3 million followers every day. In March 2022, as the biolabs allegation was being promoted by other outlets, the site posted a video that echoed one of the most sensational versions: Ukraine was planning to use migratory birds as a delivery vehicle for bioweapons, infecting the birds and then sending them into Russia to spread disease.\n\nYala did not invent this ludicrous tale: Russian state media, such as the Sputnik news agency, published it in Russian first, followed by Sputnik's Arabic website and RT Arabic. Russia's United Nations ambassador addressed the UN Security Council about the biobird scandal, warning of the \"real biological danger to the people in European countries, which can result from an uncontrolled spread of bioagents from Ukraine.\" In an April 2022 interview in Kyiv , Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told The Atlantic 's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, and me that the biobirds story reminded him of a Monty Python sketch. If Yala were truly an \"independent\" publication, as it describes itself, it would have fact-checked this story, which, like the other biolab conspiracies, was widely debunked.\n\nRead: Anne Applebaum and Jeffrey Goldberg interview Volodymyr Zelensky\n\nBut Yala News is not a news organization at all. As the BBC has reported , it's an information laundromat, a site that exists to spread and propagate material produced by RT and other Russian facilities. Yala News has posted claims that the Russian massacre of Ukrainian civilians at Bucha was staged, that Zelensky appeared drunk on television, and that Ukrainian soldiers were running away from the front lines. Although the company is registered to an address in London-a mail drop shared by 65,000 other companies-its \"news team\" is based in a suburb of Damascus. The company's CEO is a Syrian businessman based in Dubai who, when asked by the BBC, insisted on the organization's \"impartiality.\"\n\nAnother strange actor in this field is RRN-the company's name is an acronym, originally for Reliable Russian News, later changed to Reliable Recent News. Created in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, RRN, part of a bigger information-laundering operation known to investigators as Doppelganger, is primarily a \"typosquatter\": a company that registers domain names that look similar to real media domain names-Reuters.cfd instead of Reuters.com, for example-as well as websites with names that sound authentic (like Notre Pays , or \"Our Country\") but are created to deceive. RRN is prolific. During its short existence, it has created more than 300 sites targeting Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America. Links to these sites are then used to make Facebook, Twitter, and other social-media posts appear credible. When someone is quickly scrolling, they might not notice that a headline links to a fake Spiegel.pro website, say, rather than to the authentic German-magazine website Spiegel.de.\n\nDoppelganger's efforts, run by a clutch of companies in Russia, have varied widely, and seem to have included fake NATO press releases , with the same fonts and design as the genuine releases, \"revealing\" that NATO leaders were planning to deploy Ukrainian paramilitary troops to France to quell pension protests. In November, operatives who the French government believes are linked to Doppelganger spray-painted Stars of David around Paris and posted them on social media, hoping to amplify French divisions over the Gaza war. Russian operatives built a social-media network to spread the false stories and the photographs of anti-Semitic graffiti. The goal is to make sure that the people encountering this content have little clue as to who created it, or where or why.\n\nRussia and China are not the only parties in this space. Both real and automated social-media accounts geolocated to Venezuela played a small role in the 2018 Mexican presidential election, for example, boosting the campaign of Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Notable were two kinds of messages: those that promoted images of Mexican violence and chaos-images that might make people feel they need an autocrat to restore order-and those that were angrily opposed to NAFTA and the U.S. more broadly. This tiny social-media investment must have been deemed successful. After he became president, López Obrador engaged in the same kinds of smear campaigns as unelected politicians in autocracies, empowered and corrupted the military, undermined the independence of the judiciary, and otherwise degraded Mexican democracy. In office, he has promoted Russian narratives about the war in Ukraine along with Chinese narratives about the repression of the Uyghurs. Mexico's relationship with the United States has become more difficult-and that, surely, was part of the point.\n\nNone of these efforts would succeed without local actors who share the autocratic world's goals. Russia, China, and Venezuela did not invent anti-Americanism in Mexico. They did not invent Catalan separatism, to name another movement that both Russian and Venezuelan social-media accounts supported, or the German far right, or France's Marine Le Pen. All they do is amplify existing people and movements-whether anti-LGBTQ, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-Ukrainian, or, above all, antidemocratic. Sometimes they provide a social-media echo. Sometimes they employ reporters and spokespeople. Sometimes they use the media networks they built for this purpose. And sometimes, they just rely on Americans to do it for them.\n\nHere is a difficult truth: A part of the American political spectrum is not merely a passive recipient of the combined authoritarian narratives that come from Russia, China, and their ilk, but an active participant in creating and spreading them. Like the leaders of those countries, the American MAGA right also wants Americans to believe that their democracy is degenerate, their elections illegitimate, their civilization dying. The MAGA movement's leaders also have an interest in pumping nihilism and cynicism into the brains of their fellow citizens, and in convincing them that nothing they see is true. Their goals are so similar that it is hard to distinguish between the online American alt-right and its foreign amplifiers, who have multiplied since the days when this was solely a Russian project. Tucker Carlson has even promoted the fear of a color revolution in America, lifting the phrase directly from Russian propaganda. The Chinese have joined in too: Earlier this year, a group of Chinese accounts that had previously been posting pro-Chinese material in Mandarin began posting in English, using MAGA symbols and attacking President Joe Biden. They showed fake images of Biden in prison garb, made fun of his age, and called him a satanist pedophile. One Chinese-linked account reposted an RT video repeating the lie that Biden had sent a neo-Nazi criminal to fight in Ukraine. Alex Jones's reposting of the lie on social media reached some 400,000 people.\n\nGiven that both Russian and Chinese actors now blend in so easily with the MAGA messaging operation, it is hardly surprising that the American government has difficulty responding to the newly interlinked autocratic propaganda network. American-government-backed foreign broadcasters-Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Farda, Radio Martí-still exist, but neither their mandate nor their funding has changed much in recent years. The intelligence agencies continue to observe what happens-there is a Foreign Malign Influence Center under the Office of the Director of National Intelligence-but they are by definition not part of the public debate. The only relatively new government institution fighting antidemocratic propaganda is the Global Engagement Center, but it is in the State Department, and its mandate is to focus on authoritarian propaganda outside the United States. Established in 2016, it replaced the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications, which sought to foil the Islamic State and other jihadist groups that were recruiting young people online. In 2014-15, as the scale of Russian disinformation campaigns in Europe was becoming better known, Congress designated the GEC to deal with Russian as well as Chinese, Iranian, and other propaganda campaigns around the world-although not, again, inside the United States. Throughout the Trump administration, the organization languished under the direction of a president who himself repeated Russian propaganda lines during the 2016 campaign-\"Obama founded ISIS,\" for example, and \"Hillary will start World War III.\"\n\nToday the GEC is run by James Rubin, a former State Department spokesperson from the Bill Clinton era. It employs 125 people and has a budget of $61 million-hardly a match for the many billions that China and Russia spend building their media networks. But it is beginning to find its footing, handing out small grants to international groups that track and reveal foreign disinformation operations. It's now specializing in identifying covert propaganda campaigns before they begin, with the help of U.S. intelligence agencies. Rubin calls this \"prebunking\" and describes it as a kind of \"inoculation\": \"If journalists and governments know that this is coming, then when it comes, they will recognize it.\"\n\nThe revelation in November of the Russian ties to seemingly native left-wing websites in Latin America, including Pressenza, was one such effort. More recently, the GEC published a report on the African Initiative, an agency that had planned a huge campaign to discredit Western health philanthropy, starting with rumors about a new virus supposedly spread by mosquitoes. The idea was to smear Western doctors, clinics, and philanthropists, and to build a climate of distrust around Western medicine, much as Russian efforts helped build a climate of distrust around Western vaccines during the pandemic. The GEC identified the Russian leader of the project, Artem Sergeyevich Kureyev; noted that several employees had come to the African Initiative from the Wagner Group; and located two of its offices, in Mali and Burkina Faso. Rubin and others subsequently spent a lot of time talking with regional reporters about the African Initiative's plans so that \"people will recognize them\" when they launch. Dozens of articles in English, Spanish, and other languages have described these operations, as have thousands of social-media posts. Eventually, the goal is to create an alliance of other nations who also want to share information about planned and ongoing information operations so that everyone knows they are coming.\n\nIt's a great idea, but no equivalent agency functions inside the United States. Some social-media companies have made purely voluntary efforts to remove foreign-government propaganda, sometimes after being tipped off by the U.S. government but mostly on their own. In the U.S., Facebook created a security-policy unit that still regularly announces when it discovers \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\"-meaning accounts that are automated and/or evidently part of a planned operation from (usually) Russian, Iranian, or Chinese sources-and then takes down the posts. It is difficult for outsiders to monitor this activity, because the company restricts access to its data, and even controls the tools that can be used to examine the data. In March, Meta announced that by August, it would phase out CrowdTangle, a tool used to analyze Facebook data, and replace it with a tool that analysts fear will be harder to use.\n\nX (formerly Twitter) also used to look for foreign propaganda activity, but under the ownership of Elon Musk, that voluntary effort has been badly weakened. The new blue-check \"verification\" process allows users-including anonymous, pro-Russian users-to pay to have their posts amplified; the old \"safety team\" no longer exists. The result: After the collapse of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine last summer, a major environmental and humanitarian disaster caused by Russian bombing over many weeks, the false narrative that Ukraine had destroyed it appeared hundreds of thousands of times on X. After the ISIS terrorist attack on a concert hall in Moscow in March, David Sacks, the former PayPal entrepreneur and a close associate of Musk's, posted on X, with no evidence, that \"if the Ukrainian government was behind the terrorist attack, as looks increasingly likely, the U.S. must renounce it.\" His completely unfounded post was viewed 2.5 million times. This spring, some Republican congressional leaders finally began speaking about the Russian propaganda that had \"infected\" their base and their colleagues. Most of that \"Russian propaganda\" is not coming from inside Russia.\n\nOver the past several years, universities and think tanks have used their own data analytics to try to identify inauthentic networks on the largest websites-but they are also now meeting resistance from MAGA-affiliated Republican politicians. In 2020, teams at Stanford University and the University of Washington, together with the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council and Graphika, a company that specializes in social-media analytics, decided to join forces to monitor false election information. Renée DiResta, one of the leaders of what became the Election Integrity Partnership, told me that an early concern was Russian and Chinese campaigns. DiResta assumed that these foreign interventions wouldn't matter much, but she thought it would be useful and academically interesting to understand their scope. \"Lo and behold,\" she said, \"the entity that becomes the most persistent in alleging that American elections are fraudulent, fake, rigged, and everything else turns out to be the president of the United States.\" The Election Integrity Partnership tracked election rumors coming from across the political spectrum, but observed that the MAGA right was far more prolific and significant than any other source.\n\nThe Election Integrity Partnership was not organized or directed by the U.S. government. It occasionally reached out to platforms, but had no power to compel them to act, DiResta told me. Nevertheless, the project became the focus of a complicated MAGA-world conspiracy theory about alleged government suppression of free speech, and it led to legal and personal attacks on many of those involved. The project has been smeared and mischaracterized by some of the journalists attached to Musk's \"Twitter Files\" investigation , and by Representative Jim Jordan's Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government. A series of lawsuits alleging that the U.S. government sought to suppress conservative speech, including one launched by Missouri and Louisiana that has now reached the Supreme Court, has effectively tried to silence organizations that investigate both domestic and foreign disinformation campaigns, overt and covert. To state baldly what is happening: The Republican Party's right wing is actively harassing legitimate, good-faith efforts to track the production and dissemination of autocratic disinformation here in the United States.\n\nOver time, the attack on the Election Integrity Partnership has itself acquired some of the characteristics of a classic information-laundering operation. The most notorious example concerns a reference, on page 183 of the project's final post-2020-election report, to the 21,897,364 tweets gathered after the election, in an effort to catalog the most viral false rumors. That simple statement of the size of the database has been twisted into another false and yet constantly repeated rumor: the spurious claim that the Department of Homeland Security somehow conspired with the Election Integrity Partnership to censor 22 million tweets. This never happened, and yet DiResta said that \"this nonsense about the 22 million tweets pops up constantly as evidence of the sheer volume of our duplicity\"; it has even appeared in the Congressional Record .\n\nThe same tactics have been used against the Global Engagement Center. In 2021, the GEC gave a grant to another organization, the Global Disinformation Index, which helped develop a technical tool to track online campaigns in East Asia and Europe. For a completely unrelated, separately funded project, the Global Disinformation Index also conducted a study, aimed at advertisers, that identified websites at risk for publishing false stories. Two conservative organizations, finding their names on that latter list, sued the GEC, although it had nothing to do with creating the list. Musk posted, again without any evidence, \"The worst offender in US government censorship & media manipulation is an obscure agency called GEC,\" and that organization also became caught up in the endless whirlwind of conspiracy and congressional investigations.\n\nAs it happens, I was caught up in it too, because I was listed online as an \"adviser\" to the Global Disinformation Index, even though I had not spoken with anyone at the organization for several years and was not aware that it even had a website. A predictable, and wearisome, pattern followed: false accusations (no, I was not advising anyone to censor anyone) and the obligatory death threats. Of course, my experience was mild compared with the experience of DiResta, who has been accused of being, as she put it, \"the head of a censorship-industrial complex that does not exist.\"\n\nThese stories are symptomatic of a larger problem: Because the American extreme right and (more rarely) the extreme left benefit from the spread of antidemocratic narratives, they have an interest in silencing or hobbling any group that wants to stop, or even identify, foreign campaigns. Senator Mark Warner, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told me that \"we are actually less prepared today than we were four years ago\" for foreign attempts to influence the 2024 election. This is not only because authoritarian propaganda campaigns have become more sophisticated as they begin to use AI, or because \"you obviously have a political environment here where there's a lot more Americans who are more distrustful of all institutions.\" It's also because the lawsuits, threats, and smear tactics have chilled government, academic, and tech-company responses.\n\nOne could call this a secret authoritarian \"plot\" to preserve the ability to spread antidemocratic conspiracy theories, except that it's not a secret. It's all visible, right on the surface. Russia, China, and sometimes other state actors-Venezuela, Iran, Hungary-work with Americans to discredit democracy, to undermine the credibility of democratic leaders, to mock the rule of law. They do so with the goal of electing Trump, whose second presidency would damage the image of democracy around the world, as well as the stability of democracy in America, even further.\n\nThis article appears in the June 2024 print edition with the headline \"Democracy Is Losing the Propaganda War.\" Anne Applebaum's new book, Autocracy, Inc.: The Dictators Who Want to Run the World , will be published in July.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "The Nihilism of MAGA World\n\nThe president said something frightening and true.\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here .\n\nJoe Biden's \"Soul of the Nation\" address got at a cold and disquieting truth: The MAGA movement cannot be placated, reasoned with, or politically accommodated in any way. There is nothing its adherents want-and nothing anyone can give them-beyond chaos and political destruction.\n\nBut first, here are three new stories from The Atlantic .\n\nJoe Biden's address to the American people last week was, as I wrote at the time , necessary and right. The staging was bizarre, and the speech had some of the hallmarks of a group product that hadn't been subjected to a final spackle-and-smooth by a chief writer. But Biden got one big thing right, and that one thing explains why Donald Trump and the MAGA World apologists are reacting with such fury . The president outed them as anti-American nihilists:\n\nThey promote authoritarian leaders, and they fan the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights, to the pursuit of justice, to the rule of law, to the very soul of this country ... MAGA Republicans have made their choice. They embrace anger. They thrive on chaos. They live not in the light of truth but in the shadow of lies.\n\nThis, as Biden pointed out, is what makes the MAGA movement so dangerous. It has no functional compass and no set of actual preferences beyond a generalized resentment, a basket of gripes and grudges against others who the Trumpists think are looking down upon them or living better lives than they are. It is a movement composed of people who are economically comfortable and middle-class , who enjoy a relatively high standard of living, and yet who seethe with a sense that they have been done dirt, screwed over, betrayed-and they are determined to get revenge.\n\nBiden broke with tradition by saying what presidents are never supposed to say: He admitted that he was finally giving up on trying to accommodate a group of Americans, because he understands that they do not want to be accommodated. I know that some of my friends and colleagues believe that Biden, as president, must continue to reach out to MAGA voters because they are our neighbors and our fellow citizens. (The former GOP operative and my fellow Never Trumper Tim Miller made this point just this morning .) My instinct is to agree with them. But how do we reach those voters? These citizens do not want a discussion or a compromise. They don't even want to \"win,\" in any traditional political sense of that word. They want to vent anger over their lives-their personal problems, their haunted sense of inferiority, and their fears about social status -on other Americans, as vehemently as possible, even to the point of violence.\n\nHow do any of us, and especially the president, engage with such a movement, when every discussion includes the belief that the only legitimate outcomes are ones in which the MAGA choice wins? Such an insistence is not civic or democratic in any way, and it is not amenable to resolution through the democratic process.\n\nThis, by the way, is why it was a mistake for Biden to raise issues such as abortion and privacy in his speech. Yes, the opportunists who will ride into political office on the bed of a pickup flying MAGA flags will attack these rights, but that is incidental to their real interest, which is power and the spoils it brings. Issues such as abortion, LGBTQ rights, and contraception are really just hot buttons meant to rile up the voters. (MAGA World, as a movement, seems to have a kind of tabloid-television-style obsession with sex, which makes sense, as it is led by a tabloid star who literally bragged about the size of his penis on a GOP debate stage.)\n\nFor Biden even to mention something like abortion undermined the more important part of his speech, which is that MAGA is a movement that doesn't believe in anything but violence, chaos, and power. Right-wing pundits have seized on that part of his speech because it was the only thing they could argue with; they know that trying to describe MAGA and Trumpism with any consistency is pointless. Smaller government? More democracy? Power to \"We the People\"? Good luck with that: Trump just endorsed a GOP candidate for governor, Geoff Diehl in Massachusetts, by telling a crowd that Diehl will \"rule your state with an iron fist, and he'll do what has to be done.\"\n\nAs a native son of the Commonwealth, I have no concerns that the Bay State is going to elect someone on Donald Trump's say-so. But Trump's authoritarian blather makes Biden's point. The MAGA movement isn't interested in politics, or policies, or compromises. It is interested in destruction and seeing others made as miserable as its followers are. MAGA is a movement of people who seem to be, in so many ways, deeply and profoundly unhappy, and suffering from an emptiness and anger deep in their spirit. There is no political solution for that. All Joe Biden did was finally say this obvious truth out loud.\n\nRelated:\n\nThe Val Demings Gamble\n\nBy Adam Harris\n\nOn a hot D.C.

      "text": "Trump Returns to Rally Team MAGA\n\nAt the former president's first rally since the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago, the mood among his supporters veered from desperation to defiance.\n\nWILKES-BARRE, Pa.-Donald Trump's rally on Saturday night was his first major public appearance since the FBI searched his Florida home-and you could tell. A kind of manic, vengeful energy circulated among the throngs of supporters in the blue stadium seats at the Mohegan Sun Arena. Fans wore T-shirts reading YOU RAIDED THE WRONG PRESIDENT and THREAT TO DEMOCRACY , in a reference to President Joe Biden's speech last week in Philadelphia. The audience of thousands screamed in agreement when Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who's become a regular warm-up act at these rallies, declared that the FBI had \"violated our president's rights.\" And later on, the crowd exploded into one resounding, ricocheting jeer when Trump, finally on stage, addressed the matter himself.\n\n\"There can be no more real example of the very clear threats to American freedom than just a few weeks ago,\" the former president said, when \"we witnessed one of the most shocking abuses of power we have witnessed from any administration in American history!\"\n\nTrump is back at the forefront of American politics, just two months ahead of the midterm elections. This time, the former president is in a strange new position: He's backed into a corner by legal trouble. And his ever-loyal fans have joined him in a defensive crouch. \"We came because of the Mar-a-Lago raid,\" Mike Rutherford, a truck driver from East Stroudsburg, told me. He sat near the stage in a folding chair alongside his wife, Pat. \"We're here to support him,\" Pat said, nodding. \"I can't believe how brave that man is.\"\n\nPennsylvania found itself smack-dab in the eye of the midterms hurricane this week. Trump's rally was intended to give a boost to the flagging campaigns of the gubernatorial candidate and State Senator Doug Mastriano and the Senate candidate Mehmet Oz, both of whom have endorsed Trump's election lies and received his endorsement in exchange. Just two days ago, Biden spoke 100 miles to the south before an eerily lit Independence Hall, and was more direct in his warnings than he's been in previous addresses: \"Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic.\" The Darth Vader optics of his speech may have interfered with its intended effect, but Trump and the candidates he's endorsed are a threat to democracy because they appear to believe in only two kinds of election outcomes: Either they win or the system is rigged.\n\nDavid Frum: The justification for Biden's speech\n\nPennsylvania has become a hub for \"Stop the Steal\" candidates thanks, in part, to Mastriano, who spoke ahead of Trump on Saturday night. The Republican state senator and former Army colonel was outside the Capitol when rioters broke in on January 6; he helped lead the state efforts to overturn the presidential election in 2020; and he's been subpoenaed by the January 6 committee for his alleged involvement in organizing an alternate set of Electoral College electors for Trump. (Last week, Mastriano sued the panel to avoid testifying.)\n\nBoth he and Oz offered versions of their stump speeches and declared solidarity with their party leader in his moment of need on Saturday. Other headliners included Greene, the Georgia representative who'd descended the arena steps earlier in the afternoon as \"She's a Beauty\" by the Tubes played over the loudspeakers, and the Pennsylvania congressional candidate Jim Bognet, who quipped that America should hire \"87,000 more border patrol agents, not IRS agents!\"\n\nWhen Trump emerged shortly after 7 p.m., backed by the usual Lee Greenwood soundtrack, he meandered through his standard repertoire: the Russia investigation \"hoax,\" Biden's failures, the death penalty for drug dealers. He even managed to encourage a mass heckling of the press seated in the back of the stadium on at least five occasions. But it was Trump's FBI comments that got the crowd most riled up. \"The FBI and the Justice Department have become vicious monsters, controlled by radical-left scoundrels, lawyers, and the media, who tell them what to do,\" he told them. Audience members whooped, and a few shouted out \"Defund the FBI!\"\n\nThe Trump's fans I'd spoken with earlier, standing near the Dippin' Dots ice-cream stall and in line for Chickie's & Pete's chicken cutlets, all had his back. \"It's politically motivated,\" Jim Shaw, a barber from New Milford, told me when I asked what he made of the search at Mar-a-Lago. \"If Donald Trump wasn't looking like he was the [leading] Republican candidate for president, I don't think it would have happened.\" Every one of the dozen or so people I talked with offered some defense of the former president: The search was a setup; the evidence was planted; Biden's DOJ was trampling on Trump's constitutional rights to keep him from running for office again.\n\nRead: 'Stop the Steal' is a metaphor\n\nI detected a touch of desperation in many people's responses-a sense that, if Trump-endorsed candidates don't win in November, America as they know it will cease to exist. Here in northeast Pennsylvania-just 20 miles down the road from Biden's hometown-was a gathering of people not just pessimistic about the future of the country under his leadership, but deeply fearful too. \"At this point right now, I'm worried about being targeted by the FBI because I'm a Christian, I'm conservative,\" Pat Rutherford said. \"I know they won't find anything, but I am going to need a lawyer to prove I am innocent.\" The DOJ \"is like a militia for the Democrats,\" Linda Hess, from Selinsgrove, told me. \"I think our First Amendment rights are basically gone as conservatives. I really do.\"\n\nTrump and his loyalists are eager to fan these fears. \"Your president called all of you extremists!\" Greene told the rally when she was on stage. \"Joe Biden has declared that half of this country are enemies of the state!\" (The president, in fact, made a clear distinction: \"Not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans.\") \"Save us, Trump!\" one woman yelled from the crowd during his speech.\n\nFear can be a winning political tactic. It helped candidates like Mastriano sail to victory in the Republican primary. But general elections are different. The president's party usually fares poorly in the midterms cycle, and just a few weeks ago, the fundamentals would have indicated that Republicans were about to have an excellent November. Recently, though, the numbers have shifted in the Democrats' favor. Inflation is down, and so are gas prices; new job numbers are high, and unemployment is still low; and Democrats are already seeing signs that their voters are highly motivated by the overturning of Roe v. Wade . In the latest polls, both Mastriano and Oz are trailing their respective Democratic opponents, Josh Shapiro and John Fetterman.\n\nStill, 10 weeks is a long time in American politics. Republicans could gain back an edge between now and then. Some experts predict that both races will probably end up much closer than they are now. The risks of electing an election denier such as Mastriano are clear: As governor, he'd have the power to appoint the secretary of state, and together, the two officials could muddy the waters after a close election or, allied with the Republican-dominated state legislature, even change election rules to benefit their party.\n\nThat danger extends far beyond the Keystone State. Other \"Stop the Steal\" candidates are running all over the country. In 2020 battleground states, candidates who've endorsed Trump's lies about election fraud have won nearly two-thirds of GOP nominations for state and federal offices with election-oversight powers, according to a Washington Post analysis .\n\nRead: The radical fringe that just went mainstream in Arizona\n\nWhether these specific candidates win or lose, election denial has become the most important litmus test for the MAGA base. \"Stop the Steal\" is an expression of a deepening distrust in government and institutions-a mantra to remind its adherents that they, not their political opponents, are the rightful inheritors of America. The phrase is a metaphor, the sociologist Theda Skocpol told me last month , \"for the country being taken away from the people who think they should rightfully be setting the tone.\"\n\nWhen their candidates lose, it can be only through trickery. When their leader is investigated for squirreling away cartons of national secrets at his country club, it's a targeted attack by the \" Regime ,\" to use Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis's word-and capitalization.\n\nAfter Mastriano had finished speaking, and before Trump took to the stage, an elderly white man stood up behind me and shouted, \"Whose country is this?\" The people nearby in the bleachers joined him in response: \"It's our country!\" Later, Trump affirmed the sentiment. \"No matter how big or powerful these corrupt radicals may be, you must never forget that this nation does not belong to them,\" he told his supporters. \"This nation belongs to you!\" The people in the stadium roared their approval."

      "text": "The GOP Is No Longer the Party of National Security\n\nAmerica's allies and enemies watched as Trump's pick for defense secretary failed to quell concerns about his character and qualifications.\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nNot long after Secretary of Defense nominee Pete Hegseth read his opening statement and began fielding questions from the Senate Armed Services Committee, I began thinking: I hope neither America's allies nor its enemies are watching this . The hope was, of course, completely unreasonable. Such hearings are watched closely by friends and foes alike, in order to take the measure of a nominee who might lead the most powerful military in the world and would be a close adviser to the president of the United States.\n\nWhat America and the world saw today was not a serious examination of a serious man. Instead, Republicans on the committee showed that they would rather elevate an unqualified and unfit nominee to a position of immense responsibility than cross Donald Trump, Elon Musk, or the most ardent Republican voters in their home states. America's allies should be deeply concerned; America's enemies, meanwhile, are almost certainly laughing in amazement at their unexpected good fortune.\n\nMost of the GOP senators asked questions that had little to do with the defense of the United States and everything to do with the peculiar obsessions that dominate the alternative reality of right-wing television and talk radio, especially the bane of \"wokeness.\" Perhaps that was just as well for Hegseth, because the few moments where anything of substance came up did not go well for him. When Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska, for example, tried early on to draw Hegseth out with some basic questions about nuclear weapons, he was lost. He tried to fumble his way around to an answer that included harnessing the creativity of Silicon Valley to innovate a future nuclear force ... or something.\n\nOn many other questions, including adherence to the Geneva Conventions , the role of the military in domestic policing, and the obligation to disobey illegal orders, Hegseth fudged and improvised. He seemed aware that he had to avoid sounding extreme while still playing for the only audience that really matters: 50 Republican senators and one former and future president of the United States. His evasions were not particularly clever, but they didn't need to be. He was clear that his two priorities as secretary will be to lead a culture war within the Pentagon , and to do whatever Trump tells him to do.\n\nIf America's friends and adversaries saw an insubstantial man in front of the committee, they also saw Republicans-members of what once advertised itself as the party of national security-acting with a complete lack of gravity and purpose. Few Republicans, aside from Fischer and a rather businesslike Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, asked Hegseth anything meaningful about policy. Ernst extracted a promise from Hegseth to appoint a senior official to be in charge of sexual-assault prevention, but most of her colleagues resorted to the usual buzzwords about DEI and cultural Marxism while throwing Hegseth softballs. (Senator Eric Schmitt of Missouri also managed to mention drag queens, but the trophy for most cringe-inducing moment goes to Senator Tim Sheehy of Montana, who asked Hegseth how many genders there are. When Hegseth said \"two,\" Sheehy said: \"I know that well. I'm a she-he.\" Get it? Sheehy? She-he? He's here all week, folks; tip your waiters.)\n\nAnd speaking of buzzwords, most of Hegseth's answers relied on his vow to support \"the warfighters\" and their \"lethality,\" two words that have been floating around the Pentagon-as things full of helium will do-for years. Hegseth, to his credit, has learned how to speak fluent Pentagon-ese, the content-free language in which the stakeholders help the warfighters leverage their assets to increase their lethality. (I taught military officers for years at the Naval War College. I can write this kind of Newspeak at will.) As Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut noted, Hegseth might not be qualified to be secretary of defense, but he could squeak by as a Pentagon spokesperson.\n\nSome Democrats highlighted that Hegseth has never run anything of any significant size, and that his record even in smaller organizations hasn't been particularly impressive. Senator Gary Peters of Michigan pointed out that no board of directors would hire Hegseth as the CEO even of a medium-size company. Other Democrats drilled Hegseth on his personal behavior, including accusations (which he has denied) that he has engaged in sexual assault and alcohol abuse . At one point, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona listed specific incidents, asking Hegseth to confirm or deny them. Each time, Hegseth responded only by saying \"anonymous smears,\" which he seems to think is like invoking the Fifth Amendment. Hegseth also said he wasn't perfect, and that he's been redeemed by his faith in Jesus Christ, whose name came up more often than one might expect during a hearing related to national security.\n\nSenator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, an Army veteran who was wounded during her service in Iraq, brought out a large poster of the Soldier's Creed, emphasizing the insistence on standards and integrity embodied in it. She asked Hegseth how the Defense Department could still demand that service members train and serve at such high standards if the Senate lowered the bar for leading the Pentagon just for him. After she quizzed him on various matters and Hegseth again floundered, she put it simply and directly: \"You're not qualified, Mr. Hegseth.\"\n\nNot that any of it mattered to the Republicans on the committee, some of whom took great offense at questions about Hegseth's character. Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma tried to turn the tables on his colleagues by asking how many of them had ever voted while drunk or cheated on their spouses, as if that somehow obviated any further fussing about whether a possible secretary of defense was an adulterer or struggles with substance abuse.\n\nUnfortunately for Mullin, he doesn't know his Senate history, so Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member, helpfully spelled it out for him: If any member of the Senate were nominated to such a position, Reed said, they too would have to answer such questions. And then he added that the late Senator John Tower was in 1989 rejected for the same job Hegseth wants-over accusations of a drinking problem.\n\nThroughout this all, I tried to imagine the reaction in Moscow or Beijing, where senior defense-ministry officials were almost certainly watching Hegseth stumble his way through this hearing. They learned today that their incoming opponent apparently has few thoughts about foreign enemies, but plenty of concerns about the people Trump calls \"the enemy from within.\" The MAGA Republicans, for their part, seem eager only for Hegseth to get in there and tear up the Pentagon.\n\nAfter today, I suspect America's enemies are happily awaiting the same thing.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic :\n\nToday's News\n\nEvening Read\n\nThey Stole Yogi Berra's World Series Rings.

      "text": "Why the GOP Extremists Oppose Ukraine\n\nThe budget fight was about vice signaling, not spending.\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nRepublicans averted the self-inflicted wound of a government shutdown this weekend. The main casualty of the process was aid for Ukraine, but foreign aid was always a fig leaf-for both GOP dysfunction and the determination of a small group of Republicans to help Russia.\n\nFirst, here are three new stories from The Atlantic :\n\nIt's Not About the Money\n\nThe Republicans in Congress have delayed a shutdown for another 45 days while they continue their family food fight. They are all very angry with one another, and they seem to agree on only one issue: They hate Matt Gaetz . But don't blame Gaetz, who is clearly having the time of his life being famous. The Republicans, as the economist Michael Strain noted , have for weeks been careening toward a Seinfeld Shutdown, a budget impasse about ... nothing.\n\nSome $6 billion of aid to Ukraine, however, was removed from the budget, a temporary casualty of the near shutdown. (I say \"temporary\" because I have confidence that sensible members of Congress will act to restore the funds.) Republicans are trying to cloak their opposition to military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine in a lot of codswallop about oversight and budget discipline. But the opposition to aid for Ukraine among Republican extremists on the Hill is not about money.\n\nMost congressional Republicans are in favor of helping Ukraine. The extremists, however, warned Joe Biden last month that they would oppose additional assistance to Kyiv. The list of signatories to a September 21 letter to the Office of Management and Budget is a roster of shame, including the new America Firsters in the Senate (J. D. Vance, Rand Paul, Mike Lee, and Tommy Tuberville among them) and the grotesque caucus-within-a-caucus of some of the most unhinged and weirdest members of the House, including Clay Higgins, Harriet Hageman, Andy Biggs, Anna Paulina Luna, and that titan of probity and prudence, Paul Gosar .\n\nThe drumbeat of propaganda from these members and their \"amen\" chorus in the right-wing media is having an effect: An Economist /YouGov poll released last week found a slight uptick among all voters for reducing military aid to Ukraine, but for the first time found that a majority of Republicans now support such reductions. Fortunately, Americans overall- even many voters in the GOP -are still holding firm in their support for Ukraine in its fight against Russian imperialism.\n\nNevertheless, GOP hostility to Ukraine on the Hill and among its rank-and-file voters is growing for several reasons-none of them principled.\n\nFirst, foreign aid is always an easy hot button for the know-nothing right to push. Most Americans have no idea how much the United States spends on foreign aid, and they grossly overestimate how much goes to such programs. ( Most Americans think it's about 25 percent of the U.S. budget and want it reduced to about 10 percent. Their wish is already granted: It's actually about 1 percent.) Worse, so many years after Russia's first invasion of Ukraine (in Crimea), some two-thirds of Americans still don't even know where Ukraine is.\n\nThey also do not understand that most foreign assistance is not a cash handout: Money is spent to buy weapons, food, and other products made in America, which we then ship to other nations. Instead, many Americans think of assistance-mistakenly-as bags of untraceable money handed to foreigners to do with as they will, which is why opportunists such as Ron DeSantis (who once supported aid to Ukraine) try to exploit provocative terms such as blank check to describe helping Ukraine. DeSantis knows better; so do other Republican leaders.\n\nBut the Trumpist right has a more specific beef with Ukraine because of the role Ukraine played in Donald Trump's impeachment and eventual electoral downfall. Interestingly, Vance has tried to make the opposite argument: \"Sorry, this needs to be said,\" he tweeted on Saturday , while clearly being not sorry. \"A lot of the anti-Russia obsession on the left has nothing to do with Ukraine. It's a revenge fantasy over 2016. They blame Russia for Donald Trump's election and they'll bleed Ukraine dry for payback.\"\n\nAs is so often the case with modern Republicans, every accusation is a confession, and every assertion is projection. The majority of the country-not \"the left\"-is supporting Ukraine because it's the right thing to do, not because they hate Russia for electing Trump. Rather, it's the other way around: The MAGA Republicans are opposing Ukraine because they hate Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, for their role in the impeachment drama.\n\nUnlike Vance and his isolationist colleagues, most Americans recognize the immense threat that Russia's war of conquest poses to our allies, to global peace, and to the security of the United States itself. Republicans once stood at the forefront of opposition to Kremlin aggression-Ronald Reagan's steadfast opposition to Moscow was one of the reasons I was a young GOP voter in the 1980s-but now the party is saddled with a group of shortsighted appeasers, buttressed by a squad of right-wing cranks, who would doom tens of millions of innocent people to Russian President Vladimir Putin's butchery just to own the libs.\n\nAlso, we should not look away from a nauseating truth about the extremist caucus within the GOP: Some of them genuinely admire Putin and what he has created in Russia. Tucker Carlson, after all, didn't get taken off the air for supporting Putin in ways that would have made Cold War Soviet propagandists blush; he got canned after a defamation lawsuit from an election-machine company. These GOP extremists have swallowed the gargantuan lie that Putin is a godly defender of white Christian Europe against the decadent West and its legions of militant drag queens. (They believe this, in part, because they know less than nothing about conditions in Russia or its demography.)\n\nFinally, some Republicans oppose aid to Ukraine because of the more general and bizarre countercultural obsession that has seized the American right: Whatever most of their fellow citizens approve of, they must oppose, or else they risk losing their precious claims to being an embattled minority. If they were to support aid to Ukraine, how would they be different from everyone else, and especially from Biden? How would they mark their tribal loyalty if they crossed party lines to oppose a dictator-while supporting a wannabe dictator of their own?\n\nSome Republican opponents of assistance to Ukraine are merely cynical manipulators who care little about national or international security. Many genuinely admire Putin and hope for Ukraine's defeat. Others are merely ignorant. But all of them are bound together by the reflexive urge to reject whatever it is that most other Americans accept. As a commenter on social media said to me today , if liberals were opposing aiding the Ukrainian war effort, \"the GOP would shut down the government to ensure aid and you'd see Ukrainian flags waving on the back of pickups.\"\n\nTo adopt a line from Senator Vance: Sorry, but it has to be said.\n\nRelated:\n\nToday's News\n\nEvening Read\n\nTaylor Swift Is Too Famous for This\n\nBy Devin Gordon\n\nHas Taylor Swift ever been more popular, more all-powerful, more white Beyoncé than she is right now?

The best point of reference for understanding the rise of violence in the U.S. today is not the anarchist movement or Italy's Years of Lead, but rather the much deeper crisis of the Civil War and Reconstruction. In this historic transformation, the balance of power between races shifted, and the country witnessed violence far worse than what we face today.\n\nThe current wave of Trumpist reaction is rooted, I think, in an inchoate fear of a demographic shift that will make white people a minority. The Trump movement is a defensive last gasp of a dying culture of white supremacy.\n\nMark Robert Schneider Weymouth, Mass.\n\nThe dark shadow of Trumpism and its violence casts a pall over LaFrance's article. Yet LaFrance deliberately chooses not to frame her discussion around the specific threat posed by right-wing extremist groups or MAGA Republicans and their attacks on democracy. Although she is right to identify a \"dynamic of action and reaction\" between right-wing and left-wing extremists, her both-sides-ism goes too far.\n\nLaFrance concludes that ending political violence will require \"facing down those who use the language of democracy to weaken democratic systems.\" It is obvious that in American politics today, there is only one movement and one party that these words describe: MAGA Republicanism. The clear implication of \"The New Anarchy\" is that ending political violence now means decisively defeating the Republican Party. I wish LaFrance had forthrightly said this.\n\nJeffrey C. Isaac Bloomington, Ind.\n\nThank you to everyone who read my story. I chose the periods of violence I examined not because they offer simple solutions for exiting these dangerous times-if only!-but because they carry serious warnings that I believe Americans must heed. It would be too facile to say that perpetrators of violence should be held accountable-of course that is the case. But history demonstrates again and again that in periods of political violence, government overreach poses a grave danger. The unconstitutional Palmer Raids may have quashed anarchist violence in the 1920s, for instance, but at a cost that is far too steep ever to be repeated. I am deeply worried about what will happen to Americans' civil liberties if political violence continues to worsen.\n\nAs I wrote, there is no question that Trumpism is a cauldron for right-wing extremism, which is the primary driver of political violence in America today. More alarming still is the GOP's continued obsequiousness to Donald Trump-in essence, political violence is now explicitly endorsed by the state. But it is not enough to simply point at this threat, say who is responsible, and expect that doing so will make it go away. This is why I focused on how right-wing extremists have succeeded in provoking violent reactions from their political foes. This is an extraordinarily dangerous dynamic that fuels propaganda and disinformation, masks who is primarily responsible, exacerbates state violence, and accelerates decivilization and democratic backsliding. Finally, Mark Robert Schneider is absolutely right to point out the underlying racism that animates so many right-wing extremists. This is why I mentioned the post-Reconstruction campaign perversely known as Redemption and called it an urgent warning: Sometimes political violence ends not because it has been defeated, but because it has achieved its aims.\n\nBanning words won't make the world more just, George Packer argued in the April 2023 issue.\n\nI think George Packer overestimates the influence of institutional language, which is meant to be as broad, inoffensive, and inclusive as possible in order to appeal to wide and varied audiences-and, by extension, draw in more donors, shareholders, and investors. No one is insisting that you stop calling yourself a \"pregnant woman\" if you feel that applies to you-colloquial, everyday language will always be different from professional or institutional language.\n\nThere are, however, ongoing, state-backed attempts to censor words and even entire academic disciplines-but Packer neglects those. Compared with the horrifying power of censorship at the legislative level, Packer's complaints about institutional style guides fall flat.\n\nChristina Tavella Boston, Mass.\n\nAs a civil-rights attorney, I take issue with the kind of performative progressivism at the heart of the equity-language conversation. Equity language often works as a way for progressives to placate their discomfort with their own privilege while not doing anything substantive about it.\n\nBut cultural shifts in language aren't always insidious or performative, and sometimes they can be legitimately beneficial. Packer's passing mention of gender-inclusive language fails to note that it is both fairly easy to implement and exceedingly meaningful for trans and gender-nonconforming people. I am a cisgender female, but I present more androgynously. When I see pronouns included in people's email signatures or gender-neutral language ( they as opposed to he / she ) used in official documents, I feel that I can express myself honestly in my workplace. I'm more engaged, more outgoing, and more passionate when I can be myself. These subtle shifts in language are deeply meaningful to me.\n\nMackenzie Karbon Washington, D.C.\n\nIt's true that institutional equity-language guides are written for narrow audiences, but they aren't hermetically sealed from the larger culture. They all rely, as I described, on the recommendations of \"experts\" whose influence extends deep into the mainstream, including media organizations. Their usage spreads because no well-intentioned person wants to be caught on the wrong side of a banned word. Otherwise, unnatural terms like Latinx and justice-involved person would remain the private language of a small priesthood.\n\nThe language of gender would have needed an entire article of its own, with a different analysis. Stating pronouns can indeed be more inclusive-except when it's required, which becomes a new form of exclusion of those who don't accept the current ideology of gender. I didn't write about state legislative bans on books and ideas, because that's also another subject-one that has been much, and deservedly, criticized in The Atlantic and elsewhere. I did conclude my story with a reference to right-wing language orthodoxy, and I hope to expand on it in another story. My purpose in this one was to point out how the spread of a quasi-official, imprecise, euphemistic, jargon-ridden, ever-changing vocabulary in the name of social justice actually makes it harder to see and remedy injustice. Anyone who cares about justice shouldn't be too quick to change the subject.\n\nIn this month's cover story, \" The Counteroffensive ,\" Anne Applebaum and Jeffrey Goldberg report on the stakes of Ukraine's battle to expel Russia from its territory.

Sign up for it here.\n\nM ost Americans who have heard of the John Birch Society associate it with the political fringe-and rightly so. Founded in 1958 by a small band of anti-New Deal businessmen, the society rejected virtually the entire post-World War II, U.S.-led international order. Birchers urged the United States to get out of the United Nations, denounced the foreign-policy establishment as a communist cabal, and called on political leaders to confront what they saw as the gravest threat to the country: a homegrown plot to take away Americans' liberties. Many Birchers promoted baseless conspiracy theories-fluoridation in the water supply represented, as one Bircher document charged, \"a massive wedge for socialized medicine.\"\n\nBut at the height of their influence, in the mid-1960s, the Birchers were hardly a marginalized force in American society. Across hundreds of chapters in almost every state, Birch activists-mostly white, upwardly mobile, Christian, suburban men and women-won seats on local school boards, traded ideas in their neighborhood bookstores, and volunteered for like-minded political candidates. Birchers helped secure the 1964 GOP presidential nomination for Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. The founder, Robert Welch, twice appeared on NBC's Meet the Press . Herblock featured the society in his cartoons. Bob Dylan composed a song called \" Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues .\" The movement was creeping into the mainstream.\n\nYet those who are familiar with the John Birch Society also know that its time in the spotlight ended decades ago. The organization bequeathed a set of ideas to a host of successors who kept Bircher ideas alive through the decades: Phyllis Schlafly, Ron Paul, Pat Buchanan, Michele Bachmann, Marjorie Taylor Greene, among others. But little more than a decade after its founding, the society began to shrivel. Its membership declined, and its finances suffered. To many Americans, it soon came to resemble a historical artifact.\n\nRead: How the GOP surrendered to extremism\n\nHow did it happen? And what does it mean for today's far-right forces?\n\nThe decline of the John Birch Society is partly a story about political leaders, grassroots activists, and liberal institutions intervening to defend American democracy. But it is also a story of an implosion from within. As the group attracted ever more conspiratorial members, some prone to bigotry and even violence, the society was consumed by internal strife. Some members resigned. Others protested that Birchers weren't anti-Semitic enough. The leadership sometimes tried to police and expel more troublesome individuals, but that process proved fractious and chaotic. By the mid-'60s, \"John Birch\"-the name came from an evangelist turned warrior who had been killed by Chinese Communist forces-became a common epithet.\n\nThe factors that prevented the society from metastasizing are relevant to a country now struggling to contain election denialism, white supremacy, and political violence. Former President Donald Trump's millions of supporters might be more powerful than the Birchers' estimated 60,000 to 100,000 members ever were. But the MAGA movement, too, has begun to see how extremism-in the form of white supremacists, militia members, conspiracy theorists-can lead to marginalization. As numerous commentators have noted over the past decade, the guardrails of American democracy are not as strong as they once were. Yet America's institutions have still helped constrain the reach and power of MAGA Republicans.\n\nThe far right's victory in the 21st century is hardly assured. And the story of the decline of the John Birch Society offers possible strategies for containment.\n\nB y the 1960s, the John Birch Society had become, to its legion of critics, an authoritarian movement seeking to topple the nation's fledgling multiracial democracy. Welch had once charged that President Dwight D. Eisenhower was a communist agent. Birch members called to impeach Chief Justice of the United States Earl Warren (a radical step at the time), smeared Martin Luther King Jr. as a communist, promoted \"America First\"-style isolationism, and dabbled in anti-Semitism and racism. Liberals fretted that the society would use secretive, violent means to disrupt free and fair elections and help tip the United States into a civil war. Many in the GOP were worried too. Patricia Hitt, a prominent California Republican and an ally of President Richard Nixon, called Birchers \"haters beyond anything I've ever seen in my life.\"\n\nAround this time, a coalition of public agencies and liberal organizations arose to tarnish the Birch movement, acting both independently and in concert. These included presidents and former presidents, other federal and state actors, members of Congress, civil-rights NGOs, and the news media.\n\nAttorneys general, activists, the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, the Defense Department, and the FBI all at various times worked to discredit the movement, in some cases investigating Birchers or publishing mocking and even scathing reports about them. Military leaders reprimanded Birch-preaching officers (the society's supporters criticized the practice as \"muzzling\"), while some mayors and police chiefs threatened to punish police officers for being members. Human-rights and civil-rights groups-including the NAACP, the union-backed Group Research, and Americans for Democratic Action-put out press releases, speeches, and reports branding Birchers as conspiratorial, malicious, and hostile to racial equality and to democracy.\n\nNo institution took more aggressive (and, arguably, effective) steps to discredit the society than the Anti-Defamation League, the nation's foremost organization devoted to combatting anti-Semitism. Like many liberals, the ADL's leaders feared that a Bircher-led movement fueled by anti-government zeal and easy access to firearms could explode into violence against racial and religious minorities, and they felt a moral obligation to stamp the movement out. Starting around 1959 and continuing through at least the early '70s, the ADL mounted an extensive counterintelligence operation to infiltrate the John Birch Society and dig up damaging information about it.\n\nOperatives gathered Birch chapter-membership lists, studied individual Birchers' personal and professional associations, and ferreted out their credit reports, employment records, financial transactions, license-plate numbers, and even a codicil to one Birch donor's will. These efforts resulted in thousands of pages of materials giving the ADL insights into the personalities of Birch leaders and the activities of chapters and members. (The ADL's efforts to counter the Birchers are documented in the archives of the American Jewish Historical Society in New York, and are chronicled in my new book .)\n\nThe information the ADL collected amounted to one of the country's most comprehensive assessments of the Birch Society, painting a detailed picture of Birchers as agents of hate and serving as source material for countless ADL books , press releases, and pamphlets. The ADL also fed choice bits of information to the press, which helped shape public opinion of the society as an enemy of fact, reason, and democracy.\n\nThe relatively consolidated media landscape of the era also helped elites relegate Birchers to the margins. In the '60s, virtually every major news outlet in the country scrutinized the group. In The Nation , the journalist Hans Engh spoke for many reporters when he wrote that the Birch Society \"represents a basic, continuing phenomenon in American society: that regressive force which, under one guise or another, seems to pop up whenever the country as a whole seems destined to move into a more progressive era.\" Although the condemnation in the mass media engendered some sympathy among those on the right who thought the Birchers were martyrs, it also warned conservative leaders such as Goldwater, Nixon, and the National Review editor William F. Buckley Jr. to put at least some distance between themselves and the most extreme members of their coalition.\n\nAfter Goldwater was trounced in the 1964 presidential election, a handful of Republican leaders got the message, denouncing the society as a threat to the GOP's prospects and a movement out of step with the values of the party establishment. At a time of urban uprisings, anti-war protests, and student-led movements, some Republican Party officials sought to expel Birchers from their ranks while depicting Democrats as the ones who refused to extirpate extremists from theirs.\n\nFrom the October 2022 issue: The long unraveling of the Republican Party\n\nIn September 1965, Republicans' two most powerful elected leaders, House Minority Leader Gerald Ford and Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen, held a joint press conference devoted to repudiating the John Birch Society. Birchers, Dirksen emphasized, were \"NOT a part of the Republican Party\" and resembled the \"Know-Nothings\" of the 19th century. \"We do not believe in extremism,\" he added. The society's views of Eisenhower and former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles as agents of communism were \"at complete variance with a whole tradition of the Republican Party,\" in Dirksen's words. And the GOP's legislative record-its backing for the United Nations and U.S. international treaties, its partial acceptance of civil rights, its pro-public-health stands-was \"in substantial conflict with the views of the John Birch Society,\" Ford, the future vice president and president, said.\n\nO ver time, the society evinced a pattern that is familiar to many extremist groups: Its conspiracy theories drew more and more radicals into its ranks, and it became less cohesive, with Birchers fighting over how far to go. Even as some members of the society welcomed the hatred of their enemies, others worried that their affiliation made it impossible for them to live their lives freely and pursue their careers. Reports circulated that some Birchers were being hounded at work, losing business or friends. Some members resigned as a result.\n\nBy the mid-'60s, Welch accused some Birchers of putting their personal agendas above the society's by feuding with fellow chapter members or ignoring his directives, and he issued an ultimatum: follow him or resign. In August 1966, The New York Times reported that \"acrimonious disputes\" had forced Welch to travel the United States to try to resolve problems one chapter at a time. For a group with a dues-paying membership model, the squabbles exacerbated existing financial woes; the society had to refund money to lifetime members who had been expelled for various violations, recoup equipment from chapters that had gone defunct, and figure out how to handle members who had lost their own money on Birch-affiliated bookstores.\n\nAdding to the dissension, many Birchers who joined in the society's later years were more radical than the group's earlier members. The Birch leadership at times used militant rhetoric-Welch once said the fight against communism required courage \"greater than that called for in meeting an armed enemy ... on a physical battlefield.\" Yet he also believed that the group would be tainted by members who threatened physical harm to their enemies or who had criminal records or associations with the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis. That set up a clash with members who urged the society to be more bigoted. In September 1968, a Bircher named Robert Jones resigned because he found the Birchers too soft on American Jews. \"Whoever holds the propaganda power holds the real power,\" he explained, \"and the tragic thing about the Jews is that although they are very important in the field of propaganda here, most of them do not relate to being Americans first.\"\n\nAs the society lost members and money, it also lost clout. It occasionally resurfaced in the late 1970s and '80s-three players for the San Diego Padres were exposed as members in 1984-and still exists today in a much-diminished form. But the organization has never come close to matching the intensity and impact it achieved in the '60s. Most observers seemingly agreed with a Los Angeles Times reporter who, in 1974, predicted that the society's \"ideology may be so narrowly based and require so much precise faith\" that \"gaining mass popular support\" would be nearly impossible. Years of institutional pushback weakened the group, and the organization burned itself out.\n\nC ould the MAGA movement eventually ebb in the way that the Birchers did?\n\nToday's far right has numerous differences from the John Birch Society. MAGA is the dominant force in the Republican Party, with a leader who occupied the nation's highest office, and Birchers never achieved that level of political power. (Only a few Birchers were elected to Congress, and the GOP often governed in ways that rejected the fringe's most insistent demands.) Trump's movement has capitalized on larger developments that Birchers didn't enjoy: a more fractured media landscape, a full-blown culture war, and the ideological sorting-out of the two parties, among many other changes in American life. Today's defenders of American democracy face a much steeper challenge.\n\nPeter Wehner: The Trump abandonment has begun\n\nYet the decline of the Birch Society has some echoes in our current moment.\n\nAlthough American democracy might be battered today, events of the past few years have demonstrated how the nation's institutions still can curb fringe actors, as they did the Birchers. Police heroically fended off pro-Trump insurrectionists at the Capitol on January 6. Since that day, the Justice Department, the FBI, local and state prosecutors, and the federal judiciary have investigated, arrested, tried, or jailed hundreds of pro-Trump rioters and secured seditious conspiracy convictions against leaders of the pro-Trump Oath Keepers militia. The House's bipartisan January 6 committee documented Trump's central role in efforts to overturn a free and fair election. And Trump himself and his top lieutenants might eventually face criminal charges.\n\nThe mass media obviously have lost much of their cultural authority since the Birchers' heyday, but not all of it. Journalists have chronicled Trump's lies, conspiracy theories, and racist statements in detail, making it harder for him to expand his popularity. Even some of Trump's own voters have tired of his penchant for chaos and now consider him unelectable.\n\nMAGA's growing radicalism is breeding dissent within a movement that was never particularly harmonious to begin with. After years of Trump's batty screeds and violent rhetoric, his movement unsurprisingly has lured more extremist acolytes , such as the anti-Semitic rapper Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) and the white-supremacist leader Nick Fuentes, with whom Trump dined in November. (Birchers, Fuentes has remarked, were \"a prelude\" to his Groyper movement.) MAGA's ever more fringy orientation and conspiratorial mindset have damaged it electorally, as voters handed election deniers a series of defeats in otherwise winnable races in 2022.\n\nEven if the MAGA movement continues to follow a similar trajectory to that of the John Birch Society, the far right's racist, anti-Semitic, and conspiratorial elements won't disappear from our politics. They will eventually find new homes, as they did after the John Birch Society became a shadow of its old self. But the tale of the society's decline at least offers one model of how radical groups can be constrained, from the outside and the inside, even in a highly fractured and polarized America. Similar constraints could cause MAGA to wither, at least for a time. It is not too late to push the radical right back toward the fringes.\n\nThis article was adapted from the forthcoming book Birchers: How the John Birch Society Radicalized the American Right .\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "A Candidate, Not a Cult Leader\n\nAfter Biden's decision to leave the race, the difference between the Democrats and the Republicans could not be clearer.\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has chosen to put his country over his own ego, a heroic decision that shows the difference between a political party and a cult of personality.\n\nJoe Biden, the president of the United States, has decided not to run for his office in 2024. He joins a small but honorable fraternity of men who, for various reasons, declined to seek reelection. This club was founded by George Washington, whose refusal to stand for the presidency again in 1796 was particularly important, because he was walking away from a virtually guaranteed victory.\n\nBiden, by contrast, was facing the serious prospect of a loss, but his decision is similarly admirable. The president sees Donald Trump as a threat to American democracy, and he must know that he has been trailing Trump for months, even before the debate in June that sealed his fate. Biden tried to recover, but in every public outing, he raised more doubts than he dispelled. Anxious Democrats tried to get the message through to him, in private at first and then in public , that he was losing ground in swing states and that his continued presence in the race could even doom downballot candidates.\n\nMany Democrats at the national level believed that Biden was leading his party to a repeat of 2016, in which Trump would again grind out an Electoral College victory while the Republicans would take the House and Senate. Biden would be defeated, and Trump would control the entire government. This time, there would be none of the supposed adults in the room who guided Trump during his tenure. His next administration would be staffed by bottom-feeding opportunists and cranks. The courts are positioned to support this new era of Trumpism: The conservative majority on the Supreme Court has already invited Trump to rule as a king-or worse.\n\nFaced with what he sees as a nightmare scenario both for his party and his nation, President Biden decided to end his candidacy.\n\nMy colleague Franklin Foer (who has written a biography of Biden) noted today that the Biden of the past few weeks was a less than admirable figure: He was a defensive, brittle old man who didn't want to be told he could no longer lead the party on the field of political battle. Like many Americans, I have had the experience of tussling with an elderly parent who came to understand I was right but needed time to admit it. (My father lived to be 94, and we faced many such issues together.) Biden, I am assuming, has been trying to come to grips with the possibility that he might now be the Democrat least likely to defeat Trump.\n\nI do not know-no one can at this point-whether Biden's replacement will fare any better in November. (Biden has thrown his support behind his vice president, Kamala Harris, as one would expect. Representative Jim Clyburn endorsed her, and the Democrats seem to be coalescing around her.) But at least the Democrats have a fighting chance now. Biden said recently that he couldn't wait to get back on the trail against Trump, an attempt at bravado that implied he was about to start barnstorming across the fruited plain. I did not believe he was physically capable of doing that kind of campaigning; I doubt many elected Democrats did either.\n\nOf course, if the nominee is Harris, the Republicans will go into culture-war overdrive. They will say that as a Californian, she is too liberal. They will say that as a former prosecutor, she is too conservative. They will say that she is too female and too Black. (Well, they won't say those last two out loud , but get ready for a fusillade of dog whistles that will be amped up to the point that they could shatter granite.)\n\nIndeed, the MAGA Republicans are already griping about a Democratic Party \"coup,\" as if they have serious concerns about democracy in any political party, including their own. But Biden's decision reflected a determination to put the fate of his country ahead of his personal vanity, a choice Trump is inherently incapable of making.\n\nAfter today the difference between the Democrats and the Republicans could not be clearer. Biden faces challenges of age that are not going to get any easier. His decision to make way for a younger candidate reaffirmed that his party is not about one man. Trump, meanwhile, continues to bellow gibberish at his rallies, raving like the emotionally unstable , would-be dictator that he is.\n\nEven after Trump insulted America's veterans and the nation's war dead, even after he was found liable for sexual abuse, even after he racked up 34 felony convictions, almost no elected officials in his party called for him to leave the ticket. (As usual, Mitt Romney was seated at a table for one.) Yet millions of Americans, sadly, have come to regard Trump's pestilential character as merely a curious facet of an otherwise normal candidate.\n\nNow that Biden is stepping down, perhaps all the false equivalency can end. Biden is a good man, and he's been a good and consequential president with a first-term record most of his predecessors would envy. He is capable of serving out his term and should do so. (The calls from Republicans today that he should now resign, coming from opportunistic hypocrites such as Elise Stefanik , are as meaningless as they are predictable.) Trump was a disaster, an incompetent and ignorant president whose selfish decisions, especially about COVID-19 , likely cost many thousands of Americans their lives.\n\nBiden's decision is now also a challenge to every voter in the pro-democracy coalition to live by their words. For two years, many Americans lamented the choice between the aging Biden and the dissolute, unbalanced Trump. Their wish has been granted: They will now likely have a choice between a shouty, 78-year-old habitual liar whose life is a record of shame and failure and a 59-year-old woman who has served honorably as a big-state attorney general, a senator, and the vice president of the United States.\n\nHarris has her critics, and she will bring her own vulnerabilities to a campaign. Every American should assess her record with judicious skepticism, as they would that of any other politician. But in the end, if the vice president is the eventual nominee, she will be a candidate similar to many others throughout American history who can claim a long record of senior-government experience. (Like Trump, for example, she has been given briefs on nuclear-launch procedures. Unlike Trump, she almost certainly understood them.)\n\nEvery voter who cares about democracy but has claimed to be paralyzed by the two old men in the race will now have no excuses for indecision. The Democrats have made clear that they intend to field a stable, experienced candidate. The Republicans, a cult of personality in the grip of fevered delusions, will field Trump. Tonight, Americans have the clarity they demanded.\n\nRelated:\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link in this newsletter, we receive a commission. Thank you for supporting The Atlantic ."

Refusing to recognize the state's primary and not campaigning in the state was \"a stupid political mistake\" by Democrats that allowed Trump's claims to go uncontested, says Arnesen. \"This is an invitation to fascism.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Former President Donald Trump won New Hampshire's primary on Tuesday by over 11 percentage points, a vote of 54%, defeating former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who got 43%. Haley was the last major challenger to Trump after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis ended his presidential bid Sunday night and threw his support to Trump. Trump is the first nonincumbent Republican presidential candidate to win races in both Iowa and New Hampshire since both states began leading the election calendar in 1976. In his victory speech Tuesday, Trump criticized Nikki Haley for losing New Hampshire and vowed he would beat President Biden in November.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : We've won almost every single poll in the last three months against crooked Joe Biden. Almost every poll. And she doesn't win those polls. And she doesn't win those. This is not your typical victory speech, but let's not have somebody take a victory when she had a very bad night. She ha a very bad night.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Nikki Haley will pass on the Nevada caucuses February 8th and put all her efforts and millions of dollars into ad buys for February 24th primary in her home state of South Carolina. In her concession speech last night in New Hampshire, she vowed to continue her campaign.\n\nNIKKI HALEY : New Hampshire is first in the nation; it is not the last in the nation. This race is far from over. There are dozens of states left to go.\n\nHALEY SUPPORTER : Let your voice be heard, Nikki!\n\nNIKKI HALEY : And the next one is my sweet state of South Carolina.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On the Democratic side, President Joe Biden won his party's primary but did so as a write-in candidate. He didn't campaign or appear on the ballot, after the Democratic National Committee, supported by Biden, voted to start its primary season next month in South Carolina. New Hampshire's state government, controlled by Republicans, would not comply with the DNC's new rules and scheduled the primary for last night. As a result, Biden did not win any delegates from New Hampshire. His final vote count is still being tallied. Congressmember Dean Phillips came second with about 20% of the vote, with Marianne Williamson placing third with about 5%.\n\nFor more, we're joined by Arnie Arnesen, longtime radio and talk show host in New Hampshire, former New Hampshire legislator and Democratic gubernatorial candidate in the '92 elections. She's host of The Attitude on WNHN -FM in Concord, New Hampshire.\n\nArnie, welcome back to Democracy Now! I think you were our first guest in 1996, when we were covering the New Hampshire primary.\n\nARNIE ARNESEN : Shhh, don't tell anyone. It's aging both of us. And I've been covering presidential politics with you, Amy, for such a long time, as well. So thank you for having me back.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, if you can first respond to Trump's win, the significance of that, and also explain how the New Hampshire primary works, with independents, with Republicans? He got something like, what, three-quarters of the Republican vote, but I think Nikki Haley beat him when it came to independents.\n\nARNIE ARNESEN : So, let me - we're such a quirky place. We actually have a law in New Hampshire - and that law was actually written in 1975 - that the New Hampshire primary has to come one week before any other primary in the country. So, when the Democrats, for example, decided to go to South Carolina, we couldn't change the law. The law said we have to have a primary, and the primary was yesterday. Republicans kept the same calendar, so, therefore, Republicans had an \"official\" primary, and the Democrats had an \"unofficial\" primary. But the law was, we were going to have a primary by hook or by crook. We couldn't change it. The Republicans control the Governor's Office, the House, the Senate. They weren't going to rewrite the law. It was beneficial to them, the Republicans. So, again, that's one of the reasons why Donald Trump had the only official primary, and there was a write-in for Joe Biden.\n\nSo, now let me also explain something else. There are sort of three groups in New Hampshire: Republicans, Democrats and something called undeclareds. Undeclareds are actually the largest registered group in New Hampshire. They're over 40%. And as a result of the undeclareds, in New Hampshire, if there is a election, undeclareds in the primary have a choice: They can pick up a Democratic ballot, or they can pick up a Republican ballot, on the day of the primary. There was no reason to pick up a Democratic ballot, because what's the point? You were writing in Joe Biden. It wasn't going to be recognized by the DNC . So the motivation for them, all the motivation, was to pick a Republican ballot.\n\nNow the question is: What were they going to do when they picked it up? They really only had two choices. They had Nikki, who is - I describe her as MAGA polite, or they had MAGA - in other words, they had Donald Trump. And a lot of them, basically, were sort of - there was no way they could support Donald Trump. They were Republicans maybe. They were conservatives maybe, or even something moderate. But Donald Trump was so offensive to them that there was no way they were going to do it. So Nikki benefited from those undeclareds having nowhere to go on the Democratic side, and the only place they could go to exercise the franchise, for the most part, was on the Republican ballot. And that's one of the reasons why she was so successful with these undeclareds, more moderate voters. And, of course, Donald Trump was able to clean up with what? The conservative Republican base, because Republicans today are MAGA Republicans. They are not Republicans; they're MAGA Republicans. She was trying to somehow convince the small number left of more traditional Republicans and then grab those undeclareds and say, \"Now vote for me.\"\n\nBut, Amy, there's something that's really important here. She lost by 11 percentage points. Everyone says she may still have a future, there's some way to go. This state was designed for Nikki Haley. If there was a state she could win in, in the entire United States, it was this state, and she still lost by 11 points. Can I explain to you why I say this? I just posted this on Facebook. I want you to hear it. She had everything in her political backpack, and she still lost. Why? She had a great weather, unlike what you saw in Iowa. She had an affable political windsock named Chris Sununu, my governor, who basically was attached at her hip and gave actually probably more speeches than Nikki did and was more positive about her election than even she was. She had Koch money. The Koch network decided in December that they were going to pick Maggie - I mean, Nikki to support. So, starting in December, they were pouring millions and millions of dollars into her campaign, money she did not have, but they were able to do it. The Americans for Prosperity, which is the Koch network, has been operating in New Hampshire for decades. They knew the state. They knew what kind of mailers to do. They knew how to bring people out. And they spent millions on her. She also, as I just mentioned, had the undeclareds only having one choice: to vote in the GOP primary. She had no Democratic primary of consequence because it was a write-in. And then, last but not least - this is really important - what is New Hampshire? We are a highly educated, rich, white state that doesn't go to church. OK? I mean, compared to Iowa, we are probably the second least church state in the country. And when you look at all those pieces, Amy, she should have won. She should have won. But she still could not win.\n\nWhat does that tell you? She doesn't have a future. The only future she has isn't whether he's a convicted felon, because even she said she would vote for him if he was the nominee, if he was a convicted felon. She's obviously looking at the fact that he's probably not the healthiest man on the planet, and therefore she wants to be the person second in command in case he falls apart. And if he does, she'll say, \"Look, I've been here. I survived so much. Maybe I should be your nominee.\"\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Arnie, I wanted to ask you about Joe Biden's role here. You wrote in a piece to make South Carolina the first in the nation Democratic primary in 2024 for the Raw Story that, quote, \"by attempting to make South Carolina the first-in-the-nation Democratic primary in 2024 was one of the biggest political blunders in your decades-long time in public service.\" Why do you think that?\n\nARNIE ARNESEN : OK, so, I don't think that New Hampshire should be a prima donna and should be assumed to go first. Let me just say that, OK? I've always said that. But this was not the time to make the switch. And the reason is, is that in 2028, give it to somebody else. But because it was Donald Trump, because there's such a pervasion of lies, that meant that if it was going to be a Joe Biden, you couldn't cede Iowa, you shouldn't cede New Hampshire to just a Republican conversation that was going to be covered nationally and internationally and over and over again. It's bad enough that Trump has an echo chamber everywhere, but then, in some ways, Joe Biden gave him an even bigger echo chamber, because there was no Democratic conversation in either Iowa and New Hampshire. And even if you thought people were running against Donald Trump, whether it was Ron DeSantis, whether it was Vivek, whether it was NIkki, they never touched Trump. So, they all touched Biden, so all the negativity about why they should be the next candidate for the Republicans was not about that they should defeat Trump. It's that they were defeating Biden.\n\nSo, to a large extent, he ceded them the playing ground. He allowed them to continue the lies, the distortion of the economy, the ideas about the border. All those things became the headlines, and nothing about what he had accomplished, who he was, even, obviously, the conversation about abortion. Now it's the third rail for Republicans. But they basically did not have another voice.\n\nAnd so, by deciding to go to South Carolina, it was a yawn. Nobody is going to be focusing on that. It's assumed he's going to win. He doesn't gain anything with South Carolina. But he would have gained something by having another message coming out of Iowa, coming out of New Hampshire, as they were focusing on what the choice would be in 2024 for president. It was a stupid political mistake. That doesn't mean that we should always be first, but not in 2024 with Trump running for president again. This is a threat to democracy. This is an invitation to fascism. We could look at a country that we will not recognize after the November election, God forbid Trump wins.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And what were you able to see in terms of Trump expanding his base in New Hampshire compared to previous elections in which he's run?\n\nARNIE ARNESEN : Did he expand his base? His base are Republicans. His base are MAGA . He doesn't expand his base. But, frankly, if he's going to win the nomination, he doesn't need to. In this state, perhaps he might have needed to, but he couldn't accomplish it. That's part of the problem.\n\nI mean, I described Nikki Haley as democracy-lite. Why? Because she is one of those individuals who have said that, actually, Joe Biden won in 2020. In order to be a good Republican, you have to say that Joe Biden did not win in 2020. But she said that Joe Biden won in 2020. But then, what does she say? \"But if Donald Trump is a convicted felon and he happens to get the nomination, I'll still vote for him.\"\n\nSo, part of the problem right now is, if you don't buy into the lie that Joe Biden isn't legit, you can't be a Republican anymore. And if you actually believe that Joe Biden is the president of the United States, then that's where you would expand your base. But he can't expand his base, because he demands the following that follows him in his cult to say, \"Joe Biden is illegitimate. I am actually your president, and I am the one to win, because I will be your retribution.\" That's what he's about.\n\nAnd every time Amy says, well, chaos follows Donald Trump, guess what: That's what Donald Trump loves. He loves the chaos. He flourishes in the chaos. And when people kept saying, \"Well, he didn't debate,\" for example. \"He didn't debate this whole time, Donald Trump.\" Yes, he did. You know where he debated? He debated in front of judges. And that's what he debated. He loves being in a New York courtroom, because he'd rather debate a judge than debate anyone about whether he should be the nominee for president.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Arnie Arnesen, when he called Haley an imposter, he falsely claimed he had won the general election vote in New Hampshire in 2016 against Hillary Clinton - he didn't; she did - and in 2020 with Joe Biden - he won New Hampshire; Trump didn't - as he continued that lie.\n\nARNIE ARNESEN : Amy, you're acting like facts have meaning. I mean, with Donald Trump, I mean, everyone kept saying that - remember when he said the comment about he mixed up Nancy Pelosi and Nikki Haley about what happened on January 6th? He didn't mix it up. I hate to break it to you. That wasn't a senior moment. That was intentional. Because now what he's doing is, he's sort of doing this mail merge, so that now Nikki is Nancy Pelosi, now Nikki is Hillary Clinton, now Nikki is anyone who has actually taken him on and maybe defeated him. Now Nikki becomes that person.\n\nThe cult doesn't care about the facts. You can say to him, \"But, oh, Donald Trump, you lost.\" No, he never loses. And the base that follows him believes he never loses. So, you and I are focused on numbers. We're focused on votes. We're focused on facts. That is basically not an essential requirement for people that support Donald Trump. They don't need facts. They just need him.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Arnie Arnesen, I want to thank you for being with us, longtime radio and TV host in New Hampshire, host of The Attitude on WNHN -FM in Concord, New Hampshire, former New Hampshire legislator and Democratic gubernatorial candidate in the '92 elections.\n\nWe will stay in New Hampshire, next up, and speak with journalist Jeff Sharlet. He's a Dartmouth professor in Hanover, New Hampshire, and author of The Undertow: Scenes from a Slow Civil War . Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Biden said, \"Too much of what's happening in our country today is not normal,\" and that MAGA Republicans present a \"clear and present danger to our democracy,\" referring to Trump's campaign slogan of \"Make America Great Again.\" We speak with Nancy MacLean, author and Duke University historian, who says Biden's speech was a \"wake-up call\" for the nation and mainstream media. \"He was absolutely right, in my opinion, that the Trump wing of the party and the MAGA Republicans have jumped the rails of constitutional democracy, of the factual universe and of representative democracy.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nPresident Biden gave a primetime speech Thursday night warning Donald Trump and his MAGA supporters are threatening the foundations of the republic. Biden spoke in Philadelphia in front of Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were debated and signed. This is part of President Biden's speech.\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : Too much of what's happening in our country today is not normal. Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic. Now, I want to be very clear, very clear up front: Not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology. I know, because I've been able to work with these mainstream Republicans. But there's no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country. ...\n\nMAGA Republicans do not respect the Constitution. They do not believe in the rule of law. They do not recognize the will of the people. They refuse to accept the results of a free election. And they're working right now, as I speak, in state after state, to give power to decide elections in America to partisans and cronies, empowering election deniers to undermine democracy itself.\n\nMAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards, backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love. They promote authoritarian leaders, and they fan the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights, to the pursuit of justice, to the rule of law, to the very soul of this country.\n\nThey look at the mob that stormed the United States Capitol on January 6th, brutally attacking law enforcement, not as insurrectionists who placed a dagger to the throat of our democracy, but they look at them as patriots. And they see their MAGA failure to stop a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election as preparation for the 2022 and 2024 elections. They tried everything last time to nullify the votes of 81 million people. This time, they're determined to succeed in thwarting the will of the people.\n\nThat's why respected conservatives, like Federal Circuit Court Judge Michael Luttig, has called Trump and the extreme MAGA Republicans, quote, \"a clear and present danger\" to our democracy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : President Biden, speaking in Philadelphia Thursday night. He went on to say the soul of the nation is at stake.\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : I ran for president because I believed we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. I still believe that to be true. I believe the soul is the breath, the life and the essence of who we are. The soul is what makes us us. The soul of America is defined by the sacred proposition that all are created equal in the image of God, that all are entitled to be treated with decency, dignity and respect, that all deserve justice and a shot at lives of prosperity and consequence, and that democracy - democracy must be defended, for democracy makes all these things possible.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : President Biden, speaking Thursday night. Just after the speech, Democracy Now! reached Ben Jealous, president of People for the American Way, former head of the NAACP , to get his response.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : Tonight we saw Joe Biden give the most presidential speech he's ever given as president. I say this as somebody who's both been a friend of Joe for a long time in politics and yet also taken serious issue when I thought that he was moving in the wrong direction. I was arrested for voting rights protests five times in front of his White House last year. And what we saw tonight was exactly the president we need in this moment.\n\nHe was confident. He was clear about big victories for the climate, big victories for students, big victories for the economy. He was also very clear that he was drawing a line between MAGA extremists and the patriots that are the rest of this nation. He was very clear that we are at an existential moment, a moment I think most of us feel in our bones. And he was also clear, as a student of history, that we have been through worse and triumphed over it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : To talk more about President Biden's speech, we're joined by Nancy MacLean, author of the book Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right's Stealth Plan for America , professor of history and public policy at Duke University in North Carolina. She's actually joining us now from Raleigh.\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! , Professor MacLean. Why don't you start off by sharing your overall response to the speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia?\n\nNANCY MacLEAN: Thank you, Amy. It's good to be with you again.\n\nMy overall response is that this was the most important speech of President Joe Biden's political career, and it was a wake-up call to the nation, and particularly to the mainstream media, in the nick of time. He was absolutely right, in my opinion, that the Trump wing of the party and the MAGA Republicans have jumped the rails of constitutional democracy, of the factual universe and of representative democracy. You cannot have a democracy in which one party does not accept the legitimacy of the other party's candidates, elected officials and the outcomes of elections. But that is where we have come with Donald Trump and the MAGA faction since they first questioned the legitimacy of President Obama's election and denied that he had been born in America. That was the start of all that has ensued since. And it's really important that President Biden called that out for the nation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go back to President Biden speaking last night in Philadelphia.\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : Today there are dangers around us we cannot allow to prevail. We hear - you've heard it - more and more talk about violence as an acceptable political tool in this country. It's not. It can never be an acceptable tool. So I want to say this plain and simple: There is no place for political violence in America, period. None. Ever.\n\nWe saw law enforcement brutally attacked on January the 6th. We've seen election officials, poll workers - many of them volunteers of both parties - subject to intimidation and death threats, and - can you believe it? - FBI agents, just doing their job as directed, facing threats to their own lives from their own fellow citizens.\n\nOn top of that, there are public figures - today, yesterday and the day before - predicting and all but calling for mass violence and rioting in the streets. This is inflammatory. It's dangerous. It's against the rule of law. And we, the people, must say: This is not who we are.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : President Biden, speaking at Independence Hall last night in Philadelphia, the second of three trips to Pennsylvania in just a matter of days. His third one will be in the next few days. Professor MacLean, as he talks about political violence, you have said the best predictor for a successful coup is a failed coup for which there is no accountability. Talk about the political violence, how it's been dealt with, what it means and what should be done.\n\nNANCY MacLEAN: Yes. Thank you. And I think that's extremely important for people to understand. And that's not just me speaking; that is the consensus of comparative political scientists who study coups. So, absolutely, we do not yet have accountability at the highest levels for the events of January 6 and the ongoing criminal conspiracy against our country that has been more than demonstrated by the House select committee to investigate the events of January 6. And the problem is that if you don't have accountability, those acts become normalized, and the people who engage in them become emboldened to become more aggressive, more violent, more threatening.\n\nAnd I think, you know, something that Biden said at the very top of his remarks is extremely important, that so much that has happened in recent years, and certainly in the last year, is not normal. And the problem that I see as an educator is that there are young people growing up who have known nothing else but this moment. And there are many of us who have been so bruised by the pandemic and inured by years of this Trump rhetoric and aggression, and that coming from his followers, that we can start to think that this is how a normal democracy functions.\n\nBut it is not. The United States has slipped radically down the scale of healthy democracies. Ten is the highest rating you can get. By 2021, global evaluators were saying that we were down at five, with Poland, Slovenia and Hungary. Hungary is interesting, because the MAGA Republicans and figures like Tucker Carlson look to Hungary's leader, Viktor Orbán, as a model. And he is a model for them of how to use democracy to completely undermine democracy and make it impossible to remove an authoritarian leader.\n\nSo, Biden's calling out of all this is extremely important, because we have allowed ourselves to get to the point where threats and intimidation and violence are routinely used to intimidate people. Let me be frank: This is terrorism. It has been directed most recently at the FBI , at our National Archives, where the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are housed. It has been directed at teachers and school boards. It has been directed at public health officials. It has been directed at Dr. Fauci and his family.\n\nAnd yet mainstream news continues to practice bothsidesism, continues to pretend that these things are just partisan. You know, I am so glad that you are doing this extended segment on President Biden's speech, because I was shocked last night to learn that three major news networks were not carrying the speech. Even NPR , when I got up this morning and turned on the radio, they gave it the most minimal coverage and just put it in the context of the midterms, as though this was politics as usual. And I think that's the exact opposite of the message the president was rightly trying to send.\n\nWe face existential threats to democracy in America, and they are coming from one place: from Donald Trump and those he has persuaded to follow him with the big lie, with a calculated system of media disinformation. And what's most important is that he and the donors behind this, and that media, have also cowed every Republican elected official in office, except Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, both of whom have been defeated, and others less well known who have spoken the truth, who have stood up to Donald Trump and who have stood up to the lies, who have lost office or are leaving office because they know they cannot be reelected by this MAGA party.\n\nWe are absolutely, as the president said, at an inflection point in our country, and we must take stock and treat the coming midterms as truly the chance we have to save democracy from further wreckage. There's no point in talking about candidates for 2024 if we do not stop the election deniers and the election riggers from gaining control in state after swing state, as they are trying to now. Those are the people who won all the Republican primaries.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to Donald Trump, who appeared on Newsmax this week, admitted he's financially supporting people arrested during the January 6th insurrection and more.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : So, I met with a number of fans, but I met with and I'm financially supporting people that are incredible. And they were in my office actually two days ago. It's very much on my mind. It's a disgrace what they've done to them. What they've done to these people, it's disgraceful. And mostly, I mean, you know, it's firemen, they're policemen, they're people in the military. ... And I will tell you, I will look very, very favorably about - about full pardons.\n\nWENDY BELL : Amen.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : If I decide to run and if I win, I will be looking very, very strongly about pardons.\n\nWENDY BELL : Amen.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : Full pardons.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, President Donald Trump, former, who is signaling he might be running again, that he would give them full pardons, and also talking about police and firefighters that he's supporting. In fact, a former New York police officer was just sentenced to 10 years in prison - that's the latest news out from yesterday - because he attacked a police officer with an American flag pole. If you can talk about what he has just said, Professor MacLean?\n\nNANCY MacLEAN: Yeah. What he has just said, Amy, is something that should terrify us all. We have seen a Republican Party over the years that has tried to treat the rival party of Democrats as illegitimate, ever since the days of Newt Gingrich using language that's inflammatory, tossing around words like \"treason.\" Well, frankly, what Donald Trump just described was treasonous conduct. He is talking about issuing blanket pardons to people who waged an attack on our country, an attack that took the lives of, ultimately, seven police officers, that resulted in millions of dollars' worth of damage, that desecrated our Capitol and shamed us before the world. And he is talking about financially supporting those people and plans to issue pardons to them. And not only is he not calling them criminals, people who violated the law, engaged in violence, attacked our country, he is actually elevating them as heroes.\n\nAnd here I want to go back to something that Joe Biden said that got him in a lot of trouble with Republicans because he called out something accurate. When he used that phrase \"semi-fascist\" the other day to describe the MAGA Republicans, I believe that was an apt phrase. We are not in a fascist situation in America, but we have elected officials and their followers in one party behaving in a fascistic way. Donald Trump just illustrated that with his lionization of people who engaged in criminal violence.\n\nThis is extremely important, because if you look back to the interwar period that brought us the regime of Mussolini, which is marking its 100th anniversary this year of the March on Rome, and later Hitler, they started with that kind of violence, that kind of celebration of violence, and also an effort to conquer major institutions of the society and make them serve this project.\n\nLook at what Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans are doing. They are trying to conquer critical institutions. He has pardoned people in the military who engaged in illegal conduct. He has lifted them up as heroes. He has now elevated, as you're saying, those police officers who violated the law on January 6. We have had, again, such attacks on election boards and public health workers in this country, and on teachers, that we are seeing hemorrhaging in those fields. We don't have enough nurses. We don't have enough public health people. We don't have enough people in so many of the core institutions of our society. We also have Republicans attacking the domain where I work - higher education - spreading lies, attacking teachers, trying to divide students and faculty from community.\n\nWe are at red-alert stage. In military terms, it is DEFCON 1 for democracy in America. And it's time that the mainstream media started to recognize that. President Biden gave us the call and said exactly what is happening in very clear and eloquent terms. So we can only hope that Americans respond calmly, deliberately and with determination to alert their neighbors, to canvass for these midterms, to make sure people understand the high stakes of these elections. It is only the people who will be the guardrails of our democracy responding in a calm, nonviolent, determined way to ensure that we still have a democracy for generations to come, for our children and grandchildren.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor MacLean, you've also made it clear that this is not just about President Trump, saying that our situation is driven by our extreme-right fossil fuel and dirty industry donors who have radicalized the Republican Party. Can you elaborate?\n\nNANCY MacLEAN: Yes. Thank you, Amy, for raising that, because the donor question has all but fallen out of so much of the conversation and of the media attention to the problems we're facing. But this is what I researched for Democracy in Chains , and particularly the Koch network of donors, convened by Charles Koch, the CEO of Koch Industries, one of the richest men in the world, who has convened other wealthy donors, not only in the United States, by the way, but globally, particularly from the fossil fuel sector, tobacco and other dirty industries, to try to shackle democracy. They have supported this Republican Party. They were the ones who drove it to the far right with the tea party, you know, and, before that, the efforts of the radical Republicans, like Newt Gingrich, in Congress. They are a serious threat to our democracy.\n\nAnd actually, this is one of the interesting things that distinguishes our moment from the interwar period that saw Mussolini and Hitler come to power. Mussolini and Hitler came up from the streets, through street fighting and radical violence, and then later won the backing of right-wing sections of capital and other institutions, like the church and the military. In our country, we've seen something different. These dark money, fossil fuel donors, led, above all, by Charles Koch, have so poisoned the workings of our electoral system that we are in this position. And we will not solve this problem that we face, we will not get out of this crisis, unless we address that dark money, not only the money going to elected officials, but the money that is going tax-free to fund an apparatus of literally hundreds of organizations that are polluting our public debate, that are turning us against one another, that are distorting and deforming our institutions and that have brought us to this precipice.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Last question, Nancy MacLean. Before you wrote Democracy in Chains , you wrote Behind the Mask of Chivalry: The Making of the Second Ku Klux Klan , published decades ago. But there you look at that period in the 1920s, right around the time, in the '20s, '30s, when you had Mussolini and you had Hitler rising to power, but in the United States, where you looked at how some 5 million ordinary white Protestant men joined the second Ku Klux Klan in the '20s. Do you see parallels to today?\n\nNANCY MacLEAN: Yes, Amy, and it - really, it gives me chills to say it. And sadly, the book is getting a second life all these years later, because it's not just me: Ordinary Americans see the parallels. Donald Trump and this radicalized Republican Party has breathed life into these white supremacist, white nationalist forces. It's no longer the Ku Klux Klan in the forefront, but we see groups like the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters and all these, you know, kind of freelance militias, who are committed to a set of ideas very much like those of the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s, and milder forms of which are embraced by this MAGA faction of the Republican Party, namely the idea that only certain people are legitimate Americans, particularly white middle-class Christians, that other people don't belong, that they're there on suffrage, that - sufferance, rather - that white Christian Americans have the right to run the country, have the right to drive others out or subdue them, and have the right to dictate, and that somehow that is God-given, and that those elements of our history that President Biden referenced last night, the ideals of the Declaration of Independence, that all men are created equal, that all people deserve dignity and voice, that is a reaction against that. It is a rejection of the multiracial democracy and the country that is supposed to be open to the progress and achievement of all.\n\nSo, these ideas, sadly, have come back to us. It's like rocks have been lifted up around the country, and oxygen has been given to these forces that were always there but not encouraged in the way that they have been in the last several years of Donald Trump's dominance of the public discussion.

At Sunday's Madison Square Garden rally, Trump said he had a \"little secret\" with House Speaker Mike Johnson that would have a \"big impact\" on the outcome, though neither he nor Johnson elaborated on what that entailed. Elie Mystal, the justice correspondent for The Nation , says the secret is almost certainly a plan to force a contingent election, whereby no candidate wins a majority of the Electoral College and the president is instead chosen by the House of Representatives, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Mystal notes that even if Democrats challenge such an outcome, the case would still end up before a Supreme Court with a conservative supermajority that is likely to side with Trump.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, \"War, Peace and the Presidency.\" I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe end today's show with The Nation 's justice correspondent Elie Mystal, whose new piece , out this week, is headlined \"That 'Little Secret' Between Trump and Johnson? Here's What It Could Mean.\" It refers to a comment Trump made at his racist Madison Square Garden rally in New York last Sunday about how House Speaker Mike Johnson could help install Trump as a president through a \"contingent election,\" in which the House, not the Electoral College, determines the president.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : You know, with me, we've got to get the congressmen elected, and we've got to get the senators elected, because we can take the Senate pretty easily. And I think with our little secret, we're going to do really well with the House, right? Our little secret is having a big impact. He and I have a secret. We'll tell you what it is when the race is over.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"He and I have a secret. We'll tell you what it is when the race is over.\" And clearly, President Trump is concerned. Pieces in The Washington Post , Politico , Politico headlined \"Trump lagging in early vote with seniors in Pennsylvania, a red flag for GOP .\"\n\nFor more, we go to Elie Mystal. He is author of Allow Me to Retort: A Black Guy's Guide to the Constitution .\n\nElie, welcome back to Democracy Now! OK, what is this \"little secret\"?\n\nELIE MYSTAL : Yeah, so, it's really the 12th Amendment. One of the reasons you have to ask yourself: Why is Donald Trump and this group of MAGA people stomping around the country calling Puerto Ricans garbage and generally acting like they don't need to get any more votes to win the presidency? And the reason why they think that they don't need any more votes is - comes from the 12th Amendment. The 12th Amendment is where you get to these contingent election scenarios. What the 12th Amendment says is that the winner of the presidency is determined by whoever has a majority of the electoral votes among the electors appointed, right? And that's the key phrase. If you do not get to a majority among the electors appointed, then you kick it to the House, and that's where you have the contingent election, where, importantly, the House votes based on its own state delegation. So, basically, every state gets one vote. Currently, there are 26 delegations that are Republican, 24 Democrat, so Trump would win in that contingent election of the House.\n\nBut that's not the secret. The secret is that if you decrease the number of electors appointed - right? - the math is simple that the majority of electoral votes that you need also goes down. So, in a very simple case where we think it is - you need 270 electoral votes to win, if there are 538 total electors. But if you take that number down to, say, 528 electors, well, then, all of a sudden, you only need 264 electoral votes to win, right? And you can do that, you can decrease the number of electors appointed, if you prevent, delay, obfuscate the ability of any particular state to certify its elections and send electors to Congress by the statutorily required deadline of December 11th.\n\nAnd so, Amy, I think that's where this whole game is going to be played by Trump and Johnson. They're going to try to prevent states from submitting - states that Harris wins from submitting valid slates of electors by the December 11th deadline. And then, once we get to that deadline, Mike Johnson, as speaker of the House, and Republicans in control of the House, will simply call the process over and say any electors not appointed by the statutory deadline of December 11th simply don't count. And that is a way for Trump to steal an election that he loses.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And for people who are watching this globally, Elie, for people who don't understand the Electoral College - and there are movements to change it, like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, designed to ensure that the candidate who received the most votes nationwide is elected president, would come into effect only when it could guarantee that outcome. What this system is that we have, that they're finagling with right now?\n\nELIE MYSTAL : Yeah. So, for people who are not from America, who are, like, trying to figure out what's going on, I believe the scientific term for the Electoral College is \"stupid.\" Right? The Electoral College is anti-democratic and dumb. If you're living in some other country and you  have been told that America is the greatest democracy on Earth, you have been sold a lie. We are not the greatest democracy on Earth. We are not even a true democracy, because of the Electoral College, right? The Electoral College, which has always been a part of our history of our nation, it's always been part of the structure of the government, is fundamentally an anti-democratic system for the single elected official, the single representative that is supposed to be elected by all the people in the United States, right? Everybody else, it's based on their county, their town, their state. The president of the United States is the one official that's supposed to be elected by everybody, but he's actually elected by - he or she, one day hopefully soon, is elected by nobody, because of the Electoral College. It is a ridiculous system.\n\nIt's an anachronistic system, basically, like so much else in the Constitution, made to - it's another one of those poison pills the enslavers put into the original Constitution in hope that it would make it very difficult for slavery to ever be outlawed in this nation. And while we overcame slavery, its fundamental structure of allowing for minoritarian white rule is still in place, and we still see the effects. And that's what we're looking at in this election.\n\nYou got to remember, Donald Trump is most likely - you know, regardless of what happens on Tuesday in the Electoral College, Donald Trump is almost certainly going to lose the popular vote for the third time. For the third time in a row, this man will have a minority of the popular vote, yet still could be president, either by winning the Electoral College outright or by gaming the system as I've outlined in my piece in The Nation .\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Tell us more about what you wrote about deadlines, that what this means is that Republicans just have to delay long enough to pass those deadlines. They don't have to win; they just have to stall. And we're seeing more and more across this country these complicated local election laws that have to do with counting. You know, we're doing an election special at night, an election special the next morning, when we very possibly might not know what the election results are, even the next morning.\n\nELIE MYSTAL : Yeah, delay, delay, delay is the name of the game for the Republicans. Statutorily speaking, electors have to be submitted to Congress by December 11th. Statutorily speaking, those electors have to vote and then submit their votes on who the president should be by December 25th, Christmas Day, because we are that kind of stupid, right? January 3rd is when the new House takes office. That's a constitutional deadline, so no shenanigans are applicable there. And January 6th, as the violent MAGA people know, is the date when the House certifies the results of the Electoral College vote. But that day is largely ceremonial. Even Mike Pence understands that date is largely ceremonial. The real action is on December - is between December 11th, when the electors are appointed, and December 25th, when they're supposed to be done voting.\n\nNow, those deadlines are statutory. That means they can be changed. And if you roll the tape back to 2020, when Nancy Pelosi is the speaker of the House and the Democrats control the House, one would imagine that if states had gotten cute with their delaying submitting their slates of electors, Nancy Pelosi would have just extended the deadline. But this is why Speaker of the House Mike Johnson is critical to Trump's secret plan to steal the election, because if Mike Johnson is in charge, which he absolutely will be - even if Democrats win the House, Mike Johnson is in charge on December 11th. If he's in charge then, he could not move the deadline, essentially, and declare the process over.\n\nNow, let's say Democrats win the House, right? Let's say January 3rd, Democrats come in, Hakeem Jeffries is the new speaker of the House. Could the Democrats undo what Mike Johnson has done on December 11th and December 25th? Maybe. But as my colleague John Nichols just reminded us all, Democrats probably ain't going to control the Senate on January 3rd. So, you generally need a bicameral proposition to move deadlines like that. You're probably not going to have the Senate, even if the Democrats win the House.\n\nBut more importantly - and, you know, people who know my beat will not be surprised about what I'm about to say - but if you set the deadline on December 25th, and on December 25th you say, \"OK, Trump is the president now, because we didn't count the electors from Wisconsin and we didn't count the electors from Pennsylvania\" - let's say that happens, right? Well, now Hakeem Jeffries comes in, we change the rules, whatever. That's called a lawsuit, right? And that ends up in front of the Republican-controlled Supreme Court, which we have already seen go to great lengths to protect Donald Trump, to protect his candidacy and to protect his ability to become president again. So, even if Jeffries and the Democrats win the House and take over on January 3rd, by then you're putting it all into - like, all roads lead to the Supreme Court. And the Republicans, MAGA Republicans, and their wives, control the Supreme Court. So, as I say in my piece, I mean, everybody likes to say, like, \"We're close to a constitutional crisis.\" Nah, we in a constitutional crisis now, bro. And what happens after that, it's anyone's guess.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Elie, you have an interesting piece in The Nation , \"Black Men Will Vote for Harris-White Men Are the Problem.\" I mean, I think a lot of the emphasis came when President Barack Obama started to appeal to Black men. You say, \"Why is the media talking so much about the fraction of Black men who might go MAGA when more than 60 percent of white men will vote for Trump?\"\n\nELIE MYSTAL : Yeah, I think the focus on Black men has been a complete media red herring. Right? People have been worried about it. I saw a poll recently or post recently saying, like, \"It looks like Trump's support with Black men could be evaporating.\" Evaporating? It was never there. All right? Trump is going to get the same Black men to vote for him who voted for him last time, who voted for him in 2016, who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, who voted for John McCain in 2008. He's going to get 10 to 15% of the Black male vote, because there are 10 to 15% of Black males are Republicans, and they like Republican things, like shooting Liz Cheney apparently. That's a Republican thing that apparently a lot of Black men - that 15% of Black men like. But that's it. And that's always it. And it's never more than that, right?\n\nConversely, we live in a country -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We have five seconds.\n\nELIE MYSTAL : Conversely, we live in a country where somewhere around 60% of white men will vote for the adjudicated rapist Donald Trump. And that is our problem in this country, not the 10 to 12 to 15% of Black men who are going to vote Republican.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Elie Mystal, we want to thank you for being with us, The Nation 's justice correspondent. We'll link to all your pieces , including \"That 'Little Secret' Between Trump and Johnson? Here's What It Could Mean.\" I'm Amy Goodman.

G. Kelley about the roots of Donald Trump's election victory and the decline of Democratic support among many of the party's traditional constituencies. Kelley says he agrees with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who said Democrats have \"abandoned\" working-class people. \"There was really no program to focus on the actual suffering of working people across the board,\" Kelley says of the Harris campaign. He says the highly individualistic, neoliberal culture of the United States makes it difficult to organize along class lines and reject the appeal of authoritarians like Trump. \"Solidarity is what's missing - the sense that we, as a class, have to protect each other.\"\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Kamala Harris has conceded to Donald Trump after the former president pulled off an overwhelming victory Tuesday to send him back to the White House. On Wednesday, Harris spoke at Howard University.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS : I will never give up the fight for a future where Americans can pursue their dreams, ambitions and aspirations, where the women of America have the freedom to make decisions about their own body and not have their government telling them what to do. We will never give up the fight to protect our schools and our streets from gun violence. And, America, we will never give up the fight for our democracy, for the rule of law, for equal justice and for the sacred idea that every one of us, no matter who we are or where we start out, has certain fundamental rights and freedoms that must be respected and upheld.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : That was Kamala Harris giving her concession speech on Wednesday.\n\nThe Democratic Party is in a state of crisis after Trump expanded his support across the country and Republicans also regained control of the Senate. Republicans may also keep control of the House.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On Wednesday, independent Senator Bernie Sanders blasted the Democratic Party. In a statement, Sanders said, quote, \"It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And they're right,\" Sanders said.\n\nTo talk more about Tuesday's election, we're joined by Robin D. G. Kelley, professor of history at UCLA , who studies social movements. He's author of many books, including Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination .\n\nProfessor Kelley, it's great to have you back with us. If you can start off by talking about Donald Trump's major victory, I mean, sweeping the country, actually winning the popular vote, as well as what looks like the Electoral College vote, Harris winning far fewer millions of votes than President Biden did in 2020? Though some Democrats, for example, Elissa Slotkin in Michigan, polled much higher and won, she did not get those same votes. And end by talking about what Democratic Senator Sanders is saying, that the Democratic Party has abandoned the working class.\n\nROBIN D. G. KELLEY : Right. Let's begin with Senator Sanders. He's absolutely right. The Democratic Party abandoned the working class. Kamala Harris ran on a ticket of moving toward the right, you know, shifting, pivoting toward the right, bragging that Liz Cheney is endorsing her. And so, there was really no program to focus on the actual suffering of working people across the board. That's true.\n\nNow, when we think about 2024 compared to 2020, I'm not sure that Trump's victory is so historic. Trump would have won in 2020 had it not been for the uprisings that emerged out of the George Floyd murder. The wind was behind the Democratic Party, even though the Democratic Party didn't earn that wind. And so, I think that's a factor.\n\nThe other factor is that the country is moving toward the right, and the working class, or working classes, feel really disaffected and abandoned. They feel abandoned, I believe, for a couple of reasons. One, because whatever the numbers said about the shifting economy, the fact of the matter is that people are still dealing with inflation, with joblessness, with insecurity. But the second thing - and this goes back to an article I published back in 2016 - we also have, you know, a deeply racist, Islamophobic, xenophobic nation. And that runs through. I mean, when you look at the demographics, white men consistently vote for Trump. White women, of course, it was a slight shift, but the shift wasn't that radical. I mean, I don't trust exit polls, but it's amazing how many white women supported Trump. It's amazing how much of the message of fascism actually did tap into a deep insecurity, a deep fear, and the fact that deportation is the dominant message that has drawn working people.\n\nSo I really want to talk about the question of class, which I think is most important. We have a class that's suffering, but we don't have a class that thinks of itself as a class. If we had a class that thought of itself as a class, then working people would say, \"We refuse deportation. We refuse racism. We refuse transphobia,\" because that's what the class does. Solidarity is what's missing - the sense that we, as a class, you know, have to protect each other. Trump is seen as the person who can fix things, the person who represents the CEO who could step in and solve problems in a culture in which the only solidarity we're seeing, the primary solidarity, is coming from the capitalist class, you know? So, I'm not sure that there's such a radical shift from 2016 to 2020 to 2024. It's a failure of the Democratic Party. And even under Biden, the Democratic Party actually pivoted a little bit toward labor, in a way that the Harris campaign did not.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, I'd like to go to former Ohio state Senator Nina Turner, who we spoke to last week. She served as co-chair of independent Senator Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nNINA TURNER : I think, over time, the Democratic Party lost its way in terms of just talking to working-class voters. And I mean from all identities, because sometimes when we say \"working class,\" people assume we're just talking about white men. I'm talking about working-class people from all walks of life. And my state, you know, CAFTA , NAFTA , this happened over time. It didn't just happen in one fell swoop. It happened over decade after decade after decade. But those trade deals definitely decimated Midwestern states like mine and really hurt a lot of workers.\n\nAnd then working-class people from all backgrounds do not necessarily see themselves. They feel like elitism has taken over for both parties, but especially in the Democratic Party. And so, when you don't see yourself in a party, you decide that you want to go another way.\n\nAnd then, more recently - when I say \"recently,\" certainly over the almost four years - as people were suffering the effects of COVID , trying to - we were all trying to break out of it, inflation very high, the cost of groceries high, the cost of gas high, all of those material condition elements. The Democratic Party denied that, and they trotted out Bidenomics, and they turned their backs on people and made it seem as though the pain points that the big mamas and big papas were feeling were not necessarily real. You cannot do that.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : So, Robin Kelley, that was Ohio state Senator Nina Turner. If you could respond to what she said and put it in the context of what you mentioned earlier, namely the absence of working-class cohesion, and what that meant for this election? And why, in fact, why do you think there is an absence of cohesion among the working class in the U.S.?\n\nROBIN D. G. KELLEY : Right. No, I think - I totally agree with what Nina Turner said. This is where we are right now.\n\nThe absence of cohesion has to do with the general - two things, I think. One, the general absence of solidarity in a long-standing kind of neoliberal culture where people are taught to solve their own problems, a kind of deep individualism, and that corporate interests are the only ones - in other words, private interests are the ones that can solve your problem. Government is a problem. Government gets in the way. This is the kind of discourse that we've been seeing for at least three, four decades.\n\nAnd so, even though we see amazing developments in the labor movement with the UAW , we see discussions and talk of solidarity - the Boeing strike, for example - but in terms of those who are either unorganized or at the sort of edges of a concierge economy that is no longer based in high-wage manufacturing, what ends up happening, it's almost impossible to organize people and to think as a class. You know, the Amazon strike in Bessemer is a really good example of what could have been, but how the combination of fear, insecurity and the failure to really think of solidarity - in other words, the care for our neighbor, the care for those who are not us but maybe we share the same class, that sense of solidarity, that Audre Lorde talks about at the beginning of my piece, that's missing. And we haven't done the work, the political education work, to build that sense of cohesion.\n\nBut the other thing that I think is really important is this belief that if we - that we can one day become Trump. In other words, wealth, entrepreneurship, the striving for success, the fact that a lot of these Senate campaigns where seats were overturned, they were won by billionaires and millionaires, you know? I mean, that's significant.\n\nAnd one other thing I should add is that, you know, we could look at this at the presidential level; we could also look at it at the local level. I'm here in L.A. in what's supposed to be the Left Coast, California, where we just had propositions that failed, a proposition to end forced prison labor, a proposition to raise the minimum wage, a proposition for rent control, you know, a proposition that actually - the one proposition that did win was one that will deeply criminalize and expand sentences for petty crimes. This is in L.A., you see? This is California.\n\nSo we're moving toward the right. And somehow the right, for many people, is attractive. And we have to figure out why it's attractive. And if we don't think of ourselves as a class, a class with power, a class in which the state could be the lever of equality rather than deep inequality, then we're going to be stuck supporting Trumps for the rest - for generations.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Yeah, it's very interesting on the issue of prison labor and a ballot initiative there. When we were out in California interviewing prisoner firefighters who got a pittance a day, they were pushing for earlier release, but they didn't get it often because it provided a prisoner labor force for the wildfires that plague California. But I wanted to ask you about the extremism of Trump, when he was talking about - or, you know, at the Madison Square Garden rally, of course, that Puerto Rico is an \"island of garbage.\" He would later called that whole rally a \"lovefest,\" you know, referring to women as the B-word, and, of course, how he deals with immigrants. But there's a very interesting comment of writer Meg Indurti, who tweeted, \"if you are someone who was able to overlook the genocide and cast a vote for kamala harris, then you already understand how a conservative was able to overlook Trump's extremism to vote for him.\" Can you comment on this? Robin Kelley, you talk a lot about the working class and the working poor. You also have written extensively about Gaza.\n\nROBIN D. G. KELLEY : Right, right. Yeah, I mean, one of the questions that came up, my students were posing this question to me the other day: What would have happened had the U.S. actually stopped supporting Israel, like in November or December of last year? What would have happened? I think the Democrats could have won. You know, we overestimate the power of the Israeli lobby, because in some ways Democrats are looking for dollars, not necessarily votes. And so, imagine what would have happened had there been this refusal to send arms to Israel. There would be no - the war would have ended. There wouldn't be an escalation of the war. And part of the attraction of Trump, ironically, is this belief, this kind of - it's kind of a myth, but still this belief that under Trump there were no wars. And so, here we have possibly three different wars going on at once under the Democrats. And you could see how that would generate some fear.\n\nBut to go back to the question of the extremism and elites, you know, toxic masculinity is a huge factor. The buildup coming from right-wing state legislatures to attack the curriculum, to attack DEI , to attack trans people at every single level, here we are dealing with an extremism that is actually palpable and that I could see how elites, some elites on the right, those who actually have drafted Project 2025, would support these policies. So, in some ways, what we keep calling fascism, which I agree is fascism, is pretty mainstream among the Project 2025 people, pretty mainstream among the MAGA Republicans. And the Republican Party is a MAGA party. Whatever the old bourgeoisie of the kind of older neoliberal order, whatever they think, they're either going to go with the program or they're going to do what they did, support Harris and Walz. And that didn't work out for them.\n\nSo, I mean, I'm actually terrified by a future in which the kind of violence of the settler-colonial mentality, which was always there, has escalated and become normalized in a way. And let's remember that the history of fascism is filled with supporters who themselves are targets of fascism. We have examples of that, you know, historically. So, you know, it's hard - so we can't just assume that because there's an uptick in, say, the Latino vote in support for Trump, that somehow that's an example of Trumpism's multiculturalism, because it's still white supremacy and patriarchy.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : So, Robin Kelley, I just want to go back for a second to the point that you made earlier about those ballot measures. Why do you think those ballot measures were rejected? How did they get on the ballot to begin with? And then, is that related at all to the fact that, you know, the Democrats have come under massive criticism for, after 2016, after the Clinton election, basically finding ways to blame everybody but themselves? Is there a risk that that's going to happen again?\n\nROBIN D. G. KELLEY : Yes, I think there is a risk.\n\nAs far as the propositions, California is a conservative state. You know, it has been. It has produced some of the most conservative governors. It is the home of the origins of the John Birch Society. You know, this is a conservative state. So, it didn't surprise me too much, although California is also a state that has, you know, had basically the biggest, for a long time, or at least second-largest prison population in the country. And so, some of these initiatives came from imprisoned people themselves, came from abolitionists. The struggle for a minimum wage came from an organized labor movement. But there's still deep anti-immigrant sentiment here in California, deep anti-labor sentiment. And keep in mind that rent control has been consistently beat down since 1995. And why? Because some of the same elites who gave money to the Harris campaign are also absentee or venture capitalists who own a lot of property, and they're trying to profit off of them.\n\nThe Democrats, I mean, you know, I don't have an answer to that, except for the fact that we can't keep relying on the Democratic Party. I mean, it's been - it's so bankrupt. I think what Ralph Nader said yesterday is absolutely true. We need something else. You know, if not a real third party, I think Reverend William Barber has an answer, and that is to build from the bottom up, to build from low-wage workers, because that's the vast majority of the people. But we can't do this until we actually think of ourselves as a community, a beloved community, as a class that struggles with each other against corporate interests.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And we will be speaking with Reverend Barber tomorrow, so people should tune in.

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nWe speak with Yale philosophy professor Jason Stanley, author of the new book Erasing History: How Fascists Rewrite the Past to Control the Future , which examines the global rise of authoritarianism in the United States, Russia, Israel and beyond. He says attacks on education are a key part of the fascist toolkit to undermine democracy and pluralism. \"They're attacking the institutions, the universities, because the universities provide critical inquiry into the kind of myths that's required for these kinds of politics,\" says Stanley.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nElection Day is now seven weeks away. On Monday, Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance lashed out at Democrats, saying liberal rhetoric is to blame for Sunday's apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump at his golf course in Florida. Vance made no mention that the man arrested was actually a former Trump supporter. Vance spoke on Monday at a Faith and Freedom Coalition event in Atlanta.\n\nSEN . JD VANCE : Well, you know the big difference between conservatives and liberals is that we have - no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months, and two people now have tried to kill Donald Trump in the last couple of months. I'd say that's pretty strong evidence that the left needs to tone down their rhetoric and needs to cut this crap out.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On Monday, Trump ally Elon Musk posted a message on social media platform - his social media platform X that read, \"And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala\" along with a thinking-face emoji. Musk deleted the message after widespread criticism. He's now being investigated by the Secret Service. JD Vance's remarks for Democrats to tone down their rhetoric came just days after Donald Trump repeatedly used inflammatory language to attack Vice President Kamala Harris during last week's ABC News presidential debate.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : She's destroying this country. And if she becomes president, this country doesn't have a chance of success. Not only success. We'll end up being Venezuela on steroids. ... Because they're destroying the fabric of our country by what they've done. There's never been anything done like this at all. They've destroyed the fabric of our country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're joined right now by Jason Stanley, author and professor of philosophy at Yale University, his new book titled Erasing History: How Fascists Rewrite the Past to Control the Future . Professor Stanley is the son of Holocaust survivors.\n\nThis is your second book on fascism. Why are you writing it now? And the significance of its publication as this election, to say the least, heats up in its last weeks?\n\nJASON STANLEY : Well, I faced a puzzle when writing this book: Why is it that authoritarians always target schools and universities? So, we see that all over the world. We see that with Viktor Orbán, who provides a kind of template for U.S. authoritarianism. He attacked Central European University for \"gender ideology\" and leftism and being pro-immigration. And so, we know about the courts, the authoritarians targeting the courts. But why do authoritarians always target voting - that's clear - and schools and universities?\n\nSo, last year, when the anti-genocide, antiwar protests on campus were happening, I thought about the international context. I thought about what happened in India in 2019, when they passed the Citizenship Amendment Act, which made Muslims into second-class citizens. And there were nonviolent protests on campus, denounced as anti-Indian, so - and violent, militarized responses. So, this tactic of tarring school teachers, tarring university professors as Marxists and communists and ruining the country, and replacing this kind of education, replacing Black history, replacing LGBTQ perspectives by a kind of grandiosity of white Christian nationalism, as we're seeing right now, this seemed to me a democratic emergency.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance speaking in 2021 at the National Conservatism Conference. At the time, he was a candidate for the U.S. Senate in Ohio.\n\nJD VANCE : I think in this movement of national conservatism, what we need more than inspiration is we need wisdom. And there was a wisdom in what Richard Nixon said approximately 40, 50 years ago. He said - and I quote - \"The professors are the enemy.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that was JD Vance: \"The professors are the enemy.\" I also want to quote First Things magazine, a right-wing magazine, that says, \"Universities should be places of sober analysis. But at Yale, philosophy professor Jason Stanley and history professor Timothy Snyder publish books of political propaganda that describe Trump as the second coming of Adolf Hitler. TV newscasters intone rants rather than report on events.\" And, of course, JD Vance, your fellow Yale -\n\nJASON STANLEY : Person.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - colleague.\n\nJASON STANLEY : Yeah. So, that's a strangeness about this moment, that all these people, the leaders of the movement to attack universities and schools, are all Ivy League grads. Ron DeSantis is a Yale and Harvard grad. Ted Cruz is a Princeton and Harvard grad. JD Vance is a Yale Law School grad. Tom Cotton is Harvard, Harvard. Elise Stefanik is Harvard. So, what's going on? That's a mystery. These guys are sending their kids to Harvard, Yale and Princeton. They're not sending their kids to Hillsdale College. It's Hillsdale College for the rest of us and Harvard, Yale and Princeton for their kids.\n\nSo, they're attacking the institutions, the universities, because the universities provide critical inquiry into the kind of myths that's required for these kinds of politics. This kind of politics elevates the dominant group - in the case of the United States, white Christian men. It diminishes women, the agency of women. It represents history as the exploits, in the United States, of white Christian men, like in India history is represented as the exploits of Hindus. In Israel, it's represented as the exploits of Jewish nationalists who founded the state.\n\nThis kind of erasure of history justifies - it doesn't just justify wars and genocide. If you look at Russia, a case I look at extensively in the book, as well as Israel, in Russia, the erasure of Ukraine as an independent place, the complete erasure of Ukrainian history, justifies Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine, because it says it is sort of a fake identity, a fake country. It represents all Russian incursions as justified by supporting independence movements. Israel has erased the existence of the Palestinian people. It has erased the history, making the desert - Jews made the desert bloom. This kind of thing represents - erases Palestinians from the narrative of the country and of the area and paves the way for genocide.\n\nThis kind of erasing history paves the way for ethnic, racial and religious nationalism, which is the core of the message we're hearing from MAGA Republicans today. When you represent - when you erase Black history, when you erase LGBTQ perspectives, when you erase social - history of social movements, then you represent history as just the exploits of great white men. You erase social movements, you make citizens feel like they have no agency, and so it's an anti-democratic education. And then you justify great replacement theory, which is their core message, that the greatness of America comes from the exploits of great white men, and so we need to protect that identity.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Jason Stanley, you write in your book, Erasing History , the most visible current manifestation of the Black American tradition of reclaiming history is Nikole Hannah-Jones' 1619 Project. She is, of course, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for The New York Times Magazine , creator of the landmark 1619 Project, which reframes U.S. history by marking the year 1619, when the first enslaved Africans arrived on Virginia soil, as the country's foundational date. This is then-President Donald Trump denouncing the project at a White House conference on American history in September 2020.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Critical race theory, The 1619 Project and the crusade against American history is toxic propaganda, ideological poison that, if not removed, will dissolve the civic bonds that tie us together, will destroy our country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Stanley, your response?\n\nJASON STANLEY : This is an erasure of Black history. This is an erasure of Black perspectives. What we need to improve our democracy is we need knowledge of who has been denied equality and why. We need to know - democracy is a system where we all play a role in the formation of the policies that govern us, the laws that govern us. Without Black perspectives, without the Black perspective on history, we don't know, we don't understand their voices. We can't - the grounds for eliminating and responding to stereotypes and prejudice have been robbed from us.\n\nWithout critical race theory, the study of structures that maintain racial hierarchy, the study of, say, mortgage redlining, you won't - children won't understand why there are poor Black neighborhoods and wealthy white neighborhoods in their cities protected by military police. Black children will be led to believe the stereotypes about themselves and, ironically, feel shame about their own identity. These divisive concept laws that are being passed all over the country that invite students at public universities and students at public schools to report on their own teachers and professors, these are purportedly justified as students - we shouldn't have teaching that makes students feel shame about their race. Well, when you don't allow professors and teachers to teach Black history, you're making Black students feel ashamed about their race. When you don't allow LGBT perspectives, when you declare them as obscene and pornographic, you make LGBT families feel ashamed about their identity.\n\nPeople say, \"OK, it's not banning, because you can look at the web.\" But what's taught in schools, the perspectives that are taught in schools, affect us through our whole lives. They represent an authority, a state authority. And we're being told by MAGA Republicans that that perspective is the perspective of Christian white men.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to ask you to stay with us. We're going to do a post-show interview, a Part 2 , and we'll put it online at democracynow.org.

The Republican Party, in thrall to the cult of Donald Trump, is openly professing subversion of elections. Allied with armed militias, the GOP and its backers are working to bend or break the institutions of government.\n\n\"We are in a crisis of democracy. We are not approaching a constitutional crisis; the crisis is upon us. And the question is: What do we do about it,\" Elie Mystal, justice correspondent for The Nation, asked on the Democracy Now! news hour.\n\nPresident Joe Biden gave a primetime speech last week on the threats to democracy, calling out Donald Trump by name and repeatedly referencing \"MAGA Republicans,\" the now-dominant \"Make America Great Again\" GOP faction entirely servile to Trump that embraces his lie that he won the 2020 election. Biden's backdrop was Philadelphia's Independence Hall, where two foundational documents of the United States were debated and signed: the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\"Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic,\" Biden said. \"They look at the mob that stormed the United States Capitol on January 6th, brutally attacking law enforcement, not as insurrectionists who placed a dagger to the throat of our democracy, but...as patriots. They see their MAGA failure to stop a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election as preparation for the 2022 and 2024 elections. They tried everything last time to nullify the votes of 81 million people. This time, they're determined to succeed in thwarting the will of the people.\"\n\nTraditionally, Republicans leaned on voter suppression as one of their key tactics. In 1980, conservative Republican activist Paul Weyrich said in a speech: \"I don't want everybody to vote. Elections are not won by a majority of people, they never  been from the beginning of our country, and they are not now ... our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down.\"\n\nNow, Trump allies are seeking to more directly intervene in elections. The Brennan Center for Justice recently wrote a letter to state Associations of Election Officials, saying, \"Insider threats are not a new phenomenon, nor are they unique to election security, but the current participation of election deniers in the election process, and active recruitment of more, has sparked an increase in breaches of the physical security of election equipment...those who manufacture distrust in elections use false claims that security has been breached or chain of custody broken as part of their efforts.\"\n\nCNN obtained a video of a Michigan GOP training session for poll workers, with party officials instructing people to break election laws by infiltrating polling places to challenge voters, take video recordings illegally, and other actions to disrupt voting.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis created the nation's first \"election police force,\" with armed officers tasked with ferreting out election fraud that even DeSantis admits is almost non-existent. In August, this new police force arrested 20 people, mostly Black men, for voting after believing their right to vote as former felons had been restored. Many of them now face up to five years in prison. The chilling message is clear: voting while Black can be dangerous.\n\nTrump-allied election deniers are also seeking higher office, winning Republican primaries with pledges to \"decertify the 2020 election,\" a key Trump demand. Kari Lake, a former newscaster who is Arizona's Republican candidate for governor, has taken the pledge despite the fact that no such legal decertification process exists. Three Republican candidates for Secretary of State and Pennsylvania's Republican candidate for governor, along with scores of county clerk candidates have all embraced Trump's 2020 election lies. These elected offices actually run the elections.\n\n\"The Trump wing of the party and the MAGA Republicans have jumped the rails of constitutional democracy, of the factual universe and of representative democracy,\" Nancy MacLean, a historian of the  right at Duke University, said on Democracy Now! \"You cannot have a democracy in which one party does not accept the legitimacy of the other party's candidates, elected officials and the outcomes of elections. But that is where we have come with Donald Trump and the MAGA faction.\"\n\nThe growing, rightwing militia movement adds the prospect of violence to the electoral process. Trump recently said that if reelected he would consider \"full pardons with an apology to many\" of the January 6th, 2021 U.S. Capitol insurrectionists.\n\nThe 2022 midterms and the 2024 general elections will profoundly impact the trajectory of our political system. Elie Mystal's question is one we all must seriously consider: What are we going to do about it?\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

We won't go back!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman. We're at the People's March in Washington, D.C., two days before the inauguration of Donald Trump. People are carrying banners that say, \"We will not be silent,\" \"Together we can, together we will,\" \"Your power, our power, people power.\" There are many people. One person was holding a sign that said \" MAGA : Morons Are Governing America.\" And there are many other issues. The people are talking about women's rights, trans rights, LGBTQ rights, talking about the rights of Palestinians, D.C. statehood and much more. We'll talk to people in the crowd.\n\nPROTESTERS : Trans Black women! Trans Black women! Trans Black women!\n\nHOPE GISELLE : How are you doing? I'm Hope Giselle. I'm the executive director of the National Trans Visibility March, and I'm out here because all of us deserve the space to feel like we have a voice in democracy. All of us deserve to feel like human beings, and all of us deserve to have our rights respected.

Therefore, I'm here for the People's March and a march for peace.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And you're standing in front of the Free Palestine contingent. Talk about what you want to see and what you hope for Trump.\n\nANN WRIGHT : I hope that Trump will stop the aid, the military aid that we are giving to Israel, that is so complicit in the genocide of Gaza. We hope the ceasefire will hold, so that no more Palestinians are killed. But we, the people of the world, have to put pressure, continue to put pressures on our governments so that they put pressures on the Israelis to stop this genocide.\n\nPROTESTERS : Free, free Palestine! Free, free, free Palestine!\n\nBETH MILLER : Hi. My name is Beth Miller. I'm the political director with Jewish Voice for Peace. And we're here today as part of the contingent with the Palestinian Freedom Movement, that is part of the broader antiwar contingent. And we're here because we are showing up as part of the broader resistance to this incoming fascist authoritarian regime. And we're here to make clear that all of our liberations, from here in the U.S. to Palestine and everywhere in between, are connected. And we understand that fascism here, fascism in Israel, requires a big, broad united front.\n\nPROTESTERS : When teachers are under attack, what do we do? Stand up! Fight back!\n\nTEXAS WOMAN : I'm originally from Texas, but we came from Florida. We drove here from Florida to come to attend this. It's been on my bucket list for a while, and I just am really passionate about the government staying out of my body.

And I'm here because where else would one be today? It is - now is the time to stand up as loudly, as boldly and in as big a numbers as we can, to say we're not going away. We're not sitting at home quietly. We are committed to resisting what the Trump administration, the MAGA Republicans, the Heritage Foundation, the billionaires, what they're going to bring to us, the horrors that they're going to rain on our communities. So we're here to say we're not going away. We're fighting back.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And do you feel that the resistance is strong enough?\n\nLESLIE CAGAN : We're strong in our commitment, in our understanding of the problem, in our willingness to take bold action. We need more people. Honestly, we need more people in every community of this country to be speaking out. Some will come to marches. Some will make calls to their elected officials. Some will organize community defense and protection of immigrants and other communities. So, people will do it in different ways.

And we came then for the exact same reason we're here today. And that is -\n\nANDREA'S SISTER : Even more.\n\nANDREA PASKIN : More so, because you have to resist and resist and resist and resist. I don't know what else to say. There are just too many things to say that are going wrong. And we thought we had hopefully corrected them in 2020, and then we had an insurrection, and then we never had any peace.\n\nANDREA'S SISTER : Yeah, sure. All our children and grandchildren need to see that you have to do something. You can't just wait around and let it happen to you. So, that's why we're here.\n\nPROTESTERS : Tell me what democracy looks like! This is what democracy looks like! Show me what democracy looks like! This is what democracy looks like!

My name is Ben Jealous, former national president of the NAACP . I'm proud to serve as the seventh executive director of the Sierra Club.\n\nNow, I'll tell you, this crowd today touches my heart. My mom is in a People's March in California right now. When I was 12, she took me to my first march. It was a march against rape in our community that my father organized.\n\nAnd so, today we come here from many movements. We come here for many reasons. We also come here as human beings who are clear that we must do everything in our power to create a greener, healthier Mother Earth for all of us. And that's what my vice president, Shruti Bhatnagar, and I do at Sierra Club every day. And I'll tell you this: January's off to a wild start for the Sierra Club. Woke up one day, and Exxon was suing us. Woke up a few days later, and that Twitter troll-in-chief Elon Musk was attacking us. ... You know, somebody up there has a sign that says, \"Deport Musk and Murdoch.\" ...\n\nY'all are too much this morning. But I'll tell you this: They only attack us because they fear us. They know that last time this man who comes back into office on Monday, last time that man was in office, we sued him hundreds of times, and we won hundreds of times. They know that last time that man was in office, we saw him install corrupt Cabinet members, and then he saw us run them out. They know that last time this man was in office, he said that we would burn more coal, and we shut down more coal-fired power plants than we had in either of Obama's first terms. No, we are powerful enough, in other words, to keep making progress, no matter who is president. The people of this democracy, we don't - we don't elect politicians to make change for us. We try to elect the best politicians to make it a little easier for us to make change. But, you know, when the hill gets steeper, when the weather gets colder, we don't cancel our gathering, and we keep climbing up that hill.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ben Jealous, executive director of the Sierra Club, before that, head of the NAACP , addressing the People's March in Washington, D.C.\n\nANALILIA MEJÍA: Y'all, I believe that we will win together! My people! All right, y'all, as you heard, my name is Analilia Mejía. I know that's a lot of vowels. So, all you've got to hear is \"Resist Trump.\" That's how you spell it. All right, y'all. Now, Popular Democracy, which is an organization of 50 organizations across the country who are like, \"Hell no! This is our government. This is our country. It is our responsibility. We defend the 14th Amendment, and we are here to stand up and fight back.\" Are you with me? ...\n\nNow, I know. I know. I'm pushing 50, so I feel it in my knees. I know that some of us, we're weary. We are so tired. We cannot believe that we have to do this [bleep] again. Oops. I know that we are in disbelief and, frankly, in disappointment for the 90 million who stayed. But it's all right, because, y'all, that even though we find ourselves in this moment, we've got to know that freedom, that justice is not a final destination, y'all. This is a practice. Every day, we need to make the decision: Are we going to uphold a democracy and the kind of government that is for the people, or are we going to sit it out? For me, I'm going to stand up. How about you?\n\nCROWD : Yeah!\n\nANALILIA MEJÍA: Are you going to stand up, fight back?\n\nCROWD : Yeah!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Analilia Mejía, co-executive director, the Center for Popular Democracy, speaking at the People's March in front of the Lincoln Memorial on Saturday, addressing thousands.\n\nWhen we come back, we'll hear Dr. Martin Luther King on this federal holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King. But first, the Inaugural Peace Ball.

      "text": "Democrats Could Save Speaker Johnson - But Republicans Say That Would Doom Him\n\nPolitics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nFaced with the possibility of a revolt within his own party if he allows a vote on helping Ukraine fend off Russia's brutal invasion, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) may need help from Democrats to keep his job.\n\nBut there's a problem with that: Many members of his party see any hint of help from across the aisle as even more reason to oust him.\n\nAnd that leaves Democrats, who favor Ukraine aid, in an awkward position: How do you help when your help is unwanted?\n\n\"Our general approach has been that [Make America Great Again] Republicans have to solve the problems that MAGA Republicans create,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) told HuffPost Tuesday. \"We cannot cure the MAGA caucus of their intrinsic cannibalism.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Having said that, the real ethical imperative now is to get aid to the people of Ukraine. I will talk to anybody about what needs to be done to get aid to people.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said he supported Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's (R-Ga.) threat to call a vote to oust Johnson from the speaker's chair if he brings Ukraine aid to the floor. Johnson laid out a plan Monday night to do just that, in conjunction with aid to Israel, Taiwan and another measure with several GOP-favored national security-oriented provisions.\n\nWith Republicans having only two votes to spare in party-line votes, a margin which will drop even further when Rep. Mike Gallagher's (R-Wis.) resignation becomes effective later in the week, the threat to Johnson's hold on power is real.\n\nJohnson said he was unconcerned but delayed the release of the details of his plan until Wednesday.\n\nThe resulting pileup has led to a tableau of incongruous and awkward scenes on Capitol Hill and elsewhere. Tuesday morning saw Johnson at a press conference trying to shift focus away from the House GOP and back to the effort to convict Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in his impeachment - which Greene is helping manage.\n\nAnd after appearing with Johnson at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida on Friday and saying Johnson was doing \"a very good job,\" former President Donald Trump said Tuesday after a court appearance in New York , \"We'll see what happens with that\" when asked about the effort to oust the speaker.\n\nMassie on Tuesday also gave the bluntest assessment yet as to why Johnson still was in his post, even as discontent was rising among House Republicans: They are afraid of a replay of October, when the House was paralyzed for three weeks as the GOP met daily for hours on end to try to name a new speaker but saw several candidacies implode publicly before Johnson's.\n\n\"I think the concern for that happening again is literally the only reason he's still speaker,\" Massie told reporters.\n\n\"I think he would say, 'Well, he's the only one that could get the votes, or do you really want to go through that again?'\"\n\nThat's also why Massie said he wants Johnson to announce a resignation date to provide for a more orderly transition.\n\nKevin McCarthy, the former congressman from California who became the first speaker ousted from the floor, blamed Democrats in part for his exit, saying he had been told they would not support such a move, as eight Republicans voting with all of them ensured his defeat.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) has tiptoed gingerly around the same question with Johnson, declining to answer directly if Democrats would help Johnson survive, especially if he helped push Ukraine aid across the finish line.\n\n\"I believe that there are a reasonable number of Democrats who would not want to see the speaker fall as a result of doing the right thing,\" Jeffries said last week, though he added that was \"an observation,\" not a declaration of support.\n\nBut for many Republicans, if the Democrats were to be for Johnson, they would be against him. Even for those not supporting an ouster, the prospect of a speaker holding on to the gavel only because Democrats allow him to is just not tenable.\n\n\"I don't think that's a sustainable position for a Republican speaker. It may be very temporarily, but I don't think that's a sustainable position,\" said Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), who dismissed the ouster effort as being pushed by only two members. \"I don't think Speaker Johnson wants to be speaker with Democrat votes.\"\n\nRep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) said: \"The good thing about Johnson is I don't think he'll cut a deal. I don't think he'll give them anything to save his job. The only way they'd save him is if they get something for it. That's how it works.\"\n\nMassie also said a Democratic-backed Johnson in the speaker's role was unsustainable.\n\n\"That would not last, no. Because I think people back home would get upset, particularly given that every bill we put on the floor is exactly as [Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Schumer would have it,\" he said.\n\nRep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas) said he was unconcerned about the ouster effort because he did not think anyone else in the House Republican conference would want the speaker's job.\n\n\"Who wants the job? We went into three weeks, right? We got deep into the bench, right? We skipped over all of our leadership and everything. So then, who's going to want the job?\" he asked.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Again.\n\nSenior White House Correspondent, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON ― President Joe Biden Tuesday repeated his warning to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and his fellow Republicans to stop threatening a global recession to get their way on spending cuts.\n\n\"He threatened to become the first speaker to default on our national debt, which took over 230 years to accumulate,\" Biden said, referring to McCarthy's speech to a Wall Street audience Monday.\n\n\"He threatened to be the first one to default on the debt, which would throw us in a gigantic recession and beyond unless he gets what he wants,\" Biden said and then tied McCarthy to the \"Make America Great Again\" wing of the party, loyal to coup-attempting former President Donald Trump . \"You've got to ask yourself, what are MAGA Republicans in Congress doing? Because this is not your father's Republican Party , it's a different deal.\n\nOn Tuesday, McCarthy told the New York Stock Exchange that Biden's refusal to negotiate over proposed spending cuts is making a debt default more likely, as the United States Treasury's ability to cover bond interest payments will run out as early as June unless the \"debt ceiling\" is increased by Congress and Biden.\n\n\"The longer President Biden waits to be sensible to find an agreement, the more likely it becomes this administration will bumble into the first default in our nation's history,\" McCarthy said.\n\nIn remarks at the signing of an executive order to make it easier to pay for child care and home care, Biden said he disagreed with Republicans' desire to cut discretionary spending and that, regardless of their differing views on future spending, that disagreement had nothing to do with paying debt already incurred.\n\n\"I urge Congress to take the threat of default off the table,\" Biden said.\n\nRepublicans' threat of defaulting on the national debt ― which would likely trigger a global financial catastrophe ― as a way to win spending cuts was a tactic they first used in 2011 when Democrat Barack Obama was president.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

He also agreed to a rule allowing a single member to trigger a no-confidence vote that could end his tenure as speaker.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nDeep-pocketed right-wing Trump backers eager to drive a progressive from Congress are swelling the campaign coffers of George Latimer, Rep. Jamaal Bowman's challenger in the 16th congressional district of New York.\n\nGeorge Latimer speaking in New York on August 7, 2023. (Lev Radin / Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\n\"Help me defeat the Squad,\" Republican Steve Louro wrote, announcing a May 16 fundraiser at the home of fellow Republican David Bercow, in Armonk, an upscale suburb in Westchester County, New York. The cause? The defeat of \"radical Jamaal Bowman.\"\n\nIt's not surprising that Republicans would oppose Bowman, a black democratic socialist. But these Republicans aren't organizing behind a Republican general election candidate. They're supporting Bowman's Democratic opponent, George Latimer.\n\nThat means that Democrats in Westchester, including centrists who don't always agree with Bowman's progressive politics - which have included public funding for renewable energy and a cease-fire in Gaza - who vote for Latimer would be allying themselves with MAGA backers.\n\nLatimer's willingness to accept money from such actors reflects the grim reality that some in the centrist Democratic establishment would often rather ally with Trumpists than allow the Left to gain power. Local Democratic committees and even some unions have, in this spirit, endorsed Latimer. (That support has been far from uniform, however: national figures like House Democratic leaders Hakeem Jeffries, Pete Aguilar, and Kathleen Clarke came out strongly for Bowman last month.)\n\nThis election year, Bowman is one of the main targets of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), which essentially serves as an arm of the Israeli state and its far-right government. Latimer's fundraising edge is huge, but according to recent internal polling , the race could be much closer than previously reported. Bowman could win.\n\nPart of what's animated both MAGA and AIPAC is Bowman's call for a cease-fire in Gaza. However, his position is a popular one: a Working Families Party poll in the district last month found that 69 percent of Democratic voters in the district would be more likely to support a candidate backing a cease-fire.\n\nLouro, an insurance mogul who has already given $5,000 to Latimer, is a top Donald Trump fundraiser. He hosted a $5,000-a-plate event for Trump in 2016. In the last election, he hosted a party for New York governor Kathy Hochul's far-right opponent, Lee Zeldin. Donald Trump Jr. was a featured speaker. Louro, who lives on Long Island, has also served as regional finance chairman for New York state's Republican Party. (As for Bercow, the host of the Latimer shindig, he's been less partisan in the past, supporting both Democrats and Republicans as many rich people do. But his biggest cause has been genocide apologetics, giving thousands over the years to AIPAC and similar groups.)\n\nLouro isn't the only MAGA Republican backing Latimer. Alex Dubitsky, CEO of a \"bespoke insurance\" firm based in Connecticut, who gave $15,000 to Trump in 2020, held a brunch in January at his home in Larchmont, inviting his friends to pay up to $6,600 to meet and greet Latimer.\n\nOver the last few years, as the New York Daily News reported , he's given nearly $20,000 to the Republican National Committee, as well as supporting right wingers like Lindsey Graham, Elise Stefanik, Rob Astorino, and Zeldin. Hedge funder Daniel Loeb has also donated to Latimer. Loeb is a charter school zealot who has given $1.5 million to Mitch McConnell, $200,000 to a PAC supporting Dr Oz, along with millions to the Republican Party.\n\nThat's not even counting the indirect far-right money: MAGA Republicans are also some of the biggest donors to AIPAC, which plans to spend millions on Latimer this cycle.\n\nWhile Latimer's support from AIPAC has been widely reported, and some local papers have uncovered the MAGA connections, the latter have been surprisingly downplayed in major media. Bowman supporters even point to a pattern of reporters deleting tweets that portray Latimer in a negative light.\n\nPolitico reporter David Freedlander took down a tweet about the Louro-organized fundraiser; he told Jacobin he did this because Bercow, the event's host, said that he was getting violent threats. A News 12 reporter also took down a tweet in which Latimer unconvincingly answered accusations that, in taking money from MAGA Republicans, he is working with groups and people who have a history of targeting people of color. (That clip, which was reposted by Daniel Marans of the Huffington Post , is a familiar genre: a white person's awkward testimony that, having grown up with black friends and neighbors, he could not possibly be implicated in anything racist.)\n\nPerhaps it shouldn't be so surprising that a Democrat willing to ally himself with AIPAC - whose mission is to enable an eliminationist policy against Palestinians - would be willing to accept money from domestic white supremacists and extremists. But for many liberal suburbanites, even those accustomed to tuning out Middle East politics, MAGA cash might be too egregious to stomach.\n\nThese unsavory bedfellows are helping to give the unremarkable Latimer - who was never gifted at fundraising before he was adopted as a pet cause by the far right - a big fundraising edge over Bowman. Bowman did a video on the matter: \"This is what we've been telling y'all,\" he says, with the Louro invitation appearing in the background, \"Republicans are bankrolling my opponent.\"\n\nOn Louro's support for Trump and Zeldin, Bowman noted in the video that these are \"two people who want to end Roe v. Wade and have said it out loud, two people who are racist MAGA Republicans who supported the insurrection and the attack on the US Capitol.\"\n\nThere are clearly some voters in Bowman's district who don't like him - hardcore Israel apologists who don't like his support for Palestinian lives, and some rich people who don't like social democracy and high taxes. But it seems unlikely that most residents of Westchester and the Bronx want to tolerate racist, anti-choice MAGA influence in their district.\n\nLiza Featherstone is a columnist for Jacobin , a freelance journalist, and the author of Selling Women Short: The Landmark Battle for Workers' Rights at Wal-Mart .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen I first learned about the plans for President Joe Biden's speech on Thursday, I thought he'd struggle to deliver his message of an extreme and dangerous Republican Party threatening democracy, given he'd spent his first year bending over backward to prove that same party could still be a sane and reasonable governing partner. When I finally watched it, I realized only Joe Biden could deliver a partisan speech whose actual message was about rehabilitating the institution he was meant to be warning people about.\n\nBiden's major primetime address on Thursday was his latest attempt to grapple with the perils facing democracy at home and abroad, a familiar topic for the president that has previously brought underwhelming returns. Biden's virtual \"Summit for Democracy\" last year fell flat, given US democracy's own troubles and the contradictory, clearly geopolitically driven mess of an invite list . His Summit of the Americas held this year was an even bigger debacle , when similarly incoherent decisions around who was invited and who wasn't prompted a boycott from some of the region's major players. Would the third time be a charm for the president?\n\nTo be fair, a clarion call to protect democracy is not really what Biden was going for last night. This was a campaign speech through and through, as Biden tried his hand at adopting the wider Democratic Party's electoral strategy this year, aimed at framing the GOP as an increasingly extreme and out-of-control menace to democratic norms - only with a Bidenesque twist.\n\nWhile the Democrats have more and more come to stress the lack of daylight between Donald Trump, his movement, and the Republican Party as a whole, Biden focused his ire on Trump and the \"MAGA Republicans\" who he said are contemptuous of democracy and the rule of law, and want to reverse long-established rights to abortion, contraception, and marriage equality. In fact, Biden went out of his way to explicitly separate this MAGA movement from what he called \"mainstream Republicans,\" who, the implication was, were opposed to this agenda.\n\nThe incoherence of this message was best embodied by an early passage, where over the course of a few sentences, Biden careened from warning about the dangers of the MAGA movement, to stressing they didn't represent the GOP, to then declaring the same GOP was entirely in the thrall of said dangerous movement:\n\nNot every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology. I know because I've been able to work with these mainstream Republicans. But there's no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.\n\nThis is firmly in line with the message that an army of often liberal commentators, influencers, and politicians have fed the public over the past six years. It's also, whatever the political wisdom of this message, a total fantasy.\n\nThe reason Trump has taken over the GOP isn't because he's blackmailing every elected official with compromising photos; it's because the man always was and continues to be wildly popular with the Republican base. Only one of the \"mainstream Republicans\" Biden brags about working with in the Senate to pass his infrastructure bill voted with Trump less than 70 percent of the time, nor did any of them ever deviate from lockstep GOP opposition to Biden's own agenda, dooming it and the millions of working Americans it would have benefited.\n\nHow can Biden claim it's only MAGA Republicans who trample on democracy and the rule of law when it was just two Republican administrations ago that the GOP stole an election , before pursuing a \"war on terror\" that was regularly accused, including by Democrats, of trampling on the US Constitution? By the way, according to OpenSecrets, Biden's party had spent a whole $44 million in the recent primary contests to boost the very \"election deniers\" he said sought to \"undermine democracy itself,\" on the basis that they'll be easier to beat in November - a risky strategy that already backfired once when they did it with Trump in 2016.\n\nBut most absurd is the idea that it's Trump and some cabal of zealots behind him that explain why the GOP is attacking abortion and other privacy rights nationwide. Trump's sudden adoption of an extreme anti-abortion position was what consolidated his support from the GOP base in 2016 in the first place, and his anti-abortion Supreme Court picks weren't rogue choices but names fed to him from the Republican establishment, with nearly every single Republican senator voting lockstep to confirm them all (Maine senator Susan Collins's vote against Amy Coney Barrett remains the only GOP no vote). The quest to overturn Roe v. Wade , as just a start, has been a decades-long Republican project.\n\nAs I've written about again and again and again and again over the past six years, apparently to no avail, Trump and his imitators aren't a break from, but the logical culmination of, a variety of long-intensifying trends within the GOP. The idea there's some meaningful line that separates mainstream Republicans from MAGA Republicans is like pretending a shower curtain makes your bathtub into a separate room.\n\nBut since Biden was making a political pitch, let's put aside reality and think about whether this is even an effective campaign message. There's a risk Biden's unnecessarily nuanced message for November - not \"Don't vote Republican\" but rather \"Don't vote for specific Republicans, who I'll leave nameless\" - is confusing and unclear.\n\nOnly a handful of names, like Matt Gaetz or Marjorie Taylor Greene, have established public profiles as MAGA Republicans, and any Republican candidate not in a safe red seat is almost certain to present themselves as moderate or even opposing Trump in some cases, as so many of his most loyal acolytes have easily done over the years. Listening to Biden's speech, any voter could easily rationalize agreeing with the president's warnings about MAGA Republicans while continuing to support their local GOP candidate over whoever the Democrat is.\n\nNone of this may even matter anyway, since broadcast networks declined to run Biden's speech, opting instead to play the night's regularly scheduled programming of a game show and reruns. But it's all emblematic of the confused and incoherent nature of Democratic messaging.\n\nThe same day, a different US politician made another major address, only across the Atlantic Ocean. As UK railworkers with the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) continued negotiations for better wages and working conditions for the third straight month , Senator Bernie Sanders flew into London to speak to the workers directly, at his own request . (The same day, RMT workers announced two more days of strikes.)\n\nThough largely a statement of solidarity for striking workers, Sanders's speech obliquely tackled the same global crisis of democracy Biden centered on Thursday and throughout his presidency. But rather than framing the threat to democracy as a group of extremist ne'er-do-wells whom the president incidentally needs to beat in an upcoming election, Sanders pointed to the structural problems of ballooning wealth inequality and emerging oligarchy as the chief issues bedeviling liberal democracy.\n\n\"What you are looking at globally is a small number of billionaires who have enormous power over the economic life of the people and the political life of the people,\" Sanders told the crowd.\n\nThe Vermont senator rattled through many of his usual points, albeit with a slightly more radical tinge, warning about billionaires who \"every day are fighting hard to crush the working class so they can have a few billion more,\" and about the \"concentration of ownership\" giving those at the top power over what's produced and its cost. But Sanders, whose brother, Larry, has lived in the UK since 1969, stressed that the trends US audiences are used to hearing him highlight - the superrich getting richer, a vanishing middle class, rising poverty - are part of a global shift that must be combated.\n\n\"What is going on in the UK is no different from what is going on in the United States of America,\" he said. \"Same bloody thing.\"\n\nOf course, Biden, too, had given his listeners a call to action, warning Americans they were \"not powerless\" or \"bystanders\" as democracy comes under attack. Besides voting against the MAGA Republicans and choosing a vaguely defined \"different path\" instead, the president instructed Americans to unite behind the \"single purpose\" of defending democracy. But how, specifically?\n\n\"Democracy endures only if we the people respect the guardrails of the republic,\" Biden said, adding respecting election results and viewing politics \"not as total war but mediation of differences\" to the list of preconditions for democracy's continuing survival. \"Democracy begins and will be preserved in we the people's habits of the heart,\" he explained.\n\nSanders's audience heard a different perspective, one where preserving democracy wasn't a matter of every individual simply voting once and changing what was in their hearts, but about mass movements and popular struggle. He noted the upsurge in US union organizing efforts going on at the same time as the UK's own rise in worker militancy, and stressed the need to marry it to something bigger.\n\n\"We are trying to grow the trade union movement, we're trying to combine trade unionists with the progressive movement to create an economic and political force of real power,\" he said.\n\nParaphrasing US abolitionist Frederick Douglass, he told the crowd there was \"no success, no justice, without struggle,\" sarcastically asking if oligarchs would raise workers' wages simply because they decided RMT general secretary Mick Lynch \"made a good case.\"\n\n\"That ain't the way it works,\" he said. \"The only way that justice comes about, the only way working people ever make success, is when we stand up, take them on, and we win. That's what this struggle is about.\"\n\nIt stood in marked contrast to Biden's exhortation that Americans \"have burning inside of each of us the flame of liberty,\" which \"lit our way through abolition, the Civil War, suffrage, the Great Depression, world wars, civil rights.\" As Sanders's allusion to Douglass should remind us, the various milestones Biden name-checked didn't come about because of a metaphorical fire that, by virtue of inherently smoldering within the soul of every American, simply led these events to inevitably happen. They came about through the kinds of radical and usually international mass movements - often deeply polarizing and unpopular ones, to start with - that Sanders proposed in his London speech.\n\nAs far as preelection motivational speeches go, Biden's was leagues ahead of his 2010 effort admonishing his own voters to \"stop whining.\" As far as a vision laying out what ails American democracy and how to fix it, it was incoherent and had little to do with reality - an unfair verdict, maybe, since it's not clear the speech had ambitions to be anything more than a base-rousing, get-out-the-vote barn burner.\n\nOf course, neither of these speeches by itself is likely to have much concrete impact in either the coming midterms or the ongoing British strike actions. But those budding progressive political standard-bearers and left-wing movement leaders genuinely alarmed by today's threats to liberal democracy should pay close attention to Sanders's warnings about oligarchy and his prescriptions for how to fight it.\n\nDemocracy is in peril, both in the United States and around the world. But it's not simply a matter of some bad people doing some bad things; it's the result of an accelerating drift toward oligarchy, born of decades of shortsighted free-market policies its champions misled us were part and parcel of democracy, and of which Trump and his movement are just one by-product. And no amount of verbal condemnation and biyearly votes is going to defeat that system; it will instead have to happen the way all political change has ever come about in the United States and elsewhere: huge numbers of people of all different backgrounds realizing their common interests, organizing, and joining hands to take on entrenched power, in this case across the globe.\n\nAs Sanders told London's striking railworkers, that's what this struggle is about.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

But the call to return to a sensible centrism ignores the real crises we face - falsely equating those who want to solve them with a far right who would make them worse.\n\nPeople gather to hear former president Donald Trump speak as he endorses local candidates at the Mohegan Sun Arena on September 3, 2022, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nJoe Biden's recent attacks on Donald Trump and \"MAGA Republicans\" have caused outrage on the US right. What should surprise us is not the strength of the attack - against what are, after all, blatantly antidemocratic forces - but the departure it represents from the approach mainstream political actors have generally taken: that is, one which has tended to euphemize the far-right threat and draw a false equivalence with the forces resisting it.\n\nThe concept of \"polarization\" is increasingly used in mainstream circles to lament the current state of politics. It is a liberal parallel to right-wing moral panics about cancel culture, \"wokeness\" - or what used to be called \"political correctness gone mad.\" Such moral panics are generally based on ridiculous nonevents that nonetheless seep into public discourse, often with the help of mainstream media. As Nathan Oseroff-Spicer has documented , the \"woke\" panic has spread to strip clubs, the military, corporations, medical education, and the British monarchy, among others. While the liberal center may see the right-wing \"war on woke\" as overblown, they insist on casting it as one side of a duopoly of extremism from both Left and Right. The Right may have indulged extremist and authoritarian tendencies, it argues, but so has the Left. Trumpists and Brexiteers are the flipside of antifa and overzealous woke students.\n\nThe solution, we are patronizingly told, lies in a more reasonable middle ground based on tolerance toward diverging viewpoints. Think, for example, of the proliferation of pieces about left-wing people refusing to kiss reactionaries or the need to \" build bridges \" or \" dine across the divide .\" Is this not what has allowed our societies to progress to this advanced state of democracy? Who was the great philosopher who once said \"there are very fine people on both sides\"?\n\nThis is nothing new, of course. It has long been central to abstract liberalism and has served well to protect against too radical a democratic change that would have challenged interests bound to the status quo. It is thus not altogether surprising to see its recent resurgence under such trite phrases as \"the marketplace of ideas.\" We are told that we should not be scared of ideas we may disagree with: if they are bad but confronted in a public setting, they will be defeated, and reason will prevail. That seems sensible - unless you have paid any attention to political developments in the past few decades and what is really at stake in modern politics.\n\nIt is easy to see how this positioning is appealing and reassuring to those in a comfortable position. As they see it, our freedom is currently under threat by those who argue certain ideas are out of bounds, whether on the Left or on the Right. This soft, grown-up, sensible middle-ground approach to politics could not appear more reasonable. If this status quo happens to benefit those who defend this position - well, that's just an added bonus.\n\nThis is, however, reasonable only if we abstract from what politics is about. This means ignoring how deeply unequal and unjust our societies are and how the situation is in fact worsening. It means being oblivious to the crises now upon us, the urgency of radical solutions, and how uncompromising the forces of reaction really are. It appears increasingly clear that fascism is rising as an answer to the inability of the current system to resolve crises of its own making. In such a context, it is simply criminal for the liberal mainstream to indulge reactionaries and normalize their talking points.\n\nPolarization has been used by academics and commentators to talk about the hollowing out the political center with eyes to Continental Europe, where support for social democratic and center-right parties has collapsed. But in the Anglosphere, the term has been also used to describe a radicalization of both the Left and Right.\n\nHowever, this often means portraying a parallel radicalization on both sides, equating the dangerous authoritarian tendencies of the Right with the alleged radical \"wokeness\" of the Left.  The result is to create a false equivalence between a far-right position and the pushback against it no matter how mild in form (for instance, not wanting to date MAGA Republicans).\n\nAs such, the polarizers include the openly and violently racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, classist, climate-change skeptic - but also those standing squarely on the side of anti-racism, anti-sexism, for LGBTQ rights, and against poverty and inequality as well as for radical change to address the climate crisis.\n\nThis false equivalence has two equally disturbing consequences. First, while it paints both sides in a negative light, equating reactionary politics with their opposition automatically normalizes reactionary politics as if they were a legitimate part of the discussion - we must hear both sides! Think for example of the way the BBC in the UK covered climate change for years, giving almost equal space to deniers as it did scientists, or of the disproportionate coverage far-right politicians and actors and their pet issues receive.\n\nIt is not just ethically and politically wrong to give so much public space to such dangerous ideas but also naive: it presupposes that these actors are actually genuinely interested in discussion rather than simply pushing their ideas into the mainstream. As Nesrine Malik wrote about shows like the BBC's Newsnight :\n\nViews previously consigned to the political fringes made their way into the mainstream via social and traditional media organisations that previously would never have contemplated their airing. The expansion of media outlets meant that it was not only marginalised voices that secured access to the public, but also those with more extreme views.\n\nSecond, it reinforces the current hegemony by pitting it as the only alternative to reactionary politics - while also standing against any real resistance to these latter, let alone demands for radical change in favor of equality and emancipation.\n\nThe way forward. we are told, is through discussion , compassion , and reconciliation. Yet it seems such gestures must always come from the Left or victims of reactionary politics and extend to the Right and perpetrators of such politics, who give nothing in return. It was telling that \"reconciliation\" was central to Joe Biden's first speech as president-elect: \"We are not enemies. We are Americans. . . . This is the time to heal in America.\"\n\nImagine being one of the many people at the sharp end of Trumpian politics (and the Republicans in general, historically) being told that, even though the side that is supposed to be yours has won, you will have to strive for reconciliation with people who have become increasingly emboldened in denying your very humanity. Imagine being asked to spend time, energy, and empathy on the perpetrators of incredible harm and the supporters of everything that is so awful in our societies, while you see very little done to address the many crises that impact all of us (albeit unequally). Those who have been made most vulnerable are told, once more, to be patient.\n\nEven though we can trace such strategies back decades, the mainstreaming of radical positions has accelerated in recent times. It only took a few years after the Unite the Right rally and the murder of anti-fascist activist Heather Heyer for Trump's shocking claim that \" there were very fine people on both sides \" to be lapped up by his liberal opposition. This should not surprise us, as the rise of Trump and the far right more globally was often entirely misread by the mainstream. Remember how Trump's election (but also Brexit) was blamed on the \"white working class.\" This has played nicely into middle-class arrogance and liberal fantasy, even if it did not withstand basic scrutiny as both clearly found their base in wealthier sections of society. Instead, it has legitimized politics which had limited, albeit extremely concerning, appeal, making them look not only far more \"popular\" than they really are but also as somehow the voice of the \"left behind\" despite their deeply elitist bent.\n\nWhere does that leave us? Liberal elites still cling to the fantasy that liberalism is innately a bulwark against the far right and fascism. Yet this belief surely rests on a poor knowledge of the history of liberalism. Indeed, on many occasions, the liberal elite has found it possible and even preferable to side with oppression in defense of its own interests, and many of the rights the liberal elite use to convince the Left to support them were won despite rather than thanks to this tradition. Voting rights, for example, were always limited and precarious and have been further curtailed recently in both the United States and the UK .\n\nThe hegemony liberalism has achieved has fed the belief that only slow progress is possible, and anything beyond this would lead us down an authoritarian path. From this derives the current strength of \"polarization\" discourse. Yet the many crises upon us demand more than incrementalism. With our very survival under threat in the short to medium term, it is becoming clear that radical change is upon us, whether we like it or not. The Right is ready for it and has clear ideas what this could look like: whether it is the technocratic rule of corporations or full-fledged fascism. In this context, sitting on the fence between oppression and resistance is not reasonable but complicity with oppression.\n\nAurelien Mondon is a senior lecturer in politics at the University of Bath.

A careful study breaks down how Trump spoke to economic grievances and personal experiences.\n\nFormer US president Donald Trump greets supporters before offering remarks during an event on August 21, 2024, in Asheboro, North Carolina. (Melissa Sue Gerrits / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn the wake of Teamsters chief Sean O'Brien's remarks at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in July, liberal commentators were aghast at the very idea of a labor leader validating Donald Trump's popularity with American workers.\n\nWriting in the Atlantic , for instance, David Graham describes Trump's working-class appeals as the \"Fakest Populism You Ever Saw,\" while Rolling Stone summed up July's RNC as an attempt to court \"the working class with hollow, populist rhetoric.\"\n\nOn one level, there is obvious truth to these assessments. While Trump can point to a few examples where he helped save jobs and project American workers as president - such as his partial success in saving jobs at an Indiana Carrier plant and his renegotiation of NAFTA to include stronger labor protections - overall his record on labor hardly inspires confidence.\n\nTo take just a few examples: Trump stacked the National Labor Relations Board with anti-union corporate lawyers and failed to deliver on his promise to bring back significant manufacturing jobs to rust belt states like Pennsylvania , Michigan, and Ohio . He threatened to veto the union-friendly PRO Act (which, by the way, none of the MAGA Republicans in the senate, including J. D. Vance, voted for), and he pushed through regressive tax cuts that were massively skewed toward the rich and failed to deliver broader economic benefits for ordinary Americans.\n\nWhile Trump did increase import tariffs with the goal of bringing back American manufacturing jobs, there is no evidence that this policy had a net-positive effect on American jobs.\n\nGiven Trump's less than stellar record on jobs, is his strong support among working-class voters (especially, but far from exclusively, white workers) simply a reflection of his shrewd capacity to get these voters to forget their own economic self-interest by doubling down on appeals to their worst xenophobic, sexist, and racist tendencies? Many liberal commentators are absolutely certain that the answer is yes. Writing in Vox shortly after Trump's surprise 2016 victory, German Lopez boldly asserts \" Trump won because of racial resentment ,\" while NPR's Rich Barlow asserted that \" Racial Resentment, Not Economics, Elected Trump .\"\n\nThere is little doubt that cynical, fear-based appeals to the worst impulses of working-class whites are an important part of the story. But if we look at the content of Trump's appeals to working-class voters, we see that a narrow focus on the darkest aspects of Trump's rhetoric belies consistent and often quite powerful appeals that tap directly into decades of economic dislocation experienced by millions of American workers.\n\nMy analysis of Trump's 2016 campaign speeches and statements reveals that, however disingenuously these messages may have been deployed, he talked a lot about bread-and-butter issues many working-class Americans care deeply about and feel that Democratic and Republican politicians alike have been ignoring for decades.\n\nLet's start with a 30,000-foot view of Trump's rhetoric on the 2016 campaign trail. To get a basic sense of how much Trump focused on different kinds of rhetorical appeals during the 2016 campaign, I collected all available Trump campaign statements and speeches from 2015 until election day on November 8, 2016. I then identified the number of times Trump mentioned key words and phrases to capture different policy bundles and rhetorical styles.\n\nContrary to conventional wisdom, it was jobs and trade - and not immigration or any other divisive social or cultural issue - that had top billing in Trump's 2016 rhetoric. On average, Trump invoked jobs and trade (\"jobs,\" \"manufacturing,\" \"unfair trade deals,\" etc.) 10.3 times per statement or speech, compared to the 8.3 times he invoked immigration (21 percent fewer average mentions) and the less than one time per statement or speech he referenced controversial social issues (excluding immigration), from abortion to trans rights and Black Lives Matter. Indeed, Trump used pro-worker rhetoric nearly three times as often - and anti-economic elite rhetoric more than twice as often - as he brought up controversial social issues.\n\nThere were certainly speeches where candidate Trump focused more on immigration than anything else, and predictably these speeches were littered with hateful vitriol against immigrants. Among many other blatant falsehoods, he lied about immigrants and their children being convicted of terrorist activities in the United States; he falsely claimed Hillary Clinton wanted to spend hundreds of billions resettling Middle Eastern refugees in US cities; and he erroneously claimed that Clinton would implement an \"open borders\" immigration policy.\n\nBut even in these speeches, Trump spent as much time connecting immigration to the economic well-being of American workers as he did demonizing undocumented workers per se, as in a June 2016 speech when he claimed that \"Hillary's Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor and unemployed Americans out of work. She can't claim to care about African American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.\" Regardless of whether Trump's controversial claims were empirically true or false, the point is that his remarks framed immigration in terms of protecting American workers, not in overtly bigoted terms based on the condemnation of an entire class of people.\n\nTrump's discussion of jobs and trade focused on three key themes: mass job loss due to bad trade policies, life getting harder and harder for American workers, and blaming elites for doing nothing to stop the decline of the working class.\n\nFirst, Trump regularly invoked the harm free trade policies have had on American workers. In a series of speeches the month prior to election day in 2016, Trump repeatedly argued that \"we are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\" In an October 16 speech in New Hampshire, for instance, he explained that \"the state of New Hampshire has lost nearly one in three manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. . . . Since China entered the World Trade Organization . . . 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States. That's fifteen factories closing a day, on average. . . . If I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA. If we don't get the deal we want, we'll leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal.\" These remarks could just as easily have come from Bernie Sanders or AFL-CIO head Richard Trumka and are consistent with legitimate research on the negative impacts of trade policies on American manufacturing jobs in the 1990s and 2000s .\n\nNext, Trump focused his remarks time and again on how it's become harder for working Americans to keep their heads above water economically than in the past. In an October 18, 2016, speech in Colorado, he again sounded indistinguishable from Bernie Sanders, exhorting that \"many workers are earning less today than they were eighteen years ago, they are working harder and longer, but making less. Some of them are working two, three jobs but still taking home less money.\" This, again, reflects the actual experiences of millions of working-class Americans since the 1970s who have seen their wages stagnate or fall, their share of America's wealth drop precipitously, and their chances of achieving a higher standard of living than their parents crater.\n\nAfter identifying and empathizing with the economic struggles facing working Americans, Trump consistently put the blame for \"a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs\" squarely on the shoulders of large corporations and \"elites in Washington\":\n\nThe political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs. . . . Just look at what this corrupt establishment has done to our cities like Detroit and Flint, Michigan - and rural towns in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, and across our country. They have stripped these towns bare and raided the wealth for themselves and taken away their jobs.\n\nFinally, Trump not only invoked classic economic populist messages to call out elites for their role in shattering the American dream for so many, but he also raised up the inherent dignity of working Americans and stressed that they needed more voice in Washington. In a speech in Michigan that August, for instance, he told listeners that his campaign was \"going to be a victory for the people, a victory for the wage earner, the factory worker. Remember this, a big, big victory for the factory worker. They haven't had those victories for a long time. A victory for every citizen and for all of the people whose voices have not been heard for many, many years. They're going to be heard again.\"\n\nAnd even though it may sound absurd in the abstract given his superelite class background, Trump managed to identify with workers on a personal level, as in a speech in Eerie, Pennsylvania, on August 12:\n\nI grew up, you know they say, \"You know you're really rich. How come you sort of relate to these [working-class] people?\" Well, my father built houses, and I used to work in these houses and I got to know the electricians. I got to know all these people. I got to know the plumbers, the steamfitters - I got to know them all. And I liked them better than the rich people that I know.\n\nHe reprised this theme a month later in Asheville, North Carolina:\n\nWhile my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people. You are mothers and fathers, soldiers and sailors, carpenters and welders.\n\nTaken together, these appeals make it pretty clear why so many disaffected working- and middle-class voters - who either experienced these economic crises directly or, in the case of many comparatively more affluent Trump voters, saw it all playing out in their communities - would find Trump appealing. Unlike virtually any politician they had ever heard before, Trump not only spoke over and over again to the economic pain felt by so many working-class Americans but also called out the elite culprits by name, something that traditional politicians typically shy away from.\n\nNearly a decade later, progressives once again ignore the economic foundations of Trump's working-class support at their own peril. Yes, of course, it's too late to reach most Trump voters, whose loyalty to the former president has become a core feature of their identities. And yes, of course, shameful appeals meant to activate latent racial and xenophobic proclivities were a key tool in Trump's electoral playbook.\n\nHowever, many past and likely future Trump voters saw something unique in his brash economic populist message and rewarded him for it. Progressives can and must compete for these voters by making the same kinds of economic appeals. But in sharp contrast to President Trump, they must deliver on that rhetoric by implementing policies that will actually help workers rather than the 1 percent.\n\nIt's been eight years since Trump first won the presidency. If progressives want to keep him out of office, they should start by taking his working-class appeal seriously - right now - before it's too late.\n\nJared Abbott is a researcher at the Center for Working-Class Politics and a contributor to Jacobin and Catalyst: A Journal of Theory and Strategy .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

(Andrew Harnik / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe mainstream press is obsessed with Trump's inner circle. In March, James Politi of the Financial Times wrote, \"narrowly ahead in the polls against Joe Biden, Trump now has the backing of a small group of seasoned campaign operatives and a tightly knit entourage of former officials eager to apply his ideas.\" In another article titled, \"How MAGA Republicans plan to make Donald Trump's second term count,\" the Economist observes that \"a professional corps of America First populists are dedicating themselves to ensuring that Trump Two will be disciplined.\" Rather than allow the GOP intelligentsia (who, according to this narrative, constrained Trump's America First agenda) to infiltrate the White House again, a cadre of true believers will unquestioningly execute his plans to shut down the US-Mexico border, unleash political retribution on his enemies, and slap tariffs on all Chinese-made goods.\n\nThere is undeniably something appealing to this analysis. Vaguely Gramscian, such journalism promises insight into the \"organic intellectuals\" behind Trumpism. An America First inner circle also furnishes an easy target against which to organize, for now there will be no \"adult in the room\" to mask Trump's authoritarianism.\n\nThe problem with these stories, however, is that unlike Gramsci they do not follow the trail down to civil society, the hidden abode where we might find the social and institutional bases of the Republican Party. On such accounts, the intellectual movement behind MAGA emerged as if from the ether to undermine the once dominant politics of compromise.\n\nBut the question of why Trump has been able to take hold of the Republican Party only becomes pressing in contrast to the inability of Bernie Sanders, or any other left-wing challenger, to do the same. Absent in the inner circle narrative is a discussion of the enduring strength of the Democrats. In 2008 and 2020, the party was able to hold together the New Deal coalition, relying on networks of association created during the Roosevelt and civil rights eras. So sedimented were these institutions that Sanders, whose program was popular with the multiracial working class, was unable to gain a foothold. The origins of the differences between the Republican and Democratic parties lie in the long history, and transformation, of both since the nineteenth century.\n\nThe great question at the heart of the US Civil War was whether or not slavery would be allowed to expand into the western reaches of what we today call the continental United States. De Bow's Review , an agricultural journal of the American South, summarized the Southern rights position on this question in 1852. For them, westward colonial expansion was the solution to a future demographic apocalypse. If white southern settlers could not transport their human chattel into indigenous lands and northern Mexico, they would be trapped in a land of the enslaved, who, upon vastly overtaking the white population, would eventually rise up in a murderous revolution. The South's choice, then, was clear: \" fight for her slaves or against them .\"\n\nIn contrast, Northern Republicans held that the expansion of slavery into the West would allow planters to monopolize those lands, overrun them with enslaved Africans, and, having effectively closed the door to land ownership, condemn landless whites to a life of wage dependency in the factory. Northern Republican elites thus framed slavery as a demographic threat that must be subordinated to the prerogatives of white settler colonial expansion. The escalating partisan conflict over these two competing demographic futures undermined mass consent for the existing terms of the Union and in so doing precipitated the secession of the South and, as a consequence, the US Civil War in 1861.\n\nAntebellum population politics had its economic sources. Chief among these was mounting wage dependency in the North, which allowed the Republican message to gain traction. A Southern conspiracy to overrun western lands with enslaved Africans played on white workers' fear of a life of endless toil in the factory. Indeed, 1860 was the first census year on record in which wage workers eclipsed those who owned their own farms or workshops. Conversely, the Southern insistence on transporting the enslaved to the western territories was animated by the political economy of cotton planting. Both large and petty slaveholders required ever more land and enslaved people to gain access to credit and money. Hence the antebellum commonplace that planters \"care for nothing but to buy Negroes to plant cotton & raise cotton to buy Negroes.\"\n\nTogether racial slavery, settler colonialism, and growing wage dependency in the industrial North comprised the key elements of the antebellum political economy, but the partisan mobilization of mass white consent was necessary to articulate them together. The promise of land ownership, made possible through settler conquest, rendered poor whites an inadequate source of agricultural labor, a fact that impelled the landed elite toward African slavery .\n\nSubsequently, plantation slavery and industrial capitalism became profitable and interdependent as cotton produced in the South supplied the textile mills of the North. But landless whites endured economic dependency on the promise that wages saved would buy cheap land out West, while the dynamics of cotton planting required ever more land and human chattel.\n\nThus, the agricultural and industrial nodes of antebellum capitalism turned on a delicate political compromise that balanced the demands of capital with those of white settlers. So long as settler colonial expansion for all whites could continue without restriction, that compromise would thrive. Building mass white consent for this compromise was the task of the early American party system, and it did so by keeping public debate trained on narrow economic issues like tariffs and banking, which created class and ethnoreligious coalitions that transcended the divide between free and slave states.\n\nThe Democratic Party cultivated a coalition of artisans, landless white immigrant workers, and small to middling farmers, who in turn were organized into unions, benevolent societies, granges, and churches, especially the Catholic and Lutheran churches. The opposition Whigs were a coalition whose hard core consisted primarily in industrialists, planters, and middle-class professionals, who, in civil society, were members of both mainline and evangelical Protestant churches, as well as the temperance, abolitionist, and nativist movements.\n\nThe issue of slavery, by contrast, could lead to disagreement over which whites had priority over the land. As Martin Van Buren, eighth president of the United States and architect of the Democratic Party, once wrote , \"We must always have party distinctions, and the old ones are the best. . . . If the old ones are suppressed, geographical differences founded on local instincts or what is worse, prejudices between free and slave holding states will inevitably take their place.\"\n\nBut when the party system fell to the Southern rights wing of the Democratic Party and the soon-to-be Republican wing of the opposition Whig Party, each of whom championed the priority of one group of whites to the land over others, the old party coalitions burst asunder: industrialists split from their erstwhile partners in the planter class, yeoman farmers in the South began to suspect the motives of northern workers, and so on. The abolitionist movement further deepened the political crisis. The heroic efforts of Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, and the Underground Railroad to smuggle the enslaved to freedom as well as the armed rebellion of John Brown in 1859 only lent credence to the Southern rights claim that the end of slavery was at hand.\n\nDespite the defeat of the Confederacy and the initial promise of Reconstruction, the postbellum two-party system gave way to a politically repressive \"Gilded Age\" that married monopoly capitalism to Jim Crow segregation. That new racialized political economy remained in place until the Great Depression, when the Democratic Party advance a new agenda called the New Deal.\n\nThe preeminent objective of the New Deal was to keep in place capitalist economic relations and secure profits for business in the face of a working-class rebellion. The latter culminated in the 1933-34 strike wave. In 1933, the total days lost to strikes jumped dramatically from 603,000 to 1,375,000 from January to July, and then to 2,378,000 in August; in 1934, there were 1,856 more strikes involving 1,470,000 workers. Many of these involved violent confrontations with the police and armed forces.\n\nIn the face of this apparent mutiny, the Democratic Party used the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935 to channel working-class militance into a bureaucratized system of union elections and collective bargaining. As this was the first time that workers gained both the right to organize and a mechanism of legal enforcement, organized labor whipped votes inside the labor movement on behalf of President Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal Democratic Party and suppressed support for left-wing challengers.\n\nSimilarly, the Communist Party, which had supplied the most skillful organizers of the strike wave, also threw its support behind the Democrats; in 1944 it refused to run a presidential candidate against Roosevelt lest he lose to the Republican challenger. Once the Democrats had consolidated their power, however, the party repressed these left elements. The American Federation of Labor, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and certain black civil society organizations, among others, became active agents of the Red Scare.\n\nLike the political compromise that hinged on unrestricted access to land in the antebellum period, the success of the New Deal relied on the ceaseless expansion of the American economy. Once again, the paradigmatic audience for this compromise were less affluent whites, who, along with black workers, bore the brunt of mass unemployment during the Great Depression. The mode of capital accumulation following the Great Depression utilized not only extensive state expenditures to mitigate unemployment and facilitate mass consumption (e.g., social security, unemployment insurance, collective bargaining), but also state subsidies and other supports to capital (e.g., infrastructural spending, the Federal Housing Administration, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation) to facilitate accumulation.\n\nWithin this framework , the welfare state created jobs and anti-poverty programs that ensured the smooth functioning of capitalist markets but also incorporated black workers, who were often discriminated against in the labor market, into the Democratic coalition. Accordingly, the New Deal Democratic Party assembled an odd bloc consisting in the white working and middle classes, southern Dixiecrats, and a growing black working class that in the first half of the last century was a critical swing vote in populous northern states.\n\nThe institutions that held these groupings together in civil society were even more varied on ideological lines. Tenant farmer and labor unions, the Communist Party, black and white ethnic civic organizations, the Ku Klux Klan, as well as the Catholic Church, synagogues, and (in the South) evangelical groups all made up the social base of the New Deal coalition. This relegated the Republicans to the role of representing the petit and corporate bourgeoisie, rural whites, and a shrinking but still sizeable number of northern black voters who remained loyal to the party of Lincoln. Today much of the MAGA movement still consists of small-business owners unable to compete against larger firms. During the New Deal era, however, Republicans associated in mainline Protestant churches, black civic and church groups, local chambers of commerce, and large corporate interest groups like the National Association of Manufacturers.\n\nThe Democratic Party was able to balance the needs of its diverse coalition, restrain corporate America, and thus maintain support for the New Deal compromise so long as economic growth and state revenues remained high through the 1960s. However, it became increasingly difficult to do so as growth slowed and revenue shrank. Indeed, the rate of profit fell by over half from a postwar high of 9.2 percent in 1966 to 4.4 percent in 1974.\n\nThese new conditions created zero-sum conflicts, politicized in racial terms, over whether, and if so how, the state should subsidize capital, organized labor, and black workers. Should it raise taxes on private property and corporate profits or through regressive taxes on household income? In the electoral arena, Richard Nixon was among several key actors responsible for a hard right turn inside the Republican Party. Claiming to speak on behalf of a white \"silent majority,\" he campaigned on breaking the New Deal consensus by ending subsidies that he cast as reserved for black workers and in doing so precipitated a mass defection of white union households from the Democrats to the Republicans. So successful was Nixon in 1972 that he carried a majority of the labor vote, according to Gallup .\n\nPressure increased in the early 1970s to choose one of two paths: an authoritarian path that imposed austerity on the working class in service to capital or a path that sought to redistribute wealth downward, creating shared prosperity. The state chose capital and allowed the dramatic expansion of corporate power through deregulation, declining corporate taxation, and the weakening of labor laws - the series of reforms that came to be known as neoliberalism. The justification for this upward redistribution was a race-baiting politics that sought to undermine the New Deal.\n\nUnder Ronald Reagan in particular the state gave capital carte blanche to bust unions and outsource production overseas. Aiding in the growth of public support for this agenda was a working class divided by the politics of racial fear and resentment. The form that the latter took was an assault on the welfare state that immiserated the working class and drove up crime, which both parties responded to cynically by embracing so-called law and order initiatives that intensified policing and mass incarceration. Slow economic growth and the emergence of a zero-sum politics had created a new political consensus. Although the Democrats retained the civil society infrastructure of the New Deal and later civil rights era, both political parties operated in a context in which the only legitimate moves in the game were to drive down wages, reduce tariffs and regulation, and cut welfare.\n\nFrom the Civil War to the New Deal, the far right in the United States has exploited the breakdown of political compromises predicated on continuous expansion, whether territorial or economic. Trumpism is no different.\n\nOur present crisis began in 2008 with the conjuncture of the Great Recession and Barack Obama's unanticipated elevation to the presidency. The 2008 Obama campaign reforged the New Deal coalition of white suburban middle-class voters, organized labor, and racial minorities by building consent for a Keynesian reset in domestic economic policy. The latter was a centerpiece of the 2008 Obama campaign. For example, in El Dorado, Kansas, his white grandparents' ancestral home, Senator Obama said , \"I am standing here today . . . because my grandfather got the chance to go to school on the GI Bill, buy a house through the Federal Housing Authority, and move his family west.\" The American electorate thus had good reason to expect a second liberal golden age. Indeed, Time magazine's postelection cover featured Obama's likeness photoshopped onto a famous image of a smiling Roosevelt with his trademark fedora and cigarette filter. The cover story by Peter Beinart was titled, \"The New New Deal.\"\n\nBut instead of a New Deal, Americans got a bank bailout that dwarfed the administration's proposed public works projects - the kinder, gentler neoliberalism of the erstwhile Clinton administration, which famously worked to take the sting out of post-Fordism but not to resuscitate Fordism itself. This was followed by the disillusionment of progressives and the emergence of the Occupy Movement, whose slogan, the 99 percent, put class inequality back on the table where once class had been a dirty word in American politics. The other side of the political spectrum witnessed the rise of a racist anti-Obama rebellion of Birthers and Tea Party activists (supported in part by reactionary political and economic elites like Donald Trump) that gave voice to the far-right fringe of civil society and eventuated in the Republican takeover of Congress in 2010. Institutional politics was convulsed, with no one actor having the mass consent of the people.\n\nGramsci argued that there were three routes out of such crises: 1) the reabsorption of renegade constituencies by the political establishment; 2) the passage of all renegade groups under a new banner; and 3) Caesarism, the rise of a single charismatic figure not unlike Gramsci's own nemesis, Benito Mussolini. There appear to be two routes at present, with no one clear pathway out of the crisis. The least likely of Gramsci's three routes is a unifying progressive force, capable of leading the renegade factions under a new banner.\n\nThe US labor movement is resurgent, but its ties to the Democratic Party, as I have argued, are strong and will not give way to a politically independent force in the near term. Moreover, the most active mass movement in America and abroad is the Palestine solidarity movement, and it is too soon to tell whether it can serve as the vanguard of a new left.\n\nJoe Biden, having already clinched the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination, represents the best chance for the establishment to reabsorb the foregoing disaffected groups into the Democratic Party. This he has done, like Obama before him, by combining the traditional New Deal coalition of white middle-class suburbanites, union households, and the African American community with feminist, environmental, and LGBTQ groups. That same coalition has proven resilient enough to deny Sanders the Democratic nomination twice on the one hand (despite the fact that when polled many of these constituents supported the Sanders program), and defeat the Republicans in the most recent presidential and congressional midterm elections on the other.\n\nThe Democratic Party's enduring hold on labor unions and black voters is a case in point. In 2016, no major national labor union, with the possible exception of the Communication Workers of America (CWA) and its seven hundred thousand members, endorsed Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries. Most were local unions with a handful of state bodies, many of them from Sanders's home state of Vermont. By 2020, the number of unions in the Sanders coalition shrunk further; its largest endorsement came from the American Postal Workers Union with a membership of two hundred thousand. The rest of organized labor, including the CWA , threw its support behind Biden.\n\nSanders suffered a similar fate with black Democrats. In the 2020 South Carolina primary, for example, the Sanders campaign ran up against the machinery of Democratic congressman and majority whip James Clyburn. More than once, Clyburn said that Sanders's proposal for free higher education was not feasible and misleadingly suggested that it might hurt black institutions of higher learning. In a kind of \"folksy red-baiting\" that recalls the complicity of certain black organizations during the New Deal, Clyburn said, \"I do not believe there are any free lunches. And certainly there's not going to be any free education.\" Clyburn's relationships with black civil society, which became entrenched over a lifetime of patronage politics that dealt in everything from jobs and scholarships to infrastructural improvements, worked to deny Sanders the votes of party members in South Carolina.\n\nWhat we have in Donald Trump is a Caesar, who now leads the disaffected fractions of the racist anti-Obama rebellion. His message is clear: that the political and economic system takes away the precarious white majority's once unchallenged access to power and privilege and hands it over to undeserving immigrants, black people, howling feminists, and sexual perverts.\n\nTrump's most loyal constituency is the evangelical right, particularly after the defeat of Roe v. Wade . Arguably the least reliable sector of support is the Republican establishment, which continues to have close links to the conservative press (minus Fox News), think tanks, and Wall Street. Finally, there is a small white minority in the more racially conservative sectors of the US labor movement, especially among the police, who have cast their ballots for Donald Trump. For example, in 2020 the Fraternal Order of Police , the largest union of law enforcement officers in the United States, endorsed Trump for president.\n\nThe Republican Party is far from a \"zombie\" organization utterly bereft of institutional ties to civil society and running only on the fumes of the leader's cult of personality, but neither does it have the constancy of the Democratic Party's hold over the institutionalized left. The Democrats' enduring ties to civil society comprise the ceiling or limit of Trump's support in the American electorate and at the same time represent the barriers that any left-wing challenge would have to overcome to win the presidency.\n\nTrumpism is therefore a product of the twin failures of neoliberalism and the New New Deal. This is not only a structural failing in capitalism's capacity to provide for social needs, but also a failing on the part of political actors to deliver what they promise to less affluent white voters. To these latter constituents, Trump represents a way to get at a system that is far beyond their reach. As the former president himself said in March of 2023, \"I am your justice . . . I am your retribution.\" Among the base, Trump's recent felony conviction in the New York hush money trial will likely only deepen support . His success will be limited by the extent to which the Democratic Party can motivate its historic bloc.\n\nAmerica's complicity in Israel's brutal campaign against Gaza together with ongoing fears about economic insecurity may further fragment the multiracial coalition that the Democrats have long taken for granted. Absent any serious left challenger, these disaffected voters may see no other option but to stay home on election day. The irony is that it is because the center can hold, that the Right might win.\n\nCedric de Leon is Professor of Sociology and Labor Studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

As Pierre Poilievre and Doug Ford embrace nationalistic rhetoric, they're also hedging their bets to keep trade and defense ties intact.\n\nCanadian Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre speaks during a news conference on Parliament Hill on December 16, 2024, in Ottawa. (Dave Chan / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIt's a complicated time to be a certain kind of conservative in Canada. For years, many Canadian right wingers have considered themselves supporters of Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans. Ontario premier Doug Ford even referred to himself as an \" unwavering \" supporter of Trump. This dynamic has always been tricky to navigate, as Canadian identity - to the extent it exists - is deeply bound up with being \"not American\" while harboring an insecure yearning to be noticed by the United States.\n\nBut now, as Trump talks of annexing Canada with \"economic force\" and making it the fifty-first state - just as Canadians prepare for a probable spring election, quite a time to get noticed - the institutional right north of the forty-ninth parallel is walking a much finer line.\n\nMainstream conservative politicians have been quick to dismiss Trump's remarks about making Canada a California North. Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre stated emphatically on X/Twitter that \"Canada will never be the 51st state. Period. We are a great and independent country.\" He also says he'll \"put Canada first\" - whatever that means.\n\nMeanwhile, Doug Ford, that unwavering Trumper, has threatened to cut off energy exports from Ontario to the US if Trump goes ahead with his tariff threat. Ford, too, says Canada \"isn't for sale.\"\n\nWhile conservatives drape themselves in the flag and stand up for Canada's sovereignty, they're also playing a second-order game, recognizing that Canada can't afford to decouple all that much from the United States. That means that whatever tough talk and familiar tones of Tory nationalism we may hear, things are more complicated than the sloganeering.\n\nWhile Ford threatens to cut off energy exports, he's also proposing an energy alliance between the US and Canada as part of a unity effort. He calls it - quite seriously - \"Fortress Am-Can,\" with America no doubt carefully placed ahead of Canada in the portmanteau. Ford pitches this as a strategic partnership, benefiting both nations, \"powered by Am-Can energy of every type that's produced, consumed and creates jobs in every region of both countries.\" Ford characterizes the alliance as a way to strengthen Canada and the United States' position against global rivals, particularly China.\n\nTrump, for his part, appears to see little need for cooperation. \"We don't need their fuel, we don't need their energy, we don't need their oil and gas - we don't need anything that they have.\" Viewing trade through a zero-sum, mercantilist lens, Trump sees Canada's trade surplus as a subsidy from the US. In a press conference, Trump claimed to have told Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that if Canada can't exist without that surplus, it should become the fifty-first state.\n\nIronically, some Canadians might argue this has been the de facto case for decades, particularly since the free-trade agreements of the 1980s, when Canada was often described as a \"branch plant\" of the United States.\n\nPoilievre is playing his own subtle game managing conservative support for Trump, Canada's dependence on the US, and his own need to evoke nationalist fervor ahead of the upcoming election. His strategy is to stand up for Canada by blaming Trudeau and his government for making Canada weak and opening it up to threats from Trump. Instead, Poilievre plans on making Canada strong and secure, he says. Naturally.\n\nPoilievre's statement on X/Twitter asserted that, as prime minister, he \"will rebuild our military and take back control of the border to secure both Canada and the US. We will take back control of our Arctic to keep Russia and China out.\" He emphasized Canadian cooperation with the United States, reminding readers that Canada joined the fight against al-Qaeda, traded energy \"well below market prices,\" and bought \"hundreds of billions of dollars of American goods.\"\n\nPoilievre also claimed that the Liberals and Canada's left-leaning New Democratic Party, which he lumps together as one and the same, were \"weak and pathetic\" and \"failed to make these obvious points\" to the US. That's untrue. Indeed, the Liberals have pursued this strategy for years. And it more or less worked the last time around with Trump. But this time seems set to play out differently, with Trump's trade deficit and tariff obsession cranked way up.\n\nIn his posts and press conferences, Poilievre has occasionally tipped his hand, just as Ford did with his groveling energy plan. The Conservative solution to managing the awkwardness of standing up for Canadian sovereignty against Trump without dooming the country is to talk a big game but ultimately roll over and show the US Canada's belly.\n\nConservatives are unlikely to look to Beijing or elsewhere to increase diversification in trade - or, especially, security - arrangements. Displays of national pride and defiance may be politically necessary, but they are largely ceremonial. In the end, the playbook is the same no matter who governs: emphasize deep economic ties, shared military goals, and mutual interests, then negotiate the best deal possible.\n\nIn this sense, a Conservative government under Poilievre wouldn't be much different than the Liberals. Without a willingness to rethink the deeply integrated relationship with the US - resulting from a free-trade agreement that sends most Canadian exports south and a shared defense framework - the cycle of dependency and concession will continue.\n\nWhat might change, however, is the tone of Canadian conservative populism. Recently steeped in cross-border right-wing comradery, it may evolve into a distinct form of domestic nationalism, where the border takes precedence over ideological alignment.\n\nGroup psychology being what it is, threats to Canada from the US will no doubt shift allegiances for some, triggering an in-group impulse to fall back on nationalist sentiments. This will almost certainly revive the Canadian tradition of defining the country as, first and foremost, not America . That will include Conservatives who, when push comes to shove, will affirm their loyalty to the maple leaf over the stars and stripes. They'll remain conservatives; they'll just make it clear they prefer a distinctly Canadian variety over any notions of joining the United States.\n\nPoilievre and every other federal politician with plans to succeed in Canadian politics will keep talking a big game against the threat of American imperial interests, economic or otherwise, but, in the end, will happily turn around and deal. This is a strategy that could well include giveaways on trade, border security, and defense to meet Trump's demands.\n\nThe thing for Canadians to watch in the coming months isn't rhetoric, but policy. Politicians will say what they have to say to project an image they expect will play well with their supporters and, more broadly, the country. But that doesn't mean they won't make concessions to remain in power and preserve Canada's relationship with the United States. In that sense, the current crisis is a variation on a theme that goes back centuries and is, indeed, very Canadian.\n\nDavid Moscrop is a writer and political commentator.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn Thursday, Hakeem Jeffries - a newly significant leader in the Democratic Party, now that, with Nancy Pelosi's impending retirement, he's the House Minority Leader and the leader of the House Democratic Caucus - gave a master class in being a craven tool.\n\nWhen House Republicans brought an absurd resolution condemning the \"crimes\" of socialism, just after stripping Minnesota representative Ilhan Omar of her committee positions, Jeffries was quick to call bullshit, dubbing it - repetitively though pointedly - a \"fake, phony, and fraudulent\" resolution. Jeffries said the House resolution gave \"cover\" for \"MAGA Republicans to try to undermine an agenda that is designed to lift up the health, safety, and well-being of the American people.\"\n\nThanks for your support, Hakeem. We'd describe socialism the same way.\n\nJeffries pointed out that historically, Republicans have used the word \"socialism\" to try to undermine support for popular government programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, public education, Obamacare, and even the Obama-era stimulus bill. His indignation was palpable over what he called a \"so-called resolution.\"\n\nYet after this rousing speech, Hakeem Jeffries voted for the Republicans' resolution.\n\nSo did Nancy Pelosi. Yea votes also include other members of centrist leadership, including Adam Schiff, who we've written about before , and Jim Clyburn, notorious opponent of Bernie Sanders and Nina Turner. Rising \"progressive\" icon Ro Khanna, whose Silicon Valley constituents badly need expropriation, also voted yes.\n\nThe resolution sweepingly equates every socialist leader from Hugo Chavez to Joseph Stalin and ignores most of socialist history and present-day experience. After a name-check of socialist dictators, the resolution invokes America founding fathers condemning what Republicans and Democrats probably agree is the more pressing evil: redistribution of wealth.\n\nTo that end, the resolution quotes from Thomas Jefferson on the sacrosanct nature of wealth, even inherited wealth:\n\nTo take from one, because it is thought that his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to every one of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it.\n\nThis is especially rich coming from someone whose wealth consisted of actual human beings. Jefferson held more than six hundred people as slaves during his lifetime, and only freed ten.\n\nThe founding fathers had no experience of twentieth-century authoritarianism. Their evocation here plays a revealing role: this resolution isn't about abusive autocrats, but about sending a message that any kind of redistribution is dangerous and un-American, at a time when socialist ideas - ranging from increasing taxes on the rich to worker ownership of the means of production - are more popular than ever. Please note that these Republicans and Democrats are evoking ardent slaveholders' opposition to redistribution and collectivity, to silence a growing movement for social and workplace democracy.\n\nExplaining why she brought the resolution, Representative Maria Elvira Salazar said on the House floor that young people were \"falling for\" socialism, noting with alarm that 40 percent of millennials thought the Communist Manifesto was a better declaration of freedom and equality than the Declaration of Independence.\n\nThose millennials are correct, of course: the Communist Manifesto and the Declaration of Independence are both visionary documents, but Marx's manifesto is far more specific about what freedom and equality is and how it is achieved.\n\nSalazar noted that 40 percent \"of all Americans, not only the youth\" believe that \"socialism is good\" (we couldn't agree more with this 40 percent), and that 33 percent said they were likely to support a member of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) for office.\n\nIf Jeffries truly didn't agree with the Republicans' McCarthyite statement of plutocratic entitlement, he could have done much more than say so: he could have voted no. That he didn't shows yet again that the Democratic leadership is willing to side with the Republicans against the Left, something we've seen again and again (recall how New York State Democratic chair Jay Jacobs put more energy into defeating India Walton , a socialist running for mayor of Buffalo, than in helping New York Democrats beat Republicans in congressional races, choices that have cost the Democrats the House majority and are the reason Jeffries is a Minority rather than a Majority leader today\n\nWhile the behavior of these senior Democratic leaders was depraved, there's some good news here. Eighty-six House Democrats voted against the resolution. It's hard to convey to those who didn't grow up during the Cold War what a huge advance in our political culture this represents: even a decade ago, many more of these Democrats would have supported this resolution.\n\nThe reasoning of those members who opposed the resolution was heartening. Berniecrat Pramila Jayapal noted that the Republicans are fearmongering about socialism in order to attack popular entitlement programs, and distract Americans interested in emulating popular models of social democracy like those in Nordic countries. Even some of the liberals less sympathetic to socialism recognized the Republican resolution for what it was: a craven attempt to tar the entire public sector with the blood of Pol Pot's victims.\n\nThe most encouraging dimension of the whole weird episode, however, is what it demonstrated: the Republicans and centrist Democrats know that socialism has traction right now. This resolution was really about self-identified democratic socialists like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Cori Bush, and Jamaal Bowman, as well as the modest but growing power of DSA in New York and elsewhere. Red-baiting is of course always despicable, but red scares are much more likely when the reds are doing something scary. At present, socialists are building power, winning some victories, and as Salazar noted, persuading many Americans to give their ideas a try. That scares the Right - and the centrist Democrats in thrall to the business elite that funds their campaigns.\n\nLiza Featherstone is a columnist for Jacobin , a freelance journalist, and the author of Selling Women Short: The Landmark Battle for Workers' Rights at Wal-Mart .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Jamie Raskin is set to be the top Democrat resisting Donald Trump and defending democracy on a key committee - less than a year after handing him expanded spying powers.\n\nRepresentative Jamie Raskin questions US Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle during a House Oversight Committee hearing examining potential security failures surrounding the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, July 22, 2024. (Chris Kleponis / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nTo hear him tell it, Rep. Jamie Raskin is running to be the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee to protect democracy.\n\n\"We are in the fight of our lives. The stakes have gone up since the election,\" he wrote to his fellow Democrats this week. With Donald Trump in the White House, he and House Democrats as a whole were duty bound to \"defend our nation against tyranny\" and to \"stand in the breach to defend the principles and institutions of constitutional democracy.\"\n\n\"We dare not fail,\" he warned.\n\nThe only problem is, they already did - and they did so in large part thanks to Raskin himself, a longtime progressive legislator who earlier this year cast the crucial vote that killed a surveillance reform and handed the incoming president the exact kind of tyrannical powers he now says he will devote himself to resisting.\n\nThe April 2024 episode concerned a set of proposed reforms to the \"backdoor search\" loophole in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) law that has allowed agencies like the National Security Agency (NSA) and the FBI to read Americans' private messages for years without the constitutionally required nuisance of getting a warrant. Privacy and civil liberties advocates spent more than a decade trying to get rid of the wildly abused provision, which lets government agencies get away with this intrusion as long as they do it with communications that were \"incidentally\" collected - meaning, that were gathered and stored after an American talked to a foreigner, whom US agencies can freely spy on without a warrant.\n\nThis past April provided an ideal chance to finally end this practice. Trump's outrage at the FBI surveillance of his 2016 presidential campaign produced an unlikely coalition of progressives and MAGA Republicans, who united to bring forward a bipartisan amendment ending the loophole. As a result, the votes were there to finally overcome entrenched opposition to the reform.\n\nExcept the House was deadlocked, 212-212 .\n\nIn other words, just one vote could have made the difference. Rep. Jerrold Nadler - the current ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, who Raskin was set to challenge until Nadler unexpectedly stepped down and endorsed his younger colleague yesterday - had voted for it. But Raskin, who is now the front-runner to replace him, voted against it.\n\n\"This was a particularly important instance where standing up would have been especially important, and he failed to do so,\" says Alex Marthews, chair of Restore the Fourth, one member of the coalition of civil liberties organizations that worked on the reform:\n\nHe therefore bears part of the responsibility for the renewal of warrantless surveillance powers and their expansion in time for the reelection of President Trump. Since he is running for ranking member, that is a part of his record that people should legitimately ask him about.\n\nIt's not clear why Raskin, who had consistently voted for the reform in previous years, caved when it mattered most. Raskin's office didn't explain or offer any comment when Jacobin reached out to ask. It was reported at the time that both the Biden White House and spy agencies themselves had lobbied lawmakers to vote against it - ironic, given the ubiquitous warnings from the president about how Trump was \"determined to destroy democracy\" if he won later that year.\n\nWhat is clear is the degree to which Raskin's vote has imperiled the very activists and social movements that Trump and others have vowed to go after once in power.\n\nWired reported that US House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence chair Mike Turner, known as a mouthpiece for the intelligence establishment, pointed to pro-Palestinian protesters in a briefing last year as an example of why the backdoor search loophole shouldn't be eliminated. In other words, such protesters were a potential security threat connected to terrorists and needed to be spied on.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump and his team have explicit plans to target and repress both the pro-Palestinian movement and progressive activists more generally. To run the FBI, which routinely abuses this loophole, the president-elect has nominated Kash Patel, a loyalist who has vowed to go after journalists, lawyers, and judges he views as Trump's enemies, and who believes Trump's political opponents in the Democratic Party and elsewhere have been installed and are controlled by foreign enemies.\n\nThe fact that Raskin allowed the warrantless surveillance loophole to survive will make it much easier for both the incoming Trump administration and the national security establishment that views activist movements with suspicion to target dissenters. Among those whose communications the FBI has spied on using this loophole are journalists, mosques, scores of George Floyd protesters, thousands of campaign donors, and a college professor, as well as a range of current and former government officials, including a senator, congressman, state senator, and state court judge.\n\nBear in mind that the Heritage Foundation - the right-wing think tank that serves as the policy shop for Republican presidencies and is behind Trump's Project 2025 agenda - has proposed investigating, publicly shaming, and otherwise going after pro-Palestinian activists and progressive members of Congress. But progressive causes aren't the only ones that might suffer either: a number of those who the FBI surveilled without a warrant in the past were protesters arrested on January 6.\n\n\"It is reassuring for any representative to say they want to serve as a check on abuses of executive power,\" says Marthews. \"But it would be much more reassuring if Raskin had showed he was willing to check abuses of executive power when the president was a Democrat.\"\n\nThis wasn't the only questionable vote Raskin took that day. Despite warning that Trump was \"in full-blown autocratic, dictatorial mode at this point,\" Raskin helped to massively expand the spying powers at his disposal if he won, by voting for the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act. (Nadler and fifty-eight other Democrats, including many progressives, had voted against it.)\n\nOne especially shocking provision of the law, added by Turner, gave the government the power to compel a range of businesses and other third parties, whether cleaners or delivery drivers, to spy on Americans on its behalf. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, at least 23 percent of its fifty-six supposed reforms \"either codify existing practices and procedures . . . or actively weaken existing protections.\"\n\nIn many ways, Raskin should be an ideal pick for the Judiciary spot: he's an influential progressive stalwart who has long cultivated close ties to civil liberties and privacy advocates. Yet when it mattered most and could have actually made a difference, he failed at the task he's now using to justify his ascent to a powerful position on an important committee. The question is, will that be a concern for a Democratic caucus that looks set to overwhelmingly approve him?\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

(Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\n\"This is the United States of America. There's nothing, simply nothing, we cannot do if we do it together.\"\n\nIt's a line you've heard countless times if you've followed Joe Biden's most recent presidential efforts starting in 2019, and it pops up once more in the commercial Biden's camp released today for his official reelection launch. \"Let's finish the job!\" the ad implores. What job? You'd be hard-pressed to find out by watching the ad.\n\nSure, there's talk of \"MAGA extremists\" trying to cut Social Security, attacking reproductive rights, banning books, discriminating against LGBTQ people, and undermining voting rights. The country is still in the middle of a \"battle for the soul of America,\" we're told.\n\nUnfortunately, Biden and the Democrats haven't made a whole lot of progress on these issues. Biden rejected his own party's push to eliminate the debt ceiling last year, which would have neutralized the current hostage scenario that has given Republicans the leverage to try and slash Social Security. Other than use it as get-out-the-vote fodder, Democrats have done little on the federal level to protect reproductive rights, while Biden reportedly won't take on the Supreme Court that's driving this assault because he's worried about hurting its public standing. The Democratic voting-rights bill went nowhere - the president quickly moved on after the party refused to eliminate the filibuster, and following mounting frustration from voting rights activists who found a White House distinctly uninterested in the issue. It's hard to know how to take a measure of the country's \"soul,\" but the fact that 71 percent of Americans think the country is going in the wrong direction surely isn't a sign of good health.\n\nMore importantly, there's no indication of what Biden and his party plan to do about any of this. Outlining an ambitious, inspiring vision of his presidency if reelected, and giving some sense of his legislative priorities in term two - reviving the very popular Build Back Better bill that died two years ago and formed the backbone of his presidential agenda, for instance, or vowing to expand Social Security benefits - might give despondent, checked-out Americans some reason or even, dare I say it, enthusiasm to come out to vote for Biden and his party next year, to give them the congressional seats they need to finally get this program over the line. But there's no such call to action. Vote for Biden because, somehow, he'll finish the job, whatever it is.\n\nBiden's reelection pitch is, in short, a retread of his September speech about the threat to democracy from \"MAGA Republicans,\" which itself was a retread of the stale, uninspiring Democratic campaign approach of the past decades: don't promise to do anything positive for people, just point to how scary the other guys are.\n\nThere's little point these days in making electoral predictions, if there ever was . Our political era is virtually defined by its unpredictability. And the midterm results showed that a strategy of pure fearmongering about the horribleness of the opposition still has some juice in the tank.\n\nBut it's also important to recognize, for the Biden campaign if no one else, that the president will be running in a vastly different environment from 2020, one that make his reelection - even against today's Republican Party - far from assured.\n\nBiden's not going to have a problem securing the Democratic nomination, chiefly because of the party's characteristically antidemocratic behind-the-scenes maneuvering. They've moved the South Carolina primary to the very first election on the schedule - as great for Biden as it is terrible for the party - and have nixed any presidential debates , protecting the president from the handful of insurgents who have raised their hand to run against him, and forestalling any open discussion about the party's priorities and future direction.\n\nBut the general election campaign is not the primary, and Biden won't have the benefit of Democratic functionaries and various loyalists putting their thumbs on the scales to help him win. And he'll need it. Doubts about Biden's fitness, which is distinct from his age, are not unreasonable. As of January this year, Biden has spent all or part of 197 days of his presidency away from the White House in Delaware, at his home or his beach property, along with more than sixty days at Camp David. By October last year, when this number was smaller, it constituted more than a quarter of his entire presidency, and far outpaced Donald Trump, who had been frequently criticized by liberals for skipping out of the White House. It's why party strategists have questioned if the president is up to the rigor of a presidential campaign.\n\nBuilding on his 2020 strategy, Biden has spent the past three years steadfastly avoiding the press . Biden often skips the traditional practice of holding joint press conferences with world leaders, and has sat down for interviews only fifty-four times in his first two years - roughly a quarter of the amount Trump did, and about half of what even Ronald Reagan managed. He averages fewer news conferences per year than any president since Calvin Coolidge, apart from Reagan and Richard Nixon. He's taken the unprecedented step of refusing to sit down for an on-the-record interview with the New York Times , Washington Post , and Wall Street Journal . As the Times noted, he's \"taken steps to reduce opportunities for journalists to question him in forums where he can offer unscripted answers and they can follow up.\"\n\nThis worked in 2020, when the pandemic gave the president a ready-made excuse to disappear for days and avoid public appearances . And while the demands of the presidency might offer another such reason, the wisdom of doing so is an open question, given the importance to a campaign of traveling the country and appearing in front of voters.\n\nNor will Biden have the unique historical conditions that his own advisers privately acknowledged were the only reason he won three years ago. COVID may have been \"the best thing that ever happened to him,\" as adviser Anita Dunn remarked at the time, but the president himself and much of the country now believe that \"the pandemic is over.\" Exit polls from 2020 showed Biden voters were driven in large part and even mostly by opposition to Trump, including because of his disastrous pandemic response, but the president no longer has an unpopular incumbent to run against - in fact, the unpopular incumbent is himself.\n\nBiden's approval ratings are desperately low right now, and fell still further - among GOP voters, no less - after he recently shifted to the right. Recent polling indicates 70 percent of Americans don't want Biden to run again. (A majority also don't want Trump to run again, but a smaller majority of 60 percent). On top of this, with his domestic agenda stalled, Biden has - partly thanks to historical accident, but also partly thanks to his own deliberate choices - presided over a dramatic shrinkage of the US welfare state, one that had largely been expanded, again largely as a result of historical accident, under his right-wing predecessor.\n\nThat shrinkage is all the worse for the fact that it's come amid deteriorating economic conditions. Nearly a quarter of US adults are food insecure, roughly five points higher than the already-staggering rate recorded last year. More than a third say it's been \"somewhat\" or \"very\" difficult to pay their bills, a jump of 25 percent from the year previous. The latest Census Bureau report puts nearly 38 million people , or 11.6 percent of the population, living in poverty as of January 2021, a number that's almost certainly grown since various forms of pandemic aid that existed then have faded away. US life expectancy has dropped for the second year in a row. And a recession is being widely predicted in the next year, exactly the kind of pandemic-like shock that could derail a presidency.\n\nPast presidents have pulled through in similarly tough spots. And Trump, who looks increasingly likely to be the GOP nominee, is a deeply polarizing, chaotic, and, for the Democratic base, energizing opponent, who could easily engineer another defeat for himself and his party - arguably the most likely to do so out of any of the other possible Republican choices, even.\n\nBut these are not conditions that anyone would want to be running in. And other than once more telling everyone how bad the alternative would be, there seems to be no impetus inside the gathering Biden campaign to so much as pretend , as they successfully did the first time, that they will fight for specific policies to improve people's lives, like a public health-insurance option or a $15 minimum wage - possibly because they don't want to be on the hook again for a bunch of promises they have no intention of carrying out.\n\nOne thing's for sure: it's going to be a bleak nineteen months.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

      "text": "MAGA Republicans are not behaving like the 'loyal opposition'\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nThere's little evidence that GOP elected officials will ever accept that former President Donald Trump is in the wrong. When he visited Congress on Thursday, he was feted like a returning hero just a few years after having encouraged a mob to run rampant against many of those present. His criminal conviction has likewise prompted no bouts of introspection or calls for Trump to drop out; instead, Republicans have dug in their heels and bashed the justice system.\n\nA few hours before his Thursday visit to Capitol Hill, a little over half of the Senate GOP sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland to complain yet again about that conviction. Spearheaded by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., the one-page letter is filled with Republican talking points without a shred of real evidence. But it was the final line of the letter that stands out: \"We condemn this show trial,\" the senators wrote, \"not just because it marks the attempt to imprison a leader of the loyal opposition, but because it threatens the existence of due process of law, without which a constitutional republic dedicated to individual liberty is not possible.\"\n\nWhat I take issue with is the idea that Trump leads a \"loyal opposition.\"\n\nLeave aside for a moment that Trump absolutely received due process in this case: He had ample opportunity to defend himself and was convicted by a jury of his peers, and neither Garland nor President Joe Biden had anything to do with the case. What I take issue with is the idea that Trump leads a \"loyal opposition.\" Under no definition of the term could that be considered true, not when he and the MAGA movement are so overtly dedicated to undermining American democracy.\n\nAt its root, democracy requires everyone involved to be invested in its outcomes. All parties who take part in an election must be willing to accept the results of an election if the system is to work at all. Within that structure, there must likewise be an ability for the minority to criticize the majority's plans and policies without fear of retribution. In doing so, the minority hopes to win over enough support that the government changes hands peacefully in the next election.\n\nIn this way, democracy differs sharply from other forms of governance where any opposition to the ruling order could be deemed treasonous. After all, if the only way to remove a government is through revolt, its leaders will work hard to ensure that theirs are the only ideas that can circulate. We see this in tyrannies stretching back into antiquity and in modern totalitarian states where dissent is stifled through whatever means possible.\n\nThe representative democratic models that developed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries offered an alternative to autocracy that provided a much less violent method of shifting a country's direction. In the United Kingdom, the House of Commons became the primary administrator of authority, supplanting the direct rule of the crown. But still, on paper at least, Parliament to this day derives its authority from King Charles III, in essence governing on his behalf in roles that have been granted through the British people via elections.\n\nIt was in the U.K. that the term the \"loyal opposition\" was first used, born out of the rise of formal political parties (the Conservatives and the Whigs) that could trade control of the government based on the will of the voters. The word \"loyal\" reflected the assumption that no matter how much the parties disagreed, they were still loyal to king and country - vastly reducing the risk of beheadings when administrations turned over.\n\nMeanwhile, in the U.S., the idea of loyalty to the monarchy was supplanted by an adherence to the Constitution and the democratic processes it outlined. Even as polarization increased the ideological gap between the two main parties, the bedrock principle remained that elections' results must be respected and if a party loses an election, it will yield power, confident in its ability to try again next time.\n\nAs you may have determined by now, none of this applies to Trump. Or, rather, Trump has made clear that he rejects the social contract that makes such an arrangement possible. When he was defeated in 2020, he falsely claimed that Democrats utilized mass election fraud to block him from office. He used that lie to attempt to overturn the election results; that campaign ended with a mob storming the U.S. Capitol to prevent Congress' certification of Biden's victory.\n\nBy themselves, Trump's rants would mean nothing if not for his ability to bring others on board with his lies and the rejection of democratic norms and processes.\n\nThose schemes earned him a federal indictment for his efforts nationally and state-level charges for his alleged schemes to do the same in Georgia. Accordingly, Trump's claim that he is merely a humble politician suffering persecution for being Biden's political opponent is in no way true. Nor is his insistence that Democrats will have somehow cheated if he loses again in November. Despite that, he's using both as a dual pretext: to pre-emptively refuse to accept the results if he loses, and to target his opponents with phony investigations and the full force of federal law enforcement if he wins.\n\nBy themselves, Trump's rants would mean nothing if not for his ability to bring others on board with his lies and the rejection of democratic norms and processes. A 2021 poll found that while most Democrats see Republicans as political opponents, as would befit a \"loyal opposition,\" most Republicans see Democrats as enemies. This dark juxtaposition speaks to why the GOP has been so willing to embrace Trump's revenge-driven rhetoric .\n\nUnder Trump's watch, the Republican National Committee is building out infrastructure to undercut confidence in the 2024 election. Russell Vought, the chief architect of the MAGA movement's policies , has said that we \"are living in a post-Constitutional time\" and argued for a purge of any federal employees who won't unquestioningly carry out Trump's wishes. Multiple GOP senators who signed on to Paul's letter have refused to say whether they're willing to accept the results of this fall's election. Many of their counterparts in the House continue to press the false claim that Trump won in 2020; several of them remain in their seats despite being an integral part of his plotting.\n\nI would ask these Republicans who have been so willing to follow Trump in his continued rampage against the Constitution and the foundations of our democracy: Where exactly does \"loyalty\" come into play here?\n\nHayes Brown is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily, where he helps frame the news of the day for readers.

      "text": "Dear Chuck Schumer, the 'old' Republican Party is never coming back\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nThis summer will mark 10 years since Donald Trump first descended the escalator at Trump Tower to announce his candidacy for president of the United States.\n\nNow, two months into his second term, it's becoming painfully clear that many of the people best positioned to push back against his agenda still haven't accepted how much the world has changed.\n\nThe latest example came from Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer in \"Mad House,\" an upcoming book from Annie Karni and Luke Broadwater of The New York Times, which revealed a 2023 exchange in which he said Trump was an aberration.\n\n\"Here's my hope ... after this election, when the Republican Party expels the turd of Donald Trump, it will go back to being the old Republican Party,\" he said, according to the book.\n\nThere are a lot of things wrong with this quote other than its needlessly vivid imagery.\n\nI remember the \"old\" Republican Party well. I was its chairman in 2009 shortly after the transformative victory of President Barack Obama and Democratic dominance in both chambers of Congress. The late Sen. John McCain had been the party's nominee in 2008 and then-Gov. Mitt Romney would be its nominee in the next cycle.\n\nThese former figureheads of the party are now considered by Trump's acolytes as RINOs, Republicans in Name Only. MAGA Republicans fantasize about McCain roasting in hell . Conservative heavy-hitters like Matt Schlapp say Romney's physical safety would be jeopardized if he so much as attended the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nThe \"old\" Republican Party is gone. It sold its soul to Trump in return for two presidencies and three Supreme Court seats.\n\nOne by one, the Republicans who stood up to Trump in the beginning have either left politics or capitulated, often in humiliating fashion.\n\nAfter Trump insulted his wife's appearance and lied about his father during the 2016 presidential primary, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could have continued calling Trump out as a \" sniveling coward .\" Instead, he became one of his sniveling supporters.\n\nWhen Trump dragged him into a stomach-turning exchange about genital size on a national debate stage, then-Sen. Marco Rubio could have insisted to Republican voters that their rhetoric had to rise above Trump's brazen behavior. Instead, he now serves as Trump's Secretary of State.\n\nTrump has shown that he can turn the Republican base against even the most stalwart conservatives.\n\nSome of this is careerism. Trump has shown that he can turn the Republican base against even the most stalwart conservatives, which leaves those who want to remain in elected office with a choice: debase themselves to gain power or stick to their principles and be cast aside like Romney and McCain.\n\nBut the truth is Republicans capitulate even when it's not necessary. Far too many of today's Republicans are unwilling to call out Trump's seedy dealings with Russia, heed warnings about the perils of relying too heavily on tariffs or stand with law enforcement over pro-Trump extremists - all positions that are unpopular with broad swaths of voters.\n\nAnother reason the Republican Party I once led is never seeing a revival? Republican voters don't want to revive it. In fact, MAGA officials repeatedly race to outdo each others' depravity because they know today's Republican voters will reward them for it.\n\nSouth Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace, who once envisioned a Republican Party that carved out space for LGBTQ+ rights , now fundraises on a bizarre obsession with trans people's bathroom habits.\n\nFar-right Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, once considered a fringe conspiracy theorist by people with multiple brain cells, is now one of the party's leading political figures and the top congressional fundraiser in her state .\n\nEven Trump's most unhinged Cabinet picks were awarded confirmations not despite their lack of experience or support for conspiracy theories, but because of them.\n\nAnd there's Trump, whose criminal indictments and even convictions became a cause célèbre and his highest fundraising days of the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe old Republican Party is not coming back. Those bridges have been burned by Republicans. The sooner Schumer and those Republicans interested in the re-emergence of traditional republicanism understand this reality, the sooner we move on from Trumpism. But sitting back and waiting for the GOP to \"expel\" Trump won't change a thing.\n\nFor more thought-provoking insights from Michael Steele, Alicia Menendez and Symone Sanders-Townsend, watch \"The Weekend\" every Saturday and Sunday at 8 a.m. ET on MSNBC.\n\nMichael Steele is a co-host of \"The Weekend,\" which airs Saturdays and Sundays at 8 a.m. ET on MSNBC.

Everywhere you look in the halls of Capitol Hill is a string of failures for the supposedly ascendent MAGA Republicans.\n\nVictories for the far-right have been few and far between , even as they've slowly lowered the bar for themselves further and further. In fact, their biggest win to date has been a case of friendly fire: removing Kevin McCarthy as House speaker. The House Freedom Caucus, for all its wailing and gnashing of teeth, has yet to find much traction in their efforts to hold must-pass bills hostage for conservative wins. Even with two members on the all-important Rules Committee , which determines the flow of bills onto the House floor, they've been unable to block spending bills that lack their lengthy list of anti-LGBTQ, anti-abortion and anti-education policy riders.\n\nVictories for the far-right have been few and far between, even as they've slowly lowered the bar for themselves further and further.\n\nAs for the \"gut-churning inanity,\" it was clear from the start that the GOP would be less focused on policy wins this term than using the House's investigative powers to antagonize the Biden administration. Accordingly, they launched several red-meat-producing probes under the auspices of \"accountability.\" Unfortunately for them, their efforts haven't just been laughably ineffective, they've been dreadfully uninteresting as well.\n\nThe House's Weaponization of the Government subcommittee, under Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, showed early on that it lacked the goods to back up any of its claims of conservative victimization. Their most recent hearing was about the FBI's financial investigation into Jan. 6 rioters, but, for some reason, the headline witness was YouTube weirdo and psychologist Jordan Peterson . Despite this stunt casting, the hearing passed with little notice .\n\nOther investigative efforts have been similarly unsuccessful. The impeachment inquiry into Biden, which McCarthy launched in an attempt to placate the far-right, has run into several brick walls . That's unsurprising to any remotely fair-minded observer, given the total lack of evidence that Biden abused his office. Even House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., has been forced to admit that an impeachment vote is unlikely. Meanwhile, their attempts to muddy the water around former President Donald Trump's criminal indictments haven't gone beyond sending letters accusing those prosecuting him of nefarious goals.\n\nYes, Republicans managed to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas by one vote for the crime of carrying out Biden's immigration policy. But the Senate is sure to quickly dispose of the charges rather than carrying out the lengthy trial that Republicans were hoping to use as a platform for attacking Biden. It doesn't help their argument that Biden has been negligent on border security when the GOP tanked its own border security bill with Trump's encouragement to keep the issue alive for the fall.\n\nAnd looping back around to McCarthy, even bagging that trophy hasn't worked out great for the chaos caucus. Though he's resigned from Congress, McCarthy is still feuding with the members who gave him the boot. Meanwhile, his successor as speaker, Mike Johnson, R-La., has opted to largely follow McCarthy in taking the path of least resistance to preventing government shutdowns. On multiple occasions, he has relied on mostly Democratic votes to give bills the two-thirds majority they need to dodge the Rules Committee. Conservatives are deeply unhappy, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., already has filed a motion to vacate the chair , the same procedure used to oust McCarthy.\n\nBut Johnson currently stands a better chance of surviving such a tactic. McCarthy went down in flames in large part thanks to Democrats voting against him as a bloc. Johnson hasn't made a habit of reneging on deals like his predecessor and has shown himself to be less afraid of earning the ire of the Freedom Caucus than McCarthy was. But yet another Republican's early resignation has dropped his majority down to one vote, and with more possible exits between now and November, he's going to have a harder time than ever trying to get even messaging bills passed ahead of the election.\n\nIt's all schadenfreude-worthy, but unfortunately, this no time for a victory lap by Democrats.\n\nIt's all schadenfreude-worthy, but unfortunately, this no time for a victory lap by Democrats. Wisdom would dictate a group of politicians taking this many L's would be chastened; in an older, simpler time, they might even feel demoralized enough to feel shame about their tactics. But it's far more likely that they'll apply the same comforting balm that the right-wing has used for decades now: convincing themselves that the current leadership just isn't pure and conservative enough.\n\nThis means that rather than rethinking their approach, MAGA Republicans are poised to double down on their bet that Trump retakes the White House next year. If that's the case, much like the man they've chosen to deify, all the grievances and failure will just become grist for the mill for whatever retribution they seek to enact. The lesson won't be that that they've overreached in their efforts to lie and reshape reality in front of us; it will be that they didn't try hard enough.\n\nHayes Brown is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily, where he helps frame the news of the day for readers.

And they're furious.\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Ja'han Jones\n\nIt appears MAGA Republicans are no longer keen on the idea of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign .\n\nOver the last several months, Republicans aligned with former President Donald Trump haven't hid their excitement over Kennedy waging a Democratic campaign for president.\n\nIn April, CBS News reported that former Trump adviser Steve Bannon had encouraged Kennedy to run for months, hoping the candidate's purported liberalism - along with his anti-vaccine conspiracy theories - would make him a chaos agent who'd pull votes from President Joe Biden in next year's presidential race.\n\nThis thinking helps explain why Kennedy received financial backing from a right-wing megadonor , and why he's been a frequent guest on conservative media platforms , where hosts have invited him on to rail against the Democratic Party. I've also written about Kennedy's effort to spread these theories and other crackpot claims through at least one ostensibly Black media platform.\n\nBut some Republicans' love affair with Kennedy seems to have come to an end after this week's announcement that he'll no longer run as a Democrat. Now that Kennedy is running as an independent , losing his Democratic veneer and, thus, waging a more overtly right-wing campaign, MAGA Republicans aren't so happy about a bid they worry could pull from the same pool of conspiratorial conservatives Trump will likely need to win. It's a group of voters Slate writer Ben Jacobs describe d as the \"partyless - and the paranoid.\"\n\nKennedy's independent campaign has already earned ire from MAGA allies, including Trump's campaign, which has tried to sully Kennedy in the eyes of right-wing voters by suggesting he isn't conservative enough. Kennedy has even fallen out of favor with Fox News' Sean Hannity, who's shown the candidate his colder side since the party switch - after previously portraying Kennedy as a principled liberal hero.\n\nRepublicans are now having second thoughts about how eagerly they've wrapped their arms. Last week, the Conservative Political Action Conference announced it had invited Kennedy to speak at its \"Investor Summit to Save America\" in mid-October, seemingly killing any pretense about where he and his campaign are on the political spectrum.\n\nPredictably, the announcement agitated many Republicans. This response, from a top official at the Trump-aligned Turning Point USA's political action arm , is remarkably transparent.\n\n\"RFK shouldn't be speaking at cpac. Let RFK convince and steal votes from democrats,\" Turning Point Action executive Tyler Bowyer tweeted on Monday.\n\nBowyer added : \"I think it was okay to lean in when he [RFK Jr.] was running as a dem, but now that he is running as an independent, why would you give him a stage to potentially split our own votes? Let him split dems.\"\n\nIt's always seemed obvious to me that Republican leadership only liked Kennedy to the extent he could chip away at potential Biden votes. But now, it looks like they're starting to realize Kennedy is just as likely - if not more likely - to appeal to the MAGA supporters they want uniformly backing Trump. It's a rather funny conundrum of conservatives' own making.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger. He previously wrote The ReidOut Blog.

This would clearly be the right thing to do, not just to help the state of Maryland but also to limit the economic damage from a disaster that has blocked both a major road artery and a major port. Among other things, the Port of Baltimore plays a key role in both exports of coal and trade in farm and construction equipment , so the bridge disaster will have direct adverse effects on the heartland as well as the East Coast.\n\nAnd if America were still the same country that enacted the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 - passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress and signed into law by a Republican president - which gave rise to our Interstate System, there would be little question that Congress would approve funding soon after it returns from Easter recess.\n\nBut we aren't that country anymore. Biden will probably be able to get funds for rebuilding, but it's by no means a sure thing.\n\nThe rise of MAGA Republicans is only part of the problem. I've seen several people citing the response to the 2007 collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge in Minnesota as an example of what things were like in a better political era. Indeed, within days, Congress voted unanimously to provide $250 million in aid.\n\nBut that was a one-off. The Minnesota bridge collapse highlighted the decaying state of America's infrastructure, and one might have expected the disaster to lead to real action, but it didn't . President Barack Obama pleaded with Congress to approve broad increases in infrastructure spending and was able to sign a highway funding bill in 2015, but for the most part he was stymied by G.O.P. opposition. As president, Donald Trump repeatedly promised to revamp America's infrastructure - \"it's infrastructure week\" became a running joke - but never delivered.\n\nMajor action on infrastructure didn't happen until late 2021 with the enactment of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law - which, despite the name, received only 13 Republican votes in the House. And that was with Democrats in full control of Congress. It's not foolish to worry that MAGA hard-liners will block aid to Maryland in much the same way that they've blocked aid to Ukraine.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Not true.\n\nBut if that's what you believe, you should be laser-focused on fighting the clear and present danger, right?\n\nInstead, they're focused on the menace of woke washing machines.\n\nOn Tuesday, 205 House Republicans (joined by seven Democrats) voted for the Hands Off Our Home Appliances Act , intended to limit the ability of the Department of Energy to set energy efficiency standards. In April, Republicans planned to vote on a series of more specific bills : the Liberty in Laundry Act, the Refrigerator Freedom Act and more. These votes were delayed but may still happen.\n\nIf all of this sounds absurd, that's because it is. But as I noted the other day with regard to the crusade against lab-grown meat, the deep silliness of one of our major political parties is itself a serious issue. If you can get past the silliness, there are also some substantive policy questions here. Should the government be trying to limit home energy consumption? If so, should it do so with efficiency mandates for appliances, or in some other way?\n\nThe case for trying to reduce home energy consumption is simple and overwhelming. Electric power generation does significant environmental damage . Not only does it emit greenhouse gases, adding to the risk of climate catastrophe; it also has more immediate effects on air pollution, including raising levels of particulates and ozone that have measurable adverse effects on human health. These costs will fall as we increasingly turn to renewable energy, but we're still in the early stages of that transition. So when you use more electricity than necessary, you are imposing real costs - including a higher risk of death - on other people.\n\nThat said, nobody is suggesting that Americans give up the convenience of modern life. The goal, rather, is to deliver that convenience more efficiently - to heat our homes, wash our clothes and dishes and so on while using somewhat less energy.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Tucker Carlson is in Moscow to conduct a friendly interview with Vladimir Putin. And we're receiving reports from the front lines that Russia is advancing, in part because of Ukrainian ammunition shortages. In short, the war is reaching a critical stage, and Ukraine may lose because Republicans are willing to hand authoritarian Russia a historic military victory rather than supply further aid to a democratic ally.\n\nRonald Reagan isn't just rolling over in his grave; he may also lurch from it in a fit of incredulous rage. This is a remarkable and potentially catastrophic reversal by a political party that is in a state of near-total, frequently random ideological transformation.\n\nTo explain the intensity of Republican resistance to Ukraine aid, I need to return to a concept I wrote about in November: that of bespoke realities . My friend Renée DiResta, the technical research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory, coined the term, and she wrote that it refers to the \"bubble realities\" constructed by communities \"that operate with their own norms, media, trusted authorities and frameworks of facts.\"\n\nAmong those who oppose aid to Ukraine, there are certainly several paleoconservatives who object on classic isolationist grounds: It's not our fight, our support is costly, we might find ourselves inadvertently embroiled in war, and so on. But the mass Republican movement against Ukraine is rooted far less in policy than it is in a particular bespoke reality of the MAGA universe, in which Ukraine is a pernicious villain, Putin is a flawed hero and Russia should have crushed Ukraine long ago.\n\nMAGA Republicans' hatred and contempt for Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian cause is shockingly vehement. Candace Owens says she wants to \" punch \" Zelensky. Donald Trump Jr. calls him an \" international welfare queen .\" Carlson says he dresses \" like the manager of a strip club .\" It's all bizarre and unreasonable. And it all fits the broader MAGA narrative.\n\nLet's break it down, step by step. First, if you're stumped by the notion that Ukraine is a villain, you may need reminding of a conspiracy theory that is now largely forgotten but was prevalent on the right at the time of Donald Trump's first impeachment. In his infamous conversation with Zelensky - the one that triggered the impeachment - Trump asked Zelensky about a \"CrowdStrike\" server allegedly being held in Ukraine.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "MAGA Wouldn't Be Such a Threat if the Electoral System Worked\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nJamelle Bouie\n\nBy Jamelle Bouie\n\nOpinion Columnist\n\nLast week, President Biden gave a wide-ranging interview to John Harwood of ProPublica that touched on his presidency, the Republican Party and the present state and future status of American democracy.\n\nEarly in the interview, Harwood asks Biden whether he thinks the threat to democracy is broader than the refusal of Donald Trump and his allies to accept election defeats:\n\nAs you think about the threat to democracy, do you think about it specifically as the refusal to accept election defeats and peaceful transfer of power? Or does it more broadly encompass some of the longstanding features of democracy - like the Electoral College, the nature of the Senate, the gerrymandering process - that sometimes thwarts the will of the majority?\n\nIn his answer, Biden more or less confirms that, yes, when he speaks of the threat to democracy, he specifically means the threat coming from the MAGA wing of the Republican Party. For Biden, the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence are the \"underpinnings of democracy.\" The issue, for him, is that MAGA Republicans would try to overturn elections and \"prevent the people's voice\" from being expressed, not to mention heard.\n\nToward the end of the interview, Biden takes care to emphasize the extent to which he separates MAGA Republicans from the rest of the public. \"I really do believe the vast majority of the American people are decent, honorable, straightforward,\" he says. The MAGA radicals, he adds, are \"a minority of the minority.\" He goes on to argue that this majority of decent Americans \"needs to understand what the danger is if they don't participate.\"\n\nThis last point is interesting. If the most radicalized and antidemocratic segment of the public is also a small and unrepresentative minority, then there's no real reason to worry about its influence on electoral politics. Yes, it may elect a few similarly radical members of Congress (who have, at the moment, made it impossible for the House to function), and it may even be strong enough to again choose a major-party nominee. But if these voters are a distinct minority, that nominee will be easily defeated at the ballot box. That is, unless the institutions of our democracy amplify that minority's influence - which they do.\n\nBiden might reject Harwood's suggestion that the institutions of the American political system constitute a threat to American democracy that is as dire as the threat posed by Trump, but the only way to square the circle of a radical minority with democracy-destroying potential is to acknowledge the way our institutions work to empower the people who hope to overturn constitutional government altogether.\n\nOne response is to say that this dynamic represents a distortion of our political institutions: It's just that they're not working properly!

      "text": "How Extremists Won the Speaker Fight\n\nListen to What Next:\n\nRepublicans in the House of Representatives finally broke their deadlock on Wednesday. It was the middle of the afternoon. And after three weeks of leaderless chaos, Louisiana's Mike Johnson took the gavel to become speaker of the House. If you're wondering, Mike who? You're not alone. Mike Johnson has been in office less than seven years . And he was the fourth candidate for the job this month. He got shoved into the spotlight-fast.\n\nHis introductory speech offered a lot to think about. Johnson offered a personal biography, speaking about his dad, who was a firefighter. He talked a lot about God. He said he'd been moved to tears on the floor of Congress, overwhelmed by the enormity of his responsibility.\n\n\"That said, there's a lot in his speech that was bullshit,\" said Tim Miller, who spent years as a Republican strategist. I called up Miller, who now writes for the Bulwark, to help me read between the lines. \"The speech included these overwrought comments about the lack of institutional trust and how he's there to regain that. That's a nice thing to say, I guess. But he didn't do anything to demonstrate that he wants to regain that trust. In fact, Mike Johnson's been somebody that's been actively working to erode trust . \"\n\nWhat Miller means here is that this pious-seeming guy, who's been pretty anonymous until now, has been fighting in the trenches for the conservative movement for a long time, including as the main architect of one of Donald Trump's schemes to flip the 2020 election.\n\n\" He was whipping people to try to vote to overturn the election,\" Miller said. \"He also was advancing some of the more crazy conspiracy theories, like the Dominion conspiracy that the voting machines were rigged.\"\n\nWhen Rep. Matt Gaetz went on Steve Bannon's show to talk about Mike Johnson, he called him \"MAGA Mike,\" Miller said. But Johnson would never describe himself that way. That's why Johnson is the \"Goldilocks candidate, because his actions are everything that the people that listen to Steve Bannon's podcast want. But his affect and his words are collegial.\"\n\nThe House may finally have a speaker, but on Thursday's episode of What Next , I spoke with Miller about how this \"Goldilocks candidate\" means the chaos is far from over. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nMary Harris: Mike Johnson's name first broke through the noise on Tuesday night. Can you just lay out who he is, what he believes? What do we know about his background?\n\nTim Miller: Johnson is from Shreveport, northwest Louisiana. In a different era, he would have been pretty much a Rick Santorum-type Republican. Just Christian conservative, cares a lot about social issues-things in the gays and abortion and religious freedom space. That is his natural place within the party, as part of the socially conservative wing. But as he has gotten into Congress, he has developed pretty good relationships with Steve Scalise and with the Republican leadership. He's demonstrated he's the kind of guy who can do interviews and not sound like a crazy person, which is an important bar to pass in the Republican Party these days.\n\nYeah, sounding reasonable seems like his superpower.\n\nIt is. And he also recognized the Trump rise within the party and really was lockstep with Trump.\n\nHe caught a shooting star. He would travel with Donald Trump, and then he got very involved in Jan. 6, in the litigation around it.\n\nYes. He wasn't like Elise Stefanik. He wasn't somebody that flipped and then became an ostentatious defender of Trump. He was more like an operational defender of Trump on the Hill. And Donald Trump likes those kind of people.\n\nHenchmen.\n\nSomeone he feels like he could cast in the role of a henchman. And Mike Johnson really does. And he has a lot of cred on the right because of his advocacy on social issues.\n\nAnd we should be clear, he made this constitutional argument against Joe Biden's victory in 2020, and it went all the way to the Supreme Court. And again, making it sound reasonable, saying like, \"Listen, there was a pandemic, and that meant there were all these changes to how elections worked. And really, the legislature should be making those changes. That's what it says in the Constitution. But it was these other people, elections officials. And so it's like, Meh, those votes don't count the same way .\" And you can see how he's drawing the lines, even if you disagree with the outcome of what he's saying.\n\nYeah, I went to the Louisiana GOP convention a couple of months ago now to cover it for the Bulwark. And this is a very MAGA crowd. And Johnson's remarks were very well received. And he's articulate and sounded intelligent. Louie Gohmert had also spoken at this thing; he didn't sound like Louie Gohmert. And so I heard that and I was like, \"Man, this guy is somebody to watch because he's figured out how to give these guys the right MAGA red meat while also having an acceptable presentation for Face the Nation .\" That demonstrates why he is somebody they turned to, because this is something that the Republicans desperately need.\n\nThey essentially had two groups in the party: They had the people that were basically old, pre-MAGA Republicans that were pretending on the MAGA stuff in order to survive-that is your Tom Emmers and your McCarthys and your Patrick McHenrys. And then you had the MAGA members that are all just a little too weird to do the Face the Nation thing and to do the ceremonial elements of the speakership that you have to do.\n\nAnd Johnson demonstrated that you can be a wild-eyed MAGA extremist who wants to turn the country into a Donald Trump autocracy and talk about it in a way that kind of sounds like you're the captain of a high school debate team and drink milk for lunch and have a podcast about religion with your wife, which he does.\n\nMike Johnson didn't really emerge as a potential speaker until a few days back, and even then, he wasn't a front-runner. Initially, Tom Emmer won the party's nomination, but he quickly dropped out once it was clear he wouldn't have the support of the MAGA wing. In the end, there were three candidates left, and Johnson came out on top.\n\nMy sense was that the reason why Johnson was able to elevate above the other two was because among the more \"normal\" establishment Republicans, whatever you want to call them, they were more drawn to Johnson. And Johnson had built good, trustworthy relationships with leadership.\n\nLooking at the winners and losers of this speaker fight, it's notable to me that Jim Jordan did not win the gavel, but Johnson did. And to me, it made me wonder: What does it mean? Like, what are the issues that are important to Republicans? Because Johnson and Jordan seem very similar when it comes to substance, but just different in style. It made me wonder if this is a party of optics at this point.\n\nYeah, that's exactly what I thought. I just wrote about this for the Bulwark. If this was an ideological fight, this would have been over weeks ago. If this was over some policy issue or some ideology, then after McCarthy was deposed, whoever started it and whoever their allies are would have gone to the conference and said, \"We will only go for a speaker that will do X, Y, and Z.\" There would be some specific thing that they wanted, but there wasn't anything like that. They had distaste for McCarthy and wanted to demonstrate power over him and wanted to demonstrate that the MAGA elements within the party were the ones that were in control, not the old establishment pre-Trump guys who had been around forever.\n\nTo me, what was so weird was people like Ken Buck, who said they couldn't vote for Jim Jordan because of Jan. 6, but then all the Republicans lined up behind Johnson, who was the architect of election denialism.\n\nSo, you have your Kay Grangers and your other appropriator types-Tom Kean and these old bulls, if you will-and they went against Jordan. And some of that was interpersonal. Jordan, for a long time, had been a thorn in their side. And so some of this was just good old high school cafeteria stuff. But I also think some of it was optics. They did not feel like he was somebody that should be the face of the party. And they feel like Johnson could be. I think that they're in for a rude awakening. And I think that a lot of folks are going to be regretting their votes\n\nIt's funny because earlier in the week we did a show about the speaker mess in D.C. , and I said it was a \"make-or-break week\" for Republicans. So I'm curious: Which was it? Was it make or break or both?\n\nI think it was \"make\" in the short term, but I think that they run a very big risk of \"break\" by next year. Let me explain why. Back when I was a Republican, we used to use the specter of Nancy Pelosi to really hurt suburban Democratic candidates and certainly red-state Democratic candidates. Like, so-and-so from Georgia voted 92 percent of the time with a San Francisco liberal who wants to do all these far-left things-30-second ads, they write themselves. The Democrats are now going to give the Republicans a taste of their own medicine on this front. And all 18 of those guys in Biden districts and even a handful that are in close Trump districts, now they have voted for and empowered somebody as speaker of the House, as the leader of their party, who was complicit in the effort to overturn the election, supports bans on abortion with no exceptions, has had extremely far-out anti-gay legislation-not just the \"don't say gay\" stuff in Florida, but he wanted to allow gay sex to be criminalized. And not to mention a climate change denier, who wants to slash Social Security and Medicare. And I think it's going to hurt these guys to have to run and say, \"OK, I'm on board with the Trump reelect and one of his top lieutenants who's this Louisiana extreme evangelical.\" I don't think that that plays in these California and New York districts that are the reason why Republicans have the House majority right now.\n\nLet's talk about what happens now. Johnson is saying he's going to move really fast. He's trying to jam through legislation this week, but he's new to the job. He still doesn't really have a staff. You've worked behind the scenes with politicians for a long time. Is moving fast possible for Mike Johnson?\n\nIt might be possible on a couple of things. I don't know what the deal was on the continuing resolution. That's the thing to watch. The government shutdown isn't until November, so we'll see how quickly they can move on that.\n\nSome of the stuff is back to optics. Can he move fast on the bill that says we condemn Hamas? Yeah, I guess. But I think that the thornier elements to this are going to be more complicated than he realizes.\n\nLike, actually funding things.\n\nYeah. I saw a list of things, like, \"We're going to do the farm bill by the end of the year.\" And it's like, OK, brother, I don't know. I feel like an old guy now, saying, \"Back in my day.\" But I've been in D.C. during two farm bills when there were speakers and majorities that were decently effective and did get things passed where that thing got delayed forever because there are all these random contingencies that you don't think of. You know, the sugar people are mad at the corn people. So, this guy with a staff of eight and a bunch of people that are just new, and he has never really had to do anything. He's not in a competitive district and now he's got to go raise money and do all of this stuff to prepare for 2024. He's behind the eight ball. He's got to fund the government. They got to figure out what to do with the Ukraine. I think that it's going to be a steeper learning curve than he presented.\n\nIs Johnson going to be governed by the same rules Kevin McCarthy was haunted by? Like, the rule that any member of the caucus can try to boot him out at any time if he strays from the rules.\n\nHe is. But technically, Paul Ryan was also governed by that, and they just never really did it. And so, I think that he's in the sweet spot. Mike Johnson has been a down-the-line right-wing congressman. There's charts going around of all of the controversial votes (among the Republican conference) since Kevin McCarthy has gotten in-the debt ceiling bill and keeping the government open and gay marriage-and Johnson was on the side of the crazies on every single one. So, what reason would they have to overthrow him? And there's no signs that the more \"moderate\" folks are going to show the backbone to use the same types of tactics that Matt Gaetz did. So he'll probably be clear on that front.\n\nGet more news from Mary Harris every weekday.\n\nOne of the most important things Johnson's going to have to do is reach spending agreements with the Senate and the president, and he's been so vocal in the past about the need to slash spending on entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. What does that mean for these debates and conversations?\n\nThe Ukraine thing is the biggest threat right now. So I think that's issue No. 1.\n\nBecause he's voted against Ukraine funding in the past.\n\nYeah, every time. And there's been no even whispers that that was part of the deal to get him through. I felt this way about McCarthy when he first got in: Everybody gets one pass. I do think that he'll get a pass to deal with the budget in a way that can get through the Senate and onto the president's desk. I don't know if there'll be additional wheeling and dealing on that or what that's going to look like exactly. But I think that he'll get some leash within the Republican conference to do that. But in the future, I think that we're looking at severe, severe brinksmanship on government funding in 2024.\n\nSo you're saying don't be fooled if things look normal for the next couple months.\n\nThat's what I'm saying. I think that he will revert to the hard-line ideologue that he's been.\n\nYou spent years as a Republican operative. And I thought it would be interesting to talk to you in this moment, because I feel like I've just lived through these wild swings of Republican identity during this speaker race. Like, literally Tuesday, there was someone who was a speaker-designate who believed the polar opposite of what the current speaker now elected believes, according to votes. I wonder: Do you feel like Johnson's election really points to what the Republican Party is now?\n\nI do. I don't even know, actually, if Johnson is the final manifestation of what the Republican Party is now. The animating issues for Republicans right now are completely different than they were 20 years ago. There's some similarities. There obviously is a line from Pat Buchanan to now and a line from Newt Gingrich to now. But if you asked somebody in 1996 in the House Republican Conference, what are the things that animate you? It's smaller government, lower taxes, maybe abortion, strong military. Like, that's the old three-legged stool of the Republican Party. If you ask the new class of Republicans what it is now, it's wokeness. It is immigration. It is receding America from the world. And, maybe it's also, for some of them, smaller government and abortion. There are some things that overlap, but there have been other issues that are totally changed. And the types of politicians that were those old Chamber of Commerce Republicans that have been hanging on in the House, they are representatives of a time gone by.\n\nThey're dinosaurs.\n\nYeah. It was only a matter of time before they were overthrown. And frankly, they lasted longer than I expected.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Our Major American Misunderstanding\n\nIn another least-surprising surprise of our times, last week Donald Trump expressed his intent, if elected to a second term as president, to utilize his Justice Department to destroy his political opponent. The New York Times reported that Trump had promised, in a speech after his arraignment, to \"appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,\" and went on to explain the plan to reinvent a DOJ entirely beholden not to the laws of the land, but the president. As the Times noted in its opening paragraph, such a move would \"fully jettison the post-Watergate norm of Justice Department independence.\"\n\nIt's interesting that we still refer to the proposition that the White House doesn't direct the DOJ to go after political rivals as a \"norm\"-much less a norm the White House has observed since Watergate-when in actual fact, only Democratic administrations have adhered to this standard. Long before the Trump era, George W. Bush deployed theories of a \"unitary executive \" to make claims about a DOJ that answered to him.\n\nTrump's own use of his Justice Department during his term as president to go after political enemies and reward sycophants is well documented. Whether it was issuing subpoenas for Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell for investigating Kremlin election meddling, conscripting his attorney general, Bill Barr, to distort the findings of the Mueller investigation, or roping John Durham into investigating the origins of the FBI's inquiry into Russian election interference, no sane person believes there was a meaningful wall of separation between Trump and his DOJ. And there wasn't a word of concern from Rep. Kevin McCarthy, Sen. Mitch McConnell, or Rep. Jim Jordan when the Jan. 6 hearings revealed the extent to which Trump had leaned on his Justice Department to support his claim that the 2020 presidential contest had been stolen, including telling acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen to \" Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen .\" It was understood that Trump thought his DOJ worked for Trump.\n\nBut do you know who has adhered to the norm that walls off the DOJ from the White House? President Joe Biden. And the attorney general he appointed, Merrick Garland. And special counsel Jack Smith. They have taken elaborate care to keep Trump's criminal investigation at arm's length from the White House. This is not an aberration for Democratic administrations. Remember, Loretta Lynch stepped away from the Hillary Clinton email investigation (leaving it to Jim Comey's judgement) just because she had run into Bill Clinton on a plane tarmac. Democratic leaders in the White House have taken pains to not just reaffirm the norm that separates the two entities, but to rebuild it as more of an immutable border than it was before.\n\nThe DOJ/White House wall of separation is just one of many, many \"norms\" that Democrats have honored and Republicans have continuously, flagrantly violated-alongside blue slips for judges, or the use of the filibuster, or abiding by the Hatch Act, or the norm that says you seat a Supreme Court justice, even in an election year.\n\nWhy is this happening? Is it that Democrats are virtuous and Republicans are hypocrites? Or that Republicans are strategic and Democrats are chumps?\n\nNeither characterization is the most useful way to think about this. We use the word norm to refer to rules and conventions. But we keep missing the fact that norms are values systems. We don't live in a country with a shared values system-indeed, our values are often in direct conflict. So we make the mistake of assuming that MAGA voters and their leaders will at some point be persuaded to return to American norms which they never agreed to in the first place.\n\nIt is well past time to realize that Trump, and the Trumpists and MAGA Republicans who have picked up this playbook, are not violating \"norms.\" On the contrary, they are honoring their own set of norms, which are radically different from the norms of mainstream liberal American democracy.\n\nNorms are set by the social systems in which we live. Trump and his MAGA enthusiasts' reference points-Fox News, Truth Social, their donors, their voters-have come to believe any Democratic government to be illegitimate, which is why accepting norms like respect for an independent judiciary or support for national security seem traitorous. Turning on your own national intelligence apparatus makes sense if your norm is that the entire government is an illegitimate cabal hellbent on purging patriots (a \"deep state\"). These norms predate Trump and MAGA specifically, by the way. Consider that when Trump accidentally suggested imposing gun safety measures post-Parkland, he had to walk it all back . It's a mistake to think that if he disappeared tomorrow the norms would snap back, as well.\n\nIn January 2016, on the eve of the Iowa caucus, Donald Trump famously said , \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK?\" After the 2016 election, as we came to realize he had been correct-and that nothing he could do would cost him any of his voters -no one imagined that if he actually committed an unthinkable crime, it would not cost him the support of any Republican politicians, including congressional leaders in the line of succession to the presidency. What if he maintained and shared confidential national security documents, as opposed to shooting someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue? Now we know that a third of Americans, as well as Republican congressional leaders (including the speaker of the House), would vehemently attack the police for arresting him rather than question Trump for the crime itself. The shared norm around presidential crimes being unacceptable is now gone.\n\nPerhaps it is time to reconsider what we call a norm, and also to ask why we bind ourselves to ideas and values that are not shared. If the norms of democratic governance are not shared, then they are simply rules to which one side binds itself and the other does not. So perhaps instead of referring to all these soft rules and conventions and traditions as norms, we should more accurately refer to them as \"rules to which we adhere and they do not.\"\n\nIt's emphatically true that if you cast these norms in that light, you begin to look like a chump. When one side is persistently priding itself on \"going high\" while the other side is already plotting the ways in which it can sink lower , one is forced to wonder whether following norms for their own sake is an end in itself. Maybe it's just misplaced confidence in the moral arc of the universe. Instead of waiting for MAGA Republicans to come to their senses and embrace a set of norms of governance to which they do not adhere and to which they don't want to adhere, it's long past time we come to our senses and realize that their norms are not ours, and never have been. Thus, the stakes are not the preservation of norms, but democracy itself, and who writes the history of these times.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Unexpected Corner of Culture That Explains a Lot About the Election\n\nI am delighted to inform you that all monsters are gay.\n\nZombies are gay. Werewolves are gay. Godzilla is gay. Vampires are obviously gay. Mothman is gay, as are all other cryptids . Frankenstein is gay in, like, 20 different ways. The Babadook , you may have heard, is gay. Swamp Thing is trans , and also gay.\n\nThe queerness here is not so much about whom the monsters sleep with-I don't want to picture the Babadook getting busy, and neither do you-as it is about the queer community's enthusiastic adoption of monsters, cryptids, and other weird little guys as beloved avatars. The cultural role of the monster, according to monster studies scholarship (a real thing), is to embody and enforce the distinction between what is acceptable and what is aberrant: The monster lurks around in the no-man's-land outside what the dominant culture deems normal, in order to remind you what happens when you stray. Queer horror and queer monstrousness turn this warning on its head. If the monster inhabits the same borderlands as you, if you see yourself reflected in the monster, then maybe the monster is your friend-and possibly your kin.\n\nIt's not just queer folks who have embraced monsters and monstrousness, pulling power from what was once considered strange or different. My book Women and Other Monsters is about how women and feminized people can look to the monsters of classical mythology, intended as cautionary tales about overstepping our boundaries, as guides for reclaiming the unbecoming traits we're supposed to suppress. Looking at Medusa, the hideous woman with snakes for hair, might turn the viewer to stone, but there's power in offending the eye-or at least rejecting the pressure to be decorative. Charybdis, a mythical female sea monster, is often depicted as a bottomless sucking whirlpool, but there's power in accepting your hunger, whether it's for food or love or armies crossing the sea in boats.\n\nAlso in the field of women's monstrosity, there's Madeline Miller's Circe and other contemporary feminist retellings, fiction that rehabilitates female villains of legend and literature, from Lady Macbeth to Baba Yaga to Japanese yokai. Memoirs like Riva Lehrer's Golem Girl , about spina bifida, and Jami Lin Nakamura's The Night Parade , about mental illness, use monsters and monstrosity to discuss disability.\n\nIn short, cultures create monster stories to establish what's normative within that culture. But there has undeniably been a recent movement among marginalized people to identify as monstrous-or at least to identify with the monstrous-as a way to celebrate stepping outside the borders of acceptability. The old world is dying, the new world struggles to be born, now is a time for looking at monsters and saying: \"Me as hell.\"\n\nAn even more interesting thing happens when you focus on these marginal characters-these outsiders, who are supposed to have been banished to the borders. Putting the monster at the center means relegating the center-the normative-to the margins. And once we recenter the figures on the edge, the putative center becomes distant and defamiliarized, stripped of its protective sheen of conformity in a way that makes its true freakishness visible. This is why, in addition to revisiting old stories to recontextualize the villainy of the monstrous characters, we've also increasingly seen new stories that show white supremacy, patriarchy, and other elements of the dominant culture as the monstrous figures they've really been all along. Book examples include Ring Shout , by P. Djèlí Clark, in which the KKK is made up of literal monsters; The City We Became , by N.K. Jemisin, a cosmic horror novel in which the infiltrating Elder God figure is a metaphor for gentrification; and Manhunt , by Gretchen Felker-Martin, a gender apocalypse in which cis men become beasts and TERFs become monstrous murderers. In TV and movies, there are the racist horrors of Lovecraft Country and the moral monstrosity of the body-snatching colonizers in Get Out .\n\nThis recentering affects the stories we tell-but it also affects our broader social story, the way we make sense of the world around us. (This is why people who want to control the way you think start by controlling what you're allowed to read, view, and share. A culture and its products are reflections of each other.) We tell stories like this because we have entered an era in which the erstwhile cultural default-whiteness, maleness, cishetness, Christianity-is starting to erode. Those factors still dominate in the halls of power, but in the stories we tell, they're no longer the presumptive starting point. Many popular and influential stories center the marginal figures who were previously banished to the monstrous borderlands-and some of them look back on the former center and go, \"What the hell was happening there?\"\n\nWhich brings me to \"Republicans are weird.\"\n\nYou probably don't need me to recap this for you; it was one of the biggest news cycles of the year, after all. But in brief: Kamala Harris' vice presidential candidate, Tim Walz, kicked off a trend -and perhaps secured his spot on the Harris team-by describing J.D. Vance and other Republicans as \"weird\" for their obsession with invading privacy, constraining rights, making up people to get mad at, and, of course, pushing antiquated and illiberal visions of a Christian nationalist idyll, with a white male overclass enforcing its dominance by any means necessary.\n\nAs New York Times columnist Lydia Polgreen has pointed out , calling these kinds of policy proposals \"weird\" verges on malignant understatement. It's a suspiciously gentle word for, say, mandating genital inspections for school-age children, or outright lying to stoke racial animus-to choose just a couple of examples from a depressingly vast slate of options. If you've read even a summary of the fully dystopian Project 2025 playbook, which Vance once praised as an \"essential weapon\" for the \"fights that lay ahead ,\" the term weird feels almost like an apologia. We're calling this weird ? The thing Al Yankovic is? Surely stronger language is necessary!\n\nBut calling MAGA Republicans weird also seems to really bug them. It gets under their skin-more than fascist or Nazi , which some of them are going so far as to embrace wholesale (at least on porn forums). \"They're the weird ones. Nobody's ever called me weird. I'm a lot of things, but weird I'm not,\" Trump protested this summer. \"And he's not either, I will tell you. J.D. is not at all.\"\n\nClearly, to dismiss these ideological tyrants as \"weird\" seizes back their most treasured possession: the ability to dictate who is normal and who is deviant. This is key to their vision, which puts people like them-the more like them the better-at the center of society and drives others to the margins. The margins being, of course, where the monsters live.\n\nRepublicans in leadership, and many of their fans, have historically been able to shrug off accusations of moral grotesquery because they are safely installed in their cocoon of conformity; the monsters must be the other guys, the ones outside the boundaries. They've desperately insulated themselves against divergence, seizing the center and installing themselves as the arbiters of what's natural and correct, in order to avoid ever having to face the reality of their own warped principles. To call them weird, to banish them to the monstrous hinterlands, is to claw back the ability to define whether behavior is prosocial or antisocial, to determine what principles we should be conforming to. Who gets to decide what \"normal\" is? Probably most Americans would say: Not people who want to monitor your menstruation .\n\nSo what does this mean for monstrosity in 2024 and beyond? It had become a badge of honor, a symbolic identity so many of us have learned to wear with pride. But as the normal and the deviant continue to swap places, our cultural monsters-the ones we create, and the ones we hold a mirror up to-continue to raise questions of where we situate decency, what we canonize, and what we try to exorcise. It's fun for monsters to be gay, but at the same time ... gay is actually an extremely normal thing to be! Way more normal than getting frothy and tyrannical about other people's sexual and emotional lives. There's power in embracing the monstrousness laid upon you as a person on the margins. But there's also power in reflecting it right back where it belongs.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "A Democratic Super PAC's New Trump Ad Might Be Borderline Criminal\n\nHere's something to scramble your brain: A progressive super PAC in Pennsylvania put out an advertisement trying to suppress mail-in voting by MAGA Republicans, and the Trump campaign responded by saying that the super PAC was violating the same law that Trump has been charged with violating in his federal election interference case. To boot, Trump's lawyers said in their letter that the super PAC's actions were just like those of Douglass Mackey, a Trump supporter that the Department of Justice successfully prosecuted for falsely telling Black supporters of Hillary Clinton in 2016 that they could vote for her by text. In the end, the super PAC's actions appear despicable, but it is much more questionable whether the advertisement crossed a legal line.\n\nThe 30-second advertisement in question opens with words onscreen: \"MAGA PATRIOTS: LISTEN TO OUR PRESIDENT.\" It then turns to a series of statements in which Donald Trump disparages the safety and security of voting by mail, claiming fraud and corruption. It ends with the words: \"Stand strong with PRESIDENT TRUMP AGAINST MAIL-IN VOTING.\" A disclaimer on the bottom explains that the ad was paid for by \"Pennsylvania Values,\" and was not authorized by any candidate or committee.\n\nPennsylvania Values, in turn, is a super PAC allied with Democrats and Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. The intention appears to be to suppress Republican turnout by getting fewer Republicans to vote by mail. Those who don't vote by mail might have some issue with voting on Election Day, and some may end up not voting. Although Trump indeed railed against voting by mail relentlessly in 2020, given his (publicly unacknowledged) failures in the last election, he has now started speaking up its benefits , part of a Republican effort to get Trump supporters to \"bank\" their vote.\n\nThe advertisement sends a terrible message, and the super PAC's tactics deserve condemnation. All eligible voters should be encouraged to vote in whatever way is most convenient for them, including mail-in voting. This advertisement is only going to fuel more distrust of voting by mail among Trump supporters by reminding them of his earlier statements, and ramp up further negative polarization between the parties by highlighting the voting wars and engaging in a dirty trick: The message is not coming from \"MAGA Patriots,\" but from partisans on the left.\n\nThe Trump campaign's response is as interesting as this voter suppression effort from the left. In a letter sent to the super PAC, Trump's lawyers wrote:\n\nFederal law makes it a crime from two or more persons to \"conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person ... in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\" 18 U.S.C. § 241. Voting is such a right. The Department of Justice has successfully criminally prosecuted people for conspiring to injure the right of citizens to vote by spreading false information about how to vote. See United States v. Mackey . .. On its face, your false advertisement appears materially similar to the communications that resulted in a seven-month prison sentence for Mr. Mackey.\n\nThe letter also claims that the super PAC is violating part of the federal Ku Klux Klan Act that bars the use of \"force, intimidation, or threat\" to interfere with voting rights.\n\nThe Trump campaign's citation to the Mackey case and the federal statute, 18 U.S.C. Section 241, is doubly interesting. First, on the Mackey case, as I explained at Slate in April:\n\nBack in 2016, a man named Douglass Mackey, tweeting under the name 'Ricky Vaughn,' repeatedly directed messages to Black voters encouraging them to vote by text for Hillary Clinton. The intent was to trick these voters out of their franchise; of course, votes sent by text don't count. Thousands sent texts to vote. We don't know how many of them later did not attempt to vote in a permissible way.\n\nMackey was convicted under Section 241 and his case is currently on appeal to the 2 nd Circuit, where he is arguing, among other things, that his conviction violates the First Amendment because it squelches too much free speech. I filed an amicus brief along with the Protect Democracy Project and the Yale Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic arguing that so long as Section 241 is read to apply in speech and voting cases only to lies about when, where, or how people vote, the law does not violate the First Amendment.\n\nIf that reading is right, the new super PAC ad may not violate Section 241. The ad never lies to voters about when, where, or how to vote. It instead uses Trump's own words expressing Trump's distrust of mail-in voting to imply that Trump still does not want his supporters to vote by mail (this implication may be false, but who knows with Trump, who recently called mail-in voting \"treacherous\"). It also implies that the speech is coming from MAGA supporters. The ad doesn't quite say the ad is paid for by Trump forces, though it does refer to Trump as \"OUR PRESIDENT.\" It includes false statements made by Trump about ballots being found in creeks. Maybe that should count as a super PAC lie about how people vote? Perhaps this ad is artfully crafted to potentially just stay on the line of legality under the test we think works in the Mackey case. The super PAC will need some good lawyers.\n\nThis also doesn't seem like a case of force, threats, or intimidation under the Ku Klux Klan Act, though perhaps a case could be made under other parts of the act. It doesn't appear to violate a different federal statute that prevents a candidate from misrepresenting that he is speaking for another candidate. That law does not apply to super PACs. There may be some potential tort claims here, but the Trump letter doesn't make a strong case for criminal liability.\n\nThis point about Mackey is important, but we should not overlook the chutzpah of Trump's lawyers citing Section 241. Even if the super PAC's actions in this case were criminal, they pale in comparison to what Trump has been charged with in the federal election interference case: The federal complaint filed by the Department of Justice against Trump alleges that his actions violated Section 241 in attempting to overturn the election results through activities-including the fake-electors schemes-in numerous states that were meant to deprive voters of their fair right to vote. That case is currently on hold after Trump appealed to the Supreme Court that he had absolute immunity from prosecution for actions he took as president, and the court will issue an opinion on that any day now. The Supreme Court could well shield Trump from a far more obviously criminal act than what he accuses this super PAC of under the same statute.\n\nBut just because what Pennsylvania Values is doing does not rise to the level of election subversion that Trump committed, and maybe not even to criminal conduct, does not make it OK. Progressives and Democrats should think twice before going down the road of trickery and voter suppression.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Hello, Steve Bannon\n\nThis is part of Hello, Trumpworld , Slate's reluctant guide to the people who will be calling the shots now-at least for as long as they last in Washington.\n\nSteve Bannon, the scruffy MAGA populist known for railing against immigration and bullying centrist Republicans, reached the height of his power at the beginning of the first Trump administration-and quickly fell. In 2017, back when he was associated with the then-popular term alt-right , he had served only months in his role as the White House's chief strategist when he was pushed out of the position after the deadly (and optically damaging) \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville. A year later, he broke with Donald Trump more seriously after it was reported he had insulted Trump's children.\n\nBut Bannon is playing the long game, and his alienation from the White House failed to kill his political ambitions. He got behind MAGA Senate campaigns, and it was reported that he and Trump remained in contact. He also refocused on media, first with Breitbart, then through his War Room show and associated films. He tried (but largely failed) to orchestrate a far-right populist movement in Europe. He spread vast amounts of dangerous COVID- and election-related misinformation to energize dissident conservatives. He urged inflammatory MAGA Republicans to oust Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House.\n\nIt can be tempting to think of Bannon as a silly character with a bloated sense of his own importance. The 71-year-old has a corny obsession with the Roman Empire and quotes philosophers as he parrots conspiracy theories and rails against the elites; he broadcasts from his own basement and wears layered polo shirts. But we shouldn't dismiss him. Although Bannon worships Trump, he has enough of his own ideological vision to be more than a sycophant clinging to a powerful man's coattails. He knows to look more broadly for power, to build connections and a following for his own particular brand of politics. Some of his regular guests, such as Kash Patel , Scott Bessent , and Bill McGinley , are already taking positions of power within the administration.\n\nHe may not formally return to the White House, but Bannon will use this moment to push his provocateur allies in positions of power toward a stark \"America First\" agenda. He'll fight the influence of the party's Elon Musk-Vivek Ramaswamy tech cohort (\"we're going to rip your face off,\" he recently warned Musk ) and ruthlessly attack any sign of softness from the GOP. Most important, he'll continue to hammer the intellectual arguments for the kind of pure, nativist-populist version of the MAGA agenda that he sees as key to building a lasting political movement.\n\nBannon isn't built for compromise, and if midterm elections give Democrats any kind of upper hand, he'll be swept out of power again. (He could also face a personal setback from his upcoming trial over his border wall charity scheme.) But for as long as Trumpism has political dominance in the halls of Congress, Bannon will be there to try to police the ideological purity of the movement.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "It's Pretty Clear Why Trump Wants Total Crackpots to Run the Military and Intelligence Agencies\n\nIn his first few picks for Cabinet secretaries, President-elect Donald Trump has made it clear-even clearer than many had predicted-that his main criterion for selection is blind loyalty. Qualities such as competence or experience have no bearing whatsoever.\n\nOne of the nominees, a combat veteran and Fox News host named Pete Hegseth, is so blatantly unqualified-a caricature of MAGA fidelity-that some insiders say even the Senate sworn in this January, with its 53 Republicans, may vote not to confirm him as leader of the Defense Department.\n\nThe same might be true (one can always hope) of Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, the far-right Democrat turned MAGA Republican, who has no relevant experience except, perhaps, that she has avidly parroted Russian propaganda lines to explain a wide variety of international developments.\n\nOnly somewhat less jaw-dropping is Trump's choice of former Texas Rep. John Ratcliffe to be CIA director. An even slightly less lopsided Senate would likely reject Ratcliffe out of fear that he'd politicize intelligence-as indeed he did during the brief spell, at the end of Trump's first term, when he was director of national intelligence, the office that oversees and coordinates the 18 U.S. intel agencies. But especially if enough Republicans feel they can't stomach Hegseth or Gabbard in high offices, they'll probably let Ratcliffe go through.\n\nOther beneficiaries of political payback include South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, nominated to be secretary of homeland security, and New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who is slated to be United Nations ambassador. Neither has any experience remotely related to the job they'll be handling. Both, however, have been ardent supporters and defenders of Trump; Stefanik enjoys the special distinction of rising to become chair of the House Republican Conference after Rep. Liz Cheney was ousted for criticizing Trump over the Jan. 6 riots.\n\nThe oddball of them all, the nominee who emerged out of nowhere, is Hegseth, a complete unknown to anyone who doesn't watch Fox & Friends Weekend , which he has co-hosted for a decade. Of course, Trump is one of that show's regular viewers, and, to the surprise of his advisers, he picked Hegseth to run the Department of Defense-the country's largest bureaucracy, with 2.8 million employees and a budget this year of $841 billion-because he liked a lot of what the rugged-looking co-host was saying.\n\nHegseth fought in Afghanistan and Iraq, but his rank-a major in the Army National Guard-wasn't exactly a leadership slot. He has written some bestselling books, notably The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free . In it, as well as on several Fox broadcasts, he decried the introduction of diversity requirements in the military, saying that they brought on the rise of \"woke generals,\" who in turn weakened the Army's fighting spirit. He has also said that lowering admission requirements, in order to let women join combat units, has had the same deleterious effect. (Many Army officers say that critics such as Hegseth exaggerate the amount of time spent on diversity training and that the women serving in combat-in some cases in elite units like the Rangers and Green Berets-have had to pass the same grueling tests as the men.)\n\nThe anti-woke attitude may be what appealed most to Trump, who wants to fire generals who display insufficient loyalty to him. Hegseth has said he would appoint a board of retired officers, no doubt of like mind, to draw up lists of active officers who should be dismissed.\n\nOn his Fox show, Hegseth also vigorously protested the prosecutions of soldiers for war crimes, even to the point of persuading Trump, while he was president, to pardon two perpetrators of particularly heinous murders of civilians.\n\nBut when it comes to a defense secretary's main jobs-forming budgets, assessing weapons systems, managing interservice rivalries, engaging in interagency policymaking, conducting diplomacy with foreign counterparts, and so forth-Hegseth has no apparent qualifications whatever.\n\nEven some MAGA Republicans see the merits of having someone with at least a bit of political acumen and organizational talent run an enterprise as large, complex, and vital as the Defense Department. It would take four Republican senators to reject his nomination. Some on Capitol Hill think four could be rallied to vote their conscience. If not, and if Hegseth is sworn in, others doubt he would last more than six months on the job. The Pentagon bureaucracy is deeply entrenched; it can wear out far more agile players than Hegseth.\n\nBefore launching a political crusade against military officers, Trump might also want to review the biography of his own early business lawyer and mentor Roy Cohn, who began his career as the counsel for Sen. Joseph McCarthy. Cohn, who died in 1986, could have told Trump that McCarthy-who rose to prominence by rooting out and prosecuting suspected Communists in government-made his big misstep when he went after Army officers. It was during the nationally televised Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954 that Joseph Welch, the lawyer for an accused officer, snapped back at the senator, \"Have you no sense of decency, sir?\" And that was the end not only of McCarthy's witch hunts but also of his career-and, three years later, of his life, from excessive drinking.\n\nHegseth probably read some history as an undergrad at Princeton and a master's student at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, so he might want to ponder the takeaways from this tale: Is anti-woke the new anti-communism? Will Hegseth be its Cohn or McCarthy?\n\nAs for Gabbard, picked to oversee and coordinate the 18 U.S. intelligence agencies, not much need be said beyond \" Holy shit! \" If confirmed, she will replace Avril Haines, who had been-in contrast to Gabbard's slim résumé-deputy director of the CIA and deputy national security adviser before President Joe Biden nominated her for the job. Haines also has degrees in law and theoretical physics.\n\nIf the Senate doesn't dismiss Gabbard's nomination as an insult to the enterprise of intelligence gathering and analysis, then we are in serious trouble as a nation. At the very least, one can expect hundreds of intelligence professionals to resign-which may be Trump's intention. He wants to destroy \"the administrative state,\" as his erstwhile strategist Steve Bannon once put it. Putting Gabbard in charge of the intelligence apparatus is one way of doing that.\n\nRatcliffe's nomination as CIA director is only slightly less egregious. In many ways, his and Gabbard's selections are more appalling than even that of Hegseth. Although defense secretaries are expected to carry out the president's policies, the chief of the main intelligence agency is supposed to be rigorously independent-and Ratcliffe is anything but that.\n\nHe first came to Trump's fond attention as the congressman who most virulently spoke out against the officials probing the then president's various alleged improprieties, most notably the Mueller commission delving into tales of Trump's collusion with Russia. Trump wanted to nominate Ratcliffe as director of national intelligence until even Republican senators warned him that the Texas congressman was too partisan and inexperienced for the job. Trump nominated a more moderate congressman, Dan Coats, who filed too many honest reports that were at odds with Trump's own talking points about Iran, North Korea, and Russia. In his final year as president, Trump fired Coats and nominated Ratcliffe, this time sticking by his defender. The Republicans, riding Trump's coattails as the 2020 elections approached, relented. Ratcliffe was confirmed by a narrow margin, 49-44.\n\nIn his 18 months on the job, Ratcliffe confirmed every fear about him, using his office to validate several conspiracy theories , many of them about Trump's political opponents. Among them was a claim that in the 2016 election, the Russians had backed Hillary Clinton more than they backed Trump, and that in the 2020 election, the Iranians had hacked into the servers of the pro-Trump Proud Boys militia group and sent emails to voters in three battleground states, warning them, \"You will vote for Trump on Election Day, or we will come after you.\" In fact, other intel agencies concluded that the Russians had backed Trump, not Clinton, in 2016. And even Ratcliffe had to admit, in the report on the battleground-state emails, that the evidence on Iranian involvement was inconclusive.\n\nJust over a week into Trump's transition to the White House, the once and future president is making good on his most hair-raising threats. Those who dismissed his agenda as theatrics, telling us not to worry, that he doesn't mean them, or that institutional guardrails will keep them from happening-well, we shall see. It's up to four Republican senators out of 53 to play hero, and as Liz Cheney learned, playing hero in defiance of Donald Trump can end your career.

      "text": "Why Are \"America First\" Republicans Lining Up to Support Israel's Military?\n\nIn the years since Donald Trump was elected, a variety of Republican politicians, writers, and think tanks have declared that his positions constitute a new kind of conservatism. It's often referred to as the \"America First\" ideology and accompanied by the claim that the GOP is, or is becoming, a party for \"working people\" rather than \"the establishment\"-and that the interests of working people don't include intervention abroad.\n\nA central plank of the America First platform, born out of candidate Trump's claim that the invasion of Iraq was a mistake, is that MAGA Republicans shouldn't support \"endless war\" or \"forever war\"-particularly the deployment of U.S. troops in the Middle East, or the provision of weapons and other aid to Ukraine. While president, Trump himself had to be talked out of withdrawing from NATO , the U.S.'s most significant commitment to common international defense; earlier this year, he claimed to object to the perpetuation of the war in Ukraine on humanitarian grounds , arguing that he would negotiate its end in short order were he to hold office again. Senators such as Missouri's Josh Hawley and Ohio's J.D. Vance have denounced the U.S.'s support for the besieged European nation as a waste of resources that would be better put toward security at the U.S.-Mexico border or deterring China , while Hawley has complained about the United States' involvement in \"constant intervention\" around the world and its \"massive, permanent presence in the Middle East.\" The abortive America First Caucus in the House wrote in its would-be founding manifesto that \"sending taxpayer money outside of the nation is generally an unwise undertaking and an entanglement that rarely provides any benefit to our citizens.\"\n\nMore broadly, this wing of the party has been dismissive of the idea that regular Americans have an emotional interest in the protection of populations abroad. In their view, concern for the plight of Ukrainians is sometimes denounced as an affectation of \"globalism\"-friendly cosmopolitans who identify more with the interests of elites in other countries than with regular Joes and Janes in the heartland. As Vance famously told right-wing operative Steve Bannon during last year's Ohio Senate primary, \"I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or the other.\" (He has since said the invasion of the country was a \"tragedy\" and that he is sympathetic to what Ukrainians are experiencing.) Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who now heads an organization called America First Legal, told Tucker Carlson with disdain that Ukraine support was the product of \"a fetish in Washington for the citizens of foreign countries.\"\n\nThese positions have appealed to the conspiratorial, online \"alt-right,\" whose members believe the Ukraine war has been orchestrated by globalists, neoconservatives , or just plain Jews in order to profit from military spending or inflict death and immiseration on \"white\" populations. Given the tendency of conspiracy theories to overlap, some of the individuals who hold these beliefs have coalesced behind the presidential candidacy of anti-vaccine ex-Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has said that Russia was \" acting in good faith \" toward Ukraine before it was provoked into war by the U.S. (He, too, has denounced the actual invasion as \"brutal.\") RFK's profile on X (formerly Twitter) says that, as president, he would \"end the forever wars.\"\n\nTaken all together, there is enough anti-Ukraine feeling on the right that, in late September, the Biden administration and Democrat-controlled Senate felt obligated to agree with the Republican-controlled House on a short-term government funding compromise that didn't include the $6 billion in additional Ukraine aid that had initially been planned.\n\nPut simply, though, the isolationists' response to Hamas' attacks on Israel has not been isolationist. The Heritage Foundation, despite its America First turn under the leadership of new director Kevin Roberts, has announced that it \" stands with Israel \"-which, in context, as Emily Tamkin explained in Slate on Tuesday , is a phrase that implies support for current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, which has been aggressive in its push to extend Israeli settlements into areas of the West Bank previously reserved for Palestinians. Vance said in a statement that the U.S. should \"stand with our allies in Israel\" as it strikes back against Hamas with \"overwhelming force.\" Hawley has called for shifting military funding from Ukraine to Israel because the latter faces an \"existential threat,\" and RFK Jr.'s statement about the matter said that the U.S. should take \"unwavering, resolute, and practical action\" to support \"a sustained military campaign\" against Hamas in Gaza.\n\n(Not everyone is on board. Alt-right figures Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec have warned vaguely but darkly that factions within the United States will attempt to use the Hamas attack as a pretext for launching an attack on Iran. RFK Jr.'s statement was hammered by commenters accusing him of creating a new forever war.)\n\nWhat's the rationale for supporting Israel but not Ukraine? To be generous, one might argue that Israel is a more established U.S. ally than Ukraine, that involvement in a conflict with a global power like Russia has more potential strategic downsides than involvement in a conflict with Hamas, and that the exclusive targeting of civilians by a nonstate actor is a more blatant violation of international order than the invasion of a neighboring country over a historic territorial dispute. Said Victoria Coates, a former adviser to Trump and the Heritage Foundation's vice president for national security and foreign policy: \"One can make a moral case for supporting Israel based on shared values, a shared history of democracy, but the case is also very practical-its intelligence-sharing capabilities, its strategic position in the eastern Mediterranean projecting both east and west, its contribution to the stability of international energy markets.\" (She also observes that Ukraine, unlike Israel, could be reasonably expected to draw non-U.S. support from European neighbors and allies.)\n\nBeing less charitable, though, one might suggest that support for Netanyahu's government might be related to the increasingly rightward arc of his career. Netanyahu has formed a coalition with Israel's most extreme religious parties, attempted to consolidate constitutional power through \"reform\" proposals that have triggered widespread domestic protests , and hosted visits by right-wing leaders like Vladimir Putin and Hungary's Viktor Orbán, whose policies have been cited as a model for the American right by intellectuals like Vance and Carlson. Carlson and figures like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz have contrasted what they see as American softness and liberalism with the purportedly robust state of traditional Christianity, masculinity, and resistance to \"cancel culture\" in Putin's Russia. Trump, a noted admirer of Putin's ruthless style, helped advance Netanyahu's belligerent domestic interests by moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The relative treatment of Israel and Ukraine-Russia's enemy-isn't a contradiction if the actual issue at stake, rather than the protection of American resources, is the expression of solidarity with leaders who share an \"America First\"-like interest in ethnic purity, cultural conservatism, and the rollback of democratic institutions.\n\nThis might not be what motivates every conservative drawing a distinction between the two countries-Coates says she'd be calling for military aid for Israelis at the moment regardless of where its government stood on the left-right continuum. But it also wouldn't be the first time that a nominally defensible conservative policy goal was carried along by a darker undercurrent. Perhaps the lesson of recent days is that there is no Republican isolationist movement-just a transition toward a new, more brutal kind of internationalism whose alliances are only beginning to form.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Jim Jordan's Speakership Bid Collapses, Democracy Dodges a Bullet\n\nThis week saw MAGA Republicans engage in extremist arm-wrestling in the House speaker race and the sins of the 2020 election subversion scheme begin to catch up with Donald Trump's closest allies. On this week's episode of the Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick spoke to newly minted MacArthur genius grant recipient Ian Bassin of Protect Democracy to take a look at the stakes of this moment for American democracy. Protect Democracy's work focuses on the technical ways the law can be applied to protect election workers and inhibit disinformation while also addressing the big constitutional and cultural questions we must answer if we're going to reject authoritarianism. Their discussion of the utter mayhem unfolding around the House speaker contest, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nDahlia Lithwick: I'm just going to turn to the Chaos Muppets for a minute. You know, one of the things that we are looking at this week is whatever it is that is happening in the speaker's race.\n\nI'm going to confess to you that a law professor friend sent me an email that chilled me to the bone this week, suggesting that if Jim Jordan won the speakership, he would simply never certify a Biden election win.\n\nBut I wonder if you could just help me understand what it means to have a nonfunctioning House of Representatives at this moment, what power is the speaker of the House going to have in the 2024 election, and whether the reforms you all made to the Electoral Count Reform Act can somehow sort of hedge against the absolute catastrophe we've seen unfolding for the last two weeks in the House?\n\nIan Bassin: Let's go from darkness to light. I'm going to agree with the law professor friend of yours. In advance of the 2020 election, one of my colleagues, Erica Newland, a brilliant attorney who served in the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice, was tasked by our team to dig into what were all of the mechanisms by which Congress could subvert the election results, and what were all the mechanisms by which those in Congress who were committed to their oaths of office and upholding our constitutional order could try to prevent the body from doing that. And after doing that research, after the inauguration, Erica commented on an internal call to our team that it occurred to her, as she dug into it, that if the current iteration of the Republican Party is in control of Congress on Jan. 6, 2025, there is no way that they will certify a win if it turns out that a Democrat is legitimately elected in the 2024 election.\n\nSo let that sink in. I still believe that that is the most likely outcome if the current Republican Party is in control of one or both of the houses of Congress. Now recall that the Congress that presides over the counting of Electoral College ballots is the new Congress that is elected in 2024. So whatever Congress is elected in 2024 will be seated on Jan. 3, 2025, and then will oversee the counting of Electoral College ballots on Jan. 6, 2025. So it's not the current Congress. It's the new one.\n\nBut all we have seen from the Republican Party over the last six years is that they are moving further and further and further in the direction of being entirely MAGA-fied or Trumpified. So, if they prevail in the 2024 election, it seems likely that that Congress will be even more Trumpified than the one that is sitting now, which is kind of hard to believe. That's the dark part of it.\n\nThe light part of it is that as much as it is terrifying, and should be, that 200-plus members of the Republican caucus voted to make Jim Jordan, Donald Trump's key lieutenant in the Congress, the speaker, as of the moment that we are recording this, that has been thwarted. A handful of GOP members in the House have stood firm and blocked Jim Jordan from being speaker. And it looks like we may end up with, essentially, is some form of compromise. ...\n\nAnd I think if that holds, and that's a big if , this is one of the most important developments in this country over the last seven-plus years. And here's why. I'm going to invoke another recent story in the news that I think is really important to pay attention to, which is the elections this past week in Poland. So, in Poland this past week, a coalition that ran from the center-right to the left united and pulled off a stunning upset of the illiberal nationalist and ever more authoritarian-leaning Law and Justice party , which has governed Poland for the better part of the last decade or so.\n\nWhy is that important? Because history teaches that the way to defeat authoritarian movements is to form a very broad pro-democracy coalition of people who typically disagree about policy and politics. This is why I talked about how our strategy at Protect Democracy is to build a broad coalition of pro-democracy progressives, moderates, and conservatives.\n\nLet's go back to the interwar period in Europe. During that time, there were far-right, extremist, authoritarian movements rising across the continent. In some countries, Belgium and Finland in particular, the mainstream center-right parties saw those extremists for what they were, as threats to the system, and they held their noses and formed a united coalition with their traditional opponents on the left to block those extremists from power.\n\nIn Italy and Germany, the mainstream center-right parties made a different calculation. They gambled that they could ride the energy of the far-right extremists to power, and sideline the leaders of those far-right movements. We know how tragically that gamble turned out. For most of the last six years, the American Republican Party, by and large, has chosen the German and Italian path.\n\nIf they continue to do that, I think we can expect similarly tragic results. But what we may be witnessing in the House this week is the first potential signs that they might choose the Belgian, Finnish, and Polish path, or at least enough of them. Now, I'm not naïve enough to be super optimistic about that just yet, because the Republican Party of late has not given me enough confidence to be super optimistic about that. But I continue to push for it, and I think we all need to continue to push for it, because I think it is the single most important thing we could do to save democracy in the United States. So I am cautiously optimistic that if, in fact, Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick McHenry does gain some degree of ongoing power to be speaker on the backs of some form of coalition, that may be one of the most positive signs we've seen in the last seven years that the United States will survive this moment.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Slate's guide to the most important figures in politics this week.\n\nWelcome to this week's edition of the Surge, a politics newsletter that the Supreme Court is expected to ban in the next term for being \"too hip.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court is on vacation, and you are in hell. But a surprisingly close special election in Nebraska could indicate that a maximally conservative SCOTUS term could indeed fire up Democrats to turn out. Another advantage Senate Democrats have: lousy Republican competition. And we'd like to introduce you to our favorite candidate discovery of the week-in Arizona.\n\nBut first, it's Hutch time.\n\nBy Jim Newell\n\nThe former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows testified in a special \"bonus\" hearing this week that Donald Trump isn't just unfit to hold the presidency, he's unfit to eat lunch. Hutchinson alleged that, on Jan. 6, Trump directed a mob that he knew to be armed toward the Capitol; told Meadows that Mike Pence deserved to have the mob that was chanting \"Hang Mike Pence!\" find him; and then, in a fit of pique with former Attorney General Bill Barr, threw ketchup-coated food against the wall. (There was more, but those are some of the highlights.) The allegation that's prompted the most post-hearing mudslinging, though, was Hutchinson's recollection of a former deputy chief of staff, Tony Ornato, telling her on Jan. 6 that Trump, sitting in his vehicle, had lunged for both the steering wheel and his own bodyguard when told they wouldn't take him to the Capitol. Secret Service sources and \"those close to Ornato\" (is that you, Tony?) have since denied the accusations of lunging-though not Trump's righteous anger at not being able to visit the Capitol to do ... whatever he was planning to do there. The dispute has since turned into an anonymously sourced dogfight, with MAGA Republicans smearing Hutchinson as a know-nothing striver looking for an MSNBC deal and her defenders leaking stories about Ornato as a Trump loyalist with a history of dishonesty. A few points. First, Hutchinson said plenty that was extremely damaging to Trump beyond the steering-wheel anecdote. Second, the committee should've had the tiny details more pinned down before going public so as to deny Trump loyalists an opening to dispute the entire testimony. Third, who are you more likely to believe is on the up-and-up here? The person in her 20s who was willing to blow up her career in Republican politics and be forced to live with extra security for the foreseeable future? Or the one who is intimidating witnesses with mob-ass texts before they testify?\n\nThe first term of the 6-3 conservative Supreme Court-sometimes only 5-4, when John Roberts was worried about his liberal friends being mad!-has concluded. It was insane. The court eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion, swapped in a right to carry guns outside the home, and ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency needs to buzz off if it even thinks about regulating carbon emissions. And that's just a taste of what they did in the last week of the term . The good news is that the court is now off for the summer. The bad news is that they will come back in the fall. And in one of the last orders they released before bouncing on Thursday, they announced that, come autumn, they will hear a case regarding the \"independent state legislatures\" theory, a hyper-literalist reading of the Constitution that would give state legislatures sole authority over their election laws for federal office. A maximalist ruling on this could effectively negate anything state courts, governors, or state agencies want to do on gerrymandering or election administration. And since all we really get now are maximalist rulings ... well, enjoy the summer!\n\nSnooty \"conventional wisdom\"-of the fancy Washington Elite Establishment kind-holds that the Dobbs ruling should mitigate Democrats' losses in November, though not reverse the overall pro-Republican lean of the cycle. Well, here's what we think about this so-called expert opinion from the \"Georgetown cocktail party\" crowd: Um ... yeah, that sounds about right. And yet ... we were beginning to get skeptical that Democrats could even successfully use this to mitigate their losses, given how so much of the party seems bent on pointing fingers at one another rather than at the Republicans who installed this radical court. But there was one notable piece of evidence this week that demonstrated that Democrats are pissed off enough to turn out and vote-and it wasn't a few noisy generic ballot polls. There was a special election in Nebraska this week to replace Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, who resigned from Congress to spend more time with his probation. Though Nebraska's 1 st District got a touch more Democratic in redistricting, it's still, per FiveThirtyEight's assessment, a safe, R+17 rated district. Republican Mike Flood won the district, but only by a surprisingly narrow six-point margin, 53 to 47, over Democrat Patty Pansing Brooks. Pansing Brooks campaigned hard on abortion rights in the final days of the campaign following the Dobbs decision. So don't assume that Democrats will blow the post- Dobbs politicking just yet. (Give them, like, two more weeks for that.)\n\nFiveThirtyEight also released its early forecast of the midterms this week. And though its House forecast aligns with the popular understanding-Democrats need a miracle to hold it-the Senate forecast was pretty tight, essentially showing that control of the body is a 50-50 proposition. That's not something you'd expect in a midterm cycle where the Democratic president's average approval rating is just below 40 percent. But Republicans have candidate problems. In Pennsylvania, Mehmet Oz won a nasty Republican primary with a bare plurality of voters and only because Trump asked them to, almost as a personal favor. In the first couple of polls, he's trailing the Democrat, John Fetterman, and Oz's favorability numbers are horrible: Only 30 percent of voters viewed him favorably in an AARP poll, and only 28 percent in a Suffolk poll. In Georgia, a Quinnipiac poll this week found Herschel Walker trailing Sen. Raphael Warnock by 10 points. In Arizona, Trump ran off the obvious candidate (Gov. Doug Ducey) and now the Republican front-runner is one of those techie-nationalist Peter Thiel-funded creeps. We should expect some of these early polls to tighten as the fundamentals of the cycle-namely, Biden's trash approval rating-assert themselves. But candidates matter, too. And Republicans' Senate crop? EHHHHH, it's a little stinky, folks. A LEEEEEETLE stinky.\n\nFor months, it's been difficult to figure out how seriously to treat Democrats' efforts to revive a slimmed-down resurrection of the Build Back Better Act. Sens. Joe Manchin and Chuck Schumer will meet for hours, and then Manchin will say something like We're talkin', talkin', I don't know, what's a bill, and who even am I? when reporters ask him how discussions are going. But NBC News reported this week that Democrats are close enough to a deal on prescription drug costs-a linchpin of any package that would come together-that they're ready to scrub it to make sure it conforms with Senate rules. The more telling signal that this is getting serious, though, is the seriousness with which Mitch McConnell is taking it-and he's at the \"making threats to unrelated things\" stage of seriousness. \"Let me be perfectly clear,\" McConnell's office said. \"There will be no bipartisan USICA as long as Democrats are pursuing a partisan reconciliation bill.\" He's referring to the United States Innovation and Competition Act, a bill to boost technological competitiveness with China that the House and Senate have been negotiating for months. Is this a threat he can really maintain? Is McConnell just going to, say, tell automakers that they won't get a flood of cash for semiconductors because Democrats passed a separate bill to cut drug costs? We guess all that matters is how seriously Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema take the threat.\n\nBoth the Democratic president and the Democratic Congress have been taking heat for not doing enough since the release of the Dobbs decision. But sometimes you just lose , and Democrats lost this in 2014 (when Ruth Bader Ginsburg came to the conclusion that she would live forever). One thing the administration could not do, though, is accede to Mitch McConnell's requests to appoint more Federalist Society, anti-abortion judges to the federal judiciary. That appears to be in the works, though! Biden is preparing to nominate a certain \"Chad Meredith\" to the bench in Kentucky. McConnell, in exchange, would apparently stop blocking Democrats' preferred nominees for U.S. attorney in the state, as Slate's Mark Joseph Stern reported. Democrats in Kentucky are furious at the reported deal. Gov. Andy Beshear said that \"if the president makes that nomination, it is indefensible.\" Rep. John Yarmuth told Slate that Meredith \"represents everything that is anathema to Democrats.\" The White House isn't commenting on the reports. It's one thing to not be able to magically restore abortion rights with the stroke of an administrative pen. It's another to say to McConnell, in the aftermath of McConnell's legacy achievement, Here, have another.\n\nWe would like to introduce you to Paola Tulliani Zen, Republican candidate for Arizona governor, who has earned 2 percent in one primary poll and did not register in the other. Now, we all know what the key is to winning a statewide election in Arizona: Capturing the Italian vote. That's what Tulliani Zen, who has a fantastic website bio with choice art and a rich timeline of her life, is dedicated to doing. We first noticed her strategy in a clip from a gubernatorial debate where, frustrated that she was being interrupted, she delivered a perfectly executed \"mamma mia!\" We then checked out the ad she had released a few days earlier. In it, she-wielding a butcher knife-says, \"I'm going to cut the fat off the government just like I cut the fat off my prosciutto.\" Now this is kind of a mixed bag. Her pronunciation of prosciutto is-and we cannot stress this enough-absolutely impeccable. But ... \"cut the fat off my prosciutto\"? Is that what we do with prosciutto? Cut the fat off of it? Hmm. We'll be monitoring Paola Tulliani Zen closely until the August primary.\n\nThe most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Biden attacks Trump and MAGA Republicans as threat to American democracy\n\nHe is sharpening his attacks on \"MAGA Republicans\" as the midterms loom.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, in a rare prime-time speech, condemned Donald Trump and his \"MAGA Republicans\" as he urged the nation to unite against threats to American democracy.\n\nBiden took the stage shortly after 8 p.m. on Thursday at Independence Historical Park in Philadelphia, where several hundred people were sitting in white lawn chairs and Independence Hall's facade was lit up in red and blue.\n\n\"This is where the United States Constitution was written and debated,\" Biden said. \"This is where we set in motion the most extraordinary experiment of self-government the world has ever known.\"\n\n\"But as I stand here tonight, equality and democracy are under assault,\" he continued. \"We do ourselves no favor to pretend otherwise. So, tonight, I've come to this place where it all began, to speak as plainly as I can to the nation about the threats we face, about the power we have in our hands to meet these threats and about the incredible future that lies in front of us if only we choose it.\"\n\nThe president mentioned his Oval Office predecessor by name as he assailed Republicans who refuse to accept the 2020 election results, defend those who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 or want to strip away abortion rights and other privacy concerns.\n\n\"Too much of what's happening in our country today is not normal,\" he said. \"Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.\"\n\nBiden made a distinction between the so-called MAGA Republicans and other conservatives, stating \"not every Republican embraces that extreme ideology.\"\n\n\"I know, because I've been able to work with these mainstream Republicans,\" he said. \"But there's no question that the Republican party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans and that is a threat to this country.\"\n\nBiden's urgent rhetoric mirrors his 2020 messaging, in which he presented himself as a clear contrast to Trump and the race itself as an inflection point for the nation.\n\nHe made that comparison again Thursday, telling the crowd: \"Now America must choose to move forward or to move backward, to build a future obsessed about the past, to be a nation of hope, unity, and optimism or a nation of fear, division and of darkness.\"\n\nAdministration officials had teased Biden's speech as an extension of his \"soul of the nation\" message, which first emerged in 2017 after white nationalists clashed with counter protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia -- the incident Biden said inspired him to run for president.\n\nBiden on Thursday said all Americans are called by \"duty and conscience to confront extremists\" and to reject political violence.\n\n\"We are still at our core a democracy, and yet, history tells us that blind loyalty to a single leader and a willingness to engage in political violence is fatal to democracy,\" he said.\n\nBiden's appearance in Philadelphia is his second of three stops in the battleground state of Pennsylvania this week alone.\n\nAt Wilkes University, where made the case Tuesday for his administration's plan for policing and crime prevention, Biden went after MAGA Republicans for their response to the Jan. 6 attack and the FBI search at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\n\"For God's sake, whose side are you on? Whose side are you on?\" a fired-up Biden asked.\n\nThe GOP issued a preemptive rebuttal of Biden's remarks, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy speaking in Scranton (Biden's hometown) just hours before the president took the stage in Philadelphia.\n\nMcCarthy criticized Democrats on inflation, crime and the border before demanding Biden \"apologize for slandering tens of millions of Americans as fascists\" after the president previously described the ideology being adopted by MAGA Republicans as \"semi-facism.\"\n\n\"What Joe Biden doesn't understand is that the soul of America is the tens of millions of hard working people, loving families, and law-abiding citizens whom he vilified for simply wanting a stronger, safer, and more prosperous country,\" McCarthy said.\n\n\"The soul of America is not the ruling class in Washington, it is the law-abiding, tax-paying American citizen,\" McCarthy said. \"The soul of America is our determination to get up and go to work everyday, provide for our families, to love our children, be involved in their education and ensure that this nation and its people always come first.\"\n\n- ABC News' Justin Gomez, Mary Bruce, Sarah Kolinovsky and Molly Nagle contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Biden identifies 2022 campaign opponents: MAGA and Trump: The Note\n\nBiden is signaling that he wants to make the 2022 election about Trump.\n\nThe TAKE with Rick Klein\n\nA 2024 rematch for the presidency may or may not happen. But President Joe Biden is signaling that he wants to make the 2022 election about former President Donald Trump - and about the movement he still leads.\n\nOn one level, Biden's speech Thursday night in Philadelphia narrowed his critique of Republicans. He ditched \"semi-fascism\"-type language to emphasize that, in his view, \"not even the majority of Republicans are MAGA Republicans.\"\n\nBut by going squarely at Trump and his devoted followers, Biden is raising the stakes of the midterms in part by singling out voters he is all-but conceding won't have their minds changed.\n\n\"MAGA Republicans have made their choice,\" the president said, in an ostensibly official - as opposed to political - speech, with a striking backdrop that included two Marines standing at attention. \"They embrace anger. They thrive on chaos. They live not in the light of truth, but in the shadow of lies.\"\n\nIt's a stark message that is unlikely to be particularly attractive to Republicans - and that could make for an immediate turn-off for anyone looking for an excuse to oppose the party now in power in Washington.\n\nIt was also a message delivered by a president now on the political upswing, leading a party with actually realistic hopes of outperforming expectations in the midterms. Democrats may not love the idea of Biden on the trail with them, but Trump led the GOP through elections that lost the party the House, the Senate and, yes, the presidency - with Biden at the top of the ticket that time.\n\nThe president framed the November choice as \"to move forward or to move backward.\" Both Biden and Trump, though, are finding it useful if not necessary to focus on the recent past.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with Averi Harper\n\nAs Biden ramps up midterm messaging emphasizing the threat to democracy and calling out so-called \"MAGA republicans,\" the GOP is pushing a message of its own.\n\n\"It's clear to me and clear to you is that Washington and the White House aren't listening,\" said Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy during remarks in Scranton, Pennsylvania. McCarthy, borrowing terminology from Biden, later added, \"Joe Biden has launched an assault on the soul of America.\"\n\nHis ambition to be speaker of the house rides on the GOP's ability to deliver a \"red wave\" of Republican victories on Election Day. Republican efforts to take control of both the house and the senate are arguably on shaky ground.\n\nSenate minority leader Mitch McConnell's recent comment that candidate quality would determine who will take control of the senate has been interpreted as a jab at Republican candidates and an attempt to temper expectations heading into November. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who heads up the GOP's senate campaign committee, spoke out about it.\n\n\"If you trash talk our candidates ... you hurt our chances of winning, and you hurt our candidates' ability to raise money,\" Scott said to Politico. \"I know they're good candidates, because I've been talking to them and they're working their butts off.\"\n\nAll the while, former President Trump's continued focus on 2020 election lies and justification of January 6 still loom over the party. Trump told conservative radio host Wendy Bell he would issue pardons and apologies to those charged in connection to the attack at the Capitol. He even said he is boosting some of those charged financially.\n\n\"I am financially supporting people that are incredible and they were in my office actually two days ago, so they're very much in my mind,\" Trump said. \"It's a disgrace what they've done to them. What they've done to these people is disgraceful.\"\n\nThe TIP with Hannah Demissie\n\nCould a different method of voting be on the rise?\n\nFollowing the first test of rank-choice voting in Alaska's special House election, where we saw Democrat Mary Peltola come out victorious against former Gov. Sarah Palin and Nick Begich, politicians spoke out on the state's new system of voting.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton rebuked rank-choice voting on Twitter , saying it's \"a scam to rig elections.\" Rep. Adam Kinzinger said on Twitter that \"rank-choice voting gives all Americans a voice and not the extremes of a party.\"\n\nKinzinger's remarks align with those who support rank-choice voting, hoping it could lead to less polarizing elections and push candidates to reach beyond their base voters.\n\nRanked voting works like this: If a candidate in the general election wins more than 50% of first-choice votes, they win the race outright. Otherwise, the candidate with the least amount of first-place votes is eliminated and that candidate's voters instead have their ballots redistributed to their second choice.\n\nOnce all the ballots were counted in the race, Begich was the candidate with the least amount of first-choice votes and was eliminated. Those who voted for Begich had their votes redistributed to their second-ranked candidate, which saw Peltola come out on top.\n\nPeltola will only serve the remainder of the late Rep. Don Young's term, which ends in January. She is on the ballot again in November -- along with Palin and Begich to try and win a full two-year term which would begin next year. The state will use rank-choice voting for that election as well. Despite losing to Peltola, Begich and Palin have made it clear that they intend to stay on the ballot for November.\n\n\"Though we're disappointed in this outcome, Alaskans know I'm the last one who'll ever retreat,\" Palin said in a statement following her loss. \"Instead, I'm going to reload. With optimism that Alaskans learn from this voting system mistake and correct it in the next election, let's work even harder to send an America First conservative to Washington in November.\"\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY, powered by FiveThirtyEight\n\n18. That's the number of percentage points by which Democrats have outperformed the partisan lean of Alaska's at-large district in its special election. On average, Democrats have now overperformed by 11 points in the five special elections held since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in late June. But as FiveThirtyEight's Nathaniel Rakich writes, Alaska's special election was a weird one - it used ranked-choice voting, which most states don't do, and Republicans' top candidate, former Gov. Sarah Palin, was flawed.

      "text": "Wisconsin Supreme Court candidates set to debate amid race about Trump, Musk and major issues\n\nThe race could preview how Wisconsin voters feel about Trump's second term.\n\nA closely watched Wisconsin Supreme Court election takes center stage as Republican-backed Brad Schimel and Democratic-backed Susan Crawford are set to debate on Wednesday, locked in a race for a seat that is technically nonpartisan but has become the center of a political firestorm.\n\nThe April 1 election will determine which of the candidates, vying to replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, will help determine the ideological bent of the court, which currently leans liberal. The winner will join the bench as the court grapples with hot-button issues such as abortion access and redistricting.\n\nThe race could also preview how voters in the battleground state feel a few months into President Donald Trump's second term.\n\n\"They're using it as a test as to President Trump's popularity,\" Janine Geske, a law professor at Marquette University and a former Wisconsin Supreme Court justice, told ABC News. \"He took Wisconsin in the election. And the question is, how will this election go?\"\n\nThe debate, hosted by ABC affiliate WISN-TV at Marquette University Law School, will air online and on ABC News affiliates across Wisconsin at 7 p.m. Central time on Wednesday.\n\nSchimel, the candidate backed by Republicans, is a former state attorney general who is a circuit court judge in Waukesha County.\n\n\"I got in this race 16 months before Election Day because I recognize ... you gotta meet voters where they are,\" Schimel told WISN in February.\n\nCrawford, backed by Democrats, is a Dane County circuit court judge and a former private attorney. She at points represented Democratic-aligned groups such as Planned Parenthood, an organization supporting abortion access.\n\n\"I have spent a lot of time talking about my record, my background as a prosecutor, as a lawyer representing people in court and standing up for their rights,\" Crawford told WISN in February.\n\nOver $40 million has been spent on ad reservations, both aired already and for future reservations, in the race, according to advertisement tracking firm AdImpact . ( Recent polling from the Marquette University Law School showed a sizable percentage of voters do not have an opinion on either candidate.)\n\nThe election is also seen as one indication of Elon Musk's influence beyond Washington, where he has overseen major cuts to the federal government.\n\nA conservative group affiliated with Musk, Building America's Future, has spent more than $1.6 million on television ads in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, while another one Musk backs, America PAC, has spent over $6 million on get-out-the-vote efforts and digital media, according to state campaign finance records. The expenditures are marked as either opposing Crawford or supporting Schimel.\n\nMusk himself has not weighed in much directly about the race, but he posted on X last month urging people to \"vote Republican for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to prevent voting fraud!\" Schimel has said he has never spoken to Musk and told reporters in February , \"I don't have any agenda that I'm working alongside anyone.\"\n\nThese groups' investment in the race has sparked pushback from Democrats.\n\n\"Wisconsin voters don't like Elon Musk running our federal government and they don't want him buying elections in Wisconsin either,\" Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin said in a statement on Monday.\n\nCrawford's own support has not been free of scrutiny. Schimel and his supporters have pointed to major donors seemingly supporting Crawford, including liberal billionaire George Soros and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat. According to state campaign finance records, those individuals donated to the Wisconsin Democratic Party , and the state party has donated $2 million to Crawford.\n\nCrawford has said she has made no promises to any donors and has also emphasized her independence.\n\nWhile this election is being eyed nationally as the first major race of 2025, experts and supporters of either candidate say it also could have major impacts for the state of Wisconsin, including on issues such as redistricting, voting rights and abortion access.\n\nFor example, there is a Wisconsin Supreme Court case regarding if the Wisconsin Constitution protects the right to an abortion, which the court might consider after the new justice is seated.\n\nWisconsin has an 1849 statute on the books that would effectively limit all abortions in the state, although the law is not enforced.\n\nIf the court were to determine in a different case that the statute is still in effect and later that abortion access is not protected by the Wisconsin Constitution, it could mean abortion is determined illegal in Wisconsin, Chad Oldfather, another law professor at Marquette University, told ABC News.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that Schimel had previously indicated support for leaving the 1849 law in place. More recently, Schimel told WISN that on abortion access cases, \"I treasure life even when it's not planned, but I respect that the law puts this in the hands of voters, and I will respect their will. ...

      "text": "Republicans at the RNC signaled support for unions. Here's why experts are skeptical.\n\nA union leader spoke at the Republican convention this week.\n\nAt the Republican National Convention this week, Teamsters President Sean O'Brien delivered the type of full-throated union advocacy that one would not expect at a gathering of top conservative officials.\n\n\"We are not beholden to anyone or any party,\" O'Brien, whose union boasts 1.3 million members, told the audience in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. \"We want to know one thing: What are you doing to help American workers?\"\n\nThe next day, vice presidential nominee JD Vance , a Republican senator from Ohio, indicated a second-term Trump administration would lend such a hand to labor. \"We need a leader who's not in the pocket of big business but answers to the working man, union and non-union alike,\" Vance said.\n\nLabor experts who spoke to ABC News expressed deep skepticism about the Republican gestures of support for unions.\n\nThe pro-labor message comes at a time when Republicans are eager to win over working-class voters, experts noted, saying the sentiment belies the party's record of policy positions that make it harder for workers to form unions and secure union contracts.\n\nDuring his first term in office, Donald Trump weakened enforcement of federal labor regulations and appointed Supreme Court justices who issued rulings that limited union activity and worker protections, the experts said.\n\n\"Right now, both parties are in selling mode,\" Lynne Vincent, a professor of industrial and labor relations at Syracuse University, told ABC News. \"I'm hesitant to give any power to those words, without serious commitment to policies that would support labor.\"\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, the Trump campaign said the former president would improve the financial conditions of union workers, especially in the auto industry.\n\n\"Union workers and all the nation's working families are paying the price for Crooked Joe Biden's failed economic policies. Joe Biden's radical electric vehicle mandate will destroy the livelihoods of countless U.S. autoworkers while sending the U.S. auto industry to China. President Trump will reverse Joe Biden's extreme electric vehicle mandate on Day One and save the U.S. auto industry for generations to come,\" Trump campaign National Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\n\nThe Trump campaign has proposed an escalation of its tariff policy as a means of protecting U.S. businesses, thereby ensuring a robust job market and a bolstered domestic manufacturing industry.\n\n\"Trump wants jobs here in America. He wants things made in America,\" Stephen Moore, who served as an economic adviser to Trump, previously told ABC News.\n\nSome Republicans have pointed to the selection of Vance as indication of a shift in the party, placing a priority on Vance's oft-expressed views critical of large corporations and sympathetic toward workers.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., an ally of Vance, walked the picket line with members of the United Auto Workers during a strike last year.\n\nEarlier this month the Republican Party platform released vows to \"protect American workers.\" The party must \"return to its roots as the Party of Industry, Manufacturing, Infrastructure, and Workers,\" the platform added. It does not mention the word \"union.\"\n\nVance exemplifies a focus on symbolism over substance characteristic of Republican gestures in support of union workers, some experts said. The AFL-CIO, the nation's largest labor federation, gave Vance a 0% rating on its scorecard ranking elected officials' voting record for union-related issues. Hawley carries a rating of 11%, the AFL-CIO says.\n\n\"The selection of Vance as vice president did disturb the traditional corporate community that is at the core of the Republican Party,\" Erik Loomis, a labor professor at the University of Rhode Island and author of \"A History of America in 10 Strikes,\" told ABC News. \"But at the same time, neither Vance nor Hawley have supported a specific kind of legislation that helps labor unions.\"\n\nIn response to ABC News' request for comment, a press representative for Hawley pointed to an op-ed this week in which he backs bipartisan labor law reform. \"Thousands of Americans have voted to unionize in elections but can never get a contract done, often due to corporate tricks,\" Hawley wrote in Compact . \"How can we let that stand?\"\n\nABC News has reached out to Vance's office for comment.\n\nThe speech from O'Brien drew praise from some labor leaders and criticism from many others. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, lauded O'Brien in a post on X. \"Glad that he savaged big business for their greed,\" Weingarten said .\n\nAmong the critics was John Palmer, vice president at large of the Teamsters. \"It is unconscionable for any Labor leader to lend an air of legitimacy to a candidate and a political party, neither of which can be said to have done or can be expected to do, anything to improve the lives of the workers we are pledged to represent,\" Palmer wrote in a column for the Las Vegas Sun .\n\nO'Brien did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen asked about O'Brien's speech, Rebecca Pringle, president of the 3-million member National Education Association, told ABC News: \"It's everyone's right to speak their mind and for their organization.\"\n\nPringle added there should be no illusions about the Republican Party's posture toward organized labor. \"What we have experienced with Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans is that they don't care about workers and they don't support unions,\" she said.\n\nStill, polling shows a large minority of union workers support Trump. Union households prefer Biden to Trump by a margin of 50-41, an NBC News survey in February found .\n\nThe labor embrace from some speakers at the RNC this week could help Trump and his allies increase that support, some experts said.\n\n\"They're trying to expand their white working-class base,\" Harry Katz, a professor of collective bargaining at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told ABC News. \"They're not idiots.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "House Republicans regrouping after government funding bill fails\n\n38 Republicans voted against the bill they negotiated with Trump\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson said Thursday night that Republicans will \"regroup\" and \"come up with another solution\" after the government funding bill they negotiated with President-elect Donald Trump that would avert a government shutdown failed to pass.\n\nThe bill failed by a 174-235-1 vote with 38 Republicans voting against it.\n\nJohnson blamed Democrats for the bill's failure.\n\n\"The only difference on this legislation was that we would push the debt ceiling to January of 2027,\" Johnson claimed. \"I want you all to remember that it was just last spring that the same Democrats berated Republicans and said that it was irresponsible to hold the debt limit, the debt ceiling, hostage. What changed?\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries celebrated the bill's defeat, saying in a statement that Republicans were \"not serious\" about helping working class Americans.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump earlier Thursday endorsed the deal that House Republican reached to continue to fund the government through March and avoid a government shutdown at the end of the week.\n\n\"All Republicans, and even the Democrats, should do what is best for our Country, and vote \"YES\" for this Bill, TONIGHT!\" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.\n\nTrump said the \"newly agreed to American Relief Act of 2024 will keep the Government open, fund our Great Farmers and others, and provide relief for those severely impacted by the devastating hurricanes.\"\n\nHe also said that the bill would push raising the debt ceiling to January 2027 from June of next year. Congress last raised the country's borrowing limit in June 2023 and had suspended it until June 2025.\n\n\"A VERY important piece, VITAL to the America First Agenda, was added as well - The date of the very unnecessary Debt Ceiling will be pushed out two years, to January 30, 2027. Now we can Make America Great Again, very quickly, which is what the People gave us a mandate to accomplish,\" Trump wrote.\n\nGOP House leaders and Vice-President-elect JD Vance were hoping to appease both Trump's demands that any legislation to fund the government also deals with raising or eliminating the country's debt ceiling, as well as House Republicans on the right who are traditionally against any spending deal or debt limit increase.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats refused to budge from the deal they originally worked out with Republicans that Trump and Elon Musk demolished on Wednesday.\n\nJeffries called the latest proposal \"laughable\" as Democrats gathered to strategize their next move.\n\n\"The Musk-Johnson proposal is not serious. It's laughable. Extreme MAGA Republicans are driving us to a government shutdown,\" he said.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin said it was unclear who Democrats were negotiating with -- Trump or Musk.\n\nAsked about Republicans who say they have now done their part and that Democrats would own any shutdown, Raskin replied, \"It's an intolerable way of proceeding... Democrats are going to try to figure out how to salvage the public good out of the wreckage just foist upon us.\"\n\nThat bipartisan deal called for extending government spending at current levels until March and added other provisions like relief for disaster victims and farmers and a pay raise for members of Congress.\n\nThings changed Wednesday after Musk began a pressure campaign on X with multiple posts opposing the deal. Later that day Trump and Vance posted a statement calling on Congress to \"pass a streamlined spending bill,\" with the president-elect echoing Musk's threats of primarying any GOP member who didn't comply.\n\nTrump told ABC News' Jonathan Karl Thursday morning that there will be a government shutdown unless Congress eliminates the debt ceiling or extends the limit on government borrowing before he takes office.\n\n\"We're not going to fall into the debt ceiling quicksand,\" he said. \"There won't be anything approved unless the debt ceiling is done with.\"\n\nUnder current law, the federal government would hit its borrowing limit sometime in the spring of 2025, during the first months of the second Trump presidency. Trump, however, said he wants it taken care of now, while Joe Biden is president.\n\n\"Shutdowns only inure to the person who's president,\" Trump said.\n\nSome Senate Republicans, including John Kennedy and Mike Rounds, expressed displeasure with Johnson's bill and praised Trump for stepping in.\n\nBut Sen. Thom Tillis, whose home state was devastated by Hurricane Helene, said he'd do everything in his power to slow down the passage of any government funding bill that doesn't include disaster relief.\n\nCongress faces a deadline of Friday night, when the current government funding extension expires, to pass a new one or non-essential agencies would shut down.\n\nHouse Republicans of every stripe were seen rotating in and out of the speaker's office on Thursday -- including House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, Majority Whip Tom Emmer, Texas Rep. Chip Roy and Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris of Maryland.\n\nJeffries told reporters that raising the debt limit as part of the government funding bill is \"premature at best.\"\n\n\"We are going to continue to maintain an open line of communication to see if we can resolve this issue on terms that are favorable to the everyday Americans,\" Jeffries said when asked if he was speaking to Johnson.\n\nBehind closed doors during a caucus huddle Thursday morning, Jeffries delivered the same message to Democrats: Republicans backed out of a bipartisan deal and now have to figure out a way to get out.\n\n\"This kind of chaos and dysfunction has real-world impacts on hard-working people,\" Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., said.\n\nRep. Bill Keating, D-Mass., told ABC News that Jeffries quoted President John F. Kennedy to the caucus: \"Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.\"\n\n\"He said, look, we kept all our doors open during this negotiation. We made concessions. Most of us weren't happy with the outcome of this, but you have to do your basic job. He's saying that will continue. We're open to everything, but we're not open to the kind of bullying tactics that Elon Musk is doing,\" Keating said.\n\nRep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., quipped, \"We had a deal. We negotiated a deal, and then Musk decided to change the deal. Do I call him 'President Musk?'\"\n\nTexas Rep. Greg Casar, the new chair of the progressive caucus was also critical of Musk.\n\n\"If Elon Musk is kind of cosplaying co-president here, I don't know why Trump doesn't just hand him the Oval Office, or Speaker Johnson should maybe just hand Elon Musk the gavel if they just want that billionaire to run the country,\" Casar said.\n\nWhile many Democrats support eliminating the debt limit in principle, members left their closed-door meeting opposed to striking it now as part of a spending deal, stressing it should be a separate matter.\n\nABC News' Emily Chang, Ivan Pereira and Jay O'Brien contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "What did we learn from Trump's first week?\n\nHe focused on immigration over the economy and continued to play to his base.\n\nWelcome to 538's politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited.\n\ntia.yang ( Tia Yang , senior editor): President Donald Trump's second term began on Monday, and he's already taken a record number of executive actions. A lot has happened this week, so today we thought we'd debrief and discuss what mattered most (or least), what it tells us about how Trump is approaching his second presidency and what we might expect moving forward.\n\nSo, what stood out to you all the most this week?\n\nmeredithconroy ( Meredith Conroy , political scientist at California State University, San Bernardino and 538 contributor): Right out of the gate, the Trump administration is testing the degree to which the other branches are willing to exercise their constitutional obligation to check executive power and authority with the flurry of executive orders he issued.\n\nAs we noted earlier this week , in terms of sheer number of executive orders, it's more than any modern president has issued on their first day, and in one of those orders he rescinded 78 that were signed by former President Joe Biden . Executive orders can run the gamut from what are effectively toothless press releases to major policies that are quickly actionable, and it looks like there is a mix of that among Trump's. Notably, a few are obviously unconstitutional or conflict with existing statutes (e.g. the law banning TikTok), so the extent to which the newly GOP-controlled Congress or this Supreme Court, which has been friendly to Trump on a number of issues, are open to ceding their power is being immediately tested.\n\ntia.yang: Right, already just yesterday a court halted one of those actions - the one ending birthright citizenship, a right that's been guaranteed by the Constitution for over a century. That means that, at least for now, the order won't have immediate effects and could be DOA. But what happens next could tell us something important about Trump's continuing relationship with the courts. In his first term, he appointed three justices to the Supreme Court, as well as a significant share of those serving on lower courts (some of whom could be vying for a future Supreme Court nomination from him).\n\nmeredithconroy: On birthright citizenship and how that challenges interbranch power dynamics, Adam Serwer at The Atlantic put it this way : \"Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship is an early test of the federal judiciary, and of the extent to which Republican-appointed judges and justices are willing to amend the Constitution from the bench just to give Trump what he wants.\"\n\nMonica Potts ( Monica Potts , senior politics reporter): Yes, I expect there to be so many legal challenges to nearly everything. But I think part of that is the point. Some legal ground will seem, or actually will be, unsettled because he is challenging centuries - and decades-old laws. It'll open businesses and governments up to lawsuits potentially no matter what they do.\n\nThe other thing I would say is that he has threatened to investigate local government officials and prosecutors who don't enact his policy desires, so it's setting up battles up and down the government.\n\ngelliottmorris ( G. Elliott Morris , editorial director of data analytics): Jamelle Bouie over at The New York Times also has a good point about this. His most recent column talks about an influential right-wing commentator, codenamed Mencius Moldbug, who has argued for a dictator-president (he calls his ideal form of government a monarchy via CEO-king) and is very popular with the types of Silicon Valley conservatives who are increasingly gaining power in Trump's circles. To them, and to Trump, testing the limits of power is the whole point.\n\nTo Tia's initial question, aside from the sheer breadth of Trump's interpretation of executive powers (which Meredith rightly points out will not result in immediate policy outputs for many of the executive orders he has signed), what stood out to me was how little Trump has focused on or even mentioned the one issue of his 2024 campaign that arguably did the most to get him elected: the economy.\n\nYou can see this if you look through that long list of Trump's first-week executive orders . The only ones that even mention the economy substantively* are primarily focused on energy: his declaration of a national energy emergency , which says high energy prices have \"devastated\" low-income Americans, and his broader order on domestic energy production , which aims to bolster oil and gas drilling. But economists say this will have little impact on prices of everyday goods and services.\n\n(By the way, gasoline as a share of average income is approaching a decade-long low .)\n\nBeyond this, Trump has dedicated almost all of his initial efforts to immigration. He suspended refugee resettlement and stopped flights of immigrants already cleared to land in America, canceled appointments for asylum and, of course, there's his attempt to upend birthright citizenship.\n\nI feel like this is the key theme worth watching moving forward. Trump won in 2024 in large part because people were upset about prices. Where do they go from here, especially if he pursues aggressive tariffs which many economists (and the Congressional Budget Office) believe will be inflationary ?\n\nMonica Potts: To Elliott's point about the economy: An AP-NORC poll from a few days ago showed that many voters are skeptical that Trump will be able to fulfill his promises on lowering prices, so they seem to acknowledge that that is really beyond a president's power. But you're right, many voters chose Trump because they remained upset about high prices and the affordability crisis across the board. What they likely want to see is more money in their pockets and more economic security, and I don't think many of Trump's actions so far were directly designed to do that.\n\nThat being said, a point I will hit on constantly is that presidents don't have a huge effect on the economy one way or another, at least not directly or quickly. Inflation had already returned to almost normal by the time Biden left office, and Americans will also just become used to some things costing more. I don't think they'll directly hold Trump accountable whatever happens, unless the economy is a mess in four years' time and they're deciding whether to keep Republicans in power or to change course.\n\ngelliottmorris: To that point, Monica, I'd note just how confusing it is to credit any given leader or policy with overall economic growth: My modal expectation for Trump is that he will get some credit for the economic growth that happened in the last few years of Biden's presidency. As inflation in the 2021-2023 period fades from peoples' minds, Trump will get credit for prices coming down and economic activity restarting post-pandemic. Look at the boom in building development in Austin, Texas, for example. Rents there have gone down by more than 10 percent over the last year. Biden obviously didn't get credit for that. Trump could.\n\ntia.yang: As you point out, Elliott, immigration seems to be where Trump has directed most of his focus - I want to get at why that is. Of the issues he's tackled so far, immigration seems to easily be the issue area where the public is most on his side . Do you think Trump has focused so heavily on immigration to score some easy points? And has he scored some easy points? After all, immigration consistently ranked as the other big issue that Trump and Republicans won on this fall, and is an area that presidents can have more immediate and direct impacts on than the economy.\n\nMonica Potts: I do think that a lot of the moves will score points with voters who feel that he is doing something on immigration. Polls showed that many voters did want Trump to get what they believe to be a border crisis under control.\n\nBut when asked about or pressed on some of the consequences of a tough border policy , like the potential to lose foreign workers, which will have economic effects, or splitting families apart, voters were less keen on some of those ideas. And it's hard to forget how Trump's border policies were a lightning rod for opposition during his first term, spawning massive protests and backlash. So he might get early points from some voters on that, but we'll have to see if and how these actions are enforced to truly understand how voters feel. I suspect many of these actions will prove unpopular in the long run.\n\ngelliottmorris: Tia, I think you're right about why Trump's administration is focusing executive action where they are. At the start of a term, a president wants to score big wins where he can and as fast as possible. Think about Biden's early executive orders and the policies he pushed to pass in Congress, including an extra pandemic stimulus package that was popular ( and arguably inflationary ).\n\nBut rhetoric is another matter entirely. Talk is cheap, and Trump could have gone big on all the things he will do to fix the economy. Instead, he went big on immigration, tariffs and good-old-fashioned American hegemony in his inaugural address and speeches later that day. When it comes to the economy, he promised a \"golden age\" for America ... but that was pretty much it.\n\nOf course, maybe that's the point. Inflation is firmly in the Federal Reserve's target range now . The job market is appropriately tight (putting less pressure on wages to rise, which increases prices). Overall labor force participation is high , and unemployment is at or near historic lows every month we get new data. The economy, broadly speaking, is on a tear and has been for about a year. It's likely that Trump's team knows they extracted proper political power out of Americans' dissatisfaction with high inflation during last year's election, and now as a president inheriting a good economy, they shouldn't rock the boat.\n\nmeredithconroy: The immigration issue checks a lot of boxes for the Trump administration. MAGA Republicanism has a narrow vision of what it means to be an American, and it goes part and parcel with their efforts to \"restore\" the United States as a country that is dominant, powerful and defined by a singular, exclusionary identity that many of his more vocal supporters endorse. For example, \" replacement theory \" - a conspiracy theory that nonwhite people are being brought into the U.S. to replace white voters and support Democrats - was regularly discussed on Fox News , so it was approaching a mainstream conservative view by the election.\n\nMonica Potts: Yes, Meredith, I agree with that. It's very important to MAGA Republicans and so this is where their focus will be.\n\ntia.yang: I'd also emphasize, though, that these immigration moves aren't just something that will appeal to Trump's base - the public has come around to Trump's anti-immigration policies in a big way since his first presidency. That's especially true of his party as a whole.\n\nFor one, I thought it was pretty striking that the Senate passed a GOP-backed bill to require the detention of undocumented immigrants charged with crimes, on the very day of Trump's inauguration. That bill is similar to some provisions of an executive order Trump signed later that day, and is named after Laken Riley, whose murder became a major rallying point for GOP anger over immigration throughout the 2024 election. It had already picked up some support from Democrats last year and has now passed both chambers with modest bipartisan support. It's presumably going to be the first bill Trump signs into law in his second term.\n\nThe new GOP majority scheduling that vote on Trump's first day was a powerful sign of unity behind the new president from the upper chamber, which has generally been less \"Trumpy\" than the House. I got a push alert about the Senate vote literally as I was watching the inaugural parade. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean new Majority Leader John Thune, who is more of an establishment than MAGA figure, will line up behind Trump on every issue, but the message on day one was unity behind the MAGA agenda.\n\nmeredithconroy: Yeah, that's a good point, Tia. The Trump administration was successful at elevating episodic crimes committed by undocumented immigrants or migrants during his first term, too, to garner public support for stricter immigration policies. The rapid spread of baseless claims that migrants in Ohio were eating pets , amplified by Trump during the September presidential debate, is a more recent example.\n\nMonica Potts: Right, he's been on the national stage for a decade now, and being anti-immigration was arguably how he started his presidential career . So he has probably brought some voters over to his side on this and remade the political landscape to some extent.\n\ngelliottmorris: At the same time, it's hard to know exactly what public opinion is (and what it has been previously) on some of these executive orders. That's because they are in some cases especially narrow policy proposals, with the meaning of the order turning on specific wording that doesn't always make it into polls. An AP-NORC poll conducted earlier this month found supermajority support for deporting immigrants \"who have been convicted of a violent crime\" - with higher support for immigrants who are here illegally (83 percent) versus those that are here legally (69 percent). But punishing criminals, I reckon, is probably pretty popular despite immigration status: I bet you'd also get a large percentage of Americans saying we should deport citizens who have been convicted of violent crimes.\n\nThere are a couple wrinkles here, though: First, the executive order Trump signed, and his subsequent plans for mass deportation , calls for detaining and then deporting immigrants who are arrested for, not convicted of, crimes. That is, a jury of your peers does not need to say you are guilty of a crime for the federal government to deport you, according to the new EO. That is different from the language used in the poll specifying convicted criminals and has already raised legal challenges over due process, so support for Trump's more expansive policy may be lower. (At the same time, that immigration law that just passed Congress gives state and federal immigration officials the power to deport immigrants accused of crimes, so maybe Trump will have political cover here.)\n\nAnd secondly, I could not find any poll that asks about deporting criminal undocumented immigrants from before 2024. So, we have no idea how popular this was before Trump campaigned on it last year/signed an executive order on it this year. It's possible - perhaps even likely - that this was always popular with voters, despite higher resistance to mass deportations in the recent past.\n\ntia.yang: Beyond immigration, Trump also took a load of actions that were, safe to say, not bipartisan. Many of them had to do with his plans to consolidate executive power, including by firing political opponents and installing loyalists throughout the government - seeming to make good on his campaign promises to enact \"retribution\" on his political enemies.\n\nOur colleague Nathaniel Rakich wrote on Monday about how Trump's planned actions could weaken democracy , or already have. Have we already seen him take some of those steps this week? Are they likely to succeed?\n\nMonica Potts: Oh absolutely. The pardons for Jan. 6 defendants are probably the top example of that. These are folks who were motivated by Trump's baseless claims that he won the 2020 election to try to overturn the results of a democratic election on Trump's behalf, who were fairly tried in our criminal justice system, and who Trump has now pardoned. That is a blatant disregard for the rule of law, even though pardons are within the purview of the president and something he is technically allowed to do. That weakens democracy and absolves the political violence that occurred four years ago.\n\nSpeaking of pardons, Republicans have criticized some of Biden's preemptive pardons issued before just leaving office, which included officials involved in COVID-19 policies like Dr. Anthony Fauci, officials involved in the Jan. 6 investigation like former Rep. Liz Cheney, and members of his own family. But Biden made these unprecedented pardons in direct response to Trump's promises to investigate and prosecute political enemies , so they are really part and parcel with how Trump had already eroded Democratic norms, by normalizing the targeting of government officials and public figures for political reasons. (Trump, of course, claims the Jan. 6 prosecutions and related legal cases against him were politically motivated, though experts disagree .)\n\ngelliottmorris: Yeah, pardoning people who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 and committed violent crimes along the way is decidedly not popular .\n\nSo, there's the bigger point about democratic backsliding here, but also that it represents a counter-majoritarian action by the president. This was the expected balance of Trump's actions when he was elected in 2016 by winning the Electoral College and losing the popular vote, but perhaps more surprising when he won both in 2024 and could, in theory, keep popular support by doing things that the majority of people who voted for him actually want, as opposed to taking actions that appeal primarily to his base.\n\nI'm not sure if y'all saw this in his press conference on Wednesday, but it actually looks like Trump may have been unaware that he was pardoning violent offenders when he issued those pardons - which speaks to a couple dynamics in the White House, including about the breadth of actors exerting influence on him.\n\nOr maybe it was a calculated move , and he was just lying in that press conference.\n\nmeredithconroy: I did see that, Elliott! I am not sure what to make of it. The political fallout for the administration will probably be minimal. But some of these violent offenders are people who have said they want retribution against their political enemies and may turn to political violence - so it could be a consequential mistake, if it was one.\n\ntia.yang: Elliott, I was thinking about that counter-majoritarian streak as well when you mentioned earlier what Trump notably did not address in his inauguration day speeches. In addition to big swings on the economy, we're used to hearing certain unifying rhetoric from new presidents: appeals to the opposite side, messages of hope for the country, aspirational plans.\n\nWhat we heard instead was exactly the opposite - something that sounded a lot like Trump's campaign speeches - directly attacking his predecessor and his other political opponents and leaning into issues that appeal most to his base.\n\nMonica Potts: Recent polls have shown that few voters thought Trump did a good job trying to unify the country or reach out to Harris supporters after the election, even though many say it's important he do so. And only a third expected him to \"heal political divisions\" in his second term. So he's living up to expectations on that score.\n\ntia.yang: Another note on Trump's enemies: The inauguration being held inside the Capitol (due to cold weather) really drove home the message, visually, \"I belong here\" and \"I'm the head of the government.\" This feels sort of superficial, but images like this do matter and can significantly influence how people perceive and remember events (see: that old chestnut about Richard Nixon losing the debate because he looked sickly on TV).\n\nOne enduring image of the inauguration this year will be Trump lambasting Biden and Democrats, with many of those Democrats packed into the Capitol and even sitting in frame for his entire speech. It was a huge contrast from four years ago, when he lost the election and his supporters stormed the same building - some violently, as we've discussed - threatening some of those same lawmakers sitting feet away from Trump this time around.\n\ngelliottmorris: Tia: The message conveyed here was not only \"I'm the head of government\" and \"I belong here,\" but also \"and the people in this room are who I choose to give power to.\" Mega-billionaire tech executives and ultra-right-wing donors are not who put Trump in the White House, swing voters are. I'm not convinced (and polls back this up ) that the elevation of these powerful elites is what they really wanted. Speaking literally, people voted for Trump, not for the people he has surrounded himself with.\n\nmeredithconroy: Yes, I am glad you brought up the billionaires in the front row at the inauguration. Couple this with the Trump meme coin and you don't really have the symbolism of a man of the people.\n\nMonica Potts: Right? People are really unhappy with CEOs, corporate greed, etc. And here were the richest people in the world lined up with Trump. I wonder how many of his voters, or swing voters, will square that with Trump's populist, anti-status-quo rhetoric.\n\ntia.yang: Yeah, Monica and I were just looking at some polling yesterday (which we will be covering soon!) about how one big thing driving Trump voters across the spectrum is that they're angry. They're angry at what they see as the government \"establishment\" - but they're also angry at big corporations. Trump replacing the traditional political establishment with tech and industry elites isn't what most mean when they say \"drain the swamp.\"\n\ngelliottmorris: I'll just note that a YouGov/The Economist poll released Wednesday has Mark Zuckerberg's personal favorability rating underwater by 30 points, and net-negative among Republicans as well as Democrats. I think those pictures of Trump surrounded by people worth over $1.5 trillion probably won't play well if grocery prices go up 20 percent again ( eggs, anyone ?).\n\nMonica Potts: This has always been part of the paradoxical thing about his appeal, though, right? A New York businessman born with a silver spoon in his mouth and head of the party that has always represented wealthy business interests has somehow managed to pitch himself as a champion of \"the forgotten man.\" It's ... something.\n\nmeredithconroy: That's true - Trump positioning himself as a channel for that populist anger is probably why he gets away with surrounding himself with wealthy people at the inauguration, and growing his business' wealth as president.\n\ngelliottmorris: I'm reminded that most Americans think political leaders do not represent their interests . That is true for Trump, too. So while he benefited from anger and resentment in 2024, that doesn't mean he will in the future. For example, to me it is indisputable that Trump benefited from economic conditions being bad after COVID-19 and a broader anti-incumbent wave that has swept the globe since 2021. But in two years, if people still feel the system is \"rigged\" and what-not, who do they point to? Probably the guy in charge.\n\nPutting this a different way: People did vote for change in 2024. But a negative signal against the incumbent party, against a status quo that has left people behind, etc. is not an affirmative signal for everything the opposition is offering. (The Labour government in Britain is figuring this out the hard way right now.) If Trump's team misunderstands his victory as an affirmative vote for unpopular policies and decisions that he has wrapped up in his more appealing anti-elitist, populist veneer, then, well, his second term will probably take a similar trajectory to his first .\n\n*Trump did sign a symbolic memorandum ordering heads of executive agencies to decrease prices for food and healthcare, but it included no specifics and the government does not have the power to lower prices. Trump also signed an executive order eliminating a Biden-era program that was studying implementing out-of-pocket maximums for generic pharmaceutical drugs.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Republican Party pushing mail-in voting despite Trump's opposition\n\nTrump has claimed that mail-in voting is \"totally corrupt.\"\n\nJust weeks into his tenure as chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Whatley pitched to voters something that former President Donald Trump has spoken against consistently throughout the campaign trail: mail-in voting.\n\n\"We need to build a national early-vote program that is going to communicate with [voters] through door knocks, through phone calls, through mail, through digital, through data. But we can't wait until the week before the election,\" Whatley said at the New York Republican State Committee's annual gala Thursday night -- one of his first public speeches since accepting the role last month.\n\n\"Voters can vote early. They can vote on Election Day. They can vote by mail. Do I care how they vote? No, I do not. I care that they vote,\" the Trump-backed chairman continued.\n\nDespite Trump's many deprecatory comments regarding mail-in voting, it's a plan that Republican party leaders now seem to be embracing.\n\nLara Trump, Trump's daughter-in-law whom he tapped to serve as RNC co-chair , has publicly supported early voting and vote-by-mail efforts, claiming Trump would switch his tune because of the election security initiatives the RNC was working on.\n\n\"We have to start encouraging Republican voters to do things like voting early, trust mail-in voting. These are ways that we actually can have a big lead as we head into Election Day. And these are things that traditionally Republicans have sort of shied away from,\" Lara Trump said in a NBC News interview , adding \"We're embracing it this election cycle.\"\n\nIn June, the RNC launched a \"Bank Your Vote\" initiative under the leadership of former Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel in an effort to combat Republican distrust in early voting after doubt -- perpetuated by Trump -- was cast on the results of the 2020 presidential election\n\nThough the former president has endorsed the Bank Your Vote initiative his RNC leadership is still touting, at campaign events he routinely disparages mail-in voting and has made unfounded claims about the process which he claims, in part, led to his 2020 election loss.\n\n\"Mail-in voting is totally corrupt. Get that through your head. It has to be,\" Trump said at a rally in Michigan in February, repeating unfounded claims about mail-in voting.\n\n\"Anytime the mail is involved, you're going to have cheating,\" Trump again falsely claimed during an interview with GB News' Nigel Farage last month.\n\nTrump has been more accepting of early in-person voting in recent months, urging supporters in South Carolina and New Hampshire -- where early voting is already underway -- to go out and vote. Still, his messaging hints at election denialism.\n\n\"I will secure our elections. We are going to secure our elections. Our goal will be one-day voting with paper ballots -- very simple -- and a voter ID, but until then, Republicans must win. Landslide. We want it to be too big, too big to rig,\" Trump said at an April 2 rally in Wisconsin, where he continued to falsely claim he won the state in 2020.\n\nWhatley says he's had several conversations with the former president about \"stopping the steal\" that MAGA Republicans have posited since 2020.\n\n\"First off, we are going to make sure in every single state that we have the right rules of the road, we have the right laws and regulations in place to ensure a fair election. We are going to work with state legislators, we are going to work with the regulators whether it's a secretary of state or a board of elections and we're going to make sure that we have those rules of the road set right. And if those folks won't work with us and we can't get it done, we're gonna go to court,\" he said Thursday.\n\n\"As the general counsel of the RNC and now the chair, I have filed over 80 lawsuits in 24 states around the country to make sure that it is going to be easy to vote and hard to cheat. We are also going to make sure that anytime a vote is cast or a vote is counted, we are in the room.\"\n\nTrump's critics have pointed to his rhetoric on election security as reasons why Republicans have struggled to gain leads over Democrats heading into Election Day.\n\nNow, mixed messaging from the party and its projected nominee could prevent some Republicans already skeptical of early voting practices from changing their ways, but some lawmakers say it's a necessary measure toward winning elections to implement the change they want to see.\n\n\"Embrace voting as it is. Now, I like voting on Election Day ... when I became a United States senator, I had to vote absentee,\" Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said at Trump's rally to muted claps. \"We need to embrace that. We can't afford to have a miserable Election Day on November and now have our votes already banked.\"\n\nFormer New York Rep. Lee Zeldin espoused similar sentiments with an air of sober reluctance at Thursday night's gala.\n\n\"I totally oppose universal mail-in balloting across the country. I believe that there shouldn't be ballot harvesting anywhere in any state in this country. There should be voter ID in every state in this country. But if the Democrats in Pennsylvania are going to legalize universal mail-in balloting, we have to do it better than the Democrats to the point that they regret legalizing it in the first place or we won't win these elections.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

While 82 Republicans voted against the bill, 132 voted with Speaker Mike Johnson, who saw his funding plan voted down last week as Democrats rejected inclusion of the controversial SAVE Act.\n\nThe SAVE Act, pushed by Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump, would have required proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections. Democrats said that measure was unnecessary because it's already a crime for noncitizens to vote.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump had called on congressional Republicans to allow the government to shut down over the SAVE Act before Johnson dropped the provision over the weekend. Although Johnson said he was \"not defying\" Trump when asked if the former president approved of the new funding bill, Trump called several hardline House Republicans in recent days, trying to get a last-minute change to the plan.\n\nThe measure is largely an extension of current funding levels but includes $231 million in additional aid to the Secret Service to help protect presidential candidates during the election.\n\nLater Wednesday, the Senate passed the bill by a 78-18 margin and sent it to President Joe Biden for his signature.\n\nBefore the House vote, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries pointed out that House Democrats have repeatedly helped Republicans avoid shutdowns during the current Congress.\n\n\"Can anyone name a single thing that extreme MAGA Republicans in the House have been able to do on their own to make life better for the American people? A single thing? Just one,\" he asked. \"Can the American people name a single thing that extreme MAGA Republicans have done to make their lives better? Zip, zero. So that is the track record that will be presented to the American people,\" he said.\n\nJohnson asserted Trump \"understands the current dilemma\" with House Republicans and said, \"there's no daylight between us.\"\n\nThe White House and congressional Democrats all slammed Johnson's attempt to tie the voter eligibility legislation to government funding, noting that it's already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections.\n\nThe \"clean\" short-term measure to avert a shutdown was praised by Democratic leaders and the Biden administration.\n\n\"Americans can breathe easy that because both sides have chosen bipartisanship, Congress is getting the job done,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"We will keep the government open. We will prevent vital government services from needlessly coming to a halt. We will give appropriators more time to fully fund the government before the end of the year. And I'm especially pleased we're getting the job done with some time to spare.\"\n\nIn addition to funding the government through Dec. 20, the bill includes funds to replenish FEMA and $231 million for the U.S. Secret Service in the wake a second apparent assassination attempt against Trump.\n\nABC News' Allison Pecorin contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Is there really a non-MAGA wing of the Republican Party?\n\nIn a series of remarks over the last few days, President Joe Biden has made his strategy heading into the 2022 midterm elections crystal clear: Appeal to Republicans who don't align themselves with Donald Trump or his broader \"Make America Great Again\" coalition.\n\nAt his speech in Philadelphia last Thursday, Biden said this :\n\n\" Now, I want to be very clear, very clear up front: Not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology.\n\n\"I know because I've been able to work with these mainstream Republicans.\"\n\nAnd he echoed that sentiment on Labor Day during a speech in Wisconsin . \"Not every Republican is a MAGA Republican,\" said Biden. \"Not every Republican embraces that extreme ideology. I know because I've been able to work with mainstream Republicans my whole career.\"\n\nThe strategy is simple: With Trump continuing to falsely say the 2020 election was stolen and with the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, Biden wants to make sure that Republicans who feel alienated from their own party know that they can find a home with him, and with Democrats more broadly, in the fall campaign.\n\nTHE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nWhich is a smart approach - especially when you consider that some of the most contested Senate seats up in 2022 happen to be in the top swing states in the country like Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nBut Biden's rhetoric of late raises, for me, a broader question: Is he right that \"not even the majority of Republicans\" identify closely with Trump and the MAGA movement more generally? Or, put another way, are there really enough non-MAGA Republicans to sway the election to Democrats if Biden can persuade them to vote for his side?\n\nThere's no one poll question that answers that question directly. But there are a few recent polls that get us some answers - all coming at it from different directions. (And shoutout to CNN's polling and analytics editor Ariel Edwards-Levy for help with these numbers.)\n\n* In late July CNN polling of registered Republican voters or those who lean toward the Republican Party, 44% said the GOP should nominate Trump in 2024. A majority, 55%, said the party should nominate a different candidate. Among that 55%, voters are split between those who said they'd prefer another candidate because they don't want Trump to be president (27%) and those who cite other reasons for preferring different candidate (28%).\n\n* An August Quinnipiac University poll showed that among registered Republican voters, 76% had a favorable view of Trump, while just 15% an unfavorable view. Almost 3 in 4 (71%) said they would like to see Trump run for president in 2024, with 25% saying they would not.\n\n* An August NBC News poll found that among registered voters who are Republicans and lean toward the Republican Party, 41% said they considered themselves to be more supporters of Trump, while 50% said they were more supporters of the Republican Party.\n\nWhat to make of all those numbers? Well, two main things:\n\n1) Trump remains the dominant force within the Republican Party and is quite popular among rank-and-file Republicans.\n\n2) There are, roughly, one-quarter of Republicans who do not want Trump to run again in 2024.\n\nGiven that, it's probably fair to say that there are roughly 1 in every 4 Republican voters who, whether they identify as such or not, are non-MAGA Republicans.\n\nWhich is interesting!\n\nBut don't assume that that 25% of non-MAGA Republicans are necessarily up for grabs for Biden and Democrats - either this fall or in 2024. There's a big difference between saying you don't want Trump to run for president again in 2024 and deciding to cross party lines to support a Democrat running for House or Senate this November.\n\nOn the other hand, Democrats don't need 1 in 4 Republicans to cross party lines to vote for Democrats in the 2022 election. If even 10% of that group did so, it could well amount to enough votes to make a difference in not just some of these swing states and districts, but also in the broader fights for the majority in the House and Senate.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "With a MAGA win and a Squad loss, the political middle moves\n\nFollow:\n\nA version of this story appears in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here .\n\nThere must be some sort of larger takeaway in the fact that Rep. Lauren Boebert , among the most MAGA members of Congress, won a Republican primary in Colorado on Tuesday night, and Rep. Jamaal Bowman , a member of the progressive \"Squad\" from the Bronx, lost a Democratic primary to a more moderate candidate from Westchester County in New York.\n\nEvery House race is different, obviously, since all politics is local, according to the old saying. So it would be an oversimplification to say that Republicans moved more MAGA and Democrats moved more moderate based on these two unrelated races.\n\nAnd yet there's evidence to support that general trend. Look no further than the two parties' presidential candidates.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump personifies MAGA, and a large part of the Make America Great Again ethos he pushes is loyalty to him. President Joe Biden, on the other hand, effectively worked with Republicans to pass a bill to improve the nation's infrastructure and has said he wants to work with Republicans on immigration reform . Many Republicans will tell you they don't believe Biden.\n\nThere's nothing moderate about either Boebert or Bowman, who occupy space on the fringe of their respective parties. Both were also seriously flawed candidates with problems that extend beyond policy. Boebert was kicked out of a theater last year for vaping and \"causing a disturbance,\" for instance. Bowman was charged last year with pulling a fire alarm in a House office building when there was no emergency.\n\nRather than face voters in the district she narrowly won two years ago, Boebert moved to run in a district with a more conservative voting record. She emerged from a crowded field to win the Republican primary in the district, which was previously represented by Rep. Ken Buck, a conservative Republican who is a critic of Trump and had resigned from office in frustration.\n\nBowman, on the other hand, was targeted by more mainstream Democrats in part for his loud criticism of Israel in its war on Hamas in Gaza, an issue that has split Democrats this year. Pro-Israel groups spent heavily in the race, attempting to oust Bowman. However, in advertising , Bowman was attacked more for his opposition to Biden's policies than for his position on Israel.\n\nI asked CNN's Gregory Krieg, who covered the Bowman race, why he thinks Bowman lost and what it says about Democrats today. Here's what he emailed back:\n\nKRIEG: There are obviously many ways to read Bowman's defeat, and his failure to bridge the gap with pro-Israel Jewish voters in the district, specifically in Westchester, is understandably the one you're hearing most often. But I also think, if we're looking at this through a national lens, it's hard to not see it as part of the broader liberal retreat from some of the more aggressive left-wing characters and candidates they embraced during Trump's presidency.\n\nFor all the talk about Democrats' lack of enthusiasm about Biden personally, the idea of Biden - the moderate, even-tempered statesman type - is still very, very popular. And (Westchester County Executive George) Latimer, to some extent, embodied that.\n\nIt obviously did not help Bowman that AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) and other outside groups bombarded him with record spending and gobs of money invested in research into every thought that's crossed his mind the last 25 years.\n\nThat primary voters did not hold the spending against Latimer, as progressives argued they should, also reminds me that voters (especially Democrats) in presidential cycles tend to be cautious. You'll probably never hear Trump, Fox News or anyone on the right mention Latimer's name. And for some folks left-of-center, that's priceless.\n\nWhile Boebert's victory provides a foil for Bowman's loss, it was far from a perfect night for more MAGA Republicans.\n\nIn a separate Colorado race, the chair of the state GOP, Dave Williams , who had gotten Trump's endorsement but who said controversial things about gay rights - including that Pride flags should be burned - lost to the more establishment pick, Jeff Crank, a real estate investor and former talk radio host.\n\nAnd in Utah, Republicans snubbed the MAGA options for both governor and senator in a state that is very conservative but where the base of Mormon voters has bristled at the former president.\n\nCurrent Sen. Mitt Romney is a notable Trump critic in the GOP, and his decision not to run for reelection opened up an opportunity to replace one of the few remaining Republicans who voted to convict Trump on impeachment charges in 2021 with a Trump-backed Republican.\n\nRep. John Curtis , the winner of the GOP Senate primary, did not vote to convict Trump as a member of the House, but he is the rare Republican focused on climate change, an issue that disproportionately affects Utah but which Trump dismisses.\n\nBoth Curtis and Gov. Spencer Cox were actually rejected by GOP party activists at the state's nominating convention but found their way onto the ballot with the help of signature drives. Cox has taken more moderate positions on certain issues and was booed at the state GOP convention this year, according to The Associated Press . But Cox and Curtis both easily won their primaries, which essentially determine the winner of statewide contests in a state like Utah.\n\nIt's a shame that primary voters are becoming the de facto general election voters in states and districts that lean heavily to one side or the other, according to former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels , a Republican who wrote a lament in The Washington Post that most of the country lives in a state with \"trifecta\" government, where one party controls most of what's happening at their state level.\n\nDaniels writes: The issue isn't simply that states lean reliably Republican or Democratic. It's that now a big majority are heavily, maybe irrevocably, tilted in one direction or the other. Where that obtains, office seekers pitch their initial appeals to the hard core on their side, as primary candidates always have. The difference is that, instead of the winner's traditional post-primary imperative, to reach out to nonpartisans and even open-minded members of the opposing party, now their job is finished.\n\nThere are efforts to change this dynamic, which we've written about in this newsletter , such as in states experimenting with nonpartisan primaries and ranked-choice voting.\n\nBut Daniels has a point. None of the races we've discussed so far in this story are expected to be at all competitive in November.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Opinion: Mike Johnson is testing to see if the MAGA Republican fever can be broken\n\nFollow:\n\nEditor's Note: Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst, is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author and editor of 25 books, including the New York Times best-seller, \"Myth America: Historians Take on the Biggest Lies and Legends About Our Past\" (Basic Books). Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer . The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson is moving forward with a legislative package to provide aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Despite fierce opposition from MAGA Republicans within his caucus, Johnson has decided that the imperative of the US providing this assistance is more important than pleasing all the members of his caucus.\n\nWithout this support, international adversaries, including Russia, Iran and China, would read the failure of the US Congress to pass legislation as a sign that MAGA's America First agenda was triumphant. They might conclude that age of internationalism, entrenched into American politics since World War II, had come to an end.\n\nThe problem for Johnson is that his decision to move forward could very well cost him his job. Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has been beating the drums to vote Johnson, who is himself also an extreme right-wing Republican, out of office. With the new rules adopted by House Republicans when Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California was elected speaker last year, it only takes one member to trigger a vote to \" vacate \" the speakership.\n\nWhen GOP House members adopted this lower threshold in exchange for accepting McCarthy, experts understood that the rule would create extreme instability within the Republican caucus. That proved true in October when McCarthy became the first speaker in American history who was voted out of his position. With the low threshold whoever was speaker would always know that angering just one member could result in their downfall.\n\nRelated video SE Cupp: Marjorie Taylor Greene has become irrelevant\n\nThe rule was only one part of the challenge. Since we live in an era where there tend to be extremely narrow congressional majorities, party leaders find themselves in a position where just a few defections could render the passage of legislation impossible without bipartisan support. The choice for Republicans in the House has increasingly become doing nothing or working with Democrats to get things done.\n\nYet Republican speakers can't really turn to the second option without immense risk. As the Republican Party has shifted dramatically to the right in recent decades there is very little appetite on the red side of the aisle to enter into any kind of deal with the other side. The resistance is both political, for fear of giving the Democrats any kind of victory that could help them gain the majority, and ideological, given that many in the GOP claim that anything their opponents want constitutes a fundamental threat to the country.\n\nWhile Democrats too have also veered toward the left , the party remains much more ideologically and politically diverse. There is still more tolerance for sometimes working with the other side. This was evident when New York Senator Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries showed willingness to support the stringent bipartisan immigration deal that House Republicans ultimately subverted at the behest of former president and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.\n\nThe new generation of Republicans have almost no tolerance for leaders who don't follow their command.\n\nAll of this is made worse by the fact that Republicans have become a political party that has little room for strong, independent leadership. For decades, there has been a willingness to throw leaders overboard rather than providing them with the leeway congressional leaders have historically needed to govern.\n\nThe trend started as a Republican strategy against Democrats. In 1989, House Minority Leader Newt Gingrich led the way when he toppled Democratic Speaker Jim Wright through an ethics scandal that resulted in Wright's resignation. Although Wright warned colleagues to avoid the \"mindless cannibalism\" that he feared was sweeping the chamber, conditions only became worse.\n\nIn the era since 1994, when Republicans have held control of the House numerous times, they have frequently turned on themselves. In 1998, Republicans pressured Gingrich into relinquishing his speakership because the party did poorly in the midterms - as they were impeaching President Bill Clinton - and since Gingrich was having an affair . Gingrich's successor, Louisiana's Rep. Robert Livingston, stepped down before even becoming speaker because of his own affair.\n\nRelated article Opinion: Trump might have dozed off in court. Here's how that could come back to bite him\n\nAlthough Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois would retain the speakership from 1999 to 2007 (he would end his career as a convicted felon and sex offender), Republican speakers are always on thin ice. Hastert's relative longevity was the exception. Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, who helped Tea Party Republicans win office in 2010 , struggled with young colleagues, one of whom he later called a \"legislative terrorist,\" (fellow Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan), thought he was too open to compromise.\n\nOn July 28, 2015, Tea Party Republican Rep. Mark Meadows from North Carolina filed a motion to vacate but the House never voted on the resolution. Nonetheless, the pressure was so intense that in September of that year Boehner resigned. \"My first job as speaker,\" he said , \"is to protect the institution. It had become clear to me that this prolonged leadership turmoil would do irreparable harm to the institution.\" Of course, Boehner only had himself to blame as he had been part of the Gingrich generation that promoted smashmouth partisanship and opened the doors to Tea Party Republicans who he saw as useful and believed he could control.\n\nBoehner was followed by Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan . As speaker, Ryan unsuccessfully tried to change what he called the \"weapon\" of the ability of members to vacate the speakership and spent his four years unable to control the creeping extremism of his colleagues. His tenure ended in 2019 after Democrats retook control of the chamber.\n\nElected as speaker in 2023, McCarthy only held the seat for 269 days before the GOP voted him out for working with Democrats to keep the government open. His became the third shortest speakership in American history, only longer than Speaker Michael Kerr who passed away in the middle of his term (1876) and Speaker Theodore Pomeroy who was elected in 1869, the final day of the 40 th Congress.\n\nThe time of Republican speakership keeps shrinking as right-wing ousters have become increasingly common. In a party that has become hyperpolarized, respect for stability, governance and compromise has gone out the window. Republican speakers have to toe the line. If they don't, they are likely to be shown the exit.\n\nThe long and short-term changes have produced a party in the House of Representatives that is almost incapable of producing strong leaders, rendering the GOP unstable, toxic and destructive. But the costs are not just internal.\n\nA functional House depends on having two parties that can maintain some internal order and deliver when it comes to deal-making. Functionality depends on two parties with strong leaders that are ultimately committed to governance as a shared central goal.\n\nWhen this imperative breaks down within one party, as we are seeing in 2024, the risks to the nation increase as each speaker in the GOP must confront the choice of moving forward with legislation that is in the interest of most of the chamber or relinquishing their power. It has become an either-or proposition.\n\nJohnson is now testing the waters to see if the fever can be broken.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The total off-ramp of a shutdown, how you stop a shutdown, is totally determined by the Republican House and Senate, and that is totally determined because they've shown complete blind obeisance [to] Trump, DOGE, etc. They could keep us in a shutdown for months and months and months,\" Schumer told reporters Thursday night.\n\nThe Democratic leader's decision privately disappointed many in his caucus, and stunned his House colleagues across the US Capitol - leaving the party deeply divided on the path ahead at a moment when their base is clamoring for a strong response against Trump and Elon Musk's actions to radically reshape the federal government.\n\n\"We are in a perverse, bizarro land where we're having to decide between letting Donald Trump wreck the government this way or wreck the government that way,\" New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said of Democrats' predicament.\n\nIt's a moment that has been months in the making. Still, top Democrats in Congress struggled to find a cohesive message and strategy that would allow them room to fight without the potential risk of what it would mean if thousands of government workers were suddenly thrust into more uncertainty with a shutdown.\n\nRelated article What's at risk if Congress doesn't fund the government by Friday's deadline\n\nPerhaps the clearest sign of the dilemma: Their top two leaders took opposite paths, with Schumer deciding to vote for the GOP plan that top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries has spent a full week bashing.\n\n\"Dr. King once made the observation that, although everyone may not see it at the moment, the time is always right to do what's right. This week, House Democrats did what was right. We stood up against Donald Trump. We stood up against Elon Musk. We stood up against the extreme MAGA Republicans,\" Jeffries said to applause in Leesburg, Virginia, at a party retreat Thursday night, according to a person in the room. \"We can defend that vote because we stood on the side of the American people.\"\n\nWhen the Senate votes Friday, many Democrats expect the vote to reflect the generational divide in the chamber. Freshmen senators, like Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Ruben Gallego of Arizona - who many believed would vote for the bill because they hold seats in states Trump won in November - instead remained firmly opposed and signaled they wanted to use the funding bill to fight the president. And the disconnect reflects a simmering tension that runs through the Democratic Party far beyond Washington.\n\n\"I'm pissed,\" Rep. Jim McGovern told CNN shortly after Schumer's floor speech. \"Maybe they'll toughen up for the fight on reconciliation, I don't know. ... This guy [Trump] is ruining the country. And you know, I just expected more fight.\"\n\nDemocrats have been handwringing over how to handle the shutdown for months. The decision between voting for a shutdown and voting for a bill many believe has serious cuts in funding to programs that are important for Democrats has led to marathon party lunches, endless discussion and little clarity on what many Democrats would ultimately do.\n\nIn order to avert a shutdown, at least eight Senate Democrats need to vote to allow the bill to move forward. Four sources familiar with the discussions said Schumer spent Thursday privately asking members whether they planned to advance the House-passed spending bill that would fund the government until the end of September. And after a lengthy lunch Thursday, several senators who spoke on the condition of anonymity to privately discuss internal party deliberations, told CNN they believed the votes would be there on their side to avert a shutdown.\n\n\"I believe it is my job to make the best choice for the country to minimize the harms to the American people,\" Schumer said on the floor Thursday in a highly anticipated speech that made clear Democrats would lend the votes needed by the GOP to keep the government open.\n\nStill, several Democrats dug in against the bill as the week stretched on. Gallego announced Thursday he'd vote no, as did a half dozen others, citing concerns over cuts to programs and arguments that voting for the stopgap measure would only embolden Trump and Musk to continue reprogramming money that was already part of previous spending bills.\n\nRelated article Salesman-in-chief: Trump leans on Freedom Caucus to avert government shutdown\n\n\"Let's not kid ourselves. This is a bad resolution that gives Elon Musk and his cronies permission to continue cutting veterans' benefits, slashes resources for Arizona's water needs and abandons our wildland firefighters. I can't stand by that, and that's why I'm voting no,\" Gallego said in a statement.\n\nEven retiring senators like Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota announced she was opposed to the bill on both a procedural vote to advance the measure and on the final vote.\n\nAdding to the mounting frustration, Senate Democrats have complained their party leaders have not been more decisive on how to proceed. The day before Schumer told his caucus he would vote to advance the bill, the Democratic leader went to the Senate floor and said his caucus was united against a vote to advance it.\n\n\"How on earth could we find ourselves in this position? We knew this was coming. We have no plan. We are getting blamed. Progressives are really agitated,\" one senior Democratic aide told CNN. \"We have a case to make. We just have not had the leadership and guidance on how to prosecute that.\"\n\nSeveral Democratic senators who were asked to respond to questions about their party's strategy and if it had been effective declined to comment.\n\n\"Look, my frustration right now is that this bill is not a CR. It is a brand new budget bill and it is going to cut veteran services by $1.2 billion, FEMA by $300 million, cut wildfire firefighters and water in Arizona and the fact that Trump thinks that's a good thing for this country astounds me and I'll think about the other question at a later time and date once we get past this,\" Gallego told reporters.\n\nThirty miles away, as more than 100 House Democrats gathered for their policy retreat, lawmakers' mouths were agape at reports that Schumer was planning to vote with Republicans. Privately, they fumed at his reversal - a direct contraction of their position that nearly their entire caucus took just 48 hours earlier. Some called on him to lose his position as leader.\n\nBut most declined to comment publicly, wary, they said, of deepening the ugly divide within the Democratic Party. One senior aide described the House Democrats' reaction as \"collectively ripsh*t.\"\n\nBehind the scenes, Democrats pointed to several miscalculations made by their party. For one, most Senate Democrats never thought the House could pass a stopgap funding measure with just Republican votes. Then, Speaker Mike Johnson - with major muscle from Trump - convinced more than 30 conservatives who just months ago voted against another stopgap spending bill to vote for one.\n\nSome Senate Democrats expressed intense frustration with the attacks they faced from House colleagues, who they believe have painted them into a corner after they had the privilege of voting against a spending bill without directly risking a shutdown. The bill passed out of the House with almost every single Republican voting \"yes.\"\n\nRelated article Ocasio-Cortez mobilizes Democrats against Schumer plan as colleagues privately urge her to consider primary challenge\n\nToo few Democrats voting \"yes\" in the Senate could trigger a shutdown. Meanwhile, some progressives like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been urging their constituents to flood the phone lines of Democratic senators to lobby them to vote against the bill.\n\n\"It's infuriating to see these tweets,\" one Democratic Senate staffer told CNN.\n\nAnother Democratic office told CNN that their phone lines had been so inundated with calls from the base that they'd received more than 4,000 phone calls in a single day.\n\n\"I think there is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told reporters.\n\n\"There are members of Congress who have won Trump-held districts in some of the most difficult territory in the United States who walked the plank and took innumerable risks in order to defend the American people, in order to defend Social Security and Medicaid and Medicare. Just to see Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk, I think is a slap in the face.\"\n\nAnd House Democrats - before it was clear that Schumer intended to back down - defended their decision to amplify pressure on the Senate.\n\n\"God gave the Senate six-year terms for a reason,\" centrist Rep. Scott Peters told CNN. \"I'm in the fight. We've done what we can do. We need them to do what they can do.\"\n\nRep. Susie Lee, a Democrat who represents a tough swing seat in Nevada, told CNN she's personally made the pitch to her state's two senators.\n\n\"They have the House and the Senate and the presidency. They made a choice to not negotiate with us,\" Lee said. The Nevada Democrat acknowledged that Senate Democrats had a \"fear\" of a shutdown. But she argued that Democrats could easily explain to their voters that it was the Republicans, not their own party, that triggered the funding lapse.\n\n\"I don't think it's a hard task. It's their government. They have the majority,\" Lee said. \"I think that they need to own it.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Biden uses Florida's 'extreme MAGA Republicans' as foils for his closing midterm pitch\n\nWhen President Joe Biden rallied Democrats in Florida on Tuesday for a final-stretch campaign stop, he finally landed in the state his advisers have long eyed as the ideal backdrop for his warnings against \"mega-MAGA\" Republicans.\n\nFor months, Biden and his team had been hoping to use Florida's constellation of Trump-aligned Republicans - including the former president himself - to crystallize Biden's closing pitch that the election is a choice and not a referendum and galvanize Democratic voters.\n\n\"You can't shake a stick (in Florida) without hitting a Republican that represents the MAGA extremes that the president is talking about,\" a senior Biden adviser said. \"So, it allows the president to really drive home what's at stake and what the choice is.\"\n\nBiden made that argument to voters in Miami Gardens on Tuesday, a week from Election Day. The rally came as Biden sharpened his attacks on Republicans and painted an increasingly grim picture of America under a Republican majority in Congress.\n\nThe Sunshine State represents an important battleground state for the midterms and future presidential elections. But more importantly, with the president's approval ratings underwater, Biden's team views Florida as the perfect political backdrop to frame the midterm elections as a choice - between \"extreme MAGA Republicans\" and Democrats - rather than a referendum on the President and his party, Biden said Tuesday.\n\n\"This election is not a referendum. It's a choice. It's a choice between two vastly different visions for America,\" Biden said at Florida Memorial University.\n\nBiden also said Republicans were \"coming after\" the right to vote, warning once again that \"democracy is on the ballot.\" The president spent much of the speech painting, what he called, the \"stark contrast\" between Democrats and Republicans, including on issues of Social Security, Medicare, abortion and student loans.\n\nOn student loans, Biden said, \"They moaned and groaned about it and they challenged it in court, which they're going to lose.\"\n\n\"Who in the hell do they think they are?\" Biden added.\n\nBiden's team first identified Florida as an ideal launching point for his midterm message over the summer. That kickoff was delayed by the president's Covid-19 diagnosis and scuttled again by Hurricane Ian, so instead Biden has chosen it as the location for a major rally as he makes his closing argument ahead of next week's midterm elections.\n\nHe has drawn on Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott's policy proposals and on threats of Republican brinkmanship over the debt ceiling to argue the GOP will hurt the economy and put popular entitlement programs at risk. And with senior-heavy Florida as the backdrop, Biden also held an official event before the rally, calling attention to Republicans' Social Security and Medicare proposals.\n\n\"I came to Florida today to talk about two very, very, very important programs,\" Biden said, speaking at a small venue in Hallandale Beach. \"A great deal of people in the state are gonna be affected, and they're under siege by our Republican friends.\"\n\nDemocratic officials are under no illusions that Biden's visit to Florida on Tuesday will drastically change the dynamics of a Senate and gubernatorial race that appear to be heading Republicans' way, but they see a chance to nationalize the stakes of the midterms in the final stretch.\n\nAmong his chief foils is Scott, the head of Republicans' campaign arm who had laid out a policy agenda that would put Medicare, Social Security and other government programs up for a vote every five years. The state is also home to former President Donald Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis, both likely 2024 presidential candidates whom Democrats have been eager to cast as the faces of a new, more extreme Republican Party.\n\n\"And by the way,\" Biden said in Hallandale Beach, \"this ain't your father's Republican Party. It's a different deal right now. And there's a lot of good Republicans out there, but they're under a lot of pressure.\"\n\nA second senior Biden adviser argued that Biden's contrast argument, with Florida as the backdrop, was \"even more relevant\" in the closing week of the midterms.\n\n\"As the congressional Republican plan to either eliminate Social Security and Medicare, cut Social Security and Medicare or hold it hostage to debt limit negotiations becomes even more apparent...it's even more relevant for the President to draw that choice for the voters of Florida and the voters across the country,\" the senior adviser said.\n\nBiden held the rally in Florida largely at the urging of the state's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, former Gov. Charlie Crist, according to two Democrats familiar with the decision.\n\nIn an interview with CNN on the eve of Biden's visit to his state, Crist was effusive about the president's willingness to campaign alongside him in the final stretch of the midterms, as he hopes to deny DeSantis reelection.\n\n\"He's the most important man in the world,\" Crist said. \"The fact that he's coming down to Florida with a week to go until the election says everything you need to know about how important Florida is.\"\n\nMore than any other issue, Crist said he wanted Biden to zero-in on the topic of abortion rights. DeSantis' record as governor on the issue speaks for itself, Crist said, adding that abortion rights is the \"number one issue\" in his race.\n\nWhen Biden visited Florida last month to tour damage from Hurricane Ian, the president and DeSantis put aside their political differences to emphasize an effective response.\n\n\"We have very different political philosophies, but we've worked hand-in-glove,\" Biden said during the stop.\n\nBut a few weeks later, the governor made clear Biden was still in his sights as a potential rival, even as he demurred about a potential national run during a debate with Crist.\n\n\"I just want to make things very, very clear,\" DeSantis said. \"The only worn-out, old donkey I'm looking to put out to pasture is Charlie Crist.\"\n\nWhile Democratic officials insist Biden is first and foremost focused on the upcoming midterms, campaigning on behalf of the Democrat running to unseat DeSantis this week offered in part a preview of what a Biden-DeSantis matchup could look like in 2024. In a debate last week, DeSantis would not commit to a full four-year term if he were to win reelection.\n\n\"DeSantis' first and last question is: 'What do I need to do for DeSantis to succeed?' That is the same conversation that Trump has with himself,\" said Cedric Richmond, a senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee.\n\nStill, Biden's decision to rally in Florida - where neither the gubernatorial nor Senate race are particularly close - a week out from the election called attention to the limits of his ability to sway voters in the final stretch of the campaign. It also highlighted the extent to which Biden has struggled to convince voters to view the election as anything other than a referendum on him and his party amid economic unease.\n\nWith 56% of Americans disapproving of the job Biden has done as president, according to CNN's Poll of Polls, he has largely been sidelined from publicly campaigning with many of the Democratic candidates in the country's most competitive races.\n\nBiden has chafed at suggestions he is not in demand on the campaign trail, insisting to reporters that more than a dozen different campaigns had requested him in the final stretch of the contest.\n\n\"That's not true. There have been 15. Count, kid, count,\" he said last week when a reporter suggested he hadn't been holding many rallies in the final stretch.\n\nPrivately, Biden accepts not every Democratic candidate will welcome him as a surrogate while his approval ratings remain underwater. He has told fellow Democrats he respects their political intuition when it comes to their own races and has joked publicly he would \"campaign for ... or against\" his preferred candidates, \"whichever will help the most.\"\n\nBut he has grown frustrated at coverage suggesting he is political albatross, according to people familiar with the conversations, arguing his policies - when properly explained - are widely popular with voters.\n\nDemocrats familiar with the decision-making acknowledged that Biden is not in demand from campaigns in the most competitive races. They also argued that rallies are costly and less valuable from an organizing perspective than they used to be.\n\nWhat's clear is that Biden has watched as his reputation as a Democrat who could venture places others could not has faded. As vice president, Biden was frequently dispatched to red states and conservative districts to campaign for vulnerable members of his party, often viewed as more palatable than his then-boss, Barack Obama.\n\nNow, it is the former president who appears to be the most sought-after Democrat for the nation's marquee races. He held rallies in Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin over the weekend, and will visit Nevada and Arizona this week.\n\nBiden and Obama will appear together next Saturday to boost the Senate and gubernatorial candidates in Pennsylvania - one place Biden, who was born there, has been welcomed.\n\nWhen compared with his predecessors, Biden has maintained a lighter campaign schedule. His event Tuesday evening in Florida will be his first rally this month, compared to the 16 that then-President Obama held in October 2010 and the 26 that then-President Trump held in October 2018.\n\nBiden has been in demand on the fundraising circuit, though, speaking at multiple high-dollar fundraisers nearly every week this fall to help the DNC raise a midterm record total of $292 million through September. Democratic officials credited Biden's decision to share his presidential campaign list with the DNC at the start of his presidency with powering a midterm record $155 million in grassroots fundraising.\n\nOn the event side, Biden scaled back battleground state political rallies in favor of political speeches in Washington and official events where he has called attention to his accomplishments - like infrastructure and manufacturing investments - and warned of the Republican alternative.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Ron Klain suggested on CNN in October that the lack of big rallies was strategic: \"I don't think rallies have proved effective for candidates in the midterms, and so we're trying something different,\" he said, noting the Obama and Trump models failed to stave of losses for their respective parties.\n\nBut as Biden prepares to hold rallies this week in New Mexico, California and Pennsylvania, a senior Biden adviser said, \"There's a time and place for rallies.\"\n\n\"As you get toward the end of any election, rallies are a way to rev up the base. Rallies are a way to get out the vote,\" the senior adviser said.\n\nThis story has been updated with further developments on Tuesday.\n\nCNN's Nikki Carvajal and Maegan Vazquez contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Georgia election subversion case judge skeptical of asking potential jurors about 'MAGA Republicans'\n\nThe judge presiding over the Georgia election subversion case said Monday he's unlikely to let Donald Trump's co-defendants ask potential jurors for their views on the former president's attempt to \"steal the election,\" the impact of \"political misinformation\" on US democracy and the extremism of \"MAGA Republicans.\"\n\nRelated article Trump 'does not have the right to say and do exactly what he pleases,' Judge Chutkan says, issuing gag order\n\nFulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee revealed at a hearing Monday that lawyers for the first two defendants going to trial - pro-Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro and former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell - wanted to include these politically charged inquiries in the questionnaire that will be given to potential jurors in the case.\n\nJury selection is scheduled to begin later this week. A total of 900 prospective jurors have been asked to report to the Fulton County courthouse, including 450 on Friday and the rest next week.\n\nThe judge was highly skeptical of the request and pointed out that there are \"decades of case law telling us that we're not supposed to be asking jurors to give their opinion upfront.\" Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' team also encouraged McAfee to exclude these items from the jury questionnaire.\n\nChesebro attorney Scott Grubman said the questions were essential to \"getting to the true question\" of whether the jurors can be \"fair and impartial,\" instead of simply asking if they can be fair, yes or no.\n\nAccording to McAfee, the defendants want to ask potential jurors for their feelings about each of the following statements:\n\nThe judge didn't say when he'll issue a final ruling on the questionnaire.\n\nBoth Chesebro and Powell have pleaded not guilty. Chesebro is accused of helping orchestrate the fake electors plot and Powell is charged with crimes stemming from the Coffee County voting system breach . They are the first of the 19 defendants to go to trial, because they invoked their right to a speedy trial.\n\nMcAfee said Monday that he'll tell potential jurors that the trial is expected to last about five months. That means the trial would overlap with the opening months of the 2024 GOP primaries, including the Iowa caucuses in January, Super Tuesday in early March and likely the Georgia primary on March 12.\n\nTrump's trial is not yet scheduled.

      "text": "In forceful condemnation of Trump, Biden warns that 'MAGA' backers pose grave threat to democracy\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. - President Joe Biden on Thursday called his once-and-perhaps-future opponent Donald Trump a direct threat to American democracy in the most forceful condemnation of the former president and the MAGA movement he has delivered since he took office.\n\nBiden said at a speech in Arizona that Trump holds the dangerous view that presidents possess fearsome, unchecked powers, a position at odds with the constitutional norms meant to prevent unilateral rule. Though he seldom mentions Trump by name, Biden quoted something his predecessor said in 2019 when he was speaking to a conservative student group.\n\n\"Then I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president,\" Trump said at the time . \"But I don't even talk about that.\" Article II spells out the powers and duties of the presidency.\n\nBiden, speaking at an event honoring the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona, said: \"I've never even heard a president say that in jest. Not guided by the Constitution or by common service and decency toward our fellow Americans, but by vengeance and vindictiveness.\"\n\nThe speech was weeks in the planning, and Biden worked on it aboard Air Force One as he flew to Arizona, a senior White House official said. His remarks preview how he will navigate a tricky set of parameters that limit how frankly he can talk about Trump.\n\nTrump, a heavy favorite to win the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, faces federal and state indictments accusing him of using various levers of power to try to overturn his loss in the 2020 election. In every case, he has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nNormally, that sort of baggage would be a ripe target for a political opponent. But Biden is also a sitting president whose Justice Department is prosecuting Trump. Any mention of Trump's legal woes could be seen as politically motivated interference. So Biden has stayed silent about Trump's felony charges - and he remained so in Thursday's speech.\n\nInstead, he fo cused on Trump's attacks on institutions that are crucial to a healthy representative democracy. He discussed plans developed by people in Trump's orbit to expand presidential authority in ways that would replace career civil servants with people who owe their loyalty chiefly to the president.\n\n\"What is it they intend to do,\" Biden said, \"once they erode the constitutional order of checks and balances and separation of powers? Limit the independence of federal agencies? Put them under the thumb of a president?\"\n\nBiden denounced Trump's attacks on the free press and also Gen. Mark Milley, the outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Milley said he was taking precautions to protect himself and his family after Trump suggested without evidence on his social media site that Milley had made improper contact with China about Trump's thinking.\n\n\"This is an act so egregious that, in times gone by, the punishment would have been DEATH!\" Trump wrote.\n\nBiden said: \"The silence is deafening. Hardly any Republican called out such heinous statements.\"\n\nIn response to Biden's speech, a spokesman for Trump's campaign, Steven Cheung, said, \"The radical left Democrats, now led by Crooked Joe Biden, are the greatest threat to democracy the United States of America has ever faced.\"\n\nBiden's speech is the fourth in a series centered on fortifying democratic values against attacks from what he describes as Republican extremists bent on eviscerating self-government. He singled out the \"Make America Great Again\" movement that Trump leads.\n\n\"This MAGA threat is a threat to the brick and mortar of our democratic institutions,\" Biden said. \"It's also a threat to the character of our nation that gives our Constitution life, that binds us together as Americans, a common cause. None of this is surprising, though. They've tried to govern that way before. Thank God they failed. But they haven't given up.\"\n\nBiden also used the speech to celebrate McCain, whom Trump once ridiculed for having been taken prisoner during the Vietnam War. Biden is setting aside federal funding for a library honoring McCain that will also offer education, work and health programs to needy communities in Arizona, a White House official said.\n\nBiden sees McCain as a model of a faded bipartisan spirit that he would like to revive. McCain was willing to break with his party on matters of principle, angering then-President Trump in 2017 when he gave a memorable thumbs-down gesture on a Senate vote to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nAfter he lost the 2008 presidential race to Barack Obama, McCain conceded defeat, which Trump has yet to do since he lost in 2020 . A new 60-second Biden campaign ad includes photos of Biden with McCain and other prominent Republicans to showcase his willingness to work cooperatively with the other party.\n\nBiden's speech underscores how the 2024 presidential race has entered a new, post-primary phase even before the first primary votes have been cast. Trump has cemented an outsize lead in the race for the GOP nomination, and the Biden campaign is shifting its focus to him earlier than it had anticipated.\n\nIn a cheeky post on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, Biden showed a snippet from the Republican presidential debate Wednesday night in which Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis criticized Trump for not showing up at the forum.\n\n\"Donald Trump is missing in action,\" DeSantis says in the clip.\n\n\"That's right,\" Biden wrote.\n\nThe site of Thursday's speech had been a moving target. The White House had originally considered Valley Forge in Pennsylvania, a nod to the Continental Army's fight against British rule in the harsh winter of 1777-78, a senior White House official said.\n\nAt a time when some voters seem willing to cast aside constitutional freedoms, Biden sought to remind them of the painful sacrifices made to build an enduring democracy.\n\n\"People can be frustrated at the pace of progress,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the thinking behind the speech. \"But our institutions also hold us together. The Constitution is a check on the abuse of power. And if you attack the free press, you subvert the will of the voters, you risk unraveling it all.\"\n\nBiden's warning about Trump is unusual in the modern history of presidential campaigns. Although he has plenty of quarrels with Trump over policy, he is casting Trumpism as a mortal threat to the very constitutional order that gives Americans the right to hire and fire their leaders.\n\n\"Their extreme agenda, if carried out, would fundamentally alter the institutions of American democracy as we know it,\" Biden said. \"My friends, they're not hiding their attacks; they're openly promoting them. Attacking the free press as the enemy of the people. Attacking the rule of law as an impediment. Fomenting voter suppression and election subversion.\"\n\nBut polling suggests Biden's message thus far has failed to break through. If anything, Democrats are losing ground on that front.\n\nBiden gave a similar speech in Philadelphia a year ago. \"Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic,\" he said at the time.\n\nWhen he delivered that speech in prime time at Independence Hall, Democrats held a 7-percentage-point lead over Republicans on the issue of protecting democracy, according to NBC News polling . Since then, Republicans have erased that advantage and now hold a 1-point edge.\n\nEyeing those trends, Biden's allies worry that Americans are failing to grasp the stakes in the 2024 election should there be a rematch with Trump.\n\n\"Too many people are not thinking clearly,\" said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., whose endorsement of Biden in the South Carolina Democratic primary in 2020 helped rescue his faltering presidential bid.\n\n\"The country is in a bad place. And we need to be thinking about the country and not about the personalities,\" Clyburn said in an interview. \"This is not a contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump or Joe Biden and any other person who may be interested in being the president. This is a contest between democracy and autocracy. That's what this contest is about.\"\n\nAsked whether Trump could return to power, Clyburn said: \"Sure, it's possible. All things are possible. I think it's highly improbable, but it's possible.\"\n\nGabe Gutierrez reported from Tempe and Peter Nicholas from Washington.

Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic,\" Biden said in the speech from the Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia.\n\nHe accused so-called \"MAGA Republicans,\" a reference to Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan, of refusing to recognize free and fair elections, increasingly talking about violence in response to actions they don't like, and of being determined to thwart \"the will of the people.\"\n\n\"MAGA Republicans have made their choice.

They live not in the light of truth but in the shadow of lies,\" Biden said.\n\nAhead of the remarks, a senior administration official insisted that it was \"not a speech about a particular politician, or even about a particular political party.\" Biden said he didn't believe the ideology he was referring to represented that of most Republicans, although it has been embraced by a number of elected Republican officials.\n\n\"Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology. I know because I've been able to work with these mainstream Republicans,\" Biden said. \"But there's no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, and that is a threat to this country.\"\n\n\"For a long time, we've reassured ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed. But it is not. We have to defend it. Protect it. Stand up for it. Each and every one of us,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden laid into those who have embraced Trump's false claim that the 2020 election was rigged and sought to disrupt the coming 2022 elections, calling the belief a threat to the fundamentals of American democracy.\n\n\"Democracy cannot survive when one side believes there are only two outcomes to an election: either they win, or they were cheated,\" Biden said. \"And that's where the MAGA Republicans are today.\"\n\nRepublicans offered their own retort ahead of Biden's speech. Appearing hours earlier in Biden's hometown, Scranton, Pennsylvania, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., accused the president of being divisive and called on him to apologize for labeling Trump supporters as \"semi-fascists\" at a recent campaign event.\n\n\"Instead of trying to bring our country together to solve these challenges, President Biden has chosen to divide, demean and disparage his fellow Americans - simply because they disagree with his policies. That's not leadership,\" McCarthy said.\n\n\"When the president speaks tonight at Independence Hall, the first lines out of his mouth should be to apologize for slandering tens of millions of Americans as 'fascists.'\"\n\nMcCarthy appeared with Jim Bognet, the Republican nominee trying to unseat Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Pa., who represents Scranton. McCarthy, who is the favorite to be speaker if Republicans flip the House, argued that Biden has failed to fix inflation and supply-chain issues, secure the southern border or address rising crime rates.\n\nWhile the Biden administration billed the remarks as an official White House event, not a campaign event, the speech comes as the president is stepping up efforts to help Democrats hang on to control of Congress with the midterm elections just over two months away.\n\nAn NBC News poll last month found that \"threats to democracy\" had overtaken the \"cost of living\" as the most important issue facing the country.\n\nBiden likened the outlook of Republicans who have embraced the MAGA philosophy central to Trump's presidency to \" semi-fascism \" at a fundraiser for Democrats last week.\n\nIn remarks this week, also in Pennsylvania, Biden accused Republicans of not being supportive of law enforcement and the rule of law for their attacks on the FBI after it searched Trump's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, their calls to defund the FBI and the unwillingness by some in the party to condemn the Jan. 6 rioters.\n\n\"What the president believes, which is a reason to have this in prime time, is that there are an overwhelming number of Americans, the majority of Americans, who believe that we need to continue, we need to save the core values of our country,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday. \"What he's not going to do is shy away from calling out extremism that he is seeing, these MAGA Republicans.\"\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel accused Biden and Democrats of pitting Americans against one another.\n\n\"Joe Biden is the divider-in-chief and epitomizes the current state of the Democrat Party: one of divisiveness, disgust, and hostility towards half the country,\" McDaniel said.\n\nShannon Pettypiece is senior policy reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

So we'll find out.\"\n\n\"I fully expect the speaker to keep his commitment to secure the passage and support needed to help Ukraine as they defend themselves against aggression and brutality,\" he said.\n\nAfter his remarks, a spokesperson for McCarthy said in a statement: \"Speaker McCarthy has been clear and consistent: we have an obligation to fix the crisis at the border and to ensure any request for further aid to Ukraine is matched with a sound strategy and accountability. The House will continue to discuss these challenges in the weeks to come.\"\n\nCongress passed a short-term bill to keep the government open Saturday night. The legislation, which keeps the government funded at current levels through Nov. 17 and authorizes additional disaster relief money, allows Congress more time to reach a funding agreement for the full year. However, it left out aid to Ukraine after McCarthy removed the provision from the bipartisan Senate bill, saying it should be considered separately later.\n\nBefore the bill passed, McCarthy announced he would drop Republicans' demands for spending cuts and policy provisions about immigration to clear the way for a quick House vote on a \"clean\" stopgap bill.\n\nA group of 21 conservative rebels, led by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., voted against Republicans' 30-day funding bill to keep the government open Friday. The rebels demanded the House pass all 12 appropriations bills with significant spending cuts before it holds negotiations on funding with the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nMcCarthy said Saturday he had no choice but to leave out Republicans' demands after conservative rebels tanked his funding bill.\n\nIn addition to Gaetz, the Republicans who voted against McCarthy's short-term funding bill included Reps. Andy Biggs, Eli Crane and Paul Gosar of Arizona; Lauren Boebert and Ken Buck, both of Colorado; Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia; Tim Burchett and Andy Ogles, both of Tennessee; Alex Mooney, who is running for the Senate in West Virginia; Matt Rosendale, who is running for the Senate in Montana; and Nancy Mace, who represents a swing district in South Carolina. All of them also voted against the continuing resolution that passed Saturday night.\n\nGaetz said Sunday that he plans to file a motion this week to oust McCarthy as speaker for working with Democrats to pass the stopgap measure.\n\nSummer Concepcion is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Biden says the election is a battle against 'MAGA Republicans.' He's been silent about Democrats elevating them.\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nHuddled with top Democratic donors in a recent meeting, party operatives got an uncomfortable question. Democrats had been spending millions of dollars in Republican primaries elevating extreme candidates who falsely insist Donald Trump won the 2020 election, in hopes of facing weaker opponents in the general election.\n\nBut, one donor asked, what happens if one of these far-right Republicans actually wins?\n\nSam Cornale, executive director of the Democratic National Committee, made no apologies, according to two people who were in the room and described the exchange to NBC News. The goal is to win elections, he and other Democratic panelists argued, and this is a way to make it happen.\n\n\"It's politics,\" Cornale told dozens of top donors at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C. Cornale works hand-in-hand with White House deputy chief of staff Jen O'Malley Dillon, who ran Biden's 2020 campaign and oversees his political office.\n\nThe raw political calculus that underpins the Democrats' midterm election strategy is at odds with President Joe Biden's core political message that democracy is in peril. He's dedicated his presidency to battling \"MAGA Republicans\" and working across the aisle to preserve the \"soul of the nation.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic,\" Biden said earlier this month in a speech in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia.\n\nYet even as Democrats plowed money into helping election-denying candidates advance through Republican primaries, the White House stayed conspicuously silent about a practice that risks undermining the democratic traditions that Biden has vowed to protect. Biden appears to have accepted the tradeoff involved: If boosting election-denying candidates saves even a few Democratic congressional seats, it's worth the risk.\n\nGiven opportunities to repudiate a strategy that has divided the party, the White House has refused. NBC News asked the White House what Biden thinks of the practice and whether he's ever voiced qualms about it. Officials declined to answer.\n\nIn a recent interview with NBC's Chuck Todd, Vice President Kamala Harris said, \"I'm not going to tell people how to run their campaigns.\"\n\nSome Democrats see in the White House's approach a willingness to prioritize winning over principle. They want a more full-throated repudiation of the practice from Biden on down and question the bet that MAGA Republicans are easier to defeat - elections are notoriously tough to predict. During the 2016 presidential campaign, many Democrats saw Trump as the weakest and, hence, most desirable opponent in the general election. They paid dearly for misreading the public mood.\n\nTim Roemer, a former Democratic congressman from Indiana, said, \"Democrats and President Biden have made defending democracy a primary issue going into the midterms. They potentially fall on a double-edged sword when you make it your issue and then you promote election liars.\"\n\nRoemer suggested that Democratic House members withhold dues to their main campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, in protest. (The DCCC did not make its chairman, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, available for comment.)\n\nOne Democratic senator, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk more freely, said the strategy \"is just not wise.\"\n\n\"The consequences of getting it wrong is you help facilitate people who are actively undermining democracy,\" the senator added. \"We are better off being who we are and being for what we're for and supporting our candidates.\"\n\nDefending the strategy, party officials told donors at the meeting earlier this month that the more moderate GOP candidates being targeted for defeat don't necessarily deserve any sympathy, attendees said. One Democratic donor who was in the room summarized the argument as: \"It's not like we're taking out the Baby Jesus.\"\n\nDemocratic consultants contend the \"moderate\" GOP alternatives sometimes hold views that are indistinguishable from those of the pro-Trump conservatives, justifying attempts to bounce them out of the race. In Pennsylvania, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Josh Shapiro spent hundreds of thousands of dollars elevating Doug Mastriano - an election denier who was outside the Capitol on Jan. 6 but has denied wrongdoing - over Lou Barletta in the GOP primary. One ad said a Mastriano victory would be a \"win for what Donald Trump stands for.\" But Barletta, too, has long aligned himself with Trump's agenda.\n\nThe tactic worked. In the general election, Shapiro will face Mastriano, who was endorsed by Trump. Polls show Shapiro leads by nearly seven points.\n\n\"If stupid people crave information about stupid candidates, we ought to supply them with the information,\" James Carville, a top adviser in Bill Clinton's 1992 successful presidential campaign, said in support of the Democrats' practice. \"We're giving ourselves the best chance to win. And that's what a campaign does. You try to get your horse in the most favorable position.\"\n\nAs the primary season played out, Democratic campaigns and various arms of the party spent millions of dollars in at least a dozen Republican primary races for gubernatorial, Senate and House seats. As with Mastriano, the aim was to showcase the candidates' pro-Trump credentials in hopes that GOP voters would take note and make them the party nominees. Then, when the general election rolls around in November, Democrats would face candidates whose extreme ideology would render them unelectable, as party operatives see it.\n\nAlthough Democrats didn't get every far-right opponent they paid for, the primary meddling was partly successful. Six of the Trumpier candidates whom Democrats elevated went on to capture the GOP nomination - two running for House seats, one for a Senate seat, and three for gubernatorial offices, including Mastriano.\n\nPolling and nonpartisan campaign analysis currently shows them all trailing their Democratic rivals. Yet upsets are common in politics, as some critics of the Democrats' practice observe.\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., a member of the House Jan. 6 committee and a staunch foe of Trump, said: \"For me, putting it all on the line with the Jan. 6 committee, it's tough to swallow people saying that the No. 1 fight is democracy survival and then playing with fire here. It may help retain more seats, but there are going to be two or maybe three of these election-denier candidates who actually win. And that's really dangerous.\"\n\nThe Democrats' plan, Kinzinger added, \"strikes me as cynical.\"\n\nIn some instances, Democrats promoted far-right candidates to avoid running against more moderate Republicans who took principled stands that may have cost them their political careers.\n\nIn Michigan, for example, the DCCC spent $425,000 on ads with the effect of bolstering the more conservative candidate. An ad that ran during the Republican primary said that GOP candidate for Congress John Gibbs was \"hand-picked by Trump\" and mentioned that he had called Trump \"the greatest president.\" Those points amounted to an implicit rebuke of Gibbs' opponent, Rep. Peter Meijer, who was one of only 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nGibbs went on to win and now faces Democrat Hillary Scholten in the fall election. The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan analyst, considers the race to be competitive, with Scholten having an edge.\n\n\"Without that [DCCC] money spent, it's very likely Peter could have skated through that primary,\" said Kinzinger, who is retiring from Congress at the end of his term. In voting for impeachment, Meijer \"made the tough, right decision and he paid the ultimate political price for it.\"\n\nThe argument leaves some Democrats unmoved. \"He [Meijer] probably votes against us on 99 things out of 100,\" said Carville. \"If we've got a chance for that seat, I'm sorry. The Democrats are in a much better position to pick up that seat now than if Peter Meijer won that primary.\"\n\n\"Could it backfire?\" he added. \"Yeah. But I don't think it will. It's an acceptable risk worth taking.\"\n\nPeter Nicholas is a senior White House reporter for NBC News.\n\nCarol E.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who promised to introduce articles of impeachment before the president was sworn into office. Johnson, Tyler said, made an about-face on the proceedings following a private meeting with Trump.\n\nMoreover, allies of the former president have drawn a link between impeachment and a need to \"inspire the base\" ahead of the presidential election next year, Tyler said in the memo.\n\n\"Instead of trying to deliver results for the American people, Trump's MAGA followers in the House are using their power to pursue an evidence-free impeachment sham all to help Trump's 2024 campaign,\" he continued.\n\nIt is the sharpest and most direct hit yet against Republicans' inquiry by the president's political operation, going after \"MAGA Republicans\" in a way the White House cannot .\n\nHouse Republicans accuse Biden and his family of improperly profiting from the now-president's decisions while he was vice president under then-President Barack Obama, but they have failed to come up with direct evidence of wrongdoing by him.\n\nThe Republican-controlled House is expected to proceed with a vote Wednesday that would grant the party new powers in its investigation of Biden and his family, and a resolution to authorize the inquiry is set to go before the House Rules Committee on Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans' slim margins mean they can only lose three votes if all members are present and Democrats vote against the measure. Biden's Democratic Party holds a narrow majority in the Senate, making it unlikely that the upper chamber would convict the president if the House does pass the articles of impeachment.\n\nTyler said the push for impeachment has lost popular support among Republican and independent voters and is opposed by more than half of Americans.\n\n\"Instead of focusing on the important issues that really matter to Americans' everyday lives, like lowering costs, creating new jobs, strengthening health care, or tackling gun violence, extreme MAGA Republicans have turned the House of Representatives into an arm of Donald Trump's 2024 campaign,\" he added.\n\nKatherine Doyle is a White House reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The White House has accused McCarthy of failing to make a counteroffer to the president's budget, risking the country's faith and credit in the process.\n\n\"America is not a deadbeat nation. We meet our obligations. ... No one should do anything to jeopardize the full faith and credit of the United States of America,\" Biden said Wednesday. \"They say we're going to default unless I agree to all these wacko notions of theirs.\"\n\nBiden said McCarthy delivered \"a speech without a plan\" in New York. McCarthy talks about \"limiting spending,\" Biden said, but \"what he didn't say, he didn't tell you exactly how much he wants to cut.\"\n\nIn criticizing House Republicans, Biden invoked Donald Trump's debt ceiling negotiation tactics when he was president, and he cited Trump's objections to using the debt limit to extract political concessions.\n\n\"'I can't imagine anybody ever even thinking about using the debt ceiling as a negotiating wedge,'\" Biden said, quoting Trump. \"I guess he didn't know the new MAGA Republicans he bred.\"\n\nBiden called on House Republicans to \"take default off the table and let's have a real serious conversation.\"\n\nThe White House has accused House Republicans of threatening to \"kill\" thousands of manufacturing jobs as GOP lawmakers eye cuts to Biden's infrastructure law and other legislation to pass a spending bill.\n\nBiden's remarks follow a call Tuesday with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both D-N.Y., in which the Democrats said they would stand firm on Biden's stance not to negotiate over the debt limit .\n\n\"President Biden, Leader Schumer, and Leader Jeffries agree that we won't negotiate over default and Republicans should pass a clean bill like they did three times in the previous administration,\" according to a readout of the call shared by the White House.\n\nHouse Republicans are moving ahead with a bill to lift the debt limit by $1.5 trillion or until March 31, which would include spending cuts and repeal some of Biden's signature legislation.

He has said that responsibility for increasing the nation's borrowing limit falls on Congress and that House Republicans led by Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California are trying to use the threat of default as leverage to force concessions.\n\n\"He wants to cut 22% of everything that isn't defense spending,\" Biden said, warning that \"thousands of wildland firefighters would stop getting paid,\" park rangers \"face losing their jobs\" and layoffs loom for workers regulating water quality.\n\n\"It would mean slashing resources for monitoring pollution, which would let polluters get away with and expose vulnerable communities to dirty air and water,\" Biden added. \"We can't let that happen.\"\n\nAsked about Biden saying McCarthy wants to cut 22% of all non-defense spending, the speaker's office pointed to remarks from a Thursday press conference where the GOP leader said: \"What we do is once we set the baseline, we go forward, and we decide, Republicans and Democrats, what our priorities are. It is the exact same thing that every single American family does.\"\n\nBiden and congressional leaders on Thursday postponed a planned Friday meeting to discuss the debt ceiling following fraught talks on Tuesday.

He has angered environmental activists, including over his decision to approve Willow, an $8 billion oil drilling project in Alaska.\n\nBiden said Thursday his administration had protected 9 million acres of land in Alaska and would ban new drilling in the Arctic Ocean.

      "text": "Donald Trump is outrunning other Republicans. What does it mean for November?\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nIn Arizona, Donald Trump leads Joe Biden by 4.6% â but Republican Kari Lake is down by seven in her Senate race. A similar trend can be seen across other key states, according to the Real Clear Politics averages: Trump is up on Biden in Pennsylvania by roughly 2%, but Republican David McCormick is down by almost 5%, and in Wisconsin, where Trump is in a statistical tie against Biden in the averages, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin is up by almost 7% against Republican Eric Hovde.\n\nTrumpâs superior polling is starting to attract more attention, especially after two prior elections where he was often portrayed as a drag on down-ballot candidates. The New York Timesâ Nate Cohn noted that some of Bidenâs biggest weak spots âÂ his losses with Black, Latino, and younger voters âÂ do not show up with Democratic Senate candidates in their surveys.\n\nBut the implications are also unclear: Does it suggest that Trump is breaking through with even core Democratic voters, setting himself up for a victory? Or that Biden has an opportunity to win back voters whose political instincts favor his party as they tune in more closely?\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe explanation we heard most often from strategists on the left, right, and center: Biden is unpopular in ways that are largely unique to him, regularly hitting sub-40 marks in approval ratings. And while Trump is still viewed unfavorably, polling also shows voters increasingly rating his presidency better by comparison.\n\nâI think this just speaks to the degree that Biden is a weak general election candidate when relatively uninspiring Democratic candidates are outperforming him so consistently across the board,â Patrick Ruffini, a Republican pollster and founding partner of Echelon Insights, told Semafor. âAll former presidents get better retrospective evaluations when they leave office. We just havenât had a chance to test how this would play out when one was a current candidate â until now.â\n\nOne of Bidenâs biggest weaknesses, according to polling, is the economy. Alyssa Cass, a partner at Slingshot Strategies working on Democratic messaging, told Semafor that voters across the spectrum say their No. 1 issue is costs â cost of living, food, housing, and more. The disparity between Trumpâs polling and Senate Republican candidates, she believes, is because voters associate this key issue with Biden.\n\nâTheyâre holding Joe Biden responsible for the price pressure they feel every time they go to the grocery store, but arenât assigning that same responsibility to their Senate candidate,â Cass said. âThat further makes sense when you have these Senate candidates who are, for the most part, riding on a MAGA platform and putting culture issues front and center. I donât think this is a culture war election. I think this is a âhow expensive are my groceriesâ election.â\n\nRecent polling from Blueprint, overseen by Cass, backs up that theory: Data released on May 16 found young voters are âprioritizing kitchen table issuesâ â and 52% of those polled trust Trump more than Biden when it comes to lowering prices.\n\nCook Political Reportâs recent swing state polling found that not only is Biden seen as inferior to Trump on fighting inflation, but 59% of voters think the president has at least some ability to control prices âÂ an expectation that could separate him from down-ballot Democrats who survived a worse economy in the midterms.\n\nThen there are other Biden-specific problems, namely his age âÂ 66% of voters said they did not think Biden would finish another term in the same Cook Political Report survey. By a 53%-47% margin, voters also reported being more concerned about Bidenâs age than Trumpâs temperament and legal issues, two weaknesses that are more unique to him.\n\nIn conversations with Republicans, some also say the race between the two candidates looks different than other partisan contests. Trump has largely focused on playing up his record as president and denigrating Bidenâs in broad terms, rather than trying to make the race a referendum on policy specifics or ideological purity.\n\nâAs has been the case for many years, President Trump leads the party and the ticket, and has expanded the Republican coalition to include voters that donât typically vote Republican or vote at all,â Danielle Alvarez, an RNC spokeswoman, said.\n\nAnd finally, some of it may just be simple name recognition. Republican Senate candidates are largely going up against incumbent Democrats this cycle, meaning they may need more time to consolidate right-leaning voters who are still not familiar with their campaign, and may face more resistance from voters who dislike Biden but have voted for their opponents before.\n\nâOne generalization is that Trump is a much better known entity â thereâs going to be a lot more certainty that people are voting for Trump right now,â Natalie Jackson, vice president of GQR Insights & Action and a pollster for Democrats, told Semafor.\n\nBen WIkler, chair of the Democratic Party in Wisconsin, made the case that strong Senate candidates will help boost Biden, a shift from the usual expectation that the top of the ticket drives turnout and persuasion below it. Democrats in other states have made similar arguments .\n\nâ2024 is the Year of Reverse Coattails,â Wikler said. âRunning as a Democrat in Wisconsin on the same ballot as Tammy Baldwin is like sprinting while wearing a jetpack. Running with Eric Hovde is like sprinting while wearing snow shoes.â\n\nBidenâs team is betting on the same issues that worked for them and the party in prior races will pay off by November. âAfter Joe Biden and Democrats beat Trump and MAGA Republicans in 2020, 2022, and in off-year and special elections, youâd think folks would realize by now that Trump and his MAGA agenda of banning abortion, cutting Social Security and Medicare, and tax breaks for the rich are political losers that will cost them again in November,â Seth Schuster, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said in a statement.\n\nReviewing a mix of recent polls at Split Ticket, Adam Carlson writes that âBiden has slipped among most subgroups relative to 2020, but heâs losing more support than Trump is gaining, meaning many are not (yet) eagerly embracing Trump and might still be persuadable.â\n\nThe Nevada Independentâs Gabby Birenbaum reports another sign of Trumpâs lack of coattails so far: Congressional Leadership Fund, the House GOPâs top Super PAC, has not reserved ad time against three Democratic incumbents even as some recent polls have shown Trump leading Biden by significant margins.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "The Biden campaign wants to remind voters why they turned on MAGA\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nPresident Biden is returning to a message thatâs worked for Democrats in races around the country since his election, portraying Donald Trump as a threat to American democracy who would use his perch to punish political enemies and reward fringe supporters.\n\nThe attacks have ramped up to a new level in recent days,Â particularly after Trump described his political enemies as âverminâ over the weekend. President Biden described Trumpâs remarks as âlanguage you heard in Nazi Germany in the â30sâ at a fundraiser on Tuesday after the White House issued a similar statement earlier in the week, pointing to news reports linking his rhetoric to Hitler and Mussolini. Democrats noted the presidentâs personal involvement asÂ a sign of a more confrontational phase after several months largely focused on positive messaging around his âBidenomicsâ agenda.\n\nThe campaign has also been publicly pushing the press to more extensively discuss reports detailing potential plans to use the federal government against enemies, implement sweeping immigration crackdowns, and more. A series of press releases warn about âTrumpâs America in 2025,â accusing the former president of being âhell-bent on undermining our democratic institutionsâ while warning that âa national abortion ban is on the ballot in 2024â3 (which Trump has so far not endorsed).\n\nA Biden campaign official told Semafor that their team planned to highlight under-the-radar policy planks proposed by Trump and his team âevery day between now and Thanksgiving.â\n\nâWhat we see is a failure to properly cover Donald Trumpâs dangerous agenda,â the campaign official said. âI think we are filling that void.â\n\nThe new attention presents a significant challenge for Trump, who has largely been focused on winning over Republican primary voters since leaving office. In the midterms, Republican candidates aligned with Trump suffered loss after loss in battleground states as Democrats warned that they would pursue a conspiracy-laden agenda and threaten free and fair elections after Jan. 6. A key turning point was the partyâs decision, backed up by high-profile speeches from Biden, to label their opponents âMAGA Republicansâ in the final stretch âÂ directly tying them to Trump, and tying newly legal abortion bans to his movement.\n\nDemocrats credited that message with convincing swing voters to overlook their frustration with Biden and the economy and pull the lever for their candidates. Whether TrumpÂ can find a way to neutralize or overpower the same attacks could potentially be the single biggest determinant as to whether he succeeds in returning the White House.\n\nâThe general election has begun,â Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg told Semafor. âItâs time now for the campaign to turn on, to adopt a general election posture, and to not only make their case, but to engage Trump more aggressively âÂ which theyâre now doing, and which I think is going to be effective and important.â\n\nPrivately, Trump aides admit that having their candidateâs name in the same sentence as Hitler and Mussolini this week isnât a positive. But they also see some upside as well: More media attention amplifies his attacks â one Trump advisor said seeing âverminâ next to Democrats in cable news chyrons was an âeffective messageâ âÂ and provides an opportunity to rally supporters by accusing the press of playing up the outrage. The campaignâs initial response also seemed to play up the dictator angle as a troll, with spokesman Steven Cheung telling the Washington Post their critics âare suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome and their entire existence will be crushed when President Trump returns to the White House.â\n\nOf course, as every team thatâs worked with Trump knows, they also have little choice but to build around the candidateâs message âÂ heâs the primary driver of his campaign and has historically pushed back against efforts by aides to restrain his speech. In the case of his âverminâ riff on Veterans Day, Semafor was told it was not written into his remarks. The comment during his speech closely mirrored a message on Truth Social, where he often writes his own posts.\n\nBut the Trump campaign is noticeably trying to exercise more discipline over the parts of the campaign they can control as the general election nears. That includes cracking down on the sprawling network of groups, politicians, and acquaintances associated with Trump and who have been sources for stories about his potential second administration ever since he left office. The campaignâs top two advisors, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, put out a lengthy statement this week distancing themselves from outside efforts to plan a transition and policy platform, declaring that ânone of these groups or individuals speak for President Trump or his campaign.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nOn the surface, nothing about this is new. Trump says inflammatory things about his opponents, Democrats warn Republicans are extremists and that âdemocracy is on the ballotâ â itâs all recognizable behavior dating back to 2015.\n\nBut this week has marked a shift towards a general election environment, and weâre starting to see some of the implications. Things Trump says are now treated as newsworthy in a way they werenât before he officially announced his presidential run last year (and before it became clear he was the overwhelmingly likely nominee this year), and the Biden campaign is trying to make that distinction clear. Democrats highlighting the âverminâ remark helped give it sustained media scrutiny over several days in ways that likely would not have happened a year ago. Expect to see a lot more working the refs from both sides moving forward, albeit with different complaints.\n\nThe framing of the race is also different. Up until now, both Republican candidates and coverage of their campaigns have been focused most on the Republican voters theyâll face in the primaries. As that shifts, the views of swing voters âÂ like the famed âdouble hatersâ who dislike both Biden and Trump âÂ are going to take up more and more attention.\n\nUltimately, this very news cycle showcases the big test for both candidates. Can Trump make the election a referendum on Bidenâs policies on issues like the economy and immigration, where polls show voters trust Republicans more? Or can Biden make the election a choice between conventional American politics and what he argues is an unacceptably dangerous alternative?\n\nTrumpâs Republican opponents arenât ready to move onto the general election just yet. Candidates are betting he has a weak spot in Iowa, where voters often make up their minds late and outside groups see signs of softness in his support.\n\nA new poll from Quinnipiac University finds that 21% of Americans identify âpreserving democracyâ as their most important election issue from a list of ten, trailing only the economy as the top choice.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "As Republicans stumble, Democrats look to make 2024 a referendum on âchaosâ\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nPresident Biden has long pitched himself as the steady alternative to Donald Trumpâs nonstop chaos. A spate of self-induced Republican drama is giving that argument some new heft right as the general election comes into view.\n\nThis week alone, Republicans upended a major border deal negotiated by their own members; failed to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas thanks to a combination of internal dissent and vote-counting mishaps; and a MAGA-led effort to oust RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel has reached a fever pitch. Trumpâs multi-front legal battles also continued to make daily headlines, including a resounding court loss for his argument that presidents should enjoy substantial legal immunity after leaving office.\n\nâItâs not just a chaotic week,â Kate Berner, who held communications roles in Bidenâs 2020 campaign and in the White House, told Semafor. âItâs chaotic because Donald Trump and congressional Republicans and the MAGA Republican Party canât govern or deliver results for the American people.â\n\nWeâve already seen Democrats begin to tie this weekâs events into that core argument: âHouse Democrats will continue to choose common sense solutions to solving problems on behalf of hardworking American families, House Republicans continue to choose chaos,â House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nBidenâs reelection campaign is betting that once again, theyâll be able to convince voters that any failure or drama on the side of Republicans is because of the former president â and this week in particular seems to be a turning point in making that argument.\n\nâWeâve had a good week because Republicans have shot themselves in the foot,â a Biden campaign aide told Semafor. âThereâs a lot for us to work with, and weâre going to be able to highlight Joe Biden focusing on issues that matter for voters while Republicans are not.â\n\nThere are echoes of 2020, when Biden accused Trump of â rooting for chaos â by stoking racial tensions amid protests and riots in order to capitalize politically. Biden is already pledging to campaign on a similar argument after Trump helped scuttle the bipartisan border bill, arguing that the former president is trying to make conditions worse for Americans in order to reap a personal benefit. It doesnât hurt that some Republicans have outright said they feared a deal would benefit Bidenâs election prospects.\n\nâThe voters are going to know that just at the moment weâre going to secure the border and fund these other programs, Trump and the MAGA Republicans said ânoâ because theyâre afraid of Donald Trump,â Biden said .\n\nThe chaos focus is also one that Nikki Haley, Trumpâs only remaining main opponent in the primary race, has begun honing. And the Biden campaign seems more than happy that sheâs picking up the mantle: On Wednesday, the Biden campaign promoted multiple Haley comments on the topic on X. In one, she posted that âa vote for Trump is a vote for more chaos,â citing some of the drama that unfolded that week at the behest of the former president.\n\nIn this article:\n\nTypically, failures in Congress get blamed on whoever is in office, regardless of who is actually at fault, and Biden is running for reelection under a different light than 2020. Biden is betting on a bank-shot argument this time that offloads responsibility to his opponent, who as a court ruling put it this week, is now âcitizen Trumpâ and has no legal authority. Itâs a risky bet, especially if voters interpret it as passing the buck.\n\nTrump is not an ordinary candidate and he has his own poll numbers to worry about. Voters have strong opinions about him, they know his record, and even as recent surveys show him competitive or leading Biden in head-to-head matchups, they also find voters conflicted based on his personal traits and legal troubles. For Biden, the task may be as simple as reminding them why they soured on him ahead of the 2020 race rather than anything more elaborate.\n\nDonald Trumpâs campaign is arguing that Americans are feeling the negative results of the last four years under Biden, and that those feelings will inevitably come back to Bidenâs leadership.\n\nâUnder their watch, the border is out of control,â Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said. âUnder their watch, inflation is sky high. Under their watch, prices of everyday goods have skyrocketed. Under their watch, America is getting into all these foreign conflicts. Thereâs no way for them to gaslight voters into thinking that theyâve done a good job. Itâs clear today that they havenât. President Trump is going to run on his record, and Democrats and Joe Biden are going to have to run on their own record. As weâve seen the last four years, their record has been shitty at best.â\n\nThe overwhelming assumption in this weekâs punditry is that Joe Biden has been handed a gift this week by Republicans. But there is also skepticism about his ability to capitalize given his limitations so far as a political communicator. Politico summed it up , noting that âwhile Democrats privately agreed that theyâd been gifted a political opening, not everyone was confident in the capacity to exploit it.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Could Trump really âend democracy?â\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nAt The Washington Post, Isaac Arnsdorf covers Donald Trump and the MAGA movement from the grassroots up. Ideas that sound odd or unworkable to elite Republicans â a âprecinct committeemanâ strategy? Purging Ronna McDaniel? â make sense to the activists he talks to. And for the last three years, theyâve kept Trump in control of the GOP, replacing the ex-presidentâs enemies and signing up for every kind of electoral work. In âFinish What We Started: The MAGA Movementâs Ground War to End Democracy,â Arnsdorf tells this story from the moment Trump left office to the week that Steve Bannonâs âWar Roomâ army helped replace the Speaker of the House. This is an edited transcript of our conversation about it.\n\nAmericana: Can you define what you mean by âending democracy?â If this movement is successful, what changes about our democracy?\n\nIsaac Arnsdorf: That language is very much a part of the movement. Sometimes, you hear it in terms like âthis is not really a democracy, itâs a republic.â But you also have people who donât think of themselves as being anti-democratic, and believe democracy actually failed when the election was stolen from Trump. And Trump himself is trying to turn this around by accusing Biden of being a threat to democracy.\n\nWeâve never heard Trump say that he will accept the outcome of an election if it doesnât go his way. That goes all the way back to 2016. And weâve never heard Trump disavow violence. The way that [political scientist] Adam Przeworski put it is that democracy is a system where parties lose elections. What does that mean? Lots of countries have elections that are not free and fair, and the party in power canât lose. If Trump does win in November â and he absolutely could win a free and fair election â he and the people around him, whoâd return to the administration with him, would be much more determined to consolidate power . They would make it harder for them to ever be dislodged.\n\nAmericana: Steve Bannon talks about re-making the Republican Party into a populist party that will win for 100 years. Is he talking about some situation, like in Japan, where elections are fair but one party is so dominant that it almost always wins? Or something else?\n\nIsaac Arnsdorf: Thereâs some ambiguity there, which I think is intentional. Bannon is saying that if you kind of unleash the power of MAGA nationalism, you could have a majority coalition forever. But at the same time, heâs saying Trump didnât lose when he really did lose â the voting machines are corrupt, and we have to have paper ballots with no early voting. Tactically, a lot of whatâs driving that movement is being focused on changing the rules to make sure that the other side canât win.\n\nAmericana: So what would that mean in practice? How does democracy change if Trump wins and implements these ideas?\n\nIsaac Arnsdorf: This was sort of the Chekhovâs gun of 2020, taken off the wall and put down on the table. The post-election legal process exposed all the soft spots in the electoral system. Trump and his campaign and his lawyers were not able to successfully exploit them, because they got there too late, or they didnât have their act together, and a handful of Republicans didnât go along with it. And the book covers this effort of purging and purifying the party to make sure that there wouldnât be uncooperative Republicans like that in the future. But it also looks at ways that activists got involved earlier in the process, when the ballots are actually being cast and counted, not just when theyâre being certified. Right now, you have a lot more Republican investment in scrutinizing voter rolls and deploying poll observers, with the stated purpose of collecting evidence that can be used to challenge the results.\n\nAmericana: How does the experience of 2022 affect this movement? Thereâs a lot of success, in the run-up to the midterms, of winning precinct committee jobs and changing election laws. And then Republicans do pretty poorly under those rules, in those conditions.\n\nIsaac Arnsdorf: It doesnât change things as much as you might expect. Itâs funny, both the MAGA Republicans and the non-MAGA traditional Republicans agree that Republicans underperformed in the midterms for the same reason: The non-MAGA Republicans rejected the MAGA candidates. They just disagree about whoâs wrong and who needs to cave. It did cause an acknowledgment on the MAGA side that only voting in person, on Election Day, is not great tactically, because youâre going up against Democrats who are using early and mail voting thatâs much more convenient. So, Republicans are now in this awkward position of trying to message, âHey, we hate early voting and mail voting, and we want to get rid of it, and we donât trust it, and we need to use it where it exists so that we can beat the Democrats.â\n\nAmericana: That was Ronna McDanielâs message, and the movement got rid of her. Do the people you covered see that as a win?\n\nIsaac Arnsdorf: They consider that a total victory. Itâs not a stretch to say that a coordinated nationwide campaign to start at the bottom of the party ladder and work your way up to get new leadership resulted in new leadership, in just a few years. Youâve got to give some credit where credit is due.\n\nThe MAGA alternative-media ecosystem has also really matured in the past several years. Actually, being de-platformed by the major social networks, and being kind of shunned by major media organizations for a time, kind of helped it grow. Bannon became the sun of that solar system, especially in early 2021 when Trump was laying low. And you see this at Trump rallies. People will jeer at the TV cameras and the press pen until they see Right Side Broadcasting, and then they want to come over and get a picture with [RSB host] Brian Glenn. You see a development of alternative information sources that are considered valid within the movement, plus an overall mistrust in everything else.\n\nAmericana: Bannon talks a lot about âBowling Alone,â and social cohesion, and how weâve lost it. What meaning do these activists find in their lives from being involved?\n\nIsaac Arnsdorf: Being active in the MAGA movement has taken the place of those more old-fashioned community bonds, like the Rotary Club. Iâve talked to people at Trump rallies who describe it as their church, as a religious experience. Iâve talked to a few activists who became part of this post-2020 wave of joining the party, who say how they never made so many friends so quickly in their lives. Coming out of the isolation of the pandemic, that formation of community becomes a formation of identity. And thatâs an extremely powerful force in politics that Bannon is very intentional about using to motivate people.\n\nDemocrats and anti-Trump Republicans have picked up on that, too. The messaging that they developed, tested, and had a lot of success with in the midterms was built around authentic messengers: Republicans, people who consider themselves Republicans, for whom itâs important to think of themselves as Republicans, who just couldnât stand the Republicans on the ballot in 2022. Thatâs going to be a big part of the strategy to defeat Trump in 2024.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Donald Trump buries the hatchet(s)\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nFacing a new opponent who has energized the base and brought the race back to an effective tie, Donald Trump is beginning to bury the hatchet with former foes: âBirdbrainâ Nikki Haley would now be welcome out on the campaign trail; heâs thanked âbad guyâ Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp for all his âhelp and supportâ in the state; âRadical Left Lunaticâ Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now a part of his transition team.\n\nThe timing isnât exactly coincidental or out of the blue: The Trump campaign has engaged in multiple behind-the-scenes conversations about the need to unite the party and get some of these folks back into the fold. The theory among many in Trump world is simple: If the party doesnât unite, they risk losing.\n\nâWe need to make sure that the basics of our coalition are nailed down,â one person close to the campaign explained. âThe president definitely gets it.â\n\nAt least for right now, Trump does seem to get it: His embrace of these characters heâs long attacked is a shift, and a recent one at that â at a rally earlier this month in Georgia, the former president dismayed many of his allies when he went on a rant against Kemp, who remains popular in the key state.\n\nThereâs a few reasons for the change: The biggest one being, of course, that Trump himself has decided (swayed by multiple reasons) that this is what he needs to do to win. The advisors in his ear certainly played a role, although they only hold so much influence. But the overall story is that a candidate who seemed to treat his return to the White House as inevitable in July is contending with a much tougher race in August.\n\nTrump rarely, if ever, publicly apologizes for insulting a political rival, and hasnât in any of the cases listed here, but his allies have more flexibility to repair the damage. There have been concerted efforts in some of these cases to privately mend fences â Donald Trump Jr., Tucker Carlson, and Omeed Malik worked for months to build up the relationship between Kennedy and Trump, and JD Vance told reporters that heâd talked to Kemp, who was entirely âbehind the ticketâ before Trump came out with his praise. And it doesnât hurt that Trump saw some of these figures strategically backing down: Kemp with a Fox News interview expressing his support for Trump and Haley slowly tamping down on her criticisms of him after bowing out of the race being two prime examples.\n\nIn this article:\n\nItâs important to remember that weâve seen versions of this show before. Trumpâs inner circle is filled with politicians who he once denounced and advisors he once exiled. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, for one, was widely seen as one of Trumpâs top three vice presidential options this campaign cycle â a stark contrast to the 2016 presidential race, where Trump ridiculed him on the trail as âLittle Marco.â So, while this week Trump might be building a unity coalition, next week he might decide he doesnât like the fact that Kemp is exploring ways to remove certain Trump-aligned members of the State Election Board.\n\nOne campaign adviser said that internally, the amends felt âkind of familiar,â as the team has long been focused on building out a broad coalition and Trump often jumps between denouncing and embracing political rivals.\n\nâSometimes his level of honesty is unfettered,â this person said. âHeâs still not ever going to meet the traditional political vein, [but] heâs somebody who still understands the dynamic of relationships in politics.â\n\nThe shift in his relationships, though, is still notable, if only because of what it says about how he views the election. After he won the nomination for a third time, he showed much less interest than is typical from a winning candidate in bringing fallen rivals and their supporters back into the fold, confident that he didnât need to in order to defeat a weakened President Biden. That calculus has clearly shifted with Vice President Harris in the race.\n\nTrump isnât just trying to bring in non-MAGA Republicans to his camp: His team confirmed on Tuesday that Kennedy and Tulsi Gabbard have been tapped to play a role in his transition team.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe White House is looking to turn recent comments by Rep. Matt Gaetz into a cudgel in its messaging battle over the debt ceiling, after the Florida Republican eagerly described himself and his fellow conservatives as âhostageâ takers.\n\nâMAGA Republicans explicitly yelled the quiet part out loud,â says a new memo from White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gaetz told Semafor that hardline members of the GOP conference were uninterested in making new concessions on a debt ceiling deal, having already passed their own party-line legislation.Â  âI think my conservative colleagues for the most part support Limit, Save, Grow, and they donât feel like we should negotiate with our hostage,â Gaetz said.\n\nThe administrationâs memo accuses the House GOP leaders of âcaving to the most extreme MAGA Republican membersâ and warns a default could sink the country into a calamitous recession.\n\nâStop holding millions of people âhostageâ who donât have $100,000 to spend on chapstick,â the memoâs subject line reads, a reference to the recent House GOP auction of chapstick that Speaker Kevin McCarthy used.\n\nIn this article:\n\nGaetz isnât the only conservative pressuring Republican leadership to not budge in negotiations. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, an influential member of the House Freedom Caucus, sent a memo to House Republicans warning against any compromise on the GOPâs debt limit bill.\n\nIt listed the billâs key planks including revoking clean energy tax credits, securing decade-long budget caps, and handing Congress more power in approving federal regulations, among others.Â  âEach are critical and none should be abandoned solely for the quest of a deal,â the Roy memo said.\n\nDemocrats have spent weeks arguing that Republicans are effectively pointing a gun at the economy, as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen put it , by threatening not to raise the debt ceiling unless the White House agrees to major budget cuts.\n\nItâs unclear how well the message has resonated with voters. A recent poll by CNN found that 60% of Americans believed Congress should only raise the governmentâs borrowing if it cuts spending at the same time. However, 51% of adults told Monmouth University that the debt ceiling and spending should be dealt with separately â suggesting that answers on the issue may be sensitive to how the question is framed.\n\nStill, thereâs a sense of concern among some Democrats that theyâre losing the PR battle, as well as fear that any final deal could contain aggressive spending reductions and broader work requirements for safety net programs.\n\nThatâs creating a sense of whiplash among some Democrats, after many championed President Bidenâs expansive budget at the start of the debt limit standoff earlier in the year.\n\nâWe were talking about reinstating the expanded CTC, now weâre talking about work requirements for food assistance,â a Senate Democratic aide told Semafor.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Americana\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nOn Wednesday night, after two days of perplexed questions about his new abortion position , Donald Trump did what came naturally. He declared victory.\n\nâThe states are handling it,â Trump said in a short video, insisting that by opposing a federal law limiting abortion heâd defanged the Democrats. âItâs totally killed that issue.â\n\nAlmost no one in politics acted as if Trump was right; not the Biden campaign, not anti-abortion activists, and not Republican candidates scrambling for a response to new abortion bans in Florida and Arizona. His attempt to answer that question prompted more questions about what else a second Trump White House could do with the rule-making authority that President Joe Biden has used to expand reproductive rights.\n\nThatâs a source of tension between his campaign, which has not been specific about the way Trump would exercise executive power on abortion â and the people planning for his administration, who have.\n\nâWhy scare the hell out of voters over something thatâs not going to happen?â asked Mike Davis, a pro-Trump attorney and legal activist, referring to the Senate supermajority it would take to pass a federal abortion law. âThe rules will happen.â\n\nSince launching his third presidential bid, Trump has offered some specifics on how heâd use executive power to attack his top priorities â expelling illegal immigrants, putting tariffs on foreign goods, cutting funds for schools that teach âcritical race theory.â Heâs been more vague on abortion, even though conservative activists and policy scholars have laid out a litany of actions he could take next year.\n\nPlenty of their ideas were collected in âMandate for Leadership,â the policy book published by the Heritage Foundationâs Project 2025. Some of its contributors, like ex-Trump DOJ Office of Civil Rights head Roger Severino, have talked and written openly about what a restored Trump administration could do.\n\nBut five months ago, Trump campaign co-managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles put out a statement distancing the campaign from the âlargely unfoundedâ stories about a second term agenda running in unnamed outlets â often The New York Times and Politico. They were, said the Trump team, âneither appropriate nor constructive,â about what a second Trump administration would do.\n\nâAny personnel lists, policy agendas, or government plans published anywhere are merely suggestions,â they wrote. âAll 2024 campaign policy announcements will be made by President Trump or members of his campaign team.â\n\nKNOW MORE\n\nThe list of potential anti-abortion measures Trump could enact is long but straightforward. Some items were acted on during his administration and reversed by Joe Biden; some start with the powers that Biden has used to expand abortion access, and use them to restrict it instead.\n\nâTheir creativity knows no bounds when it comes to pushing abortion on the American people,â Severino said on a Family Research Council podcast last year. âWhenever the word âpregnancyâ appears, they mean âabortion,â which of course violates common sense.â\n\nThe Trump campaign has refused to say how a second administration would interpret the Comstock Act, a set of 1873 laws that restrict the mailing of obscene materials. After the Dobbs decision, the Biden administration issued a legal guidance that protected the mailing of the abortion drugs mifepristone and misoprostol, judging that it didnât violate those laws. But in the Project 2025 handbook, Severino argued that a new conservative administration should âannounce its intent to enforce federal law against providers and distributors of such pills.â\n\nIn the Heritage Foundationâs assessment â Project 2025 is a joint effort with dozens of conservative groups, but Heritage condensed the basics â every action Biden took to go around state abortion limits can be reversed.\n\nâThe Biden self-proclaimed whole of government approach to promoting and mandating abortion would be replaced by a whole of government commitment to life-affirming support for pregnant women and parents,â said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, who was critical of Trump for coming out against any kind of federal abortion limit. âTrump would roll back Bidenâs funding for abortionists like Planned Parenthood at home and abroad. He would put an end to use of military and veteransâ resources for abortion and address the damage done when Biden rolled back safety standards for abortion drugs.â\n\nTrump, according to Project 2025âs report, could âeliminate the HHS Reproductive Healthcare Access Task Force,â which Biden created on Roeâ s 49th anniversary, âand install a pro-life task force to ensure that all of the departmentâs divisions seek to use their authority to promote the life and health of women and their unborn children.â\n\nHe could end Bidenâs Gender Policy Council, created on the day he took the reins from Trump, and thereby âeliminate central promotion of abortion (âhealth servicesâ); comprehensive sexuality education (âeducationâ); and the new woke gender ideology.â The expansion of abortion rights in veteransâ and military health programs, which Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville tried and failed to end by blocking military nominees, could be ended by the executive branch.\n\nThen thereâs the question of judges: Trump and other Republicans have distanced themselves from the Alabama court that effectively halted IVF treatment and the Arizona court that revived an 1864 territorial law criminalizing abortion, but the decisions came from GOP appointees from the same conservative movement that informed Trumpâs first term judicial overhaul. In 2016, he promised to appoint judges who would overturn Roe ; heâs yet to say what legal theories heâd keep in mind when making future picks. Would nominees whoâve backed âpersonhoodâ arguments like the one that roiled Alabama get through, for example?\n\nâTheyâve seen the backlash to extreme anti-abortion policies,â said Katie OâConnor, the director of federal abortion policy at the National Womenâs Law Center. âEven Trump is seeing the writing on the wall. Heâs not going to tip his hand on what he would implement. We know that heâd do what Severino asked him to.â\n\nDAVIDâS VIEW\n\nThe clarity of these ideas, and Trumpâs evasiveness on specific abortion questions, has created a two-track campaign. In one of them, the Republican nominee is careful about taking potentially unpopular positions, and does most of his interviews with conservative media outlets that donât ask about them. In the other, policy advocates have explained exactly how Trump could act, sometimes admitting outright that it would be a mistake for the candidate to talk about it.\n\nâI hope he doesnât know about the existence of Comstock, because I just donât want him to shoot off his mouth,â Texas attorney Jonathan Mitchell told The New York Times, who has guided a legal strategy to ban the mailing of abortion medication. âI think the pro-life groups should keep their mouths shut as much as possible until the election.â\n\nOkay, set aside the irony of that quote. Trump did get through the Republican primary without answering any of these questions. Biden hasnât really faced questions, either; his actions to expand abortion access have been covered through the broader prism of abortion polling, which found most Americans unhappy with the Dobbs decision.\n\nâWe cannot allow an out-of-control Supreme Court, working in conjunction with the extremist elements of the Republican Party, to take away freedoms and our personal autonomy,â Biden said after Dobbs was handed down. Biden says all of this in public, and Trump doesnât respond.\n\nThe larger conservative movement may be getting more careful, too. The âfourth pillarâ of Project 2025 â pillars one through three cover policy and staffing â is an effort to write executive orders that Trump could implement immediately, robust enough that they couldnât be undermined by lawsuits or delay tactics. Unlike the rest of the project, itâs not been published, and may not be before the election.\n\nTHE VIEW FROM THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN\n\nAny time the Biden-Harris ticket can talk about abortion, it does. The vice president will be in Arizona today, where sheâs expected to speak in more detail about what the administrationâs done on abortion rights and what Trump could undo.\n\nâDonald Trump unleashed this chaos on women in America, heâs proud of it, and his allies are planning more,â said campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika. âHis campaign isnât answering these questions about his plans to rip away access to reproductive health care nationwide because all of the answers are desperately unpopular with the American people.â\n\nNOTABLE\n\nNebraska. Gov. Jim Pillen floated the idea of a special legislative session to change how his state awards electoral votes, after the state GOP and Turning Point Action rallied in Omaha for that change. If a majority of legislators endorsed the idea â Pillenâs condition for calling the session â it could end the stateâs 33-year practice of splitting its vote by congressional district, which in 2008 and 2020 allowed Democratic presidential candidates to win an electoral vote by carrying the stateâs biggest city. Rep. Don Bacon, the Republican who represents Omaha and the 2nd Congressional District, told CNN that he endorsed the change: âI think it undermines the influence of Nebraska. I think it should be standardized.â Bacon faces a conservative challenger, Dan Frei, in the upcoming May 14 primary.\n\nWisconsin. State Supreme Court Justice Ann Walsh Bradley will retire next year, creating another battle for the majority after liberals secured a 4-3 advantage in 2023. That yearâs victory for Judge Janet Protasiewicz was the most expensive for any judicial candidate in American history, and conservatives already had a relatively well-known candidate running for the 2025 opening â Brad Schimel , the former state attorney general who served a single term before losing in a 2018 Democratic sweep. Two liberal judges, Chris Taylor and Susan Crawford, said they were considering running after Walsh Bradleyâs announcement.\n\nClear Choice PAC, âSpoiler.â Formed last month by Biden allies, Clear Choice PACâs mission is wrecking Robert F. Kennedy Jr.âs image with liberal and progressive voters. Its first attempt â 60 seconds of attacks on Kennedyâs âracistâ vaccine skepticism, his (now lonely) endorsement of a federal abortion limit, and his hypothetical willingness to serve in a Trump cabinet. The strategy: Fixing Kennedy in swing votersâ minds as a Trump puppet with an ironic last name.\n\nRick Scott for Florida, âValues.â Former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, the Democrat running against Scott, launched her campaign with an attack on the stateâs six-week abortion ban. She spent the last week attacking the state supreme court for upholding the ban, and endorsing the constitutional amendment that would replace it with a 24-week ban if 60% of voters support it in November. Scott has started to run his own ads on other themes, which worked for him six years ago, like fighting âsocialism.â Here, he visits a memorial with Floridians who escaped communist countries, ruminating on what was lost: âIn Florida, we understand how socialism suffocates the human spirit.â\n\nFriends of Sherrod Brown, âRight Here.â In February, Intel admitted that it wouldnât finish building its new $20 billion chip factory in Ohio until 2026. But itâs coming, and Brown, in one of the many Democratic ads about bills passed from 2021 through 2022, celebrates it by holding a chip in front of the New Albany construction site: âI worked with Republicans to jump-start American chip manufacturing.â\n\nMoments after Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson won the March gubernatorial primary, Democrats were firing off the opposition research theyâd compiled on him. A HuffPost story about a particularly esoteric Robinson speech, in which he pined for âthe America where women couldnât vote,â circulated for days. One month later, Robinsonâs image has been badly bruised; 31% of all voters say they donât like him âas a person,â and 40% say they donât like his issue positions. Right now, he runs weaker with women and independents than Trump.\n\nMinnesota is one of the easier states for third party ballot access, which hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016 and could hurt Biden this year. Since 2020, heâs lost little support in Minneapolis and its suburbs, and Trump has lost nothing in Greater Minnesota. But Biden won independents by 15 points in 2020, and he barely leads with them now, partly because one in four self-identified independents say theyâre supporting someone else. No alternatives are named, but they have until Aug. 20 to make the ballot.\n\nWeâve got some exciting additions to the list of speakers at the World Economy Summit , including Jeremy Hunt , UK Chancellor of the Exchequer; Gina Raimondo , U.S. Secretary of Commerce and Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers .

Republican secretaries of State in Ohio and Alabama both warned Democrats that the official nomination of the Biden-Harris ticket might come too late for them to make the ballot. The Democratic National Convention begins right after both statesâ ballot deadlines â a problem that both states quickly resolved in 2020, when the Republican National Convention had the same problem. Ohio Republicans passed a one-time bill to extend their grace period, while Alabamaâs Secretary of State accepted a provisional letter from the RNC, affirming that Trump would be its nominee. Democrats are weighing their options for ballot access, and could hold a virtual vote to nominate Biden and Harris in late June, before the convention, after all of its delegates are selected.\n\nIndependent candidate Cornel West named his running mate , California activist Melina Abdullah, who founded the Los Angeles chapter of Black Lives Matter and built a distracting history of posts on Twitter. Critics emphasized her comments after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, endorsing rallies that day that were condemned by many Democrats.\n\nâI think itâs really important to understand where uprisings come from, even when we may disagree with tactics that are used,â Abdullah told CNN in a joint interview with West. âI find it really troubling that we are constantly asked to condemn Hamas. Iâm not a member of Hamas, I find it even more troubling that an entire state has been built on the genocide of a people.â\n\nAt The Washington Post, Isaac Arnsdorf covers Donald Trump and the MAGA movement from the grassroots up. Ideas that sound odd or unworkable to elite Republicans â a âprecinct committeemanâ strategy? Purging Ronna McDaniel? â make sense to the activists he talks to. And for the last three years, theyâve kept Trump in control of the GOP, replacing the ex-presidentâs enemies and signing up for every kind of electoral work. In âFinish What We Started: The MAGA Movementâs Ground War to End Democracy,â Arnsdorf tells this story from the moment Trump left office to the week that Steve Bannonâs âWar Roomâ army helped replace the Speaker of the House. This is an edited transcript of our conversation about it.\n\nAmericana: Can you define what you mean by âending democracy?â If this movement is successful, what changes about our democracy?\n\nIsaac Arnsdorf: That language is very much a part of the movement. Sometimes, you hear it in terms like âthis is not really a democracy, itâs a republic.â But you also have people who donât think of themselves as being anti-democratic, and believe democracy actually failed when the election was stolen from Trump. And Trump himself is trying to turn this around by accusing Biden of being a threat to democracy.\n\nWeâve never heard Trump say that he will accept the outcome of an election if it doesnât go his way. That goes all the way back to 2016. And weâve never heard Trump disavow violence. The way that [political scientist] Adam Przeworski put it is that democracy is a system where parties lose elections. What does that mean? Lots of countries have elections that are not free and fair, and the party in power canât lose. If Trump does win in November â and he absolutely could win a free and fair election â he and the people around him, whoâd return to the administration with him, would be much more determined to consolidate power . They would make it harder for them to ever be dislodged.\n\nAmericana: Steve Bannon talks about re-making the Republican Party into a populist party that will win for 100 years. Is he talking about some situation, like in Japan, where elections are fair but one party is so dominant that it almost always wins? Or something else?\n\nIsaac Arnsdorf: Thereâs some ambiguity there, which I think is intentional. Bannon is saying that if you kind of unleash the power of MAGA nationalism, you could have a majority coalition forever. But at the same time, heâs saying Trump didnât lose when he really did lose â the voting machines are corrupt, and we have to have paper ballots with no early voting. Tactically, a lot of whatâs driving that movement is being focused on changing the rules to make sure that the other side canât win.\n\nAmericana: So what would that mean in practice? How does democracy change if Trump wins and implements these ideas?\n\nIsaac Arnsdorf: This was sort of the Chekhovâs gun of 2020, taken off the wall and put down on the table. The post-election legal process exposed all the soft spots in the electoral system. Trump and his campaign and his lawyers were not able to successfully exploit them, because they got there too late, or they didnât have their act together, and a handful of Republicans didnât go along with it. And the book covers this effort of purging and purifying the party to make sure that there wouldnât be uncooperative Republicans like that in the future. But it also looks at ways that activists got involved earlier in the process, when the ballots are actually being cast and counted, not just when theyâre being certified. Right now, you have a lot more Republican investment in scrutinizing voter rolls and deploying poll observers, with the stated purpose of collecting evidence that can be used to challenge the results.\n\nAmericana: How does the experience of 2022 affect this movement? Thereâs a lot of success, in the run-up to the midterms, of winning precinct committee jobs and changing election laws. And then Republicans do pretty poorly under those rules, in those conditions.\n\nIsaac Arnsdorf: It doesnât change things as much as you might expect. Itâs funny, both the MAGA Republicans and the non-MAGA traditional Republicans agree that Republicans underperformed in the midterms for the same reason: The non-MAGA Republicans rejected the MAGA candidates. They just disagree about whoâs wrong and who needs to cave. It did cause an acknowledgment on the MAGA side that only voting in person, on Election Day, is not great tactically, because youâre going up against Democrats who are using early and mail voting thatâs much more convenient. So, Republicans are now in this awkward position of trying to message, âHey, we hate early voting and mail voting, and we want to get rid of it, and we donât trust it, and we need to use it where it exists so that we can beat the Democrats.â\n\nAmericana: That was Ronna McDanielâs message, and the movement got rid of her. Do the people you covered see that as a win?\n\nIsaac Arnsdorf: They consider that a total victory. Itâs not a stretch to say that a coordinated nationwide campaign to start at the bottom of the party ladder and work your way up to get new leadership resulted in new leadership, in just a few years. Youâve got to give some credit where credit is due.\n\nThe MAGA alternative-media ecosystem has also really matured in the past several years. Actually, being de-platformed by the major social networks, and being kind of shunned by major media organizations for a time, kind of helped it grow. Bannon became the sun of that solar system, especially in early 2021 when Trump was laying low. And you see this at Trump rallies. People will jeer at the TV cameras and the press pen until they see Right Side Broadcasting, and then they want to come over and get a picture with [RSB host] Brian Glenn. You see a development of alternative information sources that are considered valid within the movement, plus an overall mistrust in everything else.\n\nAmericana: Bannon talks a lot about âBowling Alone,â and social cohesion, and how weâve lost it. What meaning do these activists find in their lives from being involved?\n\nIsaac Arnsdorf: Being active in the MAGA movement has taken the place of those more old-fashioned community bonds, like the Rotary Club. Iâve talked to people at Trump rallies who describe it as their church, as a religious experience. Iâve talked to a few activists who became part of this post-2020 wave of joining the party, who say how they never made so many friends so quickly in their lives. Coming out of the isolation of the pandemic, that formation of community becomes a formation of identity. And thatâs an extremely powerful force in politics that Bannon is very intentional about using to motivate people.\n\nDemocrats and anti-Trump Republicans have picked up on that, too. The messaging that they developed, tested, and had a lot of success with in the midterms was built around authentic messengers: Republicans, people who consider themselves Republicans, for whom itâs important to think of themselves as Republicans, who just couldnât stand the Republicans on the ballot in 2022. Thatâs going to be a big part of the strategy to defeat Trump in 2024.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

Read it now .\n\nDemocrats are gearing up for another âdefund the policeâ messaging fight âÂ except this time itâs highlighting Republicans calls to defund the Federal Bureau of Investigations and the Justice Department. And donât be surprised if it makes its way into some campaign ads later this cycle.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has already begun the process by declaring, in a letter to his Senate colleagues, heâll bring a vote to the floor this week to reject Donald Trumpâs call to defund the FBI and DOJ one day after his indictment by a Manhattan DA.\n\nThe resolution will recognize the dedication of federal law enforcement, condemn calls to defund the agencies and reject attempts by Trump to âdegrade public trust in Federal law enforcement agencies.â\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene R-Ga. has also repeatedly called to âdefundâ the FBI, DOJ, and federal officials who she believes are politically weaponizing the agencies. âThere has to be a punishment there,â Greene told Semafor during last monthâs Republican retreat. âAnd there needs to be defunding of departments and people that work in the FBI and Department of Justice that have abused their power for political persecution.â\n\nThis isnât the first time Democrats have capitalized on Republicansâ call to defund federal agencies. Bo Hines, a young, Trump-endorsed Republican candidate, narrowly lost to Rep. Wiley Nickel in North Carolinaâs 13th congressional district after House Majority PAC ran ads featuring Hines calling to defund the IRS and the FBI in an interview.\n\nWe saw this strategy work brilliantly for Republicans during the 2020 House and Senate races, when Republicans â latching onto what was the sentiment of a few House progressives, but mostly activists â famously accused even the most moderate Democrats of wanting to defund the police. Democrats retooled their messaging, but not without consternation from members in swing districts who felt they were still paying the price for progressivesâ rhetorical excesses.\n\nRepublicans risk the same fate, especially with figures like Trump and Greene giving âdefund the FBIâ calls a much higher profile in the 2024 cycle than in 2022.\n\nâThe refusal by extremist House Republicans to stand with law enforcement and their silence on Trumpâs abhorrent comments is damning,â a House Majority PAC spokesperson told Semafor. âHouse Majority PAC will ensure anti-law enforcement MAGA Republicans are held accountable and voted out in 2024.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Republicans tried to clear the 2024 field to stop Donald Trump. It may have backfired.\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nMitt Romney is very worried about a divided Republican field electing Donald Trump, just like he argues a similar one did in the 2016 primaries. So much so that heâs publicly asking donors to cut off support to any candidate whoâs not getting it done by the South Carolina primary next February.\n\nHe doesnât have much to worry about. The âdivided fieldâ concern âÂ a staple of election commentary since Trumpâs first nomination â is a classic case of generals fighting the last war.\n\nFor one, the situation has changed: Donald Trump has a huge lead right now and pulls over 50% support in national polls of Republicans, with even higher favorability numbers. Worrying about splitting the vote in February is like telling a basketball team thatâs 12 games under .500 at the All-Star break to think about their strategy for the NBA Finals.\n\nItâs not just that itâs premature, though: The obsession with the divided field that elected Trump in 2016 has arguably damaged Republicansâ chances of defeating him in 2024.\n\nThe reason why is that Republicans skeptical of a third Trump run already took Romneyâs lesson to heart years ago. Since the moment Biden took office, they began uniting behind Ron DeSantis to get around this very problem. The Murdoch media empire went about enthusiastically promoting his work in Florida and downplaying Trump for awhile, big donors threw record amounts of cash at his less-than-competitive re-election campaign, and numerous potential candidates decided against a run, with some even citing their fear of âyou guessed it â Â a divided field.\n\nGetting behind DeSantis early made sense, on paper.Â He had unique advantages that made him look compelling as a candidate who could appeal to both traditional and MAGA Republicans.\n\nThe good news for Republicans is that it briefly worked. DeSantis started the year as the near-undisputed heavyweight champion of the non-Trump field against a bunch of rivals polling near the margin of error. At one point, he was even threatening to overtake Trump.\n\nThe bad news is that DeSantis hasnât lived up to the billing . His campaign has not looked competent, his personal charisma has been less than compelling, and heâs still settling on a clear message that can rally supporters and put Trump on the defensive.\n\nBut the even worse news is that there are few, if any, obvious backups if DeSantis flames out . Tim Scott is next in line to audition as a consensus option with a traditional resume, but heâs also untested on the national stage and has scrupulously avoided major confrontations with Trump for years, who has in turn held his fire. Everyone else looks like a niche candidate until they can prove otherwise, especially when there will be strong incentives for donors and interest groups to return to Trump if his nomination starts to look inevitable.\n\nHad the non-Trump Republican party encouraged some more credible contenders to run, they might have been able to use this early period to see who could build some authentic grassroots momentum or find an angle against Trump that works. Instead, theyâre likely stuck with what theyâve got.\n\nIn this article:\n\nTo be fair, itâs not clear thereâs anyone outside the field who would be doing better â Glenn Youngkin is the most cited name, but thereâs no sign voters are clamoring for him to join the race. The fundamental problem is still that Trump is popular with a majority of Republicans, full stop. In fact, the âdivided fieldâ was an exaggerated problem in 2016 for the same reason âÂ Trump did well in some late head-to-head polls against individual opponents.\n\nBut campaigns are unpredictable. The mayor of South Bend, Indiana made a real run at the nomination in 2020 on the Democratic side, and the person whoâs arguably stood out the most so far in 2024 is a 37-year old anti-woke entrepreneur. If DeSantis canât turn his campaign around and the other options fail to break out, donât be surprised to see a future Wall Street Journal op-ed begging more candidates to run in 2028 âÂ and possibly against Trump again.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

A Jan. 6 defendant flashed his pardon. Donald Trump predicted \"generations\" of political dominance. One supporter wore a hat declaring him \"MAGA king.\"\n\nMAGA was in the mood to celebrate, bolder and more confident than ever before at the raucous Conservative Political Action Conference last weekend. The GOP's biggest stars - including Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Musk - whipped the crowd into a frenzy at a sprawling Maryland resort as they bragged of recent conservative victories and pledged more to come.\n\nIf Trump supporters had caught lightning in a bottle, across the Potomac traditional Republicans had all the brilliance of autumn fireflies trapped in a jar.\n\nThe muted, business-like atmosphere at the Principles First Summit - a gathering of anti-Trump Republicans, right-leaning independents and disgruntled Democrats - in downtown Washington D.C. matched the lack of political fire power. A cast of disempowered GOP leaders tried to reassure the crowd - and themselves - that maybe, just maybe, Trumpism wasn't here to stay.\n\nFailed Trump opponents such as former Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas said there still is an opportunity to put the GOP on a different course but also acknowledged they were swimming against a powerful tide.\n\nSet against the aggressive, destabilizing opening month of Trump's second turn at the presidency, the two conferences offered dramatically different visions: Radical change and a demolition of the existing order versus classic small \"c\" conservatism.\n\nNo one doubts who's winning.\n\n\"We're going to forge a new and lasting political majority,\" Trump told a jubilant CPAC crowd.\n\nTrump's words played into the deepest fears of traditional Republicans and their allies, who have failed over the last decade to wrest the party from him - and have few answers for how to win now.\n\nChristie, who twice ran against Trump and lost , predicted average Americans would eventually get fed up with the former reality TV star.\n\n\"This is not to say we shouldn't stand up and continue to do what we're doing,\" he said of his fellow outcastes. \"But everyone's going to get there at their own pace.\"\n\nTrump later crowed at CPAC that his opponents had \"lost their confidence.\"\n\nThe victory lap was the culmination of a remarkable four years that saw voters boot Trump from office, only to take him back in 2024, this time more determined to remake America in his image.\n\nTrump's reelection was a high-water mark for the rowdy rightwing politics and culture that CPAC has long nurtured, and he was treated like a conquering hero during his speech on Saturday.\n\nYet the Republican's aggressive first month in office has sparked a growing backlash and may give credence to his opponents' let-Trump-implode strategy.\n\nTrump has never lacked confidence, and his return to power after exile in the political wilderness - which he overcame despite being charged in four criminal cases , and a cinematic, near-miss assassination attempt - has only emboldened him.\n\n\"Our movement is thriving, fighting, winning and dominating like never before,\" Trump declared at CPAC.\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk has emerged as Trump's most powerful lieutenant, blitzing through federal agencies with the Department of Government Efficiency in a drastic cost cutting spree that speaks to the conservative base's long held desire to lay waste to the federal bureaucracy.\n\nMusk appeared on stage at CPAC with a chainsaw to symbolize his approach to slashing spending .\n\nSpeakers called Trump's reelection transformational.\n\n\"We have finally awakened from this woke nightmare, and it is a new day in America,\" said U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., who defeated staunch Trump critic Liz Cheney in a GOP primary.\n\nSteve Bannon, a former White House adviser and a leading MAGA figure, broadcast his War Room podcast live from CPAC, and spent more than an hour afterward signing autographs and posing for pictures. He came in second in the CPAC straw poll of favored presidential candidates for 2028, behind Vance.\n\nBannon said in an interview that Trump's movement at first seemed \"dead\" in the wake of the 2020 election.\n\nBut \"we got a rally point, we dusted ourselves off and look at it, four years later... we're sitting here with a president, and we're 30 days into days of thunder,\" Bannon said.\n\nTrump is moving at the pace of someone making up for lost time. And even his supporters weren't expecting him to go this big.\n\n\"We're happy that Trump won. We're ecstatic he's exceeding our expectations,\" said Ronald Wilcox of Virginia, who has attended multiple CPACs.\n\nAttendees voiced optimism, vindication and a sense the culture had shifted in their direction. Some described feeling alienated at times for their views - and freer now to express them.\n\nDeborah Yanna, a Trump delegate from Iowa, who was selling handmade sequined jackets with MAGA slogans for $400 to $600, likened the revival to awakening a \"sleeping giant.\"\n\n\"Obviously we're stirring up stuff,\" Yanna said. \"We're not going to put up with it anymore.\"\n\nTrump's victory has thrilled his supporters, including on the far-right fringe. A group of Trump backers who he pardoned after they were charged with storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, attended CPAC , shouting throughout Trump's speech. One had his Trump pardon in his wallet and pulled it out to show a reporter.\n\nDespite conservative elation, there already are signs that some of Trump's moves could backfire. His efforts to expand executive authority, concentrate power and neutralize any checks by co-equal branches of government have Democrats complaining about executive overreach.\n\nThe chaotic DOGE cuts , some of which were quickly walked back , have generated angry crowds at town hall meetings held by GOP lawmakers. Many of Trump's early actions are tied up in court.\n\nBannon drew attention at CPAC for promoting an unconstitutional third Trump term and for a hand gesture he gave after his CPAC speech that was likened to a Nazi salute . The leader of a far-right French political party canceled his CPAC appearance in protest of the gesture. Bannon dismissed the controversy as \"ridiculous,\" saying he was doing \"a wave I give my audience all the time.\"\n\nTrump supporters, he said, are prepared to dig in. \"I think it's grim determination that the fight is just starting.\"\n\nMeanwhile, at the Principles First conference, attendees searched for a 2028 candidate and a coalition that could - somehow - defeat MAGA.\n\nBillionaire Mark Cuban , a self-described independent who endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris, said he wouldn't be spending his personal wealth trying to counter Musk's political operation. He predicted Trump would overstep.\n\n\"People are starting to realize that chaos is not good for this country. There's no amount of money that overcomes that,\" Cuban said. \"The only person who can convince a Donald Trump supporter to not support Donald Trump is Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"He'll do it for us.\"\n\nTrump, for his part, told CPAC he won't let up. \"I have not yet begun to fight,\" he said.\n\nThat morning, the president had given Musk license to get even more aggressive. Federal employees then received a Saturday afternoon email telling them they had until Monday night to provide a summary of what they'd accomplished in the previous workweek or face termination .\n\nSome Principles First attendees had more hope for the Republican Party's future than others.\n\nHutchinson, who challenged Trump in the 2024 primary, said he wants Trump to succeed. \"But after that, we've got a debate for our future,\" he said.\n\nHutchinson said Trump is still in a \"honeymoon\" period and enjoys strong GOP support.\n\n\"But over time as he becomes more extreme in his support of dictators, or he diminishes the rule of law, then the contrary voices will arise to a greater extent,\" he added, predicting a Republican governor could emerge to lead the party in a different direction.\n\nOthers aren't so sure.\n\nJulie Lind traveled from Tempe, Arizona, with her husband, Kevin, in search of camaraderie.\n\nThe politicians Lind said she considers leaders these days have left the GOP. Now, she's also considering changing her party affiliation.\n\n\"The longtime principles of the Republican Party, I still believe in those,\" the former political consultant said. \"But because the party, the chosen leader, does not adhere to any of those, now I have to decide, am I a Republican, or am I just a conservative?\"\n\nVirginia resident Daniel Molloy said he believes non-MAGA Republicans can still reassert themselves.\n\n\"I think fundamentally, Trump is kind of his own thing,\" he said. \"In some ways, I don't think anyone that's currently in that MAGA-sphere is gonna be able to really hold it all together the way that he has.\"\n\n\"And I think that after Trump leaves - hopefully - you're going to see kind of another struggle for the GOP identity.\""

Flawed amendment must be rejected.\"\n\nJust as to a hammer, everything looks like a nail, so apparently to MAGA Republicans, everyone not in step with them is a \"left-wing radical.\"\n\nI guess when you're so far off center, out of the mainstream of American thinking,the center looks like a left wing. It must be the party line, since they all seem to parrot it ad nauseam.\n\nIs labeling and name-calling the best MAGA Republicans have to offer?\n\nSamantha Willow, Westerville\n\nHere is the other side of two front page articles from our fair and balanced Columbus Dispatch. Ex-president Donald Trump calls Vice President Kamala Harris names. Trump has been called a threat to democracy and Hitler. Hitler?\n\nThe reason U.S. Sen. JD Vance is discussing Harris' race and 'cat ladies\" is because that is all the mainstream media ask him about.\n\nWhat about the issues and the policies she and our lame duck president have supported for 31⁄2 years. What about the liberal policies Kamala has supported since she was a senator: an open border, getting rid of ICE, getting rid of fracking, Medicare for all, and eliminating private insurance.\n\nAt least Vance attempts to talk about the issues facing our country to the left-wing media. I'll say one thing for Kamala . . . she sure can smile and read a teleprompter .\n\nStan Fulk, Dublin\n\nRe \"What does attempted murder mean?\" Aug. 7: The reason I would charge people with attempted murder when it involves shooting at a person is to send a message, and because it is the right charge.\n\nIf people in Franklin County understood they will get charged with attempted murder if they shoot at someone, it may make a few think twice.\n\nThis policy will help deter future shootings as the public hears more about attempted murder, opposed to felonious assault. I also feel prior administrations avoided charging attempted murder to make it look nicer for the public.\n\nIf people were hearing the truth, they may take more action as evidenced by a few organizations in Franklin County combating gun violence. Organizations like We Are Linden recognize the danger; now we need a county prosecutor like myself who also recognizes the danger.\n\nI am not looking to make the public safer by false perception, but by prosecuting crimes that meet certain fact patterns.\n\nJohn Rutan, candidate Franklin County prosecutor, Columbus\n\nJim Renacci's August 8, opinion piece in The Columbus Dispatch regarding redistricting reform would be laughable if it were not so frightening and pathetic.\n\nOf course, Renacci, a failed career politician wannabe, who has twice been rejected by the voters and his own Republican party, cannot understand Maureen O'Connor could have the interests of the citizens of Ohio at heart during her long and distinguished public service career because he himself cannot conceive of such a thing.\n\nWhat is, to use his words, \"beyond belief,\" is the idea that the members of Citizens Not Politicians - who include educators; the League of Women Voters, who encourages voting and participation in the political process; and some Republicans who dare have the audacity at times not to march in lockstep with the party line and support candidates and issues of the Democratic party - would simply be fraudsters in supporting this citizen initiative.\n\nThe world has seen people like Renacci and his ilk who embrace one-party rule and unfair elections while stifling voter rights and citizen participation in their own government.\n\nIn the past, they have been relegated to the dustbin of history in the evolution of democracy. Let's hope it happens again in November.\n\nMahlon Nowland, Worthington\n\nI take exception to the August 8, Dispatch opinion column \"Harris was an unlikable, ineffective VP; why are we giving her a pass?\" by Ingrid Jacques.\n\nJacques' main point is a sulky complaint that in the three weeks since being thrust into the spotlight as the Democratic presidential contender, Harris hadn't taken time to hold a press conference. Maybe she's been too busy locking up the nomination within her party, selecting a vice-presidential candidate, putting together her campaign team, and developing her own agenda.\n\nRegarding the characterization of Kamala Harris as \"an ineffective flop of a vice president,\" I have a very different view.\n\nFor the first two years of the Biden presidency, with a Senate split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats, Harris was tethered to the Washington, D.C., area so she could cast the deciding votes on the administration's major initiatives.\n\nWith a Democratic Senate majority coming into play in January 2023, Harris was able to successfully take on additional assignments. Following the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, she became the administration's spokesperson on reproductive rights, and her command of the facts is impressive.\n\nCompared to an angry old man, who is seemingly sinking into dementia, the choice is clear.\n\nVote for Harris-Walz.\n\nTom Baillieul, Columbus\n\nU.S. Senator and Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance (if that's his real name) was interviewed by ABC's Jonathan Karl regarding his previous support for a \"policy proposal\" to give extra votes to people with children. Vance stated that this was not a policy proposal but rather a \"thought experiment.\"\n\nIn my day this so-called \"thought experiment\" would have been called a \"brain fart,\" a term that could also apply to the Project 2025 document that forms the basis of the MAGA Republican election platform.\n\nHarry Farkas , Columbus\n\nIn the August 4, editorial \"1-party rule by Democrats and GOP dominates all corners of Ohio, hurts our democracy,\" no solutions were proposed for Columbus. But reforms can be made to promote competitive elections in the city.\n\nOne way to help would be to ensure that all candidates can appear on television. Shortly before longtime Columbus City Attorney Rick Pfeiffer retired in 2018, he indicated to \"Columbus Monthly\" that TV exposure is hugely important for successful campaigns. Political consultant Dale Butland likewise told Channel 4 last year: \"Television is vital in any campaign . . . \"\n\nUnder Columbus' present system, candidates backed by big money flood the TV airwaves with political ads. Meanwhile their opponents can't afford to buy ads and have no chance of winning.\n\nSome possible ways to alleviate this problem would be to bring back public access TV so candidates can appear on TV for free; provide public funding for campaigns to enable candidates to buy TV time; broadcast candidate debates and forums on the government TV channel; and encourage the city's commercial TV stations to televise debates.\n\nOther helpful measures would be to lower the number of signatures needed to get on the ballot; and reduce the wealthy's influence over elections by lowering the amounts they can give to campaigns.\n\nAlso, adding district elections for city council, instead of having all council members elected citywide, would lower the cost of campaigns and enable more people to run.\n\nWhen six of the nine Columbus City Council races were uncontested last year, and the city's four school board races had no ballot opposition, I emailed council members and the mayor's office to ask how they intend to strengthen democracy in the city. No response was provided.\n\nAs columnist Tom Suddes wrote last year, \"competitive elections are the last thing an incumbent of either party wants.\" This means the media and public must lead in addressing the issue.\n\nJoseph Sommer, Columbus\n\nI did not think the August 12 article, \"States move to ban prison \"slavery,\" was an appropriate article to publish in the Dispatch.\n\nOhio is not one of those states.\n\nWe do not have a problem with prison labor not being compensated here in Ohio.\n\nOhio pays, as the article says, $2.80 per hour for jobs done by prisoners, which the article says is one of the highest rates in the country. The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections should get a pat on the back.\n\nPay for Ohio prisoners is not mentioned in the article until the eighth paragraph, when many readers by then have already stopped reading and say, here goes the state ripping off prisoners. I also dislike the word \"Slavery\" in italics. I think it was done for sensationalism.\n\nAlso, I think the article is written for non-paying states. The article is written by an author at Thomas Reuters Foundation, not a Columbus company who knows Ohio or Columbus.\n\nPlease check your articles written by outside sources that do not know our state or Columbus history.\n\nPete Kienle, Powell"

      "text": "Can Reagan Republicans work with MAGA on foreign policy? No, obviously. | Opinion\n\nAmong the flurry of news during President Donald Trump's first week back in the Oval Office, little attention was given to a rare but interesting interview with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nSpeaker Johnson has a lot of unique insights into the direction of the Republican Party, which isn't surprising given his position. Last week, he sat down for a frank hour-long discussion with journalist Bari Weiss , giving Americans a more down-to-earth view of the speaker outside his official capacity.\n\nHis attempts to reconcile his own stated Reaganism with Trumpism are valuable in the evolution of conservatism. However, Speaker Johnson is wrong about how compatible Trump's ideology is with Ronald Reagan's version of the GOP.\n\n\" What we're doing right now is a new fusion ,\" Johnson said, likening the current schism in the GOP to the fusionism of our past.\n\nFor those less wonky than I am, fusionism commonly refers to the alliance between the more traditional social conservatives and the libertarian wing of the American right. Though this is a massive oversimplification, this alliance became the bedrock of the Republican Party throughout the second half of the 20th century, melding libertarian economics with conservative social policy.\n\nThe shortcomings of Republicans toward the tail end of this timeframe gave way to the rise of Trump and allowed his vein of conservatism to rise to prominence. While the Republican Party has always wrestled with some level of populist tendencies, even harnessing it to win elections at times, it wasn't until the 2016 election that the populist wing of the GOP broke through and won a primary.\n\nIn essence, the GOP has entered uncharted waters with its new Trumped-up platform, and Reagan Republicans like Johnson are trying to reconcile that with their vision. It won't work.\n\nSpeaker Johnson is overly optimistic about how compatible the MAGA movement is with Reaganism. Trump's form of populism - though it shares some commonalities with the old guard of the party - has some tenets that cannot be squared away.\n\nTwo key topics in which the MAGA movement comes into tension with classic conservatism are foreign policy and the economy. Today, I'd like to focus on the former.\n\nThe status quo of the GOP was always a hawkish foreign policy, enabled by the tenet of \"peace through strength.\" Speaker Johnson endorses that tenet but, during the podcast, brushed off dissenters within the party as simply wanting to \"take care of our own house before we take care of the neighborhood .\"\n\nThe perceived failures of our wars in the Middle East have led MAGA Republicans down the road of interventionism and mistrust of those who wish to interject America into international conflicts. The result has been those who want to stop funding foreign conflicts, such as those in Ukraine and Israel.\n\nThe MAGA base has thrived off of apathy toward aiding Ukraine and Israel. On the other hand, more traditional foreign policy minds see the value of helping others to fight our enemies on our behalf. Spending money in the short term can avoid a more significant conflict in the long term, one that America may need to involve itself in more directly. Representatives like Thomas Massie of Kentucky, for example, are spearheading the movement to oppose nearly all U.S. funding of these countries.\n\nThe truth is that some within the GOP genuinely do not see the value in U.S. interventionism, even when our own house is in order.\n\nThese differences are a fundamental disparity in how we see the world and America's role, and I am skeptical that those positions can be reconciled. The GOP of old would support both Ukraine and Israel, as those willing to fight our enemies on our behalf are worthy of our support.\n\nHaving the \" most powerful house in the neighborhood ,\" as Johnson put it, is just one part of achieving international peace. The other half of that calculus is that our enemies must believe we will use our strength should they push us too far.\n\nIf a large enough portion of the GOP is against U.S. interventionism, the Chinese are unlikely to see any threat against them taking Taiwan, and the Russians are unlikely to see any further resistance to their actions in Europe.\n\nWhile Trump's strongman persona of threats against our enemies remains a valid effort, those threats only work so long as Russia and China believe our bluffs to an extent. Turmoil within the GOP caucus only opens opportunities for our enemies to take advantage of.\n\nThough this is a small minority, they have risen through the ranks in the form of JD Vance, Trump's second vice president .\n\nNow, this portion of the GOP has yet to make up a majority, and foreign aid remains an issue that Democrats are willing to cooperate to overcome dissenting Republicans. However, the more the GOP morphs into accepting anti-interventionalist voices, the more skeptical I become of Trump's ability to actually execute peace through strength.\n\nTrump has already put a freeze on foreign aid for 90 days (though with exceptions for both Israel and Egypt). His administration is awaiting the confirmation hearing of leading anti-interventionalist voice Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence. His actions thus far paint a grim picture for those who support a hawkish foreign policy.\n\nNone of these actions square with the GOP foreign policy of old and should worry those hopeful of its return.\n\nThe GOP must restore credibility to our role in the world. That means following Trump's blueprint for foreign policy during his firs t term. Adopting too much from the anti-interventionist crowd will strain the GOP caucus and undermine America's international strength.\n\nThose who hope to reconcile the differences between Trump and Reagan are trying to fit a round peg into a square hole. These ideologies are not directly compatible, and those who claim they are are either disingenuous or overly optimistic.\n\nDace Potas is an opinion columnist for USA TODAY and a graduate of DePaul University with a degree in political science."

      "text": "MAGA chronicler: 'Trump supporters aren't going away'\n\nYou could call him \"The MAGA Whisperer.\"\n\n\"They should start fathoming,\" he wrote, observing that Trump's outsider, anti-establishment approach and \"open contempt for all things politically correct\" were energizing people who had been disaffected by traditional politics.\n\nFor the past eight years, Gary Abernathy traced the rise of the Donald Trump base of supporters that became known as the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement. As editor-publisher of the Hillsboro Times-Gazette in the heart of Ohio's Trump Country in the southern part of the state, Abernathy, who earlier had spent years in Republican Party politics, wrote in January 2016 that many of his friends in professional GOP politics could not fathom a presidential ticket headed by Trump.\n\nHis newspaper became one of the first in the nation to endorse Trump for president. That led to a role for him with The Washington Post as a columnist offering a voice from Trump Country, helping bring a different perspective to The Post's readership.\n\nHe's put together his Trump-era columns into a new book: \"MAGA Republicans Are Already Normal ... And Other Shocking Notions.\" He defends MAGA partisans as \"honest, hard-working, patriotic citizens\" who get disparaged in the broader news media as cultish threats to democracy.\n\nWe got together recently at a Bob Evans Restaurant (that seemed like a calm location to talk about divisive politics) to discuss Trump's surprising comeback from the 2020 election loss Trump still disputes to emerge as the presumptive Republican nominee for a rematch with President Joe Biden.\n\n\"I always felt strongly that the MAGA movement was going to be dominant in the Republican Party for the foreseeable future, but I thought people would turn to someone else,\" Abernathy said. \"What's clear is that as long people still have 'Real Coke' they're not interested in a 'New Coke.'\"\n\nAbernathy, who's now working for a conservative marketing firm, personally broke with Trump over January 2021. He said that's not as much for the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, which he doesn't think Trump can be held legally liable for, as for Trump's boycott of Biden's inauguration and rejection of the U.S. tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"What a strong position, not just with his base but with people outside his base, this guy could be in if he had done the right thing. It would be a slam dunk for him,\" Abernathy said, saying Trump's actions often make him \"his own worst enemy\" and not the party's strongest candidate in November.\n\nIn a 2021 column, he expected to see \"Trumpism without Trump\" in the party, defining that as emphasis on individual freedoms, energy independence, border security, \"America First\" foreign policy, anti-\"wokeness,\" and \"unapologetic embrace of 'God and Country' values.\"\n\nHe thought Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was a potential 2024 heir and that former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley could also have been a good general election candidate.\n\nBut MAGA wasn't ready to quit Trump.\n\n\"On the other hand, there's no other candidate who the Republican base feels is not just another establishment candidate, and that's not what they want,\" Abernathy said. Even Trump's mounting legal problems seem to rally his fans to his defense, he noted.\n\nElitist-sounding dismissals of his MAGA supporters have only made them more determined.\n\n\"Trump supporters aren't going away, and those who continue to paint them as the lowest forms of life reveal themselves to be more interested in perpetrating stereotypes and nurturing divisions than in what's needed for our nation to survive - reaching across our political chasm, respecting our differences and finding common ground where we can,\" Abernathy wrote in late 2021 in one of the columns in his book, available on Amazon.com .\n\nAbernathy has written often about the need for what he called in a 2023 column \"rediscovering the lost art of tolerance.\" He urges an end to name-calling, accusations and stereotypes and acceptance by Americans of our disparity in a respectful, peaceful and fruitful way.\n\nHowever, I don't see that happening anytime soon as long as MAGA is led by someone who mocks the current president's stutter, refers to migrants as \"vermin,\" talks of being \"dictator for a day,\" and calls the humble practitioners of journalism \"criminals.\"\n\nMAGA people might already be normal, as Abernathy contends, but their leader isn't.\n\nRex Chapman was a University of Kentucky basketball great who went on to the NBA, was brought down by drug and gambling addiction, then bounced back to become a social media star and now, bestselling author.\n\nBut he's not been interested in political office.\n\n\"A buddy of mine from Kentucky who's a big political operative asks if I want to run against (Sen.) Rand Paul (R-Kentucky). The idea of making fun of Rand every day appeals to me, but I tell him no,\" Chapman recounted in \"It's Hard for Me to Live With Me.\"\n\n\"It's not because I am afraid of losing,\" Chapman wrote. \"I am afraid of winning. If that happens, I'll have to have a real job for the first time in my life. Sorry, no interest.\"\n\nChapman has held various front office and broadcasting positions since his playing career ended. Injuries led to painkiller addiction and that with gambling led to squandering millions of dollars and eventually his arrest for shoplifting. He turned his life around and became an entertaining mainstay on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, with 1.2 million followers, and also hosts a podcast.\n\nHe delivers political takes at times; he's not a fan of Donald Trump, Paul, or his home state's other U.S. Republican senator, Mitch McConnell. Chapman wrote that such politicians have done little about the opioid epidemic that has touched nearly everyone in Kentucky.\n\n\"The worst offender is Mitch McConnell, who has consistently fought any kind of positive change to the health care system while taking a whole bunch of money from Big Pharma.\"\n\nHowever, politics is only a small part of Chapman's memoir, co-written with CBS Sports analyst Seth Davis. It's an unvarnished, intensely revealing story of a life in basketball that was nearly ruined completely, followed by a long struggle for recovery and redemption.\n\nBy the time you read this, the November general election field will be set after Ohio's March 19 primary. There's a chance coming up now to take a break for fun, with the March 28 Opening Day parade and the Reds' 2024 season inaugural game.\n\nLet's hope they're still playing when the general election campaign reaches its final weeks. That should be something we can all get behind.\n\nDan Sewell is a regular Opinion contributor. Contact him at his personal email, dsewellrojos@gmail.com ."

Since 2020, Republicans have refused to certify election results at least 35 times .\n\nThe 2024 pre-election period has already seen dozens of lawsuits filed and 25 states trying to manipulate or change laws to, among other things, make it easier to challenge ballots, voter eligibility or deny election certifications. Ohio Attorney General David Yost submitted last minute changes to election laws to limit access to ballot drop boxes making it harder for the disabled to vote via absentee ballot.\n\nAmericans deserve better than extreme partisan and underhanded tactics designed to make it harder to vote or cast doubts on our election process.\n\nKamala Harris promises to protect and uphold the right to vote for all Americans. This November we can vote for Harris and Walz to preserve our democratic right to free, fair and secure elections.\n\nErin Salva, Mount Vernon\n\nThe RINO (Republican in name only) party's 2024 presidential candidate, former President Donald Trump, is counting on returning to the White House to kill four criminal cases that could land him in jail.\n\nHowever, his recent interview with Elon Musk on X suggests that he may play a further 'keep-out-of-jail' card should he fail to take the election. Specifically, the felon, sexual abuser and Putin's bro-wannabe whined to Musk that he'll go to Venezuela if he loses \"because it'll be a far safer place\" than the United States.\n\nBut Trump's Venezuela excuse must be met with considerable skepticism given his propensity for pleading the fifth and just flat out lying.\n\nFurthermore, Venezuela is under a travel advisory due to crime, wrongful detentions, terrorism, and poor health infrastructure. Thus, Trump's interest in Venezuela likely is much more about its lack of an extrdition treaty with the United States than about any fear of how unsafe the United States will become under the Harris administration.\n\nDespite his gaslighting in the interview, it looks like Trump is eyeing Venezuela for insurance against possible incarceration from criminal cases if he loses the election.\n\nRalph von Frese, Columbus\n\nHabitat for Humanity-MidOhio's homeowner application window runs through September 20, during which time we accept applications from people and families who want to help build their own house and assume an affordable mortgage.\n\nOn Sept. 9 alone, we handed out 274 applications at our offices for people to become homeowners in the 2026 fiscal year, July 1, 2025, through June 3, 2026. This does not include applications printed at home. To put it in context, we built 15 homes in fiscal year 2024.\n\nThere is great demand for affordable housing , but more specifically, there is great demand for affordable home ownership opportunities. While owning a home does not fit the needs of everyone, there are many benefits - making it an appropriate path for many families.\n\nAt Habitat for Humanity, we connect people to opportunity and hope through obtaining and maintaining affordable home ownership. As the newly appointed president and CEO, I aim to grow Habitat's impact and service. Through partnerships, innovative funding and new service models such as multifamily home ownership, we hope to be a leader in solving our affordable housing crisis.\n\nHabitat for Humanity-MidOhio is proud to be of service to our community and looks forward to serving many more families in the year to come.\n\nBrandi Braun AL-Issa, President & CEO  Habitat for Humanity-MidOhio, Columbus\n\nAccording to Donald Trump , the only way he will lose the upcoming presidential election is with the cooperation of corrupt election officials. You know - the election official neighbors who man the polls so that you are free to vote. The ones who have faced multiple threats and harassment since the 2020 election.\n\nJust last week, Trump was addressing the Fraternal Order of Police urged them to patrol polling places because it would intimidate would-be cheaters. He said, \"I hope you watch for voter fraud. Watch for the voter fraud because we win without voter fraud . . . You can keep it down just by watching, because believe it not, they're afraid of that badge. They're afraid of you people.\"\n\nSusan B. West, Athens\n\nDo MAGA supporters even listen to what they are saying?\n\nLast week a supporter of former President Donald Trump complained about syndicated columnist Rex Huppke.\n\nHe criticized Huppke's column calling Ohio Senator J.D. Vance the worst vice presidential candidate ever.\n\nThe writer complained that it was \"shameful to print an opinion that is full of anger, hatred, personal attacks, name calling and falsehoods.\"\n\nDoes the writer fail to see the irony in a Trump supporter voicing that complaint?\n\nKirtley Alan Green, Westerville\n\nDriving a fancy car while Black is not a crime, but try telling that to Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill, who was stopped for a traffic violation while he was driving to his game Sept. 8.\n\nInstead of the police just giving him a traffic ticket the police handcuffed him and \"redirected his body\" to be face down on the sidewalk.\n\nThe police said he was not under arrest.\n\nMr. Hill is black. I am white, and I wonder if I would have been treated in the same egregious fashion.\n\nI believe in the police and support them, but just because you wear blue doesn't mean you can act in any manner you want.\n\nMichael Oser, Columbus\n\nI am sick to the point of nausea when I read the United States struggles with inflation.\n\nInflation is 2.9% and the lowest in the world.\n\nHeadline should read \"U.S, struggling from price gouging from corporate greed.\"\n\nNo Republican administration will ever get that under control.\n\nMike Dechicco, Ostrander"

      "text": "The difference between MAGA and traditional Republicans is like night and day\n\nManage your account\n\nThe \"Make America Great Again,\" commonly referred to as MAGA, movement consists of those who are supporters of former President Donald Trump. That means MAGA is wildly divergent from what is considered conservatism.\n\nBeing conservative does not make you MAGA. And being MAGA is anything but conservative. In fact MAGA supporters are fond of calling RINO on those Republicans who are not MAGA. RINO means Republican in Name Only. The truth is that MAGA adherents are neither conservative nor traditional Republican, and if anyone is a RINO, it is MAGA fans. The term \"MAGA Republican\" is reserved for those who are members of the Trump cult.\n\nWhile it's fair to note that both MAGA supporters and traditional conservatives fall under the broader umbrella of right-leaning politics, they are as different as chocolate and vanilla. Each has its own points of emphasis and priorities.\n\nMAGA beliefs are similar to traditional conservatism in only a handful of areas. These include prioritizing a strong military and national defense, favoring limited government intervention in the economy, and a focus on strong law enforcement.\n\nIt's the differences that make the difference.\n\nMAGA is a populist movement. It's focused on direct appeals to \"the people\" and is skeptical of institutions seen as elitist or out of touch. Traditional conservatism, by contrast, tends to be more institutional, placing faith in established systems and norms.\n\nTraditional conservatives have often been proponents of free trade, viewing free trade as beneficial for economic growth and international relations. MAGA Republicans are skeptical of free trade agreements, advocating for protectionist policies designed to favor American industries in the short term.\n\nWhile both traditional conservatives and MAGA Republicans may favor stronger immigration controls, the MAGA movement places a much higher emphasis on this issue, advocating for more aggressive measures like building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico and magically having a foreign country, Mexico, pay for it.\n\nTraditional conservatives have supported a robust internationalist foreign policy, including the promotion of democracy abroad. MAGA Republicans are generally more isolationist, skeptical of international organizations like the United Nations, and less interested in promoting American values overseas.\n\nTraditional conservatives often prioritize social issues like abortion, religious freedom, and traditional family values. While these issues are also important to some MAGA Republicans, the movement as a whole tends to be more focused on economic and populist grievances.\n\nThe MAGA movement is known for its confrontational and inflammatory rhetoric, amplified through social media. Traditional conservatives may share some of the same views but often express them in a more measured and institutional tone.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of MAGA thinking is strong personal allegiance to Donald Trump. In contrast, traditional conservatives may support some of Trump's policies but without the same level of personal loyalty, or they may be critical of Trump altogether and support other candidates that have nothing to do with Donald Trump.\n\nWhile conservatives may be critical of media bias, MAGA supporters go further, embracing alternative information ecosystems and espousing deep mistrust of mainstream media outlets. To MAGA supporters, it matters less the truth of what is being presented as news and more that what is presented agrees with the position (whether based on lies or not) of Donald Trump.\n\nTraditional conservatives prioritize deficit reduction and fiscal responsibility, while MAGA Republicans have shown a willingness to accept higher levels of government spending and debt, especially if it serves their policy goals.\n\nWhile there are some ideological overlaps between traditional conservatives and MAGA supporters, they are distinct groups with unique priorities and styles. MAGA supporters diverge from traditional conservatism in their emphasis on populist and protectionist policies, as well as in their communication style, dependence on Trump as their cult leader, as well as their areas of focus.\n\nAll of this is the cause of a series of weaknesses within the MAGA movement.\n\nThe MAGA movement is not inclusive and does not accept those who may disagree on one or more issues. This causes polarization and divisiveness. The resulting combative rhetoric employed by MAGA leaders can exacerbate existing social, racial and political tensions.\n\nThe MAGA movement is tied to the personality and leadership of Trump. While this has been a strength in terms of mobilizing a passionate base, it is also a weakness because the movement's success or failure becomes tied to one individual's actions, reputation and legal standing.\n\nWhile the MAGA agenda is clear on some issues like immigration and trade, it often lacks a comprehensive and cohesive policy platform. This can make it difficult to sustain long-term goals and can lead to inconsistencies that are easy for opponents to criticize.\n\nThe movement's populist nature can lead to an oversimplification of complex issues. While this might be effective for rallying supporters, it often lacks the nuance needed to address multifaceted challenges in governance, economics and international relations.\n\nMAGA is dangerous and a threat to our democracy. The MAGA movement has shown a willingness to challenge or ignore established democratic norms and institutions, from attacking the media as \"the enemy of the people\" to promoting falsehoods about election integrity. This has led to concerns about the weakening of democratic principles.\n\nWhile the idea of putting \"America First\" resonates with some people, protectionist policies ultimately harm the economy, lead to trade wars, increase consumer prices, and strain relations with allies. This \"America First\" foreign policy has led to withdrawal from international agreements and institutions, which abdicates America's role on the global stage and creates a vacuum often filled by dangerous actors who are sworn enemies of our country.\n\nMAGA supported tax cuts without equivalent spending reductions, coupled with isolationist foreign policies, have certainly provided short-term political gains but at the expense of long-term stability and prosperity.\n\nThe emphasis on this narrow vision of American identity undermines the pluralistic and inclusive ideals on which the United States was founded.\n\nThe MAGA movement under the control of Donald Trump has spread misinformation about climate change, COVID-19, election integrity and more. This propensity for ignoring or distorting facts undermines public trust and leads to poor policy outcomes.\n\nMAGA supporters may disagree with these facts, in favor of the words of Donald Trump. But the truth is the truth and those who know the truth need to take a stand against misinformation, bullying, disruptive harmful policies and poor decision making.\n\nMore from Gindlesperger: Israeli business associate's email gives insight into anguish felt in Hamas conflict\n\nBill Gindlesperger is a central Pennsylvanian, Dickinson College graduate, Pennsylvania System Of Higher Education (PASSHE) Governor, Shippensburg University Trustee, and Chairman of eLynxx Solutions. eLynxx provides cloud-software for sourcing and managing print marketing and direct mail.

      "text": "Miss Kamala Yet? Black America Has Much to Say About MAGA Republicans Scary Leak of War Texts\n\nManage your account\n\nEveryone was worried about Pete Hegseth , a former Fox News contributor with a well documented love for the sauce, heading up the Department of Defense. Well...homie just confirmed exactly why we were all terrified by making one of the biggest public blunders we've seen in national security.\n\nOn March 15, the United States planned to bomb the Houthis in Yemen. This was a covert operation, meaning that the people planning this attacked wanted to surprise their targets. Well, they surprised the Houthis, but they embarrassed America along the way: A group chat about the attack was created for American senior security officials on Signal, a decentralized, encrypted messaging app. Somehow Mike Waltz, the National Security Advisor of the United States, invited Jeffery Goldberg, an editor at the Atlantic, to join in a discussion that included Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard, the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nNormally these kinds of communications are taken seriously and not haphazardly done on an app frequented by journalists and sex workers . That they used Signal to execute their plans appears obvious that they didn't want anyone else within the government knowing what they did, and it makes one wonder what else they have going on on the app. But that's a conversation for another column.\n\nThis would be funny if it wasn't so sad. You may not remember, but Republicans suggested that Obama purposefully leaked classified information in 2012. They were outraged over the possible security breach. Then, when Hillary Clinton was running for President in 2016, there was all this uproar with Republicans about how she used a private server for her emails. The issue was concern over national security. Then there were concerns over how Kamala Harris would pose a security risk if she was elected president.\n\nSo, to recap: There was outrage about a possible security breach during Obama's administration, uproar about Hillary's use of a private server for her emails, citing security concerns and worry concerning Harris' national security bona fides.\n\nBut here we have a legitimate, actual, real deal security breach from Trump's second administration, and what do we hear? Crickets.\n\nLet's call it like we see it: Republicans are hypocrites. Full stop.\n\nSure, there is a bit of hypocrisy in every corner of the American political system, but what we are seeing from the GOP is over the top. For years they have claimed to care deeply about American democracy (that was the whole issue with Trump saying he won in 2020), but then they do an about face on the topic when it suits them.\n\nThen they claim to care about the economy (that was why he won this time) and then have nothing to say when Trump fires thousands of Americans and starts a trade war that will, unquestionably, lead to higher prices. And now the party that claims to care the most about national security has nothing to say about an administration that has put our national security at risk.\n\nAnd why do they do this? Why are they silent when they would be crying wolf if a Democrat was in the White House? Because the guy they voted for sits behind the Resolute Desk.\n\nI'm not wasting any more ink on this. The Republicans are a joke. I bet they put sugar in their grits.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook , Twitter and Instagram ."

      "text": "\"It's a slap in the face\": MAGA Republicans \"highly offended\" that Biden gave Liz Cheney award\n\nManage your account\n\nPresident Joe Biden 's decision Thursday to award former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., with the second-highest honor a president can bestow has angered pro-Trump Republicans, who have long accused the conservative lawmaker and frequent critic of President-elect Donald Trump as a traitor to the party.\n\nIn granting the Presidential Citizens Medal to Cheney and Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., Biden acknowledged their role in leading the House investigation into Trump's involvement in the Jan. 6 insurrection. The committee disbanded after unanimously voting in December 2022 to refer Trump for prosecution.\n\nTrump and his allies have said that they and other members of the panel should be jailed for their efforts, with Cheney earning particular condemnation from that corner of the political world due largely to her prominence in the GOP. Then-House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., booted her from the party leadership in 2021, and in 2022 she lost her seat against a primary challenger.\n\nCheney's latest return to the spotlight provoked a fresh round of outrage, with her home-state colleague and No. 2 Senate Republican John Barrasso, R-Wyo., declaring in a statement that Biden \"was either going to pardon Liz Cheney or give her an award. She doesn't deserve either. She represents partisanship and divisiveness - not Wyoming.\"\n\nFox News joined in the broadside Thursday night. Frequent network contributor and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told guests on a segment of Hannity he was hosting that he was \"offended\" by Cheney's receipt of the award.\n\n\"I don't know how you feel, but I was offended that President Biden gave the second-highest medal of honor- it's not called the Medal of Honor, but a medal honoring these two congressmen... Liz Cheney and Bennie Thompson. What's your reaction to that?\" he asked one of his guests, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Florida.\n\n\"My reaction is I'm highly offended, but I'm not surprised,\" Donalds responded. \"Joe Biden and his White House have lived in the bizarro land where no Americans really exist. That's why the presidency under Joe Biden has been an abject disaster. This is just one of the last pieces of icing on that cake.\"\n\nDonalds added that the \"fake\" Jan. 6 committee's only purpose was to \"put a lot of propaganda out into the information stream to go after and attack Donald Trump.\"\n\nDonalds' fellow panelist, House Oversight Committee chair James Comer, R-Ky., quickly concurred. \"It's a slap in the face to all the good Americans who actually deserve to be recognized for their public service or for their sacrifice or for their community activism,\" he said, before criticizing Biden for supposedly snubbing first responders, soldiers and humanitarians.\n\nIn addition to Cheney and Thompson, 18 other honorees were recognized at the Thursday ceremony, including a military doctor who improved battlefield trauma care and a civil rights leader who fought for desegregation."

      "text": "'Days of Thunder': MAGA roars as Trump GOP critics fret in the wilderness\n\nManage your account\n\nOXON HILL, Md. - It was MAGA ecstasy.\n\nElon Musk waved a chainsaw on stage. A Jan. 6 defendant flashed his pardon. Donald Trump predicted \"generations\" of political dominance. One supporter wore a hat declaring him \"MAGA king.\"\n\nMAGA was in the mood to celebrate, bolder and more confident than ever before at the raucous Conservative Political Action Conference last weekend. The GOP's biggest stars - including Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Musk - whipped the crowd into a frenzy at a sprawling Maryland resort as they bragged of recent conservative victories and pledged more to come.\n\nIf Trump supporters had caught lightning in a bottle, across the Potomac traditional Republicans had all the brilliance of autumn fireflies trapped in a jar.\n\nMore: Federal judge blocks Trump's refugee suspension\n\nThe muted, business-like atmosphere at the Principles First Summit - a gathering of anti-Trump Republicans, right-leaning independents and disgruntled Democrats - in downtown Washington D.C. matched the lack of political fire power. A cast of disempowered GOP leaders tried to reassure the crowd - and themselves - that maybe, just maybe, Trumpism wasn't here to stay.\n\nFailed Trump opponents such as former Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas said there still is an opportunity to put the GOP on a different course but also acknowledged they were swimming against a powerful tide.\n\nSet against the aggressive, destabilizing opening month of Trump's second turn at the presidency, the two conferences offered dramatically different visions: Radical change and a demolition of the existing order versus classic small \"c\" conservatism.\n\nMore: Elon Musk will attend Trump's first Cabinet meeting, White House says\n\nNo one doubts who's winning.\n\n\"We're going to forge a new and lasting political majority,\" Trump told a jubilant CPAC crowd.\n\nTrump's words played into the deepest fears of traditional Republicans and their allies, who have failed over the last decade to wrest the party from him - and have few answers for how to win now.\n\nChristie, who twice ran against Trump and lost , predicted average Americans would eventually get fed up with the former reality TV star.\n\n\"This is not to say we shouldn't stand up and continue to do what we're doing,\" he said of his fellow outcastes. \"But everyone's going to get there at their own pace.\"\n\nTrump later crowed at CPAC that his opponents had \"lost their confidence.\"\n\nThe victory lap was the culmination of a remarkable four years that saw voters boot Trump from office, only to take him back in 2024, this time more determined to remake America in his image.\n\nTrump's reelection was a high-water mark for the rowdy rightwing politics and culture that CPAC has long nurtured, and he was treated like a conquering hero during his speech on Saturday.\n\nYet the Republican's aggressive first month in office has sparked a growing backlash and may give credence to his opponents' let-Trump-implode strategy.\n\nTrump has never lacked confidence, and his return to power after exile in the political wilderness - which he overcame despite being charged in four criminal cases , and a cinematic, near-miss assassination attempt - has only emboldened him.\n\n\"Our movement is thriving, fighting, winning and dominating like never before,\" Trump declared at CPAC.\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk has emerged as Trump's most powerful lieutenant, blitzing through federal agencies with the Department of Government Efficiency in a drastic cost cutting spree that speaks to the conservative base's long held desire to lay waste to the federal bureaucracy.\n\nMusk appeared on stage at CPAC with a chainsaw to symbolize his approach to slashing spending .\n\nSpeakers called Trump's reelection transformational.\n\n\"We have finally awakened from this woke nightmare, and it is a new day in America,\" said U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., who defeated staunch Trump critic Liz Cheney in a GOP primary.\n\nSteve Bannon, a former White House adviser and a leading MAGA figure, broadcast his War Room podcast live from CPAC, and spent more than an hour afterward signing autographs and posing for pictures. He came in second in the CPAC straw poll of favored presidential candidates for 2028, behind Vance.\n\nBannon said in an interview that Trump's movement at first seemed \"dead\" in the wake of the 2020 election.\n\nBut \"we got a rally point, we dusted ourselves off and look at it, four years later... we're sitting here with a president, and we're 30 days into days of thunder,\" Bannon said.\n\nTrump is moving at the pace of someone making up for lost time. And even his supporters weren't expecting him to go this big.\n\n\"We're happy that Trump won. We're ecstatic he's exceeding our expectations,\" said Ronald Wilcox of Virginia, who has attended multiple CPACs.\n\nAttendees voiced optimism, vindication and a sense the culture had shifted in their direction. Some described feeling alienated at times for their views - and freer now to express them.\n\nDeborah Yanna, a Trump delegate from Iowa, who was selling handmade sequined jackets with MAGA slogans for $400 to $600, likened the revival to awakening a \"sleeping giant.\"\n\n\"Obviously we're stirring up stuff,\" Yanna said. \"We're not going to put up with it anymore.\"\n\nTrump's victory has thrilled his supporters, including on the far-right fringe. A group of Trump backers who he pardoned after they were charged with storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, attended CPAC , shouting throughout Trump's speech. One had his Trump pardon in his wallet and pulled it out to show a reporter.\n\nDespite conservative elation, there already are signs that some of Trump's moves could backfire. His efforts to expand executive authority, concentrate power and neutralize any checks by co-equal branches of government have Democrats complaining about executive overreach.\n\nThe chaotic DOGE cuts , some of which were quickly walked back , have generated angry crowds at town hall meetings held by GOP lawmakers. Many of Trump's early actions are tied up in court.\n\nBannon drew attention at CPAC for promoting an unconstitutional third Trump term and for a hand gesture he gave after his CPAC speech that was likened to a Nazi salute . The leader of a far-right French political party canceled his CPAC appearance in protest of the gesture. Bannon dismissed the controversy as \"ridiculous,\" saying he was doing \"a wave I give my audience all the time.\"\n\nTrump supporters, he said, are prepared to dig in. \"I think it's grim determination that the fight is just starting.\"\n\nMeanwhile, at the Principles First conference, attendees searched for a 2028 candidate and a coalition that could - somehow - defeat MAGA.\n\nBillionaire Mark Cuban , a self-described independent who endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris, said he wouldn't be spending his personal wealth trying to counter Musk's political operation.

      "text": "The end of MAGA's dominance: \"The American people see the Democrats take down Trump themselves\"\n\nManage your account\n\nPresident Trump is a juggernaut. His shock and awe campaign against American democracy, the rule of law, civil society, the Constitution, and the norms and institutions has been extremely successful. Trump's mastery of spectacle and mass media and his natural showmanship and charisma - in combination with the dark arts of politics and power that he learned from his mentor Roy Cohn - make him a formidable foe. The difficulty in trying to stop Trump and his MAGA movement is amplified by how the world is in the throes of an authoritarian populist era that is fueled by rage at \"the system\" and \"the elites\" and the existing order of things. In total, Trump and his MAGA movement are the product of much larger problems and disruptions both here in the United States and abroad that defy a simple solution.\n\nWhat about the Democrats and the larger so-called resistance? They have been mostly ineffective - to the degree they have even been active and present. Since Trump has returned to power, the Democrats, for example, have decided that waiting for Trump and his MAGA Republicans to overextend themselves and for the American people to realize that they are victims of the Big (and little) Con is a viable strategy. Applying military strategy to the realm of \"normal\" politics, Trump is continuing his shock and awe campaign, and the Democrats are trading space for time.\n\nFocusing in on Trump's speech to Congress last week , the Washington Post describes the efficacy and result of this plan by the Democrats as:\n\nThe Democrats showed last week that presidential addresses to Congress are no place to formulate a resistance. Almost everything they did during President Donald Trump's appearance highlighted weakness rather than strength. They had not one strategy but several. The sum was less than the parts.\n\nMany Democrats came away worried that their party is even weaker than it appeared after Trump's victory in November, and for now, Democrats might be left to hope that Trump and the Republicans will make enough mistakes to offer them a way back. But that is only one part of a comeback strategy if Democrats are to become broadly competitive.\n\nThe Democrats were handcuffed from the start Tuesday night as they sought to project the right amount of opposition. Too boisterous and unruly in their disagreements and they would embarrass themselves, playing into Trump's hands and highlighting their powerlessness. Too passive and they would further anger their demoralized base that is looking for a spark of life from the leadership of the party. They were passive, yes, while trying to project mild resistance.\n\nWinning by default and counting on one's enemy to self-sabotage is not a viable strategy in an existential struggle. Such a strategy is also not very compelling for a public that is increasingly alienated, tired, afraid and mired in learned helplessness, as they see Trump and his MAGA movement and American fascism's domination as inevitable and soon to be the new norm instead of as forces and outcomes that are contingent and still very much in doubt.\n\nIn an attempt to make better sense of the Democratic Party's weak and passive approach to political battle in the Age of Trump and their ongoing failures of strategy and messaging - and potential ways to correct them and find victory - I recently spoke with M. Steven Fish , a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley. His new book is \" Comeback: Routing Trumpism, Reclaiming the Nation, and Restoring Democracy's Edge .\"\n\nThis is the first part of a two-part conversation.\n\nHow are you feeling? Trump has been back in the White House for eight weeks. His shock and awe campaign has been very effective. What are you doing to balance yourself and maintain some perspective - assuming you have been able to?\n\nHis shock-and-awe campaign has been theatrical, but I'm neither shocked nor awed. Trump isn't doing anything he didn't promise to do, and his opening round has been more of a shit-show of bluster and flip-flops than an irresistible offensive. The key to remaining balanced is to focus on the fight and to give as good as we get. Trump's high-dominance style has carried him this far, but he also has many weaknesses - if Democrats finally start to push their advantage.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter , Crash Course.\n\nIf Trump really follows through on everything he's initiated since January 20, the economy will tank, veterans will quit receiving their benefits on time, American kids will be crippled by polio and dropping dead from measles, and America will become a contemptible international pariah and wholly-owned Kremlin subsidiary. And if Trump backs down, he'll look weak. Either way, I'm sure you'll agree the Democrats will have a lot to work with. But no matter how bad things get, none of it will stick to Trump unless the Democrats make it stick. Otherwise, Trump will continue to smash through every disaster and maintain his hold on the political arena.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on James Carville telling the Democrats to \"roll over and play dead\" in his recent op-ed in the New York Times ? Carville said the Democrats should \"roll over and play dead\" and \"allow the Republicans to crumble beneath their own weight and make the American people miss us.\" That does not seem like a winning strategy in an existential struggle for America's democracy.\n\nCarville is typically a fighter, and I know he isn't proposing passivity as a long-term strategy. But, his New York Times piece does basically call for the same losing tactics the Democrats have been pursuing for years: Stand back, cede the narrative and headlines to Trump, and then wait for everybody to realize just how awful he is and rush to support the Democrats. That's largely the way Biden ran his reelection campaign until he stepped aside; in fact, he explicitly said that he intended to make the election a referendum on Trump. Here we had a president who had been in power for almost four years and had racked up impressive accomplishments, including producing a roaring economy, but rather than make it about the Democrats' triumphs, he chose to make it about Trump. That approach displayed timidity, pessimism, defeatism, and lack of self-confidence, which is why Trump was clobbering Biden in the polls even prior to voters realizing the extent of Biden's weakness during his debate with Trump. Then, when Harris first stepped out as the party's nominee-presumptive after Biden's withdrawal, she offered a much higher-dominance act, but she then reverted to a low-dominance, let's-make-it-about-Trump approach.\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, you and I had a series of conversations here at Salon and elsewhere. You also had an opinion essay in the New York Times warning that Trump is a high-dominance leader and that he had a high chance of winning if the Democrats did not adjust. They didn't listen to you - or me or the others who were publicly warning about Trump's popularity. Harris launched her campaign with a high-dominance performance but then faltered soon after her great debate with Trump. History will likely look back at that pivot as one that crystallized the Democratic Party's failings and imminent defeat.\n\nAbsolutely. As you'll recall, between the time Harris took over as the Democrats' candidate in mid-July and the debate on September 10, she was a boss. She called attention to herself and her own great plans, projected exuberance, and limited her Trump-time to telling the truth about how horrible he is and not fit to be president. Armed with that approach, she electrified Democrats, put Trump on the defensive, and took the lead in the polls. But then her campaign reverted to ceding the spotlight to Trump, making the campaign a referendum on him and calling on everyone to be horrified by his appalling behavior.\n\nThe moment her campaign switched gears, which happened shortly after Harris shellacked Trump in the debate, you could hear the air hissing out of the tires and watch Trump get his momentum back. And as it turned out, all the groups the Democrats strove to stir to wounded umbrage weren't much moved, and they weren't impressed by the Democrats' constantly being overcome by the vapors. The partisan gender gap between 2020 and 2024 actually shrunk, with Harris proportionally losing more women than men compared to Biden's performance in 2020. And Trump made enormous strides with Hispanics and smaller but still substantial gains among Blacks and Asian Americans.\n\nHow much more evidence do the Democrats need that letting Trump be Trump and then hoping to pick up the pieces when he falters doesn't work? Trump acts, and the Democrats stand back and wait for him to stumble. But Trump's bungling has never been enough to bring voters over to us in sufficient numbers to stop him and rout Trumpism. Until the American people see the Democrats take down Trump themselves, he's going to seem like a boss.\n\nTrump and his MAGA movement are winning, and quite easily. They know that storytelling and showmanship are the keys to winning and advancing their agenda. Why are Trump and his propagandists so good at this? Why are the Democrats so bad at it?\n\nDemocratic operatives still seem to think that Jack and Diane Sixpack sit down to the kitchen table shortly before the election and calculate which candidate stands closer to them on \"the issues,\" offers them more stuff, and \"cares about people like them.\" But there's no evidence that anything of the sort actually takes place, and you can't make a compelling story out of \"the issues,\" promises to add a dental option to Obamacare and patronizing reflections on how much people are hurting. It's especially ludicrous to focus on voters' purported despair rather than your own great exploits and plans while your own party is in power, which was the case in 2016 and 2024.\n\nWhile Biden was still running, he did finally try to step out late in the campaign and claim credit for the roaring economy, but he was far too impaired by then to offer a forceful, resonant message. Beyond that, he was shut down by fretful Democratic party operatives and politicians who told him: How can you talk about \"Bidenomics\" when polls say so many people aren't \"feeling the benefits\"?!\n\nWhen Harris first stepped out as the nominee, she was all jauntiness and quick wit, but she then sank back into the party's old habits. When asked whether people were better off than they were four years ago, Harris refused to answer. Why? Because polling showed that many people weren't happy with the economy. When asked about immigration, she consistently intoned: \"Our immigration system is broken.\" No doubt that line played well in the Democrats' focus groups. Never mind that her party had been in power for almost four years; the people were supposedly struggling to make ends meet and the immigration system was broken. Under her and Biden. And when asked how her policies would differ from Biden's, she said she couldn't think of anything. Why? We can't be sure, but by some accounts, she was afraid of offending Biden. This is what poll-driven, fear-based, irrationally risk-averse messaging looks like. It thrills no one. It changes no minds. It leaves your opponent's story as the one everybody hears.\n\nDonald Trump's story is basically: When I'm in power, you will enjoy the greatest economy in the history of the world. When the Democrats are in power the economy is horrible. Trump and his propagandists and other surrogates and messengers fill in his story with all kinds of facts and figures, many of which are not true, just pulled out of the ether. But Donald Trump does have a story, and it does convince a lot of people. Trump tries to shape public opinion rather than just respond to it. What would a more compelling message from Harris have sounded like?\n\nKamala Harris could have said something like this: You're goddamn right we're better off than four years ago! Back then, unemployment was 15 percent; under me and Biden, it's lower than it's been since the 1960s. COVID pushed inflation up, but Biden and I hammered inflation down to 2 percent - exactly where the Fed says it should be. Our economy is leaving other rich countries in the dust; it's growing faster than all of them. America is the innovation capital of the world. Real wages have been growing for a year-and-a-half running. New business start-ups and corporate profits are surging. Every time I check the numbers, the Dow is setting records. When Trump left office, the Dow was 31,000; today it's 42,000. Dream on, Mr. Trump! Fast growth, plunging inflation, rock-bottom unemployment - economists said it couldn't be done. Oh, and by the way, the budget deficit is half of what Trump left us with four years ago.\n\nThis is what Democrats do: We come in and clean up the messes made by our Republican predecessors. Roosevelt did it after Herbert Hoover. Clinton did it after the first Bush, Obama did it after the second one, and Biden did it after Trump.\n\nBut you ain't seen nothin' yet. Under me, we're going to make Biden's good economy even better. Way better. No more kids in poverty in the richest, greatest country on Earth. Watch for the Dow to break 50,000. Why the hell not?\n\nToday's Democrats do not have a brand or compelling identity, and they are horrible political salespeople. Trump's recent address to Congress is an example of Trump as the master of spectacle. For his audience it was perfect. Those outside of TrumpWorld and the MAGAverse thought his speech was a failure.\n\nNothing surprising there. Trump's speech was grand theater. Vintage Trump, complete with all the props: The ranting about the Democrats' supposed perfidies, the proclamation of a new Golden Age and the adoring families of the victims of violence perpetrated by undocumented migrants.\n\nThe Democrats' responses, unfortunately, were also largely predictable, and altogether pathetic: Rep. Al Green getting thrown out for standing and waving his cane at Trump; the pink dresses (I still don't get what that was supposed to mean); and the indignant flashing of the ping-pong paddles with their various messages. Then there was the flurry of Democratic responses on talk shows over the following several days. On Stephen Colbert's show, Pete Buttigieg tore into Trump for not dwelling on people's economic pain and for failing to lower egg prices.\n\nBut most abject of all was the Democrats' formal response to Trump's speech, delivered by the new senator from Michigan, Elissa Slotkin. American democracy is being dismantled by fascists and Trump is trashing a world order that has ensured American preeminence and prosperity for the past 80 years. Putin is very pleased. What did Slotkin have to say? \"The Middle Class is the engine of our country...Michigan literally invented the Middle Class!... We need to bring down the price of things we spend the most money on: Groceries. Housing. Healthcare. Your car.\" Of course, she hit on other points as well, but never did she offer anything other than the bromides the Democrats have been mouthing for as long as anybody can remember. Nowhere was there the slightest sense of urgency, alarm, anger, or fight. I'm sure Slotkin is a wonderful person, but it's also noteworthy that she won her Senate race by 0.3 percent in a state where Gov. Gretchen Whitmer whipped her MAGA opponent by 11 points. Rather than turn to the harder-edged Whitmer - or, for that matter, Rep. Jasmine Crockett, Rep. Eric Swalwell, Senator Ruben Gallego, Senator Adam Schiff, or Gov. Josh Shapiro - to let loose on Trump, the Democrats chose Slotkin to make her heartfelt pitch for - what else? - the put-upon middle class."

That's why we have them,\" he told The New York Post. \"I have many H1B visas on my properties. I've been a believer in H1B. I have used it many times. It's a great programme.\"\n\nIt comes after Mr Musk vowed to \"go to war\" over the issue with Maga Republicans, who have called for tighter restrictions on immigration.\n\nThe Tesla billionaire and incoming head of the inaugural Department of Government Efficiency responded to the backlash by vowing to kick out \"hateful, unrepentant racists\" from the Republican Party.\n\nAt least 14 conservative accounts who criticised the Tesla founder's pro-legal immigration views claimed that X had since revoked their blue verification badge, removing access to monetisation through subscriptions and advertising revenue.\n\n\"Take a big step back and FUCK YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,\" Mr Musk wrote on X.\n\nThe online outburst comes as supporters of President-elect Donald Trump teeter on the brink of a civil war over immigration.\n\nMaga anti-immigration loyalists have shown increasing scepticism towards Mr Trump's tech world-allies over their support for legal immigration.\n\nMr Musk, who was born in South Africa and became a US citizen in 2002, has credited the HB1 scheme with attracting \"critical people\" to build tech companies such as SpaceX and Tesla.\n\nHe has likened the need to attract the \"top ~0.1% of engineering talent\" to an American professional sports team bringing in talent from abroad to remain successful.\n\nThe tech billionaire responded to a tweet which claimed Americans cannot fill jobs the \"tech Right\" are calling out for because they are \"retarded\" by saying \"this pretty much sums it up\".\n\nVivek Ramaswamy , who will lead the federal cost-cutting drive alongside Mr Musk, has also attracted criticism for claiming American culture is to blame for US firms' desire to hire foreign workers.\n\n\"A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian [the top student in a class], will not produce the best engineers,\" the American entrepreneur wrote on X.\n\nThe pair's position has spawned outrage from right-wing commentators such as Steve Bannon, who responded to Mr Musk on X: \"Someone please notify Child Protection Services - need to do a wellness check on this toddler\".\n\nThe owner of X has also been accused of censoring fellow conservatives on his social media platform, after several prominent accounts lost access to premium features.\n\nThe X account ConservativeOG, which has more than 430k followers, has claimed its verification status was removed after it spoke out against HB1 visas.\n\n\"It appears that Elon Musk intentionally shut us down,\" the account complained on X, adding: \"Is this the new status quo from America's \"most free\" social media platform?\"\n\nPreston Parra, the 23-year-old influencer behind ConservativeOG, said he considered Mr Musk to be a \"Trojan horse\" in the Maga camp.\n\n\"If anyone thinks for one minute the REAL backbone of the right wing and MAGA is gonna stand idly by while these big tech gillionaire Silicon Valley dweebs who didn't get bullied enough in high school, steal our country, they're mistaken,\" Mr Parra told NBC.\n\nAt least 14 conservative accounts have claimed that X had revoked their blue verification badge on Thursday and Friday.\n\nMr Musk has claimed that the site's algorithm attempts to \"maximise unregretted user-seconds\" by reducing the reach of those who are frequently blocked and muted by users.\n\n\"If far more credible, verified subscriber accounts (not bots) mute/block your account compared to those who like your posts, your reach will decline significantly,\" Mr Musk posted.\n\nLaura Loomer, right-wing activist and close Trump ally, said Mr Musk had \"censored\" her account over her views on migration.\n\nMs Loomer told her 1.4m followers on X that \"tech billionaires are like termites who have descended upon Palm Beach to INFEST AND ROT from within\".\n\nShe later added: \"We won't allow Big Tech to create their fantasy monarchy in America and make MAGA their indentured servants slaves.\"\n\nMs Loomer claimed her posts were being shown as \"probable spam\", describing the actions on X as \"totalitarian censorship\" and warning that \"MAGA is under attack\".\n\n\"I feel so misunderstood. I know I will be viciously targeted for speaking out\", she wrote on X, adding: \"It's a lonely existence fighting for what is righteous. It's not for everyone.\"\n\nMs Loomer accused Mr Musk of surrounding himself with online personas who \"run cover for him\" by leaping to his defence and promoting his views.\n\nSeveral right-wing accounts rallied in support of Mr Musk against Ms Loomer.\n\nMilo Yiannopoulos, right-wing British firebrand and former editor of Breitbart News, said: \"She got the slap she deserved, and took out dozens of MAGA royalty at the same time.\"\n\nMr Musk has previously been accused of setting up a sock puppet account under the name of Adrian Dittman.\n\nThe account, which has 153k followers, has repeatedly denied it is being run by the Tech billionaire but users have pointed to an uncanny similarity in voice, vocabulary and timings of posts.\n\nSleuths have also pointed to moments such as during an X Spaces conversation with Steven Kenneth Bonnell II, known online as Destiny, when the voice behind Dittman referred to owning and running a rocket company.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Don't let this become normal. They sent classified info to a journalist. It happened. The White House confirmed it. And here's the Secretary, viciously personally attacking the journalist and pretending it never happened. Trying to make us believe 2+2=7.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Michigan Representative Rashida Tlaib largely disregarded the leak in her messaging, noting: \"More heat for using a group chat than for the bombing itself.\"\n\nSeveral House Republicans have also condemned those on the Signal group chat for divulging highly classified information through insecure channels.\n\n\"None of this should have been sent on non-secure systems. Russia and China are surely monitoring his unclassified phone,\" Nebraska Representative Don Bacon, another Armed Services Committee member, told the outlet.\n\nNew York Representative Mike Lawler called for safeguards to be implemented to \"ensure this never happens again.\"\n\nWisconsin Representative Derrick Van Orden stated that if the breach was unintentional, there should be \"administrative accountability\" such as retraining, but should be held legally accountable if it was intentional.\n\nOther former top Democrats have called on the president to take action against those involved in the security lapse.\n\nLeon Panetta , who served as both the secretary of defense and director of the CIA under Barack Obama, said: \"Somebody from The Atlantic got the most sensitive emails you can imagine at the federal level. That is a serious blunder. It has to be investigated. And somebody, frankly, needs to get fired.\"\n\nPete Buttigieg, who served as Transport Secretary during the Biden administration, wrote on X Monday that \"this is the highest level of f***up imaginable.\"\n\n\"If there's no accountability for a screw-up like this, especially from a president who used to fire people every day on television for sport, what are we even doing here?,\" he told CNN's Kaitlan Collins Monday, referencing Trump's previous career as a reality TV star on The Apprentice .\n\nOther MAGA Republicans and Trump allies, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Fox News host Sean Hannity have rushed to downplay the severity of the lapse.\n\nAlong with Waltz and Hegseth , Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, were among others who appeared to be included in the Signal channel.\n\nGoldberg wrote that Waltz invited him to connect on Signal on March 11. The journalist, who uses the encrypted messaging platform under his initials \"JG,\" said he was added to the group two days later. No one appeared alarmed-or even aware-about the mysterious interloper in the chat, he said.\n\nAdding to the furor may be that officials seemingly failed to tip Trump off about Goldberg's report before being questioned on TV by reporters in the Oval Office on Monday afternoon.\n\n\"Well, it couldn't have been very effective because the attack was very effective,\" the president said when probed about the group chat. \"I don't know anything about it; you're telling me about it for the first time.\"\n\nWaltz, who Goldberg identified as being the official to send the Signal invite, does not need to be confirmed by the Senate. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that Trump continues to have confidence in the adviser.\n\nHegseth looked agitated as he insisted to reporters that \"nobody was texting war plans\" before labeling Goldberg a \"deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist.\"\n\nVance appeared to disagree with Trump's wisdom on the strikes, noting: \"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now.\""

      "text": "Who are the 'MAGA Republicans,' exactly? Not even the White House can truly say.\n\nManage your account\n\nWASHINGTON - According to President Biden, \"MAGA Republicans\" are a growing danger to American democracy and an extremist faction of a once-principled political party, a radical movement with unpopular, unworkable ideas.\n\nThere is only one question: Who are they, exactly?\n\nMAGA, of course, stands for Make America Great Again, the slogan that powered Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. And although Trump is seemingly preparing for a third White House run, Biden has said that the term encompasses more than just Trump but an entire movement that, as he put it during a rally in late August for Democratic candidates , wants \"to go backwards, full of anger, violence, hate and division.\"\n\nBut as \"MAGA Republicans\" become ever more prominent in the president's lexicon with the approach of the congressional midterms, the White House has faced persistent questions about exactly who Biden is talking about.\n\n\"I respect conservative Republicans,\" Biden said in Maryland. \"I don't respect these MAGA Republicans.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has named Reps. Marjorie Taylor-Greene of Georgia and Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, as well as Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, as adherents of MAGA Republicanism. But she and others, including the president, have outlined what they see as a much broader coalition, one that showed its true colors during the deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe Trump supporters who tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election were \"not representative of all Republicans,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters this week. But since the majority of Republicans do believe the presidential election was fraudulent, and that Trump bears no responsibility for Jan. 6, the MAGA faction appears to be significant in size.\n\nRepublicans are furious at what they see as the president's wholesale smear - at odds, they point out, with his campaign promise of reconciliation. \"Sounds like a president who has concluded his party's only path to success in November is with his predecessor on the ballot, even if it means casting aside all his campaign promises of 'unity,\" Republican strategist Colin Reed told Yahoo News in an email. \"He's running a fear campaign around the previous occupant of the Oval Office.\"\n\nThe president's supporters argue that he is only pointing out where Trump has taken the Republican Party. \"Folks want us, want people to show that there is a clear contrast in the election between where Democrats are and Republicans have been,\" Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., told the Associated Press this week .\n\nBiden first began to use the phrase in earnest last spring, as the Supreme Court prepared - according to a draft opinion of a case originating in Mississippi - to overrule the 50-year old Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion. Speaking shortly before the final decision was issued, Biden derided \"the MAGA crowd\" as \"the most extreme political organization that's existed in recent American history.\"\n\nGay marriage and contraception were also in peril. \"This is about a lot more than abortion,\" Biden warned.\n\nThe president's most trusted pollsters had settled on the MAGA label as a potent, pithy attack against Republicans at a time when voters seemed otherwise unenthusiastic about the Democratic Party. The branding was \"incredibly effective,\" a close Biden adviser, Celinda Lake, told Yahoo News in May .\n\nBut while the president can campaign for candidates and engage in overtly political activities, he cannot escape scrutiny for doing so. That scrutiny has become especially intense after last week's speech in Philadelphia, in which he lamented the eclipse of \"mainstream Republicans,\" of the kind he used to work with in the U.S. Senate.\n\nJust how real is the distinction between MAGA and non-MAGA Republicans? Of the 10 House members from the GOP who voted to impeach Trump, only two managed to fend off primary challenges from the right . Republican leadership in the House has rejected the congressional Jan. 6 investigation as a partisan spectacle; neither of the two Republicans on the panel, Reps. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., and Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., will be in the House come next January.\n\nIn the Senate, moderate Republicans have shown limited willingness to work with the president. When he first came into office, none voted for his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, but Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio later helped broker a major infrastructure deal. Portman and Susan Collins of Maine were also the lone Republicans in the upper chamber to vote for Steve Dettelbach, Biden's nominee to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\n\nThe FBI's execution of a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago last month to recover sensitive government documents from Trump further complicated alliances. Even some committed Trumpists tempered their criticism of the Department of Justice , a potential sign that the party is eager for new leadership.\n\nBiden is apparently intent on making sure that if new leaders do emerge, they are immediately tainted with the MAGA brand. But he has also conflated the Democrats' political challenges with the broader discourse about American democracy. That tactic was especially apparent in last Thursday's primetime address in Philadelphia , during which Biden referenced \"MAGA\" 13 times. MAGA had been elevated by the president to a threat on American democracy itself, which seemed to argue in favor of defining MAGA as accurately as possible.\n\nBut the president's definition of the movement is inherently contradictory. In his telling, it is both a fringe movement and also the prevailing Republican ideology of the day, a cult of personality that represents an overarching ideological project of enormous consequence.\n\n\"Not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology,\" Biden said in Philadelphia. At the same time, he argued that this committed minority had captured the entire GOP. \"There is no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans.\"\n\nThe following day, Biden assured reporters that he did not mean to malign all Republicans. \"I don't consider any Trump supporter a threat to the country,\" he said, although he said he did condemn anyone who condoned the violence of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nBut the questions continued, especially since the White House continued to be coy about who exactly the MAGA Republicans are. Earlier this week, Jean-Pierre alluded to Florida Sen. Rick Scott's controversial economic plan, which has been rejected by many of his fellow Republicans.\n\nOn Wednesday, a reporter asked whether Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader in the Senate, could be counted as part of the MAGA crowd. Although McConnell is known to dislike Trump personally, few did more than he did to advance Trump's agenda.\n\nThe press secretary demurred .\n\n\"I'm not going to go into specific names or people from here,\" she said, although she had singled out the likes of Taylor-Greene and DeSantis.\n\nThe evasions may be part of a political strategy. By leaving the \"MAGA Republican\" label open to interpretation, the White House all but ensures that debate over the label will persist, potentially normalizing the very argument about political extremism that Biden has been seeking to make.\n\n\"Is there really a non-MAGA wing of the Republican Party?,\" wondered a CNN headline earlier this week. For the White House, the persistence of that question could be just as important as arriving at an answer."

      "text": "Opinion: How anti-MAGA Republicans can reclaim their power\n\nManage your account\n\nIn a presidential election likely to be decided by razor-thin margins, a key question remains: What will anti-Trump Republicans do on Election Day?\n\nA number of prominent Republicans, such as former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, have publicly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. So have George Will , David French and other conservative intellectuals, as well as more than 200 Bush, McCain and Romney alumni and more than 100 former GOP national security officials. Former President George W. Bush's attorney general Alberto Gonzales spoke for many in this crowd when he explained his vote for Harris as arising from \"the necessity of electing a president who respects the rule of law to safeguard our liberties and way of life.\"\n\nOther high-profile Republicans like former Vice President Mike Pence, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, and former Sen. Pat Toomey and former Speaker Paul Ryan have ruled out voting for former President Donald Trump, but are withholding support for the Democratic ticket. This has been Sen. Mitt Romney's approach recently. Sen. Susan Collins has promised to write in Nikki Haley. Others might stay home or leave the presidential line blank. For this camp, Trump's unfitness is irrefutable, but pulling the lever for a party they've long opposed is a bridge too far.\n\nWhat if there were another option? What if a lifelong Republican could use their ballot to clearly affirm their commitment to conservative principles and actually help defeat the candidate they fear taking power? It's gone largely unnoticed, but Romney himself floated such an idea early in the 2024 cycle. While it's too late to realize his vision this fall, odds are this isn't the last center-left vs. MAGA matchup we'll encounter.\n\nThe solution is simple: form a new, conservative, rule-of-law political party, just as Liz Cheney recently proposed. But instead of putting forward a challenger with no chance of winning - as No Labels and others have tried - they would nominate whichever of the two leading candidates better reflects their core values. Meaning they could choose someone like Harris, even if she is also the Democratic nominee.\n\nOn the ballot, the candidate would appear as the nominee of both parties. By casting their vote on their new party's ballot line, anti-MAGA Republicans could help elect the only candidate capable of defeating the populist they want to keep out of the White House, while also signaling their continued commitment to rule-of-law conservatism.\n\nFor anti-MAGA Republicans, this new ballot line could be transformative. They would have an opportunity to object to liberal aspects of the Democratic agenda and instead affirm deeply held ideological convictions - without throwing away a vote in protest. If their candidate wins, their share of credit for victory will be plain and spelled out in the vote totals. And if they prove to be a meaningful share of a winning coalition, they'll be well-positioned to leverage this electoral strength to demand commensurate attention to their top issues and priorities.\n\nThis same \" fusion \" strategy has been used throughout U.S. history by parts of the electorate, like anti-MAGA Republicans today, who do not fit neatly within either major party. This was one way that anti-slavery third parties in the 1840s and 1850s helped elect principled Whigs and Democrats, despite both parties largely acquiescing to our nation's founding sin. The Republican Party itself was formed by these same anti-slavery visionaries shortly thereafter.\n\nRule-of-law conservatives are free to explore this path in a number of states already. In others, where state laws prevent a candidate from accepting a second party's nomination, there is ample time to amend the rules before the next cycle. In fact, many of those restrictions are unlawful and would not survive a court challenge.\n\nThe extent to which other principled conservatives follow the lead of Gonzales, Will and the Cheneys could decide the outcome of the 2024 election. Whether they \"fuse\" with Democratic nominees in the future could decide the extent to which rule-of-law conservatism continues to enjoy a prominent role in U.S. politics for years to come.\n\nBeau Tremitiere, of United to Protect Democracy, leads projects targeting political extremism and authoritarianism, including litigation challenging state laws prohibiting fusion voting. He previously served as an aide to West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin."

      "text": "Opinion: Trump's MAGA Republicans bear no resemblance to Republican Party of Ronald Reagan\n\nManage your account\n\nIn 1980, I excitedly cast my first vote for president of the United States. I supported Republican Ronald Reagan. I believed in his vision of America as a global leader defending democracy from the forces of communism and totalitarianism associated at the time with the Soviet Union and Communist China. I believed in the strength of free markets to drive capitalist economies that made the United States the world's leading economy. I also believed that from these privileged global positions, the United States incurred immense responsibilities to be a force for good. Over the past nearly 45 years my views have changed only in the sense that I have come to believe that America's post-World War II supremacy created an even more important responsibility to embrace the globalism we have authored through our military, economic and political relations.\n\nThese principles of global leadership and free markets, combined with the staunch belief in the rule of law and small government, have been the central pillars of the Republican Party for the majority of my adult life. Imagine my surprise in recent years to be informed that belief in these doctrinal principles of Republican orthodoxy bestows upon you the label \"Republican In Name Only,\" aka RINO. Donald Trump's creation of this label to identify any member of the Republican Party who did not whole-heartedly support his agenda is in fact a self-fulfilling prophecy. The reality is that the current Republican Party, as defined and operated by the Republican National Committee, is in fact the imposter. Trump's MAGA Republicans bear no resemblance to the Republican Party of Ronald Reagan. Sadly, the remaining vestiges of Reagan's Party are quickly being erased.\n\nThe election of Trump loyalist, Michael Whatley, and Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as co-chairs of the RNC and appointment of one of his senior campaign advisors, Chris LaCivita, as RNC's chief operating officer have finalized the codification of the Trump National Committee, aka RINO. The tenets of this organization seek to roll up the American sidewalk, turn out the porchlight and withdraw the United States into a self-serving cocoon. Belying the historical record and extensive social science research that asserts that democracies are far less likely to go to war with other democracies, thus underlying the related principle that the promotion of democracy leads to more peaceful global coexistence, the Trump National Committee is ceding global leadership to authoritarian/totalitarian power brokers Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. In its tragically mistaken belief that the United States can succeed as an island free of global encumbrances, the Trump National Committee has designs on imposing crippling tariffs on a vast array of imports from our leading trading partners around the globe. For an example of just how misguided this idea is, take a trip to the wheat belt of the United States and speak to any of the hundreds of family farmers who were forced out of business as a result of China's retaliatory agriculture tariffs during the first Trump Administration. The United States is tied to the global economy as tightly as a diver to his oxygen tank. This is not a new development. It has been the framework of America's economic history for most of our national history. Why the Trump National Committee and all of its political minions refuse to acknowledge this reality is not only foolhardy, but also inherently dangerous for the health and prosperity of this country.\n\nThese internationally focused issues pale in comparison to the centrality of the ardent Republican (and Democrat) belief in the sanctity of the rule of law and the corollary that no man is above the law. To say that the Trump National Committee has closed the barn door after the horse has escaped on this issue is a monumental understatement. Whether it be the continued rehashing of his 2020 Election Big Lie of election fraud or his ongoing campaign to argue that presidents must have complete immunity, Trump is convinced that he is indeed above the law. More than 60 court defeats on the election front have done nothing to quiet his victim rants. Belief in the nobility and legitimacy of Trump's disdain for the rule of law are now essential qualifications for membership in the Trump National Committee.\n\nThe Republican Party of my youth is dead. Next time you hear RINO, just remember, the speaker is actually referring to a member of the Trump National Committee, not some long forgotten adherent to Reagan's Republican Party.\n\nMore: Opinion: Republican Congressional leaders need to lead, follow or get out of the way\n\nMore: Opinion: Donald Trump is not best candidate to lead America toward the future\n\nBrad Gutierrez, Ph.D. is a retired U.S. Air Force combat pilot, professor of Political Science, military diplomat, and senior public policy civil servant.

And operatives on both the left and right say that a handful of controversial, Trump-endorsed nominees in key swing states could wind up costing the GOP some winnable Senate seats and governorships - and potentially even undercut Mr. Trump's presidential bid.\n\nCall it a coattails effect but in reverse - and with a negative impact.\n\nIn Arizona and North Carolina, MAGA Republicans are stirring up controversy and running behind their Democratic opponents, even as former President Donald Trump leads President Joe Biden.\n\n\"For lack of a better term, it's a negative trickle-up,\" says Matt Grotsky, a Democratic strategist and former communications director for the Arizona Democratic Party.\n\nIn Arizona, a critical battleground state, polls show Mr. Trump currently leads Mr. Biden by 3 to 6 percentage points. But GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake is running behind her Democratic opponent there by as many as 8 points . The divisive former news anchor lost her 2022 gubernatorial bid after promoting Mr. Trump's claims of election fraud and calling the late Arizona Sen. John McCain a \"loser.\" She then refused to concede, filing a lawsuit that was later dismissed.\n\nLikewise in North Carolina, where Mr. Trump had his narrowest win in 2020, a new Quinnipiac poll shows the former president leading Mr. Biden by just 2 points, while GOP gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson trails his Democratic opponent by 8. Mr. Robinson, the state's lieutenant governor, has made headlines for calling homosexuality \" filth ,\" suggesting abortion be banned from conception , and calling the Parkland school shooting survivors \" spoiled, angry, know it all CHILDREN .\"\n\nSome Republican-leaning voters in these states may choose to split their tickets - casting ballots for both Mr. Trump and a Democrat - or just leave the down-ballot selection blank. Others may decide to stay home, or even change their minds about supporting Mr. Trump.\n\n\"Mark Robinson is a greater threat to Donald Trump than any legal challenges he faces,\" says Paul Shumaker, a North Carolina Republican strategist who worked for one of Mr. Robinson's primary opponents. Mr. Shumaker says the gubernatorial nominee's inflammatory comments could sink the state for Mr. Trump. \"When you have a weak candidate down ballot and a strong up top, how do you weaken that candidate? By tying him. ... That's Politics 101.\"\n\nMany Republican candidates have leaned into Mr. Trump's MAGA brand since he won the presidency in 2016, but fewer have been able to ride it to victory. As Mr. Grotsky puts it, the past two election cycles have proved that Mr. Trump is in many ways a singular figure, and that voters often reject candidates who try to mimic his populist style at the state level.\n\nThe GOP learned this firsthand during the 2022 congressional midterm elections. Democrats performed better than expected, retaking the Senate after several Trump-endorsed nominees floundered with moderate voters. Now Democrats are hoping - and some Republicans are worrying - that this fall could be a repeat of two years ago, but this time with the White House on the line as well.\n\nThis week, reporting emerged that Montana GOP Senate candidate Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL whom Mr. Trump called an \"American hero,\" has told conflicting stories about a gunshot wound he said he got while deployed in Afghanistan . In Ohio, auto dealer and MAGA firebrand Bernie Moreno handily won the primary over a more traditional Republican whom Democrats had considered a greater threat. Dave McCormick, the GOP Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, is facing accusations that he actually lives in Connecticut - evoking similar carpetbagger claims that helped bring down the state's 2022 GOP Senate candidate, Dr. Mehmet Oz.\n\nThe Senate map this cycle strongly favors Republicans, with Democrats defending five seats ranked as toss-ups or likely GOP pickups, and another four that could potentially be in jeopardy. Republicans, by contrast, have just two seats ranked \"likely Republican\" while the rest are all deemed safe.\n\nBut a similarly GOP-friendly map in 2022 wasn't enough to overcome a slate of controversial, MAGA-aligned candidates. Some of those Republicans were boosted in their efforts to win the nomination by Democratic groups, who ran ads calling them \"too conservative\" or too aligned with Mr. Trump - a tactic Democrats have quietly repeated this cycle in states like Ohio.\n\nStill, Democrats say they need to take seriously the possibility of MAGA candidates winning in November. In North Carolina, Anderson Clayton, chair of the state Democratic Party, notes that Mr. Robinson, the state's current lieutenant governor, has already been elected statewide once.\n\n\"The bottom of the ballot is going to help the top of the ticket in my state like none other,\" says Ms. Clayton. \"But for us to be able to have reverse coattails, we need to educate voters on who these candidates are.\"\n\nSome analysts remain skeptical that down-ballot races will ultimately have much effect on the presidential contest.\n\n\"Trump is such a polarizing figure to Democrats, and so is Biden to Republicans. What's going to motivate people is the top of the ticket,\" says Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego. \"Politics is so nationalized, and driven by attitudes focused on the presidency, that there is not a lot of breathing room down ticket for candidates to differentiate themselves.\"\n\nIn recent years, the number of split-ticket voters - those backing candidates from different parties at the same time - has declined , as polarization has increased. The 2020 election had the lowest level of ticket-splitting since Pew Research Center started tracking the data in the early 1970s.\n\nBut that's not to say it doesn't exist.\n\nDemocratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana, both up for reelection this year, have won reelection in states that have become reliably Republican in presidential elections. Popular Republican governors won in New Hampshire and Vermont in 2016 and 2020, even as Hillary Clinton and Mr. Biden carried those states. This year, popular former Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, is currently leading in his race for Maryland Senate even as the state is expected to be a sure win for Mr. Biden.\n\nNorth Carolina specifically has a strong history in ticket-splitting. In the past two presidential election cycles, both Mr. Trump and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper won the state. The current Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Josh Stein, was reelected as the state's attorney general in 2020 - the same year Mr. Robinson was first elected lieutenant governor.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

In Mr. Trump and Mr. Robinson, \"we're seeing two Republican candidates at the top of the ticket who are very much aligned with each other,\" he adds. \"Can they push the envelope to where that small middle ground in North Carolina goes, 'That's just too much for me'?\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Two terms as chair of the Greenville County GOP, the largest Republican group in the state. He volunteered for former President Donald Trump's campaign and served as a national delegate for him at both the 2016 and 2020 conventions.\n\n\"And they call me a RINO?\" snorts Mr. Leupp, who runs a Christian music production studio just 3 miles from the new Greenville GOP headquarters - a place where he no longer feels welcome.\n\nAs Mr. Leupp sees it, the Greenville GOP has undergone something of a hostile takeover. After former President Trump lost reelection in 2020, a group of MAGA-aligned activists here - many previously unknown to local Republican leaders - began organizing under the name mySCGOP. They pushed out long-standing party officials who they claimed were insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trump. They even changed the party logo , adding Mr. Trump's infamous golden hair to the Greenville GOP's red-and-blue elephant.\n\nEfforts to put Trump supporters in charge of Republican infrastructure are bearing fruit. Some see grassroots activism. Others see a hostile takeover.\n\n\"These people ... had no credentials whatsoever,\" says Mr. Leupp, who's incredulous that he's the one being labeled a \"Republican in name only.\" \"Now we have a lot of people in the Greenville County Republicans who refuse to say they are Republican. They say, 'I'm MAGA; I'm not a Republican.'\"\n\nHe adds, \"Greenville is just a microcosm of what Trump did nationwide.\"\n\nIt's a dynamic that's playing out across the United States, as Trump loyalists, many of whom were previously uninvolved in politics and not necessarily even registered Republicans, have taken over the GOP infrastructure at the county, state, and even national levels. Supporters say they're remaking party organizations to better reflect the wishes of the voters and are finally giving the former president and current front-runner the institutional support he deserves.\n\nBut to critics, the overt fidelity to one candidate - as demonstrated through canceled primaries and the suppression of intraparty dissent - is inappropriate and verges on undemocratic. Some worry it will divert resources away from down-ballot candidates who may not be closely allied with Mr. Trump. And they say the purge of experienced operatives could hurt the GOP's long-term viability, impacting crucial duties like fundraising, candidate recruitment, and get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\nBitter infighting has broken out in places like Greenville and South Carolina's Horry County . In Michigan, new state GOP Chair Kristina Karamo, an outspoken denier of the 2020 election results, was forced from her post in January after significant fundraising woes and altercations. She is now suing to regain her seat.\n\nLikewise, scandals and ideological disagreements have weakened the GOP apparatus in other states that could decide the 2024 presidential election - including Georgia, Florida, Nevada, and Arizona. Last year, the Arizona GOP chair reportedly asked the national party for a financial bailout after running up legal bills in election fraud cases, and records suggest the Michigan GOP is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.\n\nAt the national level, Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, is reportedly preparing to step down, following months of tension between her and Mr. Trump - a rare midcycle departure. In her place, Mr. Trump has endorsed his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, and his senior campaign adviser Chris LaCivita to help lead the RNC. Recently, Ms. Trump said she believed Republican voters would like to see the RNC pay Mr. Trump's legal fees .\n\n\"What we've been doing here in South Carolina is kind of a mini version of what's happening at the RNC. We're trying to take back the party and put into leadership people who are MAGA, 'America First' supporters,\" says Jeff Davis, one of the leaders of the mySCGOP movement and the current state executive committeeman for the Greenville County GOP. \"This is the new Republican Party. It's coming.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail in South Carolina this past weekend, Nikki Haley, Mr. Trump's only remaining major challenger for the GOP nomination, called the prospect of a Trump-allied RNC bad for democracy, saying, \"We don't anoint kings in America.\"\n\nOthers compare it to letting one competitor hand-pick new referees in the middle of the game.\n\n\"The nominee - once they become the nominee - has the right to put their imprint on the RNC,\" says Henry Barbour, an RNC committeeman from Mississippi. \"[But] I think this effort is premature. Nikki Haley is still in the race.\"\n\nYet in many states, the primaries' outcome has been treated as a foregone conclusion. State parties in Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Arizona, and Georgia - none of which have held primary elections yet - have already signaled their support for Mr. Trump's nomination.\n\n\"Parties don't endorse,\" says Oscar Brock, a committee member from Tennessee. \"They have their right to be supportive of Trump, but they don't have a right to use the state party to support one candidate.\"\n\nAt a recent Greenville GOP \"Coffee and Politics\" event, roughly 40 people gather over doughnuts and biscuits with gravy, beneath a handwritten sign that reads, \"You have to be politically feared to be politically respected.\"\n\nToward the end of the meeting, one member, Terry Wicker, reminds everyone that they will be getting some yard signs for Ms. Haley, the state's former governor.\n\n\"If anyone is interested,\" she explains, before quickly adding, \"I think everybody here wants Trump. But just, you know - we're being fair.\"\n\n\"You're being watched if you pick up a Nikki Haley sign,\" someone says, as the room erupts in laughter.\n\n\"You can take a Nikki sign and put 'never' on it,\" says an older woman in the back. More laughs.\n\nAs the merriment dies down, someone asks Ms. Wicker to remind the room about an upcoming Trump door-knocking event.\n\nMr. Davis, the Greenville GOP's state executive committeeman, was once active in the local tea party group. But after going to bed on election night in 2020, when Mr. Trump appeared to be winning, and then waking up the next morning to find Joe Biden ahead, he says he realized the importance of getting more Trump supporters into the party infrastructure.\n\nHe and a group of like-minded activists formed mySCGOP, initially focusing their efforts on electing MAGA Republicans to lead Greenville County's 151 voting precincts. In years past, Mr. Davis says, as many as half of these entry-level seats went unfilled.\n\n\"The only way to replace people at the county, state, and ultimately at the national level - and this is where Trump is helping us from the top down - is a numbers game,\" says Mr. Davis. \"Technically the RNC is supposed to be a bottom-up organization, but they make the rules so complicated. ... They wanted to keep it small to control it all.\"\n\nThey started growing their group, through Facebook and a website, and knocking on doors. People \"were looking for an outlet,\" says Mr. Davis. Ultimately, mySCGOP candidates won leadership positions in a majority of the 151 precincts.\n\nA few months later, when the top three elected leaders of the Greenville GOP resigned, citing continual lawsuits and threats from mySCGOP members, it was those newly elected mySCGOP precinct leaders who got to pick their replacements - one of whom wound up being Mr. Davis.\n\n\"People that had traditionally held power very easily had never been challenged,\" says Yvonne Julian, the new chair of the Greenville GOP, who says the first time she voted for a Republican was for Mr. Trump in 2016. \"They were a little bit blind to what was happening, to the power of the whole Trump movement. ... I tell a lot of them, 'If you had done a better job, I would not be here.'\"\n\nStill, some longtime party members say what's happening is more than just healthy grassroots activism.

The speech embodied Mr. Biden's shift toward stronger rhetoric ahead of the midterms.\n\nLoading...\n\nSept. 02, 2022, 11:45 a.m. ET | Philadelphia\n\nPresident Joe Biden charged in a prime-time address that the \"extreme ideology\" of Donald Trump and his adherents \"threatens the very foundation of our republic,\" as he summoned Americans of all stripes to help counter what he sketched as dark forces within the Republican Party trying to subvert democracy.\n\nIn his speech Thursday at Philadelphia's Independence Hall, Mr. Biden unleashed the trappings of the presidency in an unusually strong and sweeping indictment of Mr. Trump and what he said has become the dominant strain of the opposition party. His broadside came barely two months before Americans head to the polls in bitterly contested midterm elections that Mr. Biden calls a crossroads for the nation.\n\n\"Too much of what's happening in our country today is not normal,\" he said before an audience of hundreds, raising his voice over pro-Trump hecklers outside the building where the nation's founding was debated. He said he wasn't condemning the 74 million people who voted for Mr. Trump in 2020, but added, \"There's no question that the Republican Party today is dominated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans,\" using the acronym for Mr. Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" campaign slogan.\n\nThe explicit effort by Mr. Biden to marginalize Mr. Trump and his followers marks a sharp recent turn for the president, who preached his desire to bring about national unity in his Inaugural address.\n\nMr. Biden, who largely avoided even referring to \"the former guy\" by name during his first year in office, has grown increasingly vocal in calling out Mr. Trump personally. Now, emboldened by his party's summertime legislative wins and wary of Mr. Trump's return to the headlines, he has sharpened his attacks, last week likening the \"MAGA philosophy\" to \"semi-fascism.\"\n\nWading into risky political terrain, Mr. Biden strained to balance his criticism with an appeal to more traditional Republicans to make their voices heard. Meanwhile, GOP leaders swiftly accused him of only furthering political divisions.\n\nDelivering a preemptive rebuttal from Scranton, Pennsylvania, where Mr. Biden was born, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said it is the Democratic president, not Republicans, trying to divide Americans.\n\n\"In the past two years, Joe Biden has launched an assault on the soul of America, on its people, on its laws, on its most sacred values,\" Congressman McCarthy said. \"He has launched an assault on our democracy. His policies have severely wounded America's soul, diminished America's spirit, and betrayed America's trust.\"\n\nAsked about Mr. McCarthy's criticism, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said earlier Thursday that \"we understand we hit a nerve\" with the GOP leader, and quoted the Republican's prior statements saying Mr. Trump bore responsibility for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMr. Trump plans a rally this weekend in the Scranton area.\n\nWhite House officials said the sharp tenor of Mr. Biden's remarks reflected his mounting concern about Mr. Trump allies' ideological proposals and relentless denial of the nation's 2020 election results.\n\n\"Equality and democracy are under assault\" in the U.S., Mr. Biden charged, casting Mr. Trump and his backers in the GOP as a menace to the nation's system of government, its standing abroad and its citizens' way of life.\n\nMr. Trump and the MAGA Republicans \"promote authoritarian leaders and they fan the flames of political violence,\" he said. They \"are determined to take this country backwards.\"\n\n\"Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love,\" he said, referencing the social issues that Democrats have looked to place front-and-center for voters this fall.\n\nMr. Biden's appearance was promoted as an official, taxpayer-funded event, a mark of how the president views defeating the Trump agenda as a policy aim as much as a political one. Red and blue lights illuminated the brick of Independence Hall, as the Marine Band played \"Hail to the Chief\" and a pair of Marine sentries stood at parade rest in the backdrop. Still, the major broadcast television networks did not carry the address live.\n\nThe president appealed for citizens to \"vote, vote, vote\" to protect their democracy. \"For a long time, we've reassured ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed. But it is not.\"\n\nMr. Biden harked back to the 2017 white supremacist protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, which he said brought him out of political retirement to challenge Mr. Trump. Mr. Biden argued that the country faces a similar crossroads in the coming months, and he cast defending the \"soul of the nation\" as \"the work of my presidency - a mission I believe in with my whole soul.\"\n\nBut Iowa GOP chair Jeff Kaufman said in a statement that Mr. Biden was using the tactics of an authoritarian regime, \"trying to turn his political opponents into an enemy of the state.\"\n\nLarry Diamond, an expert on democracy and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said calling Mr. Trump out for attacks on democracy \"can be manipulated or framed as being partisan. And if you don't call it out, you are shrinking from an important challenge in the defense of democracy.\"\n\nThe White House has tried to keep Mr. Biden removed from the legal and political maelstrom surrounding the Department of Justice's discovery of classified documents in Mr. Trump's Florida home. Still, Mr. Biden has pointed to some Republicans' quick condemnation of federal law enforcement, to argue \"you can't be pro-insurrectionist and pro-American.\"\n\nHis trip to Philadelphia was just one of his three to the state within a week, a sign of Pennsylvania's importance in the midterms, with competitive Senate and governor's races. However, neither Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, the Democrats' Senate nominee, nor Attorney General Josh Shapiro, their pick for governor, attended Thursday night.\n\nThe White House intended the speech to unite familiar themes: holding out bipartisan legislative wins on guns and infrastructure as evidence that democracies \"can deliver,\" pushing back on GOP policies on guns and abortion that Mr. Biden says are out of step with most people's views.\n\nThe challenges have only increased since the tumult surrounding the 2020 election and the Capitol attack.\n\nLies surrounding that presidential race have triggered harassment and death threats against state and local election officials and new restrictions on mail voting in Republican-dominated states. County election officials have faced pressure to ban the use of voting equipment, efforts generated by conspiracy theories that voting machines were somehow manipulated to steal the election.\n\nCandidates who dispute Mr. Trump's loss have been inspired to run for state and local election posts, promising to restore integrity to a system that has been undermined by false claims.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nThere is no evidence of any widespread fraud or manipulation of voting machines. Judges, including ones appointed by Mr. Trump, dismissed dozens of lawsuits filed after the election, and Mr. Trump's own attorney general called the claims bogus. Yet Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research polling has shown about two-thirds of Republicans say they do not think Mr. Biden was legitimately elected president.\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.

It now goes to President Joe Biden, who is expected to quickly sign it into law.\n\nLoading...\n\nDec. 21, 2024, 7:54 a.m. ET | Washington\n\nFacing a government shutdown deadline, the Senate rushed through final passage early Saturday of a bipartisan plan that would temporarily fund federal operations and disaster aid, dropping President-elect Donald Trump's demands for a debt limit increase into the new year.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson had insisted Congress would \"meet our obligations\" and not allow federal operations to shutter ahead of the Christmas holiday season. But the day's outcome was uncertain after Trump doubled down on his insistence that a debt ceiling increase be included in any deal - if not, he said in an early morning post, let the closures \"start now.\"\n\nThe House approved Mr. Johnson's new bill overwhelmingly, 366-34. The Senate worked into the night to pass it, 85-11, just after the deadline. At midnight, the White House said it had ceased shutdown preparations.\n\n\"This is a good outcome for the country, \" Mr. Johnson said after the House vote, adding he had spoken with Trump and the president-elect \"was certainly happy about this outcome, as well.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden , who has played a less public role in the process throughout a turbulent week, was expected to sign the measure into law Saturday.\n\n\"There will be no government shutdown,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.\n\nThe final product was the third attempt from Mr. Johnson, the beleaguered House speaker, to achieve one of the basic requirements of the federal government - keeping it open. And it raised stark questions about whether Johnson will be able to keep his job, in the face of angry GOP colleagues, and work alongside Mr. Trump and billionaire ally Elon Musk , who called the legislative plays from afar.\n\nMr. Trump's last-minute demand was almost an impossible ask, and Mr. Johnson had almost no choice but to work around his pressure for a debt ceiling increase. The speaker knew there wouldn't be enough support within the GOP majority to pass any funding package, since many Republican deficit hawks prefer to slash the federal government and certainly wouldn't allow more debt.\n\nInstead, the Republicans, who will have full control of the White House, House, and Senate next year, with big plans for tax cuts and other priorities, are showing they must routinely rely on Democrats for the votes needed to keep up with the routine operations of governing.\n\n\"So is this a Republican bill or a Democrat bill?\" scoffed Mr. Musk on social media ahead of the vote.\n\nThe drastically slimmed-down 118-page package would fund the government at current levels through March 14 and add $100 billion in disaster aid and $10 billion in agricultural assistance to farmers.\n\nGone is Mr. Trump's demand to lift the debt ceiling, which GOP leaders told lawmakers would be debated as part of their tax and border packages in the new year. Republicans made a so-called handshake agreement to raise the debt limit at that time while also cutting $2.5 trillion in spending over 10 years.\n\nIt's essentially the same deal that flopped the night before in a spectacular setback - opposed by most Democrats and some of the most conservative Republicans - minus Mr. Trump's debt ceiling demand.\n\nBut it's far smaller than the original bipartisan accord Mr. Johnson struck with Democratic and Republican leaders - a 1,500-page bill that Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk rejected, forcing him to start over. It was stuffed with a long list of other bills - including much-derided pay raises for lawmakers - but also other measures with broad bipartisan support that now have a tougher path to becoming law.\n\nHouse Democrats were cool to the latest effort after Mr. Johnson reneged on the hard-fought bipartisan compromise.\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said it looked like Mr. Musk, the wealthiest man in the world, was calling the shots for Mr. Trump and Republicans.\n\n\"Who is in charge?\" she asked during the debate.\n\nStill, the House Democrats put up more votes than Republicans for the bill's passage. Almost three dozen conservative House Republicans voted against it.\n\n\"The House Democrats have successfully stopped extreme MAGA Republicans from shutting down the government, crashing the economy, and hurting working-class Americans all across the nation,\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said, referring to Mr. Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan.\n\nIn the Senate, almost all the opposition came from the Republicans - except independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who said Mr. Musk's interference was \"not democracy, that's oligarchy.\"\n\nMr. Trump, who has not yet been sworn into office, is showing the power but also the limits of his sway with Congress, as he intervenes and orchestrates affairs from Mar-a-Lago alongside Mr. Musk , who is heading up the new Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe incoming Trump administration vows to slash the federal budget and fire thousands of employees and is counting on Republicans for a big tax package. And Mr. Trump's not fearful of shutdowns the way lawmakers are, having sparked the longest government shutdown in history in his first term at the White House.\n\n\"If there is going to be a shutdown of government, let it begin now,\" Trump posted early in the morning on social media.\n\nMore important for the president-elect was his demand for pushing the thorny debt ceiling debate off the table before he returns to the White House. The federal debt limit expires Jan. 1, and Trump doesn't want the first months of his new administration saddled with tough negotiations in Congress to lift the nation's borrowing capacity. Now Mr. Johnson will be on the hook to deliver.\n\n\"Congress must get rid of, or extend out to, perhaps, 2029, the ridiculous Debt Ceiling,\" Mr. Trump posted - increasing his demand for a new five-year debt limit increase. \"Without this, we should never make a deal.\"\n\nGovernment workers had already been told to prepare for a federal shutdown that would send millions of employees - and members of the military - into the holiday season without paychecks.\n\nMr. Biden has been in discussions with Mr. Jeffries and Mr. Schumer, but White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said: \"Republicans blew up this deal. They did, and they need to fix this.\"\n\nAs the day dragged on, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell stepped in to remind colleagues \"how harmful it is to shut the government down, and how foolish it is to bet your own side won't take the blame for it.\"\n\nAt one point, Mr. Johnson asked House Republicans at a lunchtime meeting for a show of hands as they tried to choose the path forward.\n\nIt wasn't just the shutdown, but the speaker's job on the line. The speaker's election is the first vote of the new Congress, which convenes Jan. 3, and some Trump allies have floated Mr. Musk for speaker.\n\nJohnson said he spoke to Mr. Musk ahead of the vote Friday and they talked about the \"extraordinary challenges of this job.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

If he wins the governorship this November, Mr. Mastriano would have the power to appoint Pennsylvania's next secretary of state.\n\nSome Republicans who deny the validity of the 2020 vote are running for office in 2022. If they win, what happens to trust in U.S. elections?\n\nAcross America, Republicans who question the legitimacy of the last presidential election are on the ballot for the 2022 midterms. At least 195 GOP Senate, House, governor, attorney general, or secretary of state nominees have echoed Mr. Trump's false charge that the presidential election was stolen, data media site FiveThirtyEight estimated this week .\n\nYet multiple reviews in state after state have shown the election to be fair and the results accurate. Multiple officials of both parties, including Mr. Trump's former Attorney General William Barr , have said they saw no evidence of widespread fraud.\n\nWhether election deniers in key positions could have flipped 2020 for Mr. Trump is an open question. The U.S. electoral system is decentralized and complex. Nor is every candidate who criticizes the last presidential vote embracing disinformation or false claims. For many, it may be a way of expressing anger at the 2020 outcome or continued support for Mr. Trump.\n\nBut Mr. Trump - who seems almost certain to run again - continues to push his false claims of widespread fraud at rallies and on his Truth Social media site. If in 2024 the election is razor-close, and a battleground state election official who echoes these claims refuses to certify a result or appoint Electoral College electors, trust in the election system, even in democracy itself, could be gravely damaged.\n\n\"Just think about the implications of simply ignoring the results of an election,\" says Kenneth Mayer, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\nIn many ways Republican candidates who question the legitimacy of the 2020 election are simply mirroring what their voters believe. In poll after poll, about 70% of Republican voters say they do not think Mr. Biden legitimately won election to the presidency, according to the fact-checking site PolitiFact .\n\nThat does not mean a vast majority of the GOP accepts all the misinformation about 2020 that Mr. Trump continues to espouse. It's possible some of this grassroots denialism represents disaffected voters expressing anger at the system, says Richard Pildes, a professor of constitutional law at New York University.\n\nBut expressing mistrust in the Biden-Trump contest's result - despite more than 60 court decisions, official statements, and reports indicating it was conducted fairly - has become a foundational belief in particular for Republican primary voters, who are often the most motivated party faction. The result has been victories for candidates who embrace Mr. Trump's \"Stop the Steal\" ethos in some key battleground states.\n\n\"I do expect that particularly in close elections, this is going to remain a force,\" says Professor Pildes.\n\nPresident Biden, in a speech billed as a defense of democracy last week, spoke for many Democrats and some Republicans when he criticized what he termed \"MAGA Republicans\" for not recognizing the will of the people and refusing to accept the results of free elections.\n\n\"They're working right now as I speak in state after state to give power to decide elections in America to partisans and cronies, empowering election deniers to undermine democracy itself,\" the president said.\n\nGOP candidates who say they doubt the 2020 outcome were not happy with his words.\n\n\"I think he is too divisive calling his doubters horrible names. He should be trying to unite the country,\" tweeted Mr. Finchem last week in response to the president's speech.\n\nOf 529 Republican nominees for top offices in the upcoming 2022 midterms, 195 have fully denied the results of 2020, according to FiveThirtyEight's analysis . That means they either directly stated that the vote was stolen or joined in legal action to try to overturn the results.\n\nAn additional 61 nominees have raised questions about the presidential election, according to FiveThirtyEight, meaning they have expressed doubts that the vote was conducted fairly without openly questioning whether the election was legitimate.\n\nThe majority of these are House candidates, and many are poised to win. In office, they could vote to challenge state results in 2024 when Congress, per the Constitution, meets to certify the election of the president - as 147 did on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nBut it is the prospect of election-denying candidates winning state offices - governor, attorney general, and secretary of state - that worries some experts the most. Of those, secretary of state may be the most vulnerable to electoral mischief. They are the top election officials in many states, setting rules and regulations, approving voting procedures, overseeing worker training, and certifying results.\n\n\"There's a lot of room for them to put their thumb on the scale,\" says Professor Mayer.\n\nSecretaries of state could change how people vote in many states, pushing to eliminate or curtail drop boxes and the use of voting by mail, or electronic voting machines. They could expand access for partisan election observers, or increase the presence of law enforcement at precincts. They could discourage voting and erode trust in elections by continuing to question the electoral system.\n\nAmong the most disruptive things secretaries of state could do is refuse to certify accurate results, or acquiesce in objection to certification from lower-level officials. If such officials in just three battleground states won't certify their results or appoint electors, the nation could face a constitutional crisis.\n\n\"One of the things that 2020 has driven home is the magnitude of insider threats to election integrity,\" says Philip Stark, professor at the University of California, Berkeley and an election integrity expert.\n\nThere are nine Republican secretary of state nominees who fully or partially embrace false assertions about the prevalence of fraud in 2020 elections, according to a race-by-race analysis of American election candidates by Bloomberg News .\n\nOne is already guaranteed election this fall. In Wyoming, GOP candidate Chuck Gray is running unopposed in November's general election. Mr. Gray has called the 2020 election \"clearly rigged,\" and has asserted that the \"woke, big tech left\" steals elections.\n\nFour of them represent crucial battleground states and have joined together in an America First Secretary of State Coalition : Mr. Finchem in Arizona, Ms. Karamo in Michigan, Jim Marchant in Nevada, and Mr. Mastriano in Pennsylvania. The last, while a gubernatorial candidate, says he has already selected a suitable person for secretary of state.\n\nTheir website states that their goals are to achieve \"voter integrity\" and \"counter and reverse electoral fraud.\" While instances of fraud can be found, many experts say it is rare in America and limited to isolated incidents that would not affect an election's outcome.\n\nTheir agenda includes eliminating mail-in ballots while keeping traditional absentee ballots - presumably for voters with an excuse as to why they cannot vote in person. They also favor single-day voting, poll-watcher reforms, aggressive \"cleanup\" of voter rolls, paper ballots, and a voter identification requirement.\n\n\"In order to win, we have to play their game better. If we want fair and honest federal elections, we must start with electing the right people at the State level,\" says the America First Secretary of State Coalition website.\n\nThere are many different forms of election denialism, says NYU's Professor Pildes.\n\nSome people say they wouldn't have certified the 2020 election, he says. Some would say that Mr. Biden is president, but without saying he won. Some say there was fraud and the election will never be certain for that reason.\n\nBut \"I'm not sure how much difference it makes to distinguish between these different versions because they're all incredibly destabilizing,\" he says.\n\nThe U.S. election system is very decentralized, even for national elections. Many different levels of government have a hand in administering the vote. Key officials who oversee elections are themselves elected, meaning they can become partisan actors.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Behind it all is Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who's demonstrated an alternative to dysfunction and chaos: governing.\n\nLoading...\n\nMay 02, 2024, 11:43 a.m. ET | Washington\n\nWithout wielding the gavel or holding a formal job laid out in the Constitution, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries might very well be the most powerful person in Congress right now.\n\nThe minority leader of the House Democrats, it was Mr. Jeffries who provided the votes needed to keep the government running despite opposition from House Republicans to prevent a federal shutdown.\n\nMr. Jeffries who made sure Democrats delivered the tally to send $95 billion foreign aid to Ukraine and other U.S. allies.\n\nAnd Mr. Jeffries who, with the full force of House Democratic leadership behind him, decided this week his party would help Speaker Mike Johnson stay on the job rather than be ousted by far-right Republicans led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\n\"How powerful is Jeffries right now?\" said Jeffery Jenkins, a public policy professor at the University of Southern California who has written extensively about Congress. \"That's significant power.\"\n\nThe decision by Mr. Jeffries and the House Democratic leadership team to lend their votes to stop Mr. Johnson's ouster provides a powerful inflection point in what has been a long political season of dysfunction, stalemate, and chaos in Congress.\n\nBy declaring enough is enough, that it's time to \"turn the page\" on the Republican tumult, the Democratic leader is flexing his power in a very public and timely way, an attempt to show lawmakers, and anyone else watching in dismay at the broken Congress, that there can be an alternative approach to governing.\n\n\"From the very beginning of this Congress, House Republicans have visited chaos, dysfunction, and extremism on the American people,\" Mr. Jeffries said May 1 at the Capitol.\n\nMr. Jeffries said that with House Republicans \"unwilling or unable\" to get \"the extreme MAGA Republicans under control, \"it's going to take a bipartisan coalition and partnership to accomplish that objective. We need more common sense in Washington, D.C., and less chaos.\"\n\nIn the House, the minority leader is often seen as the speaker-in-waiting, the highest-ranking official of the party that's out of power, biding their time in hopes of regaining the majority - and with it, the speaker's gavel - in the next election. Elected by their own party, it's a job without much formal underpinning.\n\nBut in Mr. Jeffries' case, the minority leader position has come with enormous power, filling the political void left by the actual speaker, Mr. Johnson, who commands a fragile, thread-thin Republican majority and is constantly under threat from far-right provocateurs that the GOP speaker cannot fully control.\n\n\"He's operating as a shadow speaker on all the important votes,\" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nWhile Mr. Johnson still marshals the powerful tools of the speaker's office, a job outlined in the Constitution and second in the line of succession to the presidency, the Republican-led House has churned through a tumultuous session of infighting and upheaval that has left their goals and priorities stalled out.\n\nIn a fit of displeasure just months into their majority, far-right Republicans ousted the previous speaker, the now-retired Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., last fall in a never-before-seen act of party revolt. He declined to specifically ask the Democrats for help.\n\nMr. Johnson faces the same threat of removal, but Mr. Jeffries sees in Mr. Johnson a more honest broker and potential partner he is willing to at least temporarily prop up - even though Mr. Johnson, too, has not overtly asked for any assist from across the aisle. A vote on Ms. Greene's motion to vacate the speaker is expected next week.\n\nAs Mr. Johnson sidles up to Donald Trump, receiving the presumed Republican presidential nominee's nod of support, it is Mr. Jeffries who holds what Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker emerita, has referred to as \"currency of the realm\" - votes - that are required in the House to get any agenda over the finish line.\n\nMs. Pelosi said in an interview that Mr. Jeffries as the minority leader has \"always had leverage\" because of the slim House majority.\n\n\"But it's a question of him showing that he's willing to use it,\" she said.\n\nMr. Jeffries has been \"masterful,\" she said, at securing Democratic priorities, notably humanitarian assistance in the foreign aid package that Republicans initially opposed.\n\nBut Ms. Pelosi disagreed with the idea that Democrats lending support to Mr. Johnson at this juncture creates some sort of new coalition era of U.S. politics.\n\n\"Our House functions because we're willing to be bipartisan in making it function,\" she said. \"He's not necessarily saving Speaker Johnson - he's upholding the dignity of the institution.\"\n\nMr. Jeffries is a quietly confident operator, positioning himself, and his party, as purveyors of democratic norms amid the Republican thunderclap of Trump-era disruption.\n\nThe first Black American to lead a political party in Congress, Mr. Jeffries is already a historic figure, whose stature will only rise further if he is elected as the first to wield the gavel as House speaker.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, Mr. Jeffries rose steadily through the ranks in New York state politics and then on the national stage, a charismatic next-generation leader, first elected to Congress in 2012 from the district parts of which were once represented by another historic lawmaker, Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman elected to Congress.\n\nA former corporate lawyer, Mr. Jeffries is also known for his sharp oratory, drawing on his upbringing in the historically Black Cornerstone Baptist Church, a spiritual home for many grandchildren and great-grandchildren of enslaved African Americans who fled to Brooklyn from the American South. But he also infuses his speeches and remarks with a modern sensibility and cadence, bridging generations.\n\nLast year, when Republicans could not muster the votes on a procedural step for a budget and debt deal, it was Mr. Jeffries who stood intently at his desk in the House chamber, and lifted his voting card to signal to Democrats it was time to step up and deliver.\n\nRepeatedly, Mr. Jeffries has ensured the Democratic votes to prevent a federal government shutdown. And last month, when Mr. Johnson faced an all-out hard-right Republican revolt over the Ukraine aid, Mr. Jeffries again stepped in, assuring Democrats had more votes than Republicans to see it to passage.\n\nAhead of the November election, the two parties are in a fight for political survival to control the narrowly divided House, and Mr. Jeffries would most certainly face his own challenges leading Democrats if they were to gain the majority, splintered over many key issues.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The Republican titan - deemed by many the father of modern conservatism - holds in one hand a cowboy hat, a nod to his roots in the American West and his commitment to self-reliance. The other hand rests on a camera case.\n\nSenator Goldwater loved taking photographs. He captured more than 15,000 images of the Arizona desert and Native Americans, using his mother's Brownie box camera when just a boy. His friend, the great landscape photographer Ansel Adams, called him \"a fine and eager amateur\" who compiled a pictorial record of \"historical and interpretive significance.\"\n\nVisiting the Goldwater Memorial in Paradise Valley near Phoenix, one can't help but wonder what the former presidential candidate would think if he focused his lens on Arizona's Republican Party today.\n\nOnce a GOP stronghold, Arizona is now purple - and a battleground between traditional and MAGA Republicans. This conservative divide could shape the future of the Republican Party and the coming elections.\n\nHe was famously trounced as the GOP presidential nominee in the 1964 contest against President Lyndon B. Johnson. But his conservative ideals set the stage for another proponent of small government - Ronald Reagan. And the five-term senator put his state on a rightward path that would span decades, with mavericks like the late Sen. John McCain taking up his mantle.\n\nIn recent years, however, the Grand Canyon State has turned from Sedona red to sunset purple, becoming a must-win swing state for both parties. It tipped narrowly to Joe Biden in 2020 and is now represented in the U.S. Senate by two Democrats.\n\nThat Republican erosion has ignited an existential \"battle for the soul of the GOP,\" says independent Arizona pollster Mike Noble.\n\nIn many ways it's the same battle that's been playing out across the nation ever since Donald Trump burst onto the political scene - but perhaps nowhere as intensely as in Arizona. After so many years of dominance, the GOP's slippage here has led to furious finger-pointing, as well as a sense of disbelief. The Trump wing puts the blame squarely on \"RINO\" politicians, who they say have failed to uphold both conservative ideals and election security. The Republican establishment sees the Trump wing and its unsupported claims of voter fraud as dangerous and likely to be rejected by the state's changing electorate - potentially putting the party on a path to marginalization.\n\nSo far, one side seems to have the upper hand. In August's primaries, four Republican candidates endorsed by former President Trump - for governor, U.S. Senate, state attorney general, and secretary of state - all won handily, despite being significantly outspent by their rivals. All campaigned on a message that the 2020 election was fraudulent - a claim that was tested and refuted by hand counts , forensic tests , and an outside audit . Republican gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake, a charismatic former TV news anchor, has allied herself so closely with Mr. Trump in her campaign that some are now speculating if she wins in November - and polling shows her currently in a dead heat against Democrat Katie Hobbs - the former president could tap her as a potential running mate.\n\nNovember's elections, which both parties are framing as a fight against tyranny, will not only be a pivot point in the GOP identity struggle, but will also bear significantly on control of the U.S. Senate, and in 2024, the presidency.\n\n\"Arizona Republicans are at a crossroads, in a state where they've had unequivocal dominance to now being a battleground,\" says Mr. Noble. While the Trump wing appears ascendant, he adds, the real test will come in November, when candidates face a broader swath of voters. \"Winning the primary is great, but can you win the general election? Because if not, there is going to be a short life span for this movement.\"\n\nTo understand the forces shaping today's GOP, new party activist Tommy Andrews recommends watching \"2000 Mules\" and \"Selection Code.\"\n\nThese films, claiming to show the 2020 election was fraudulent, have been criticized by experts for using misleading data points to draw false conclusions. But they've stoked enormous outrage on the right. And as Mr. Andrews points out, it's not just conservatives who distrust the voting system - other recent films, such as \"Kill Chain: The Cyber War on America's Elections\" and \"Rigged: The Voter Suppression Playbook,\" have highlighted vulnerabilities in America's elections from more left-leaning perspectives.\n\n\"There is tremendous concern over election integrity,\" says Mr. Andrews, a businessman who lives in Scottsdale. A well-to-do city of golf courses and spas bordering Phoenix, Scottsdale is part of vast, politically determinative Maricopa County - site of Arizona's 2020 election recount and audit.\n\nMr. Andrews grew up in a Republican household and has always valued personal responsibility and small government. But he only recently became involved in politics, adding \"precinct captain\" to his list of activities outside work, along with cycling and swimming. He's part of a nationwide grassroots strategy spearheaded by former Trump aide Steve Bannon and Arizona attorney Daniel Schultz to take control of the Republican Party from the bottom up, by filling hundreds of thousands of vacant party committee positions in voting precincts.\n\nVolunteer precinct committee members are the building blocks of the party - they work to get out the vote, set rules, vote on policy positions, and send delegates to the presidential nominating convention.\n\nBefore the 2020 election, Mr. Andrews didn't know what precinct he lived in, let alone what a precinct captain does. But after watching the election results come in with his wife, Kathy, he decided to find out. Both were immediately skeptical when Fox News called Arizona early for Mr. Biden: \"We said, 'That does not feel right.'\"\n\nWhen Mr. Andrews looked into the GOP precinct committee system, he discovered only two out of 15 committee slots in his Del Joya precinct were filled. He had lunch with the chair, got appointed and later elected, and set about finding \"like-minded\" people for the rest of the slots. As he explains from the cool and airy living room of his Spanish-style home, he vetted possible candidates by asking about their views on the 2020 election, border security, pandemic mandates, and their news sources.\n\n\"There is a faction of the Republican Party here that is very unhappy with the establishment,\" says Mr. Andrews. He and his team have now filled all the remaining slots and have already changed the rules to do away with proxy voting on the precinct committee, which previously allowed just a few active committee members to hold sway.\n\nMany issues motivate Mr. Andrews and his fellow conservatives (he uses that label deliberately): open borders, critical race theory in education, gender ideology, the administration's handling of the economy. More recently, he's been upset by the Aug. 8 FBI search of former President Trump's Palm Beach, Florida, estate and President Biden's Sept. 1 speech calling MAGA Republicans a threat to the republic.\n\nBut foremost among concerns is the matter of election integrity. While the GOP-backed audit in Arizona officially reaffirmed President Biden's victory, it also found \"significant issues,\" explains the precinct captain.\n\nMr. Andrews served as an observer and then a worker for the audit conducted by Cyber Ninjas, hired by the Arizona Senate. The firm had no previous election auditing experience, and is no longer in business. Mr. Andrews says he personally saw half a dozen boxes of ballots where tally sheets did not match the contents. He extrapolates from his experience a 20% error rate, and more conservatively from the experience of other workers, a 5% mismatch rate. An error rate of 1% is acceptable under Arizona recount law.\n\nBenny White, a Republican data analyst for the Arizona GOP for more than 10 years, was part of a team of experts who reviewed the Cyber Ninjas data and found its audit to be \"meaningless\" because it was so riddled with problems .\n\nMr. Andrews may have observed tally mismatches, says Mr. White, but generalizing from that is a mistake. Boxes of ballots are not \"widgets coming down an assembly line.\" Each is unique, he explains. \"You have to look at the whole story, not just at one marble and decide that half the marbles are black.\"\n\nBut Mr. Andrews is resolute. This November, he predicts, election integrity concerns and a backlash against President Biden will propel \"a red wave like none you have seen before.\"\n\nMr. Andrews' precinct activism is a \"snapshot\" of what's happening more broadly in Arizona, according to Tyler Montague, a GOP consultant based in Mesa, which is also in Maricopa County. Since 2018, the MAGA wing of the party has been trying \"to purge the party of 'heretics,'\" he says, an effort that's intensified since the last presidential election.\n\nMesa is home to a lot of \"traditional\" Republicans, says Mr. Montague - including many members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, such as himself, who have historical roots there. Many of these Republicans are deeply troubled by the Trump wing's policy positions on issues from trade to immigration - as well as what Mr. Montague describes as its anti-democratic tactics.\n\n\"They are 'burn it all down' people. Institution wreckers,\" he says. Many \"at the top\" know their claims of a stolen election are a lie, he says, and yet they have convinced rank-and-file Republicans to believe it. \"What's more critical than our elections, free and fair elections that inspire confidence?\"\n\nMr. Montague did his missionary work in Chile, and as a Boy Scout leader back in Arizona had several \"Dreamers\" - children whose families brought them to the United States illegally - in his troop. In 2011, he led a successful effort to recall state Senate leader Russell Pearce, the main sponsor of a controversial anti-illegal immigration law.\n\n\"People in my neighborhood like immigrants. They don't like the white nationalist, anti-immigration people,\" he says in a phone interview.\n\nThe grassroots battle within Arizona's GOP has been going on for years. In 2016, Tyler Bowyer was the Republican chairman of Maricopa County, and a staunch Trump supporter. He moved to Mr. Montague's neighborhood and Mr. Montague says he prevented Mr. Bowyer from becoming a precinct committeeman - and from being reelected county chair - by successfully recruiting others to fill the positions.\n\nAnd yet Mr. Bowyer, also a Mormon, has continued to rise in the party. A leader in Turning Point USA, which organizes conservatives on college campuses, he's a loyal ally of Ms. Lake and Arizona GOP Chair Kelli Ward, who has been subpoenaed by the Justice Department over a slate of \"fake electors\" whom Trump supporters planned to send to Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nAll this has made Mr. Montague feel alienated from his own party. And while he says he's still in this for the long run, others like him have \"become disenchanted.\" It didn't help when Ms. Lake, after winning her primary bid, crowed that \"we drove a stake through the heart of the McCain machine.\"\n\nOne friend, Yasser Sanchez, a fellow Mormon and immigration lawyer in Mesa, left the GOP to become an independent. Mr. Sanchez says he recently had lunch with a loyal Republican who won't vote for Ms. Lake and isn't sure what to do.\n\nGOP consultant Sean Noble notes that 60,000 Arizona voters abstained from choosing a presidential candidate in 2020, while selecting candidates for other offices. \"That's a uniquely Trumpian problem.\"\n\nMr. Sanchez, for his part, is not on the fence. \"I wrote out a check to Katie Hobbs, and I called her and said, 'Hey, let's get working. I'm independent.'\" He was hoping the GOP primary would produce a candidate he could vote for. Instead, they've \"all kissed the ring of Trump and the big lie of the stolen election.\" That, he says, is \"dangerous.\"\n\nA Kari Lake ad about border control shows some Barry Goldwater attitude. She strides toward the camera in her dusty cowboy boots and jeans, defiant and direct in her Arizona independence. But there's far more of President Trump - she promises as governor to declare an invasion at the border, finish his wall, blow up drug cartel tunnels, and send in the National Guard to halt illegal immigration. The ad ends with his endorsement.\n\nMs. Lake herself is authoritative, convincing, and completely at ease speaking directly to the camera, which she did for two decades as a news anchor at the local Fox affiliate in Phoenix.\n\n\"She's trying her best to meld themes that were present in the Arizona Republican Party with Goldwater, and again McCain and that maverick streak, with an adherence to the prime tenets of a Trumpist ideology,\" says historian Brooks Simpson, at Arizona State University.\n\nHer maverick streak resonates with Richard Truelick, one of Mr. Andrews' new precinct committeemen who lives across the lake from him in a gated community of active retirees. He's a genial man, formerly a VP with Beatrice Foods, who chats with neighbors when he walks his dogs, Lilly and Max. \"The thing I like about her, she's not a politician. She has no obligation to anyone on anything.\"\n\nMr. Noble, the pollster, says Ms. Lake's immediate task is to unify her party, which he describes as being in a state of \"civil war.\" His research shows stark differences between Trump supporters and \"party\" supporters, primarily over whether the election was stolen (82% of Trump supporters say it was, but only 50% of party supporters do). After that, she needs to reach for the independents - about a third of the electorate, he says. The last two elections underscore this necessity, he points out.\n\nIn 2016, Rep. Martha McSally moved right to win the GOP primary for the U.S. Senate - and stayed there for the general election. She lost to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema (Arizona's first Democratic senator in three decades). In 2020, Ms. McSally again stuck firmly to then-President Trump, and lost her second Senate bid to Democrat Mark Kelly.\n\nIn recent polls, Senator Kelly is comfortably leading his Trump-endorsed opponent, Blake Masters, one of several GOP candidates to whom Senate leader Mitch McConnell may have been referring when he lamented that \"candidate quality\" may prevent Republicans from taking control of the Senate in November.\n\n\"That's the problem with the base-only strategy,\" concludes Mr. Noble.\n\nMs. Lake is one of four GOP swing-state gubernatorial candidates - the others are in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin - who say that Mr. Biden was not fairly elected. Had she been governor at the time, she has said, she would not have certified the 2020 election.\n\nWhile this stance encourages some voters, it scares others - who perceive a militancy in her tone. In a statement after the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago, Ms. Lake described the government as \"tyrants [who] will stop at nothing to silence the Patriots who are working hard to save America,\" adding, \"We will not accept it.\" She later agreed on a podcast with Steven Crowder that Republicans should \"disband the FBI.\"\n\nArizona has always been a conservative state, says Professor Simpson, but Goldwater did not embrace deep-state conspiracy theories, and once considered doing a whistle-stop debate tour across America with President John F. Kennedy. He fought vigorously for conservative values on the economy and foreign policy - but was not nearly as interested in culture war issues such as abortion. The senator was one of three GOP members of Congress who went to the White House to tell Richard Nixon he did not have the votes to survive impeachment. President Nixon resigned the next day.\n\nToday's Arizona Republican Party is far different from that of Goldwater. Demographically, it's got fewer college-educated white people and more Hispanics and working-class voters. Matt Salmon, a former Arizona congressman who pulled out of the GOP race for governor, told the Monitor that when he was first elected in 1994, \"it was all about ideas\" - with Republicans running on the Contract With America. \"Now it's personality-driven.\"\n\nThe state GOP has been \"drifting rightward in more militant ways\" since the 1990s, observes Professor Simpson. \"This isn't something that Donald Trump created. The party's been sliding in this direction for quite some time.\" He cites the nearly 25-year tenure of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio as an example.\n\nThe state's establishment Republican leadership has called for party unity, with former Gov. Jan Brewer invoking Goldwater's concession speech, according to an attendee at a GOP victory rally in Surprise, another Phoenix suburb. Just after the primary, the former governor told The New York Times that Ms. Lake had gone \"so far to the right that I don't know if she can recover,\" and said she hoped she would tell voters the truth about the 2020 election.\n\nBut Latino voters could help Ms. Lake. Mr. Trump made inroads with Hispanics in 2020, and economic conditions could drive them to the polls this time around, says Republican Lea Márquez Peterson, the chairwoman of the Arizona Corporation Commission - and the first Latina elected to a statewide position.\n\nMany Hispanics in Arizona are small-business owners and workers, she explains, and their desire for lower taxes, less regulation, and small government aligns with the Republican Party. Latino businesses acutely feel the effects of inflation and are still reeling from the pandemic and supply chain disruptions, says Ms. Márquez Peterson, who used to head up the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and ran a chain of gas stations and convenience stores.\n\nBut both parties have some work to do. \"I haven't heard a lot of excitement yet,\" she says, lamenting the \"divisiveness\" of the primary. While she did not support Ms. Lake in the primary, she is urging Latinos to vote the GOP ticket. \"I do not want to see key races lost to Democrats.\"\n\nIt's important to remember that every election is a choice, says Mr. Noble, the pollster - a dynamic that could work to Ms. Lake's advantage. He says Democrats made \"a very big mistake\" by nominating Ms. Hobbs, who has declined to debate Ms. Lake and who comes across as \"meek and weak.\" \"From a personality or charisma perspective, those two candidates couldn't be more different,\" he says.\n\nHere's what Ms. Hobbs says Arizona voters are worried about: reproductive freedom, public education, the dwindling Colorado River and ensuing water crisis, and of course, the price of everything - from groceries to housing. But, she says, there's also an overarching concern: democracy.\n\nAs Arizona's secretary of state, Ms. Hobbs was in the thick of the 2020 dispute. She has maintained consistently that the election was fair. The sample hand recount in Maricopa County, for example, found a 100% match with the machine ballot count.\n\nArizonans are tired of endlessly litigating the 2020 election and want leaders who will tackle real issues, says Ms. Hobbs, in an interview at a Phoenix cafe. \"This race is not about Democrats or Republicans; it's about sanity versus chaos.\" She characterizes the November election as a choice between who will move the state forward and who will \"drag us backwards to the Civil War.\"\n\n(The Monitor's request to interview Ms. Lake was turned down. Questions sent to the campaign office, at her spokesperson's direction, went unanswered.)\n\nMs. Hobbs warns about a better-coordinated Republican effort to overturn elections this year and in 2024. The Trump-endorsed candidate vying for her current job, Mark Finchem, says the 2020 election was stolen and has called for Ms. Hobbs' arrest.\n\nAll of this is of grave concern to Daniel Martineau and his wife, Laura Medved, neighbors to Mr. Truelick, one of the new GOP precinct committeemen in Scottsdale. Mr. Martineau plays golf with the Truelicks and they are all friendly, even if their political views differ. The couple, who both work in real estate and will soon be new grandparents, are registered Democrats but consider themselves centrists and have voted on both sides of the aisle. Two years ago, they put out the lone Biden sign in their gated neighborhood.\n\n\"I worry about all future elections,\" says Ms. Medved, at their kitchen table. Her husband warns of \"fascism\" in a GOP that no longer allows dissenting views. But Mr. Martineau is also worried about Ms. Hobbs' ability to pull out a victory. He laments that she lacks the charisma and positive message of a candidate like Barack Obama. He notices his Democratic friends tuning out politics - though his wife says the Supreme Court ruling on abortion could help turn out the vote.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The bill, which is unlikely to pass, underscores Republican preferences for abortion restrictions, say lawmakers.\n\nLoading...\n\nSept. 14, 2022, 12:08 p.m. ET | Washington\n\nUpending the political debate, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham introduced a nationwide abortion ban Tuesday, sending shockwaves through both parties and igniting fresh debate on a fraught issue weeks before the midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.\n\nSenator Graham's own Republican Party leaders did not immediately embrace his abortion ban bill, which would prohibit the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy with rare exceptions, and has almost no chance of becoming law in the Democratic-held Congress. Democrats torched it as an alarming signal of where \"MAGA\" Republicans are headed if they win control of the House and Senate in November.\n\n\"America's got to make some decisions,\" Mr. Graham said at a news conference at the Capitol.\n\nThe South Carolina Republican said that rather than shying away from the Supreme Court's ruling this summer overturning Roe v. Wade's nearly 50-year right to abortion access, Republicans are preparing to fight to make a nationwide abortion ban federal law.\n\n\"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're going nowhere,\" the senator said while flanked by female advocates from the anti-abortion movement. \"We welcome the debate. We welcome the vote in the United States Senate as to what America should look like in 2022.\"\n\nReaction was swift, fierce, and unwavering from Democrats who viewed Graham's legislation as an extreme example of the far-right's hold on the GOP, and as a political gift of self-inflicted pain for Republican candidates now having to answer questions about an abortion ban heading toward the midterm elections.\n\n\"A nationwide abortion ban - that's the contrast between the two parties, plain and simple,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington who is in her own fight for reelection, said Republicans \"want to force\" women to stay pregnant and deliver babies.\n\n\"To anyone who thought they were safe, here is the painful reality,\" she said. \"Republicans are coming for your rights.\"\n\nThe sudden turn of events comes in a razor-tight election season as Republicans hoping to win control of Congress are struggling to recapture momentum, particularly after the Supreme Court's landmark decision sparked deep concerns among some voters, with signs of female voters peeling away from the GOP.\n\nIn a midterm election where the party out of the White House traditionally holds an advantage, even more so this year with President Joe Biden's lackluster approval ratings, the Democrats have regained their own momentum pushing back the GOP candidates in House and Senate races.\n\nTuesday's announcement set up an immediate split screen with Biden and Democrats poised to celebrate their accomplishments in a ceremony at the White House after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and Republicans forced to answer for Mr. Graham's proposed abortion ban.\n\n\"This bill is wildly out of step with what Americans believe,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\n\n\"While President Biden and Vice President Harris are focused on the historic passage of the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, health care, and energy - and to take unprecedented action to address climate change - Republicans in Congress are focused on taking rights away from millions of women,\" Ms. Jean-Pierre said.\n\nMr. Graham's legislation has almost zero chance of becoming law, but it elevates the abortion issue at a time when other Republicans would prefer to focus on inflation, border security, and Biden's leadership.\n\nThe Republican bill would ban abortions nationwide after 15 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of rape, incest, or risk to the physical health of the mother. Mr. Graham said it would put the U.S. on par with many countries in Europe and around the world.\n\nIn particular, Mr. Graham's bill would leave in place state laws that are more restrictive. That provision is notable because many Republicans have argued that the Supreme Court's ruling leaves the abortion issue for the states to decide. But the legislation from the Republicans makes it clear states are only allowed to decide the issue if their abortion bans are more stringent.\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who is one seat away from majority control, declined to embrace Graham's legislation.\n\n\"I think every Republican senator running this year in these contested races has an answer as to how they feel about the issue,\" Mr. McConnell said. He said most GOP senators prefer having the issue dealt with by the states, rather than at the federal level. \"So I leave it up to our candidates who are quite capable of handling this issue to determine for them what their response is.\"\n\nThe Democratic senators most at risk this fall and other Democratic candidates running for Congress appeared eager to fight against Graham's proposed nationwide abortion ban.\n\nSen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, tweeted that Mr. Graham \"and every other anti-choice extremist can take a hike.\"\n\nHer Republican opponent, Adam Laxalt, has during his campaign insisted that abortion is protected in the state constitution, which it may no longer be under this bill.\n\nIn Colorado, another Democrat up for reelection, Sen. Michael Bennet, tweeted: \"A nationwide abortion ban is outrageous.\"\n\nMr. Bennet pledged \"to defend a woman's right to make her own health care decisions, no matter what ZIP code she lives in. We cannot afford to let the Republicans take back the Senate.\"\n\nHis opponent in Colorado, Republican Joe O'Dea, who supports putting abortion access that had been guaranteed under Roe v. Wade into law, agreed, in part: \"A Republican ban is as reckless and tone deaf as is Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer's hostility to considering any compromise on late term abortion, parental notification, or conscience protections for religious hospitals.\"\n\nThe races for control of Congress are tight in the split 50-50 Senate, where one seat determines majority control, and in the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi can afford to lose only a few seats.\n\nMs. Pelosi called Mr. Graham's bill the \"clearest signal of extreme MAGA Republicans' intent to criminalize women's health freedom in all 50 states and arrest doctors for providing basic care. Make no mistake: if Republicans get the chance, they will work to pass laws even more draconian than this bill.\"\n\nRepublican leaders on Capitol Hill tried to hold the party together amid the differences.\n\n\"I think that what it's attempting to do is probably change the conversation a little bit,\" said Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican and second-ranking party leader.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Dean Phillips, who for months urged other top Democrats to run, says he's hoping to prevent a possible loss to Donald Trump next year.\n\nLoading...\n\nOct. 27, 2023, 1:27 p.m. ET | Concord, N.H.\n\nFor months, Dean Phillips has been calling for a Democratic primary challenge to President Joe Biden. He's drawn no public interest from governors, lawmakers, and other would-be alternatives.\n\nThe Minnesota congressman is finally entering the race himself.\n\nThe three-term Minnesota congressman is finally entering the race himself, telling a Friday event outside New Hampshire's statehouse, \"I am today announcing my candidacy for the presidency of the United States of America.\"\n\nMr. Phillips, one of Congress' wealthiest members, has been effusive in his praise for Mr. Biden but also says their party needs younger voices to avoid a nightmare scenario where Donald Trump is reelected next fall.\n\nWhile Mr. Phillips is highly unlikely to beat Mr. Biden, a run would offer a symbolic challenge to national Democrats trying to project the idea that there is no reason to doubt the president's electability - even as many Americans question whether the 80-year-old Mr. Biden should serve another term.\n\nMr. Phillips may also benefit from New Hampshire Democrats angry at Mr. Biden for diluting their state's influence on the 2024 Democratic primary calendar, a change that state party chairman Ray Buckley has warned could create a \"potential embarrassment\" by \"an insurgent candidate, serious or not.\"\n\nIn a campaign video posted online, Mr. Phillips promises to traipse through the snow to greet voters and \"fix the economy,\" a swipe at Mr. Biden who has made job and Gross Domestic Product growth a key of a reelection bid built around the slogan \"Bidenomics.\"\n\nKevin Munoz, a spokesman for Mr. Biden's reelection campaign said the president \"is proud of the historic, unified support he has from across the Democratic Party for his reelection.\"\n\n\"The stakes of next year's election could not be higher for the American people, and the campaign is hard at work mobilizing the winning coalition that President Biden can uniquely bring together to once again beat the MAGA Republicans next November,\" Mr. Munoz said, referring to Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also noted earlier in the week Mr. Phillips' voting record and said, \"We appreciate the congressman's almost 100% support of this president.\" And, though Mr. Biden won't officially run in New Hampshire's primary and will be requiring a write-in campaign. the president is planning to head next week to Mr. Phillips' home state for an official event and fundraiser.\n\nThe president has long cast himself as uniquely qualified to beat Donald Trump again after his 2020 win, and top Democrats have lined up behind him while also positioning themselves for a future primary run.\n\nMoments before Mr. Phillips even announced, Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz sent a Biden reelection campaign fundraising email titled \"Minnesotans love Joe Biden\" and taking an indirect swipe at the congressman, writing that some of his state's residents sometimes \"make political side shows for themselves.\"\n\nMr. Phillips has already missed the deadline to enter Nevada's primary and is little known nationally. But he argues Mr. Biden may not be able to beat Mr. Trump again, telling CBS News that polling suggests \"we're going to be facing an emergency next November.\"\n\n\"I think it's time for a new generation,\" he told the network. \"I think it's time to pass the torch.\"\n\nNew Hampshire primary challenges have a history of wounding incumbent presidents.\n\nIn 1968, another Minnesotan, Democratic Sen. Eugene McCarthy, built his campaign around opposing the Vietnam War and finished second in New Hampshire's primary, helping push President Lyndon Johnson into forgoing a second term. Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy's challenge of President Jimmy Carter and Pat Buchanan's run against President George H.W. Bush both failed, but Mr. Carter and Mr. Bush ultimately lost their reelection bids.\n\nThe state's influence on Democrats was curtailed this year by changes engineered by the DNC at Mr. Biden's behest.\n\nA new Democratic calendar has South Carolina leading off presidential primary voting on Feb. 3 and Nevada going three days later. New Hampshire has refused to comply, citing state laws saying its primary must go first, and plans a primary before South Carolina's. The DNC could, in turn, strip the state of its nominating delegates.\n\nSteve Shurtleff, a former speaker of the New Hampshire House who has distanced himself from Mr. Biden, said he has spoken twice with Mr. Phillips and believed the congressman might appeal to some Democrats and independents who can choose to vote in the primary.\n\n\"I like Biden and have a lot of respect for him. But I'm disappointed that he and the DNC have tried to take away our primary,\" Mr. Shurtleff said. \"It's not that I want to see Joe lose. It's that I want to see our primary win.\"\n\nBut Terry Shumaker, a former DNC member from New Hampshire and longtime Biden supporter, said he expects the president to easily clinch the state as a write-in option. Mr. Shumaker recalled going door to door for Mr. McCarthy in 1968, but doesn't see Mr. Phillips gaining similar traction.\n\n\"I'm not aware of what his message is,\" he said. \"To do well in the New Hampshire primary, you have to have a message.\"\n\nThere are no primary debates scheduled, according to the DNC. The only other Democrat running in the 2024 primary is self-help author Marianne Williamson. Anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced this month that he's running as an independent.\n\nMr. Phillips is heir to his stepfather's Phillips Distilling Company empire, which holds major vodka and schnapps brands. He once served as that company's president but also ran the gelato maker Talenti. His grandmother was the late Pauline Phillips, better known as the advice columnist \"Dear Abby.\"\n\nDriving a gelato truck was a centerpiece of his first House campaign in 2018, when Mr. Phillips unseated five-term Republican Erik Paulsen. While his district in mostly affluent greater Minneapolis has become more Democratic-leaning, Phillips has stressed that he is a moderate focused on his suburban constituents. He is a member of the centrist Problem Solvers Caucus in Congress.\n\nMr. Phillips has been suggesting since the summer that top Democrats challenge Mr. Biden for their party's nomination but has been ignored by governors and other top elected officials. He told CBS in the interview on Friday that he hoped his announcing would encourage other primary challengers saying of competition \"we need it.\"\n\nChallenging his party's leadership isn't new for Mr. Phillips. When he first got to Congress, he spoke of the need for a \"new generation\" of Democrats to replace then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and was frustrated when no one emerged. He later praised Ms. Pelosi as \"one of the most successful speakers of all time.\"\n\nStill, he's not the only one voicing concerns now. An AP-NORC poll released in August found that the top words associated with Mr. Biden were \"old\" and \"confused.\" Nearly 70% of Democrats and 77% of U.S. adults said they thought Mr. Biden was too old to be effective for four more years. The same poll found that respondents most frequently described Mr. Trump as \"corrupt\" and \"dishonest.\"\n\nLeslie Blanding, a retired teacher and Democrat from Bow, New Hampshire, said she did not know Mr. Phillips but was \"thoroughly conflicted\" over whether Mr. Biden should face a primary challenger.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\n\"I think Biden is too old. I think from the outset, he should've been looking to groom someone to succeed him, and he didn't do that,\" said Ms. Blanding. \"But I think he seems to be the only one positioned to have a strong chance of defeating Trump or whomever.\"\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Evan ... More Vucci)\n\nBiden used the phrase \"MAGA Republicans\" over and over to refer to former President Donald Trump and his hardline supporters, calling them dangerous authoritarians hell-bent on overthrowing democracy, even if that means resorting to violence.\n\nHe also called out Trump supporters for what he called \"blind loyalty to a single leader,\" remarking that \"too much of what is happening in our country today is not normal.\"\n\nBut he stressed that he believes the country can overcome what he called the \"fear, division and darkness\" taking hold by embracing \"the willingness to see each other not as enemies but as fellow Americans.\"\n\nBiden spoke for roughly 20 minutes outside Independence Hall, but protesters with a bullhorn made noise throughout, which the president remarked about on multiple occasions.\n\nMuch of it was faint to television audiences, but microphones did pick up chants of \"let's go Brandon\" several times, a popular stand in for the more vulgar \"f-- Joe Biden.\"\n\nThe president acknowledged the protesters to seemingly bolster his point about democracies, saying \"they're entitled to be outrageous-this is a democracy.\"\n\n\"Throughout our history, Americans have often made the greatest progress coming out of some of our darkest moments, like you're hearing from that bullhorn,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden officials spent days hyping up his primetime speech in Philadelphia, naming the address the \"battle for the soul of the nation.\" The speech is the second from Biden in Pennsylvania in just over a week, and comes at a time of surging approval ratings for the president as campaign season enters its final stretch ahead of the November midterms. Biden emphatically denounced the Trump wing of the GOP in both addresses, using last week's speech to slam Republicans who defend January 6 rioters as anti-police.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) gave his own speech prior to Biden's, where he blasted the president as someone who has \"chosen to divide, demean and disparage his fellow Americans.\" He called on Biden to apologize for his recent remark equating \"MAGA\" beliefs with \"semi-fascism.\"\n\nMcCarthy calls on Biden to apologize for 'semi-fascism' remark (The Hill)\n\nBiden outlines gun crime plan, denounces GOP over Jan. 6 in Pennsylvania speech (CBS News)\n\nBiden's Approval Rating Surges After Series Of Unexpected Wins (Forbes)"

More the White House June 16, 2022 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nThe independent Office of Special Counsel, federal investigative and prosecutorial agency tasked with enforcing several federal statutes, said that Jean-Pierre violated the Hatch Act, which limits government officials from participating in activities or speech deemed campaign-related or partisan, when she publicly criticized Republicans' \"hardcore MAGA\" budget in June, NBC News reported.\n\nMeanwhile, deputy press secretary Andrew Bates allegedly violated the Hatch Act by describing Republican fiscal policies as a \"MAGA tax welfare\" in a memo.\n\n\"MAGA,\" or \"make America great again,\" was former President Donald Trump's campaign slogan that has become synonymous with a far-right sect of the Republican party.\n\nForbes has reached out to the OSC for confirmation.\n\nThis was not the first time the OSC has cited Jean-Pierre and the White House over the Hatch Act. Just a week before these alleged violations, the OSC determined that Jean-Pierre was in violation of the act when she repeatedly described conservative political candidates as \"mega MAGA Republicans\" in the lead-up to the 2022 midterm elections. The office issued guidance that advised federal employees that they are forbidden from using \"Make America Great Again\" or \"MAGA\"-as well as other political slogans associated with other candidates.\n\nForbes has reached out to the White House for comment, and has not yet heard back. But in the past, when faced with previous accusations, officials have defended their use of the term \"MAGA,\" with Jean-Pierre saying in June, \"If you look at the archived Trump White House website, it contains about 2,000-nearly 2,000 uses of 'MAGA' to describe policies and official agendas.\" She continued: \"Congressional Republicans have also used 'MAGA' to refer to policies and official agenda frequently, for years now, even, clearly, before we entered the administration.\"\n\nThe Hatch Act was passed in 1939 and meant to prevent candidates, particularly incumbent candidates, from using employees with federal salaries, as well as federal resources to further their own political ambitions. In addition to limiting what federal employees can do, it also prevents elected officials from using government buildings for campaign events, it forbids anyone from bribing citizens for their vote and it outlaws federal funds from being used for campaign activities.\n\nThe White House ran afoul of the Hatch Act after initial warning, government watchdog says (NBC News)"

      "text": "Biden Blames Trump For Senate Border Bill's Collapse As GOP Support Evaporates: 'They're Afraid Of Donald Trump'\n\nPresident Joe Biden placed the blame squarely on former President Donald Trump for blocking Senate legislation that would implement stricter border controls and provide more aid to Ukraine, as Trump has warned the bill-which was negotiated by members of both parties-would be a \"gift\" to Democrats in an election year when immigration is a top campaign issue.\n\nUS President Joe Biden speaks in the State Dining Room of the White House on February 6, 2024 in ... More Washington, DC. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThere is a \"simple reason\" the bill is unlikely to move forward in the Senate: \"Donald Trump,\" Biden said in a White House address on Tuesday, urging Congress to approve the $118 billion package that would provide $60 billion in funding for Ukraine amid its war with Russia and $14 billion in assistance for Israel.\n\nBiden said supporting the bill is \"standing up to Putin\" and that \"opposing the bill is playing into his hand,\" warning that \"if we don't stop Putin's appetite for power\" he will expand his attacks to countries outside of Ukraine, and potentially NATO allies.\n\nBiden accused Trump of working the phones since the bill debuted to \"threaten . . . and try to intimidate\" Republicans to tank the legislation in a bid to \"weaponize this issue.\"\n\nRepublicans \"owe it to the American people to show some spine\" and move forward with passing the bill, despite Trump's efforts, Biden said.\n\nBiden reiterated his stance that the bill is the \"toughest and fairest\" border policy in years, laying out the additional mechanisms included in the legislation, including funding for additional border agents, fentanyl-detection machines and immigration judges, and a speedier asylum process.\n\n\"History is watching. Failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will never be forgotten. The position of the MAGA Republicans can be characterized by the New York Times headline . . . 'Trump First. Putin Second. America Third.' That cannot pertain,\" Biden said, quoting the headline of a Tuesday column by the Times' Thomas Friedman.\n\nSenate negotiators unveiled the $118 billion joint border security-Ukraine aid package Sunday, following months of negotiations as Republicans demanded stricter border controls in exchange for their support for additional Ukraine assistance. The legislation would require Biden to restrict asylum claims if border crossings exceed an average of 5,000 per day, among other measures. The bill began to unravel within hours as Trump vied to torpedo the effort, warning that it could be seen as a victory for Biden in an election year as he and his GOP allies have blamed the president's policies for a surge in immigration during his tenure. Trump has instead argued that Biden has the ability to \"shut down\" the border now and that foreign aid should not be tied to a border deal, despite Republicans insisting for months that it should. Republican Senate leaders, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has said publicly he backs the deal, have begun to acknowledge in recent days that it would be unwise to contest Trump's wishes, throwing the long-awaited deal into limbo. House Republican leaders, meanwhile, have vowed to block the legislation, echoing Trump's talking points and arguing it fails to re-implement Trump-era immigration policies, including Title 42, the pandemic-era policy that allowed border agents to reject migrants under the public health emergency, and \"Remain in Mexico,\" which required asylum seekers to wait out their cases south of the border."

      "text": "Republicans Launch Eerie AI-Generated Attack Ad On Biden\n\nThe Republican National Committee debuted an apocalyptic foreshadowing of a second Biden-Harris term moments after President Joe Biden announced his reelection campaign on Tuesday in a video rebuttal generated entirely by artificial intelligence-the latest sign that computer-generated content could shift the political campaign landscape.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on the South Lawn of the White House on April ... More 8, 2022, in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe video shows AI-generated images of Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris winning on election night next year, followed by simulated scenes of explosions in Taiwan, police in tactical gear lining the streets of San Francisco, migrants flooding the southern border and Wall Street buildings abandoned.\n\nPredictive newscasts narrate in the background: \"Who's in charge here? It feels like the train is coming off the tracks.\"\n\nAn RNC spokesperson told Axios the video was produced entirely through artificial intelligence, which Democrats and Republicans have both expressed plans to leverage during the 2024 election cycle in an effort to streamline operations, though the software has raised concerns about malicious fake content duping voters and campaign staffers.\n\nIn response to the video, Democratic National Committee Executive Director Sam Cornale suggested the RNC's use of AI was an act of desperation. \"When your operative class has been decimated, and you're following MAGA Republicans off a cliff, I suppose you have no choice but to ask AI to help,\" he tweeted Tuesday.\n\nRNC Chair Ronna McDaniel called Biden \"so out of touch\" in a statement warning that \"inflation will continue to skyrocket, crime rates will rise, more fentanyl will cross our open borders, children will continue to be left behind, and American families will be worse off\" if he is reelected.\n\nCampaigns reported using artificial intelligence to identify fundraising audiences during the midterm election, but in recent months, following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November, campaigns have been testing chatbots to generate written content, including statements from candidates, ads and emails, the New York Times reported . But there are concerns that the software could be used to mislead the public via convincing voice messages that sound like candidates speaking directly to voters or chatbots posing as voters providing false information to campaigns, the Times noted. AI-generated parodies of prominent political figures have gone viral in recent months. Fake images of Trump being arrested and wearing prison garb were widely shared on social media ahead of Trump's indictment in Manhattan Criminal Court. Trump also shared a faux image of himself kneeling in prayer on Truth Social in March.\n\nWhile AI-generated content has entered a new era of legitimacy, the use of deepfake videos, audios and images has been around for years. A fake video of former President Barack Obama calling Trump a \"total and complete dipshit\" circulated in 2018, and in 2004, an altered image of then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry and actress Jane Fonda, depicting them at an anti-war protest in the 1970s, was widely shared online.\n\nEven Trump Shared A Fake AI Image Of Himself: Here's How To Spot A Deepfake (Forbes)\n\nBiden Announces 2024 Reelection Campaign (Forbes)"

      "text": "What To Know About Trump's Relationship With John Thune-Including Rocky Past\n\nSen. John Thune, R-S.D., was elected by Republicans Wednesday to be the party's first new Senate leader in nearly two decades-despite some MAGA Republicans pushing for a more fervent supporter of the president-elect as opposed to Thune, who endorsed Donald Trump this cycle but broke with him in the past.\n\nSen. John Thune (R-SD) speaks after being elected Senate Majority Leader for the 119th Congress ... More following the Senate Republican leadership elections at the U.S. Capitol on November 13, 2024 in Washington, DC.\n\nThune and Trump's relationship began in 2016 when-after endorsing him for president months earlier-Thune became the first Republican leader to call on Trump to withdraw from the presidential race after the infamous Access Hollywood tape was made public.\n\nShortly after calling on Trump to leave the race and give the nomination to then-vice presidential candidate Mike Pence, Thune said he would still \"support the nominee of our party ... but he's got a lot of work to do, I think, if he's going to have any hope of winning this election.\"\n\nThe pair hit another road bump in 2020 when Trump maintained the election was stolen, but Thune encouraged people to \"move on\" and accept the outcome.\n\nThune also said any attempt by House conservatives to challenge the results of the Electoral College would \"go down like a shot dog\"-the comments drew ire from Trump, who said on Twitter Thune's \"political career (is) over!!!\" and \"South Dakota doesn't like weakness.\"\n\nTrump later encouraged South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to run against Thune-who he called a \"RINO,\" or Republican in name only-when he was up for reelection in 2022 (Noem had previously said Thune \"is a friend of mine, and I will not be challenging him.\")\n\nThune did not vote to convict Trump in either of his impeachment trials, but issued a harsh statement after the second one stating his vote to acquit Trump was not \"an exoneration for his conduct on\" Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nTrump did not endorse Thune during his reelection bid in 2022 and after Thune won, he said the broad Republican losses were evidence the party couldn't rely on Trump, saying \"You can't have a party that's built around one person's personality.\"\n\nThis election season, Thune initially endorsed Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., for president but later backed Trump, saying in February \"I support former President Trump's campaign to win the presidency, and I intend to do everything I can to see that he has a Republican majority in the Senate working with him to restore American strength at home and abroad.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Thune met with Trump in March at Mar-a-Lago to defuse tension, and Thune told the Journal the pair has \"an understanding, and it's professional,\" adding: \"we're going to need to work together for the good of the country.\"\n\nAfter being elected Wednesday, Thune released a statement saying he was \"extremely honored\" and that the \"Republican team is united behind President Trump's agenda.\"\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here .\n\n\"What former President Trump did to undermine faith in our election system and disrupt the peaceful transfer of power is inexcusable,\" Thune said in the Feb. 13, 2021 statement released after Trump's second impeachment trial.\n\nTrump did not endorse a senator in the election for the new Republican leader, but said in a post on Truth Social the next leader \"must agree to allow recess appointments,\" or temporary appointments made by the president without Senate approval when it's in recess.\n\nThune defeated Florida's Sen. Rick Scott-a right-wing firebrand who received endorsements from Trump allies Elon Musk and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., but was knocked out in the first vote-and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. Thune was first elected to the Senate in 2004 and has held the No. 2 Senate Republican position of whip since 2019. Thune will replace Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a key ally of his who is retiring as the party's Senate leader after 18 years. Thune's victory comes as Republicans are likely to secure a \"trifecta\" by taking control of the presidency, House and Senate-though control of the House has not yet been called-which will likely make it easier for Republicans to pass their agenda.\n\n29. That's how many votes Thune got from Senate Republicans to secure the position. In the first vote, he received 23 votes, Cornyn received 15 and Scott received 13. The position was decided in two rounds of voting.\n\nTrump's comments on Thune's election. Trump had not congratulated him or weighed in publicly as of mid-Wednesday afternoon, but Thune said in a tweet that he had spoken to Trump and \"Senate Republicans are excited and ready to get to work implementing President Trump's agenda on behalf of the American people.\"\n\nSome MAGA personalities have criticized Thune's election. Far-right commentator Charlie Kirk said in a tweet Thune \"has a short window to show us he will support President Trump, fill his cabinet, confirm his judges, and pass his agenda ... If he doesn't, we will work to remove him.\" Benny Johnson, another MAGA commentator, criticized the secret voting process on X , formerly known as Twitter, asking Thune why the vote had to be secret and why Trump wasn't invited to speak before it.\n\nOne Community.

      "text": "Biden Attacks GOP Fiscal Policies As 'Chaos And Catastrophe' In First Economic Speech Of 2023\n\nPresident Joe Biden accused \"extreme MAGA Republicans\" of backing policies that threaten to drive up inflation and taxes for the middle class-and highlighted his own economic record-in a speech on Thursday, hours after new fourth quarter figures showed the economy grew at a faster-than-expected pace.\n\nUS President Joe Biden speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on January ... More 25, 2023. (Photo by Andrew CABALLERO-REYNOLDS / AFP) (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nDuring a speech at a steamfitters union hall in Springfield, Virginia, Biden took aim at Republican plans he said would raise gas prices, cut taxes for billionaires, slash Social Security and Medicare and raise taxes for the middle class, while vowing to veto the proposals if they passed Congress.\n\nBiden specifically focused on the Republican-backed Fair Tax Act, which would impose a 30% national sales tax and eliminate most other taxes, warning that it would effectively \"raise taxes on working and middle class people\" (the legislation faces long odds of passing, as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has said he opposes it and the Democrat-controlled Senate is unlikely to pass it).\n\nDemocrats claim GOP-backed legislation that limits the federal government's ability to sell oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would raise gas prices, and have raised concerns that Republicans will demand cuts to Medicare and Social Security in debt ceiling negotiations (though McCarthy has reportedly agreed to preserve those two programs).\n\nLinking the GOP to former President Donald Trump-whose four years in office marked a steeper increase in the national debt than under any other president, Biden said-the president said \"30% to 40%\" of Republicans are \"MAGA Republicans\" who are \"determined to be the party of chaos and catastrophe.\"\n\nBiden cited several hallmark pieces of economic legislation passed during his time in office, including the American Rescue Plan Act that provided $1.9 trillion designed to help the economy recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Inflation Reduction Act aimed at reducing the federal deficit, lowering drug prices and reducing carbon emissions, among other initiatives.\n\nThe president also highlighted what he said was the \"strongest years of job growth ever in American history\" during his first two years in office: \"We've created nearly 11 million jobs, including 75,000 manufacturing jobs,\" he said.\n\nThe falling unemployment under Biden and uptick in the federal deficit under Trump are partially due to the coronavirus pandemic, however: The federal government's debt grew significantly in 2020 due to Covid-19 relief programs, while job growth surged during Biden's tenure as the unemployment rate fell to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe economy has faced a mixed picture over the past year: Unemployment is low, but inflation hit a nearly 40-year peak last year and is still unusually high , and Americans' assessment of the economy remains low, according to Gallup's Economic Confidence Index , which stands at -39 as of December. New economic figures released Thursday show the nation's GDP rose 2.9%, a larger-than-expected margin, in the fourth quarter of last year, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday. However, amid rising layoffs in some industries, a dip in household spending and the Federal Reserve's campaign to stem inflation by raising interest rates, some experts warn the economy could begin to decline again this quarter.\n\n\"I'm not sure, and I mean it sincerely, the news could have been any better. Economic growth is up, stronger than experts expected, at 2.9%,\" Biden said. \"Jobs are the highest number in American history and wages are up, and they're going faster than inflation. Over the past six months, inflation has gone down every month.\"\n\nThursday's address was Biden's first major economic speech of the year and comes as Democrats have ratcheted up their attacks on GOP fiscal policies. In a press conference on Wednesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) railed against the Fair Tax Act. The Democratic leaders claim it would raise taxes for 90% of Americans and lower them for top earners. Meanwhile, negotiations are underway about raising the federal debt ceiling, which reached its $31.4 trillion cap last week and must be adjusted by mid-year to prevent the government from defaulting on its debt, a scenario that would bring severe economic consequences. Republicans are calling for spending cuts in exchange for agreeing to raise the debt ceiling, but the White House has said it refuses to negotiate.\n\nThe House is expected to consider legislation on Thursday that would prohibit the energy department from exporting oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve until the Department of Energy develops a plan to increase fossil fuel production on federal lands. The House passed a bill earlier this month that would prohibit the energy department from selling crude from the stockpile to Chinese-linked firms with bipartisan support. The Biden Administration has been releasing oil from the reserve for sale to the highest bidder on the global market, at least one of which has been a Chinese-linked firm. Democrats are against the bill up for consideration on Thursday, however, and it has a slim chance of passing the Democrat-controlled Senate and being signed into law by Biden. The White House on Wednesday warned it would \"cause oil shortages and higher gas prices in times of crisis.\"\n\nNew U.S. House Targets China: 2nd Bill Prohibits Oil Sales, As Beijing Becomes A Target (Forbes)\n\nDemocrats Ridicule GOP's Proposal To Eliminate Most Taxes And The IRS - And Create One National Sales Tax Instead (Forbes)"

More 6, 2021 in Washington, DC.\n\nThe poll, conducted August 29-31 among 2,085 U.S. adults, found 64% of respondents think political violence in the U.S. will increase over the next few years, up from 57% in December 2021 and 51% in January 2021.\n\nThat includes 72% of people who identify as liberal, 58% of moderates and 68% of conservatives, and respondents who voted for President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump in 2020 were equally as likely to predict future violence (70% of each said it will increase).\n\nA 54% majority said the U.S. will be \"less of a democracy\" for the next generation than it is now, while 27% say it will be the same as now and 19% predicted it will be more of a democracy.\n\nRepublicans were actually far more likely than Democrats to predict democracy would backslide, with 64% of Republicans and 71% of Trump voters believing it will be less of a democracy versus 44% of Democrats and 45% of Biden voters.\n\nAn 86% majority believe using force and violence is \"always unacceptable\" as a method to achieve political goals.\n\nAn 80% majority believe the U.S. is more divided today than it was during their parents' generation and the same percentage feel the overall civility in American politics has gotten worse, and 67% are pessimistic that Americans with different political beliefs \"can still come together and work out their differences.\"\n\nA 57% majority \"strongly oppose\" the U.S. being divided into two \"red\" and \"blue\" countries despite the nation's political divisions and only 7% strongly favor it. Republicans were more likely to be open to breaking the country up, with 49% of Republicans and 48% of conservatives strongly opposing it versus 62% of liberals and Democrats.\n\nThe poll was released days after Biden railed against \"MAGA Republicans\" who back Trump in a speech on September 1, saying they \"represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.\" The CBS poll, conducted before Biden's speech, found 19% self-identified as \"part of the MAGA movement.\"\n\nThe CBS poll follows other polling suggesting political violence could be on the rise, with a survey released in July from the Violence Prevention Research Program finding 20.5% of respondents believed political violence was at least \"sometimes justified.\" In his speech on Thursday, Biden pointed to MAGA Republicans' continued refusal to accept the 2020 election results and installation of election deniers into positions of power as a threat to democracy, arguing they view the 2020 election and the violence on January 6 \"as preparation for the 2022 and 2024 elections.\" A previous CBS News poll released over the weekend found most voters believe there will be issues with the next election that could harm democracy, with a 67% majority believing it's at least somewhat likely election officials will refuse to certify results. Among Republicans, a majority had concerns about potential voter fraud or ineligible voters casting ballots, which may be driving their concerns about the future of democracy, though there is no evidence to support claims of widespread voter fraud in 2020 and election fraud is exceedingly rare.\n\nAmericans increasingly concerned about political violence - CBS News poll (CBS News)\n\nBiden Castigates MAGA Republicans In Scathing Speech Against Trumpism (Forbes)\n\nSurvey Looks at Acceptance of Political Violence in U.S. (New York Times)"

      "text": "White House Leans Into Accusing GOP Of 'Defunding' Police By Attacking Push To Slash ATF\n\nThe White House claimed Thursday the GOP is seeking cuts to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that would empower Mexican drug cartels and thwart the administration's efforts to \"block the flow of fentanyl into the United States,\" marking Democrats' latest effort to flip the script on Republicans by claiming they want to \"defund\" law enforcement.\n\nUS Attorney General Merrick Garland (L) and ATF Director Steven M. Dettelbach (R) arrive for a ... More briefing on the progress of the launch of the Department's regional firearms trafficking strike forces to address violent crime, at the Department of Justice in Washington, DC, on July 20, 2022. (Photo by OLIVER CONTRERAS/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWhite House spokesperson Andrew Bates accused \"MAGA Republicans in Congress\" of \"trying to defund and abolish the ATF,\" in a statement that alleged \"assault weapons purchased in the United States are arming drug cartels and enabling them to outgun law enforcement.\"\n\nBates also attacked Republicans for \"obstructing\" President Joe Biden's proposed ban on assault weapons, which he has repeatedly called for in the wake of mass shootings but has long been stalled in Congress.\n\nThe statement builds on Democrats' push to pin the left-leaning \"defund the police\" slogan, which circulated among some activist circles in 2020 but which the Democratic Party has largely distanced itself from, on Republican attacks on the various law enforcement probes into former President Donald Trump's conduct.\n\nBates' comments on Thursday came one day after Trump called on Congress to \"defund the DOJ and the FBI until they come to their senses,\" following his historic arraignment and Tuesday speech where he attacked the U.S. justice system, alleging it is engaged in a broad and unwarranted effort to hurt his chances of being re-elected president.\n\n70%. That's the share of firearms seized by Mexican law enforcement that originate in the U.S., according to March 2021 stats from the Government Accountability Office.\n\nFor years, Republicans and gun rights activists have targeted the ATF, which investigates federal firearm offenses, in their push to loosen gun regulations. The GOP-led House Committee on Oversight and Accountability held a hearing last month titled \"ATF's Assault on the Second Amendment: When is Enough Enough?\" and right-wing lawmakers, including Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.) have sponsored legislation to abolish the agency. Republicans effectively blocked the ATF from appointing a permanent director for more than seven years until Biden's nominee, former U.S. attorney Steve Dettelbach, was confirmed last year in a mostly party-line vote.\n\n\"I hope that we can act to put an end to this ATF overreach, and I would suggest that the most effective approach is to reduce funding or, better still, eliminate all funding. And even better, eliminate this woke, weaponized agency,\" Rep. Andy Biggs, (R-Ariz.) said at last month's Oversight and Accountability hearing.\n\nRepublicans recently took aim at a new ATF rule that requires a license to own pistols with stabilizing braces like the one used by the Colorado gunman who killed 10 people inside of a Boulder supermarket in March 2021. Republican Reps. Andrew Clyde (Ga.) and Richard Hudson (N.C.) introduced a resolution last month to conduct a congressional review that could upend the rule, though any measure would likely fail in the Democratic-controlled Senate. The National Rifle Association-which has successfully lobbied Congress over the years to limit the ATF's budget and authority-has also filed a lawsuit challenging the new rule, claiming it \"demonstrates a clear abuse of power by the ATF,\" National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action Jason Ouimet said in a statement . ATF is also responsible for enforcing a Biden Administration rule that regulates \"ghost guns,\" or gun kits that can be assembled at home, a move opposed by some Republicans .\n\nBiden is seeking a 7.4% increase in ATF funding in his fiscal year 2024 budget proposal released last month. Republican gun-rights proponents in Congress have expressed plans to block the additional funding, however. \"So I don't see them getting an increase in any way,\" Clyde told Roll Call . Republicans are expected to release their counter-proposal to Biden's budget in the coming months. Congress needs to pass a new budget before the current spending plan expires at the conclusion of the current fiscal year at the end of September.\n\nThe outcome of the various law enforcement investigations into Trump's conduct. He pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records on Tuesday in connection with a hush-money scheme to silence negative stories about him ahead of the 2016 presidential election, according to Manhattan prosecutors. He is also facing Justice Department investigations into his role in the leadup to the January 6 Capitol riots and his handling of classified documents after leaving office. Both probes have ramped up in recent months. Justice Department investigators have reportedly gathered evidence to show Trump obstructed its classified documents probe. Former Vice President Mike Pence also said Wednesday he will not fight a judge's order for him to testify before a grand jury in its January 6 investigation.\n\nTrump Wants To 'Defund' FBI, DOJ After Historic Arraignment-Echoing Biden Attacks (Forbes)\n\nRepublicans Launch House Committee To Investigate FBI-Including Agency's Handling Of Trump (Forbes)\n\nWhite House Pulls Chipman's ATF Nomination In Win For GOP, Gun Groups (Forbes)"

He joined Newsweek in February 2018 after spending several years working at the International Business Times U.K., where he predominantly reported on crime, politics and current affairs. Prior to this, he worked as a freelance copywriter after graduating from the University of Sunderland in 2010. Languages: English. Email: e.palmer@newsweek.com.\n\nBased on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nTech billionaire Elon Musk has been branded the de-facto leader of the MAGA Republican Party by critics over what they see as his apparent influence over President-elect Donald Trump amid spending bill negotiations.\n\nOne expert told Newsweek that \" Republican power appears to lie with Musk,\" after the mogul helped scrap bipartisan spending legislation that would have prevented a looming government shutdown. Jonah Goldberg, editor-in-chief of conservative online magazine The Dispatch, said Musk's role in sinking a continuing resolution bill marked the first time Trump has been \"out MAGA'd\" by someone else.\n\nNewsweek has contacted Trump's transition team and Musk's press office for comment via email outside regular working hours.\n\nMusk's power within MAGA circles has been rising in recent months. He spent around $250 million on Trump's 2024 election campaign and is set to join the next administration in the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nA number of Democrats have criticized what they see as the power Musk now wields amid a scramble to pass a spending bill before the end of Friday to prevent a government shutdown. A Trump-backed second bill was voted down by the Hous e on Thursday.\n\nSeveral Democratic figures said Musk is the real \"president\" after Trump appeared to follow his lead in denouncing the original bipartisan continuing resolution.\n\nMusk posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter , which he owns, urging lawmakers to reject the bill and suggesting that anyone who supported it should be voted out of office.\n\nTrump soon issued a similar objection, calling for a rise in the debt limit to be added and warning that any Republican who backs the bill should face a primary challenge.\n\nMusk continued to post dozens of messages condemning the original spending plan, seemingly dooming its chances of passage and increasing the likelihood of a government shutdown.\n\nAfter the bill was torpedoed, Goldberg, who is also a Los Angeles Times opinion columnist, told CNN: \"This is the first time that Donald Trump has been out populist, out MAGA'd by somebody else.\n\n\"Musk grabbed the spotlight on social media. He drove the agenda with Trump's base in a way that has never happened before.\n\n\"Marjorie Taylor Greene couldn't do that. Matt Gaetz couldn't do that. None of them could do that. All of their power derived from Trump. Even Tucker [Carlson] couldn't do that,\" Goldberg added. \"This is the first time somebody said, 'Shine the spotlight on me, I'm driving the agenda,' and it worked. I can't imagine Trump is going to love that.\"\n\nKaroline Leavitt, Trump's incoming White House press secretary, rejected the idea that Musk essentially now controls the GOP.\n\n\"As soon as President Trump released his official stance on the CR [continuing resolution], Republicans on Capitol Hill echoed his point of view,\" she told Business Insider. \"President Trump is the leader of the Republican Party. Full stop.\"\n\nTrump denied that Musk influenced his objection to the bill, saying the pair did not discuss it before Musk posted his objections on X.\n\n\"I told him that if he agrees with me, he could put out a statement,\" Trump told NBC News. \"He's looking at things from a cost standpoint.\"\n\nA second bill, hastily put together by House Speaker Mike Johnson and other congressional leaders, was voted down in a 174-235-1 vote in the House on Thursday, with 38 Republicans joining nearly every Democrat in rejecting the deal.\n\nAhead of the vote, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters at the Capitol: \"The Musk-Johnson proposal is not serious. It's laughable. Extreme MAGA Republicans are driving us to a government shutdown.\"\n\nMusk dismissed the remarks and blamed Democrats for the bill's failure.\n\n\"A super fair & simple bill was put to a vote and only 2 Democrats in Congress were in favor. Therefore, responsibility for the shutdown rests squarely on the shoulders of Jeffries,\" Musk posted.\n\nIn another sign of Musk's growing influence, multiple GOP lawmakers have pushed a far-fetched idea that Musk could replace Mike Johnson as the next House speaker.\n\nThere is nothing in the Constitution that says the role must be filled by a member of Congress or someone born in the U.S. Musk was born in South Africa and acquired U.S. citizenship in 2002.\n\nA Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday showed that a large majority of Republicans-81 percent-support Musk playing a prominent role in the Trump administration.\n\nMark Shanahan, associate professor of political engagement at the U.K.'s University of Surrey, told Newsweek: \"Elon Musk holds no governmental title. He has been elected to nothing and currently has no formal role in the GOP. But at the moment, he appears to be the most powerful voice in U.S. politics, having used his X platform to shout down House Republicans who were set to agree to a government funding bill just a couple of days ago.\n\n\"What's fascinating is that Musk took the lead in opposing Speaker Mike Johnson's plans before Donald Trump, rather belatedly, reached the same page. At this moment, Republican power appears to lie with Musk. Trump cannot abide any rivals for public attention-and the very last thing he'll tolerate is one with real political power. So, while 'Speaker Musk' may have a pleasing ring for some House Republicans, it won't happen while Trump remains the leading light of the GOP. Their alliance of convenience may not last long past January 20.\"\n\nThe House Judiciary Democrats account posted on X: \"The fact that Trump's team felt the need to respond to the claim that Elon Musk is the new leader of the GOP is telling. The rift between Trump and the First Buddy has started.\"\n\nFox News Senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy on Thursday : \"Elon Musk [is] the center of the universe on Capitol Hill in a way that nobody has ever seen. I get that every Christmas we have these government shutdown fights, and usually, they just complain about it and then vote for it anyway. But there has never been an unelected official like Elon Musk at the center of it like this.\"\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) told CNN : \"The Republicans can't come together because they can't stick to the deal they originally negotiated. This is on them, and it really is a reminder of who now runs the Republican Party-and it's Musk.\"\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on X: \"Elon Musk ordered his puppet President-elect and House Republicans to break the bipartisan agreement reached to keep the government open. House Republicans are abdicating their responsibility to the American people and siding with billionaires and special interests.\"\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky (R-KY) posted on X: \"The Speaker of the House need not be a member of Congress... Nothing would disrupt the swamp more than electing Elon Musk.\"\n\nIf no spending bill agreement is reached by the end of Friday, the government will shut down starting Saturday.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nEwan Palmer is a Newsweek News Reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on US politics, and Florida news.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nMAGA Republicans secured a crucial victory in their battle to control the GOP after Senator Mitch McConnell this week announced plans to step down from his leadership position.\n\nMcConnell, the Kentucky Republican who serves as Senate minority leader, said Wednesday he intends to step down from his role in November, sparking celebrations from conservatives closely aligned with former President Donald Trump . These so-called \"MAGA Republicans\" have sought to expand their power in the GOP against more traditional conservatives such as McConnell, who in recent years emerged as one of the most powerful conservative Trump critics.\n\nMcConnell's stepping down will give Trump-aligned conservatives an opportunity to elect someone more in line with the former president's vision as his successor . They could potentially expand their power in the Senate, which has generally been more resistant to Trump's influence compared to the House of Representatives.\n\nNewsweek reached out to McConnell's office for comment via email.\n\nHis announcement is the latest blow to the more traditionally conservative wing of the Republican Party. Several more moderate Republicans have retired in recent years, and only a handful may remain after the elections later this year.\n\nWhile McConnell often aligned with Trump on key policies such as immigration and the economy, he was also viewed at times as a key leader willing to defy the former president on some issues.\n\nMcConnell broke with Trump over his claims the 2020 election was stolen from him via widespread fraud. McConnell said \"very little\" election fraud occurs in the U.S. while speaking to reporters in 2022, knocking Trump for \"trying to prevent the orderly transfer of power\" after his defeat.\n\nEarlier this year, McConnell said Trump \"provoked\" the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol when a group of the then-president's supporters violently protested the election results.\n\nMcConnell's exit as Republican leader isn't the only loss for Republicans in November.\n\nUtah Senator Mitt Romney , who was the GOP's 2012 presidential nominee, is not running for reelection this year. Romney is among Trump's most vocal critics following January 6 and was one of the seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump after his 2021 impeachment.\n\nIn fact, of the seven Republican senators who voted in favor of conviction, only three-Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska-may return to the Senate next year.\n\nFormer Senators Richard Burr of North Carolina, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania have all retired since 2021.\n\nTammy Vigil, a senior associate dean at Boston University's College of Communication, told Newsweek on Thursday that anti-Trump Republicans stepping away is a \"sign of fatigue\" while also pushing the party to \"the ideological extremes.\"\n\n\"We saw the first movements in this direction with the Tea Party Republicans, but the MAGA group has become much more fervent, less interested in governing, and more interested in power for the sake of power.\"\n\nGrant Davis Reeher, a professor of political science, told Newsweek on Thursday that a lot of the success of Trump-aligned Republicans depends on whether Trump wins the presidential election later this year.\n\n\"I think we'll have the presence of Trump-sounding or Trump-lite sounding Republicans for a long time, but whether they drive the party is another issue. The primaries are showing us that there is still room for more traditional Republicans-Haley is getting 30-40 percent of the vote against the real thing,\" he said.\n\nIf Trump loses in November, it is possible to see \"that 30-40 percent changing to 60-70 percent against a Trump wanna-be,\" Reeher said.\n\nMeanwhile, the race to replace McConnell has already begun, with a key conservative senator providing hints about who Trump-aligned conservatives may support as McConnell's successor.\n\nSenator Josh Hawley , a Missouri Republican closely aligned with Trump, floated Senator Rick Scott of Florida and Steve Daines as Montana as potential replacements. However, Texas Senator John Cornyn, South Dakota Senator John Thune and Wyoming Senator John Barrasso are generally viewed as the leading contenders.\n\nReeher noted that many of the leading candidates to replace McConnell are not particularly pro-Trump.\n\nVigil said MAGA gaining more power is troubling for the Republican Party because it plays to \"the worse impulses of politicians rather than reward a drive for true leadership and responsible governance.\"\n\n\"This will undoubtedly fracture the party and create a scenario in which true conservatives will need to find representation and voice elsewhere. It might be difficult for some to support Democratic candidates, but it would be easy for them to remove themselves from the electoral process,\" Vigil said.\n\nBoth major parts have gone through \"political transformations\" throughout history and will likely continue to do so, she said.\n\nUpdate 2/29/24, 2:25 p.m. ET: This article was updated with comment from Tammy Vigil.\n\nAndrew Stanton is a Newsweek weekend reporter based in Maine.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nNearly 150 House Republicans voted to extend a surveillance act on Thursday that Donald Trump claimed was used to \"surveil and abuse\" his 2016 presidential election campaign.\n\nThe annual Defense authorization bill to unlock $886 billion in Pentagon funding has now made its way through Congress and will appear before President Joe Biden to be signed into law. Included in the bill was a measure extending Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) until the middle of April.\n\nFISA allows U.S. intelligence agencies to intercept communications involving suspected foreign agents and terrorists without a warrant, including any conversations they may have with American nationals. Court documents released this year revealed the FBI had been improperly searching this data for Americans, including individuals suspected of involvement with the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nIn a January 2018 post on Twitter , now X, Trump claimed FISA had been used by the \"previous administration and others\" to \" badly surveil and abuse the Trump campaign .\" Less than two hours later, he backed extending the legislation, saying in another post that he'd \"personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office.\"\n\nHouse Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene objected to the latest extension in an X post on Monday, saying that FISA had been \"greatly abused by the FBI and DOJ and used against Americans instead of foreign nationals violating the 4th amendment,\" which guarantees freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures by the state.\n\nThe representative from Georgia also wrote that \"FISA abuse targeted Trump campaign for Russia Russia Russia LIES\" and was allegedly used against \"Americans involved in the Jan. 6 and BLM riots.\"\n\nShe continued: \"While we need the ability to stop terrorism in America, abusing FISA to target political enemies should never happen. But if a terrorist attack happens on U.S. soil, every American will blame the Biden regime for allowing 1.8 million got aways in our country including an unknown number of terrorists from all over the world!\n\n\"It won't be because members of congress like me refuse to vote to reauthorize secret spy courts and fund politically weaponized government agencies. The communists who have abused the power of the federal government are the ONLY ones to blame!!!\"\n\nAhead of the vote, Edward Snowden , the former intelligence contractor who leaked highly classified National Security Agency information in 2013, called for House Speaker Mike Johnson to be \" dumped just like [Kevin] McCarthy \" if FISA was extended as part of the annual defense bill.\n\nOn Thursday, 147 Republicans voted to approve the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), including the FISA extension, including several outspoken Trump defenders such as Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace . Just 73 voted against while Alexander Mooney from West Virginia didn't vote. Forty-five Democrats also opposed the legislation, though 163 voted to pass it.\n\nOne of those who voted against the NDAA was Texas House Republican Chip Roy , who argued there should have been a separate vote on extending the FISA.\n\nHe said: \"The fact of the matter is what's being stated is it is impossible to oppose the National Defense Authorization Act because we put a pay raise in it or because we put something in there that is seemingly so important that we have to ignore the critical destruction of our civil liberties by adding FISA extension right on the top of it without doing the forms necessary to protect the American people.\"\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nJames Bickerton is a Newsweek U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is on covering news and politics in Texas, as well as other general news across the United States.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nSofia Nelson, a lawyer and former Yale Law School classmate of Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance , warned on Saturday that the Ohio senator is working to \"hijack\" former President Donald Trump 's Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement in favor of a far more rigid and orthodox theocracy called post-liberalism.\n\nIn an op-ed for MSNBC published Saturday morning, Nelson said that the post-liberal movement, unlike MAGA, seeks to replace existing social and political power structures with orders rooted in conservative Catholic social teachings.\n\nNelson contends that post-liberalists, like Vance, seek to position themselves within the MAGA movement with the aim of inheriting Trump's political base once he leaves politics. Their goal is to turn the GOP into a pro-theocracy party, Nelson said. The op-ed warns about the danger of a post-liberal rise and the need to counteract it, not just for the sake of defeating Trump, but to maintain the democratic values underpinning U.S. society.\n\n\"There is some policy overlap between MAGA and post-liberalism in their shared opposition, for example, to immigration and transgender rights. But the ideological overlap between the groups is a shared affinity for authoritarianism,\" Nelson wrote. \"The post-liberal right, which has goals that even MAGA Republicans would find extreme, is attempting to hijack the MAGA movement to push its own agenda.\"\n\nNelson befriended Vance and his wife, Usha Vance , while they were attending Yale Law School. Nelson, who is transgender and uses they/them pronouns, had a falling out with JD Vance when he launched his political career and backed bans on transgender minors receiving gender-affirming care. They told CNN 's Erin Burnett in July that the senator's shift in opinions were motivated by his ambition for \"political power and wealth.\"\n\nIn the op-ed, Nelson pointed to Vance's alleged influences within the post-liberal movement.\n\n\"Despite the time we spent as friends, I have no real insights (other than political expediency) into what drew him to post-liberal men like the academic Patrick Deneen, columnist Sohrab Ahmari, legal scholar Adrian Vermeule and expat journalist and author Rod Dreher, who was present for Vance's baptism into the Catholic Church in 2019,\" Nelson wrote. \"What I do know is that Vance used to condemn Trump's racism and be empathetic to how such rhetoric made Americans feel unwelcome in their own country. But these men have had an obvious and heartbreaking effect on Vance's worldview.\"\n\nNelson said Vance's \"obsession\" with birth rates and his remarks about childless women reflect his post-liberal belief structure. They also point out that Vance's comments in favor of eliminating \"no-fault divorce\" drifts further to the right on marriage issues than what is contained in The Heritage Foundation 's Project 2025 initiative, a political movement led by conservative think tanks that aim to shape the next Republican administration's policies.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied having any relation to Project 2025, but many of its contributors are former members of his administration , and his own platform, called Agenda 47, shares broad policy similarities on several issues.\n\nTrump again stated during Tuesday's presidential debate that he has \"nothing to do with Project 2025,\" adding, \"I haven't read it. I don't want to read it, purposely. I'm not going to read it.\"\n\n\"Post-liberalism, unlike MAGA, has no grassroots following. Most Americans aren't Catholic, and most Catholics support the separation of church and state. But post-liberalism, despite its ideological and moral disdain for Trump, needs MAGA, Nelson wrote. \"To accomplish any of its goals, it must leech off of a populist movement. The movement needs to exploit Trump's popularity for its own unpopular aims. This may explain why Vance, who had more integrity when I knew him, abruptly flipped from calling Trump \"cultural heroin\" to the greatest president of his lifetime.\"\n\nNewsweek has emailed Vance's office, along with the Trump-Vance campaign, Saturday morning for comment.\n\nIn July, The New York Times published an article on 90 emails and text messages from Vance to Nelson from 2014 to 2017. The then-future senator expressed opinions in the messages that differ greatly from his more recent public remarks, including telling Nelson: \" I hate the police .\"\n\nLuke Schroeder, a Vance spokesperson, said in a statement issued after the article was published that it was \"unfortunate this individual chose to leak decade-old private conversations between friends to The New York Times ,\"while insisting that \"despite their disagreements, Senator Vance cares for Sofia and wishes Sofia the very best.\"\n\nVance's opinions on Trump have shifted considerably over the years, with the Hillbilly Elegy author previously declaring himself a \"never Trumper\" and questioning whether the then-future president was \"America's Hitler\" in 2016.\n\nIn June, Vance told the Times that he \"first met Trump in 2021\" and changed his opinions on the former president soon after.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nGabe Whisnant is a Breaking News Editor at Newsweek based in North Carolina.

His role is reporting on U.S. politics and social issues. Andrew joined Newsweek in 2021 from The Boston Globe. He is a graduate of Emerson College. You can get in touch with Andrew by emailing a.stanton@newsweek.com . Languages: English.\n\nBased on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nSeveral House Republicans are holding out support for Mike Johnson ahead of the House speaker's race later this week, even after President-elect Donald Trump backed his bid.\n\nA widespread GOP revolt isn't needed to block Johnson from remaining as speaker. Republicans' razor-thin majority in the House leaves him room for only a single deflection, and one Republican has already said he's a hard no on the Louisiana Republican.\n\nThis means he needs the support of every other Republican member of Congress .\n\nRepublicans are expected to hold 219 seats when Congress reconvenes on Friday, with one vacancy in the seat held by former Representative Matt Gaetz , a Florida Republican who won reelection but resigned from office when nominated to be Trump's attorney general. By Friday, 434 sitting members are expected in the chamber, meaning Johnson will need 218 votes to receive majority support.\n\nIf he is unable to win over his critics and reach a deal, there could be another dayslong vote-a-rama like the one in January 2023, when former Speaker Kevin McCarthy struggled to win over detractors facing similarly difficult math. This could result in a more conservative speaker who would win the support of Johnson's right-wing critics.\n\nJohnson drew the ire of some fiscal conservatives earlier in December during a legislative battle to pass a continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government. Critics such as Elon Musk argued that the initial bill proposed by Johnson contained too much spending, resulting in the measure failing.\n\nConservative anger over the bill could spill over into the speaker's race, as several House Republicans have said they will not support Johnson or are undecided.\n\nOn Monday, Trump gave Johnson a potential lift in a Truth Social post, saying the speaker has his endorsement, but it's unclear whether that will be enough to sway his detractors .\n\nHere is an overview of those Republicans who haven't committed to backing Johnson.\n\nMassie has been one of the most vocal opponents of Johnson, saying earlier in December he would not vote for him. He doubled down Monday on his criticism after Trump's endorsement in a post to X (formerly Twitter ).\n\n\"I respect and support President Trump, but his endorsement of Mike Johnson is going to work out about as well as his endorsement of Speaker Paul Ryan. We've seen Johnson partner with the democrats to send money to Ukraine, authorize spying on Americans, and blow the budget,\" Massie wrote.\n\nRoy is another Republican who rebuked Johnson's initial spending bill while also breaking with Trump over his support for eliminating the debt ceiling in a second spending bill that also failed to pass the House.\n\nOn Tuesday, Roy said on Fox Business' Varney & Co. that he is undecided on how he will vote, casting doubt that Johnson has support from enough Republicans.\n\n\"The failure before Christmas is a glimpse to come if we don't organize the conference to be able to deliver for the American people. We are not going to be able to bend on the things that matter,\" Roy said.\n\nSpartz wrote on X that she still has concerns about Johnson after Trump's endorsement on Monday.\n\n\"I understand why President Trump is endorsing Speaker Johnson as he did Speaker Ryan, which is definitely important. However, we still need to get assurances that @SpeakerJohnson won't sell us out to the swamp,\" she wrote.\n\nSpartz also said Trump will need a speaker with \"courage, vision and a plan - also public commitment to the American people how he will help deliver President Trump's agenda to drain the swamp.\"\n\nHarris, chair of the House Freedom Caucus, declined to commit to supporting Johnson during a Monday interview on Newsmax . He said the speaker \"has to make some changes in the procedure and how we are dealing with things in the House\" to win his support.\n\n\"We can't have a repeat of what happened two weeks ago when we spent over $110 billion without paying for it,\" Harris said. \"When, you know, President Trump supported that bill and still 34 Republicans voted against it. So the process doesn't work that he's using now. He's got to change it or we might need new leadership.\"\n\nMassie is the only definite vote against Johnson, he said.\n\nA spokesperson for Biggs told Axios that the Arizona Republican has \"not made any public or private commitments on Speaker Johnson.\"\n\nDonald Trump on Truth Social: \"Speaker Mike Johnson is a good, hard working, religious man. He will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN. Mike has my Complete & Total Endorsement.\"\n\nMatt Gaetz on X: \"Trump endorsing Johnson is \"art of the deal\" level practicality. We could never have held up McCarthy two years ago for concessions if a Trump certification hung in the balance. Now, it does. We were able to hold up McCarthy because Republican voters weren't all that eager to see us getting back to being Biden's b**ch (which Kevin ultimately did anyway). The resistance to @SpeakerJohnson is now futile.\"\n\nRepresentative Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat who is the House minority leader, said on MSNBC: \"There will be no Democrats available to save him or the extreme MAGA Republicans from themselves based on the breaching of a bipartisan agreement that reflected priorities that were good for the American people.\"\n\nThe House will vote on the next speaker on Friday, when the new Congress convenes.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nAndrew Stanton is a Newsweek weekend reporter based in Maine.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump scored his first major victory of 2025 after two Republicans made last-minute changes to their votes in the House speaker race to back Speaker Mike Johnson for a second term on Friday.\n\nOver the past decade, Trump has become the undeniable leader of the Republican Party , transforming it into his brand of politics on issues like immigration, foreign policy and the economy. Friday's vote was the latest test of Trump's sway over the party, as he endorsed Johnson for speaker as the Louisiana Republican faced a potential revolt from some of the more conservative members of Congress .\n\nTrump doubled down on his support for Johnson in a post to Truth Social Friday morning.\n\n\"Good luck today for Speaker Mike Johnson, a fine man of great ability, who is very close to having 100% support. A win for Mike today will be a big win for the Republican Party, and yet another acknowledgment of our 129 year most consequential Presidential Election!!\" he wrote.\n\nTrump's support helped drag Johnson across the finish line.\n\nIt initially appeared that Johnson did not have enough support to retain his speaker's gavel on the first ballot, but two of his detractors, Representatives Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Keith Self of Texas, changed their votes to support Johnson after initially casting votes against him.\n\nOnly one Republican, the libertarian Thomas Massie of Kentucky, ultimately voted against him.\n\nThe vote reflects the complexities of navigating such a small majority for the GOP, as leadership aims to placate the party's most conservative members as well as moderates representing competitive districts.\n\nSix other holdouts declined to vote for Johnson when their name was first read, but ultimately backed Johnson at the end of the roll call.\n\nAll Democrats voted in favor of Representative Hakeem Jeffries , the New York Democrat who serves as House minority leader.\n\nMeena Bose, the executive dean of Hofstra University's Peter S. Kalikow School of Government, Public Policy and International Affairs, told Newsweek on Friday that Johnson's narrow win \"indicates that House Republicans will face significant intra-party tensions even with unified government.\"\n\n\"As with other modern presidents, President-elect Trump's popular support with GOP voters is no guarantee of Republican legislative support in Congress. With a razor-thin majority in the House, Trump and Johnson will have to work closely to persuade legislators to support policy priorities,\" she said.\n\nGrant Davis Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, said the close vote shows the House Freedom Caucus will need to be factored into votes.\n\n\"I would think that Trump will meet with this group to try to persuade them to be more accommodating and cooperative, in order to get things accomplished. The expectations on Trump and the new Congress for this year are big, and the margins for error are tiny,\" he said Friday.\n\nJohnson sparked the ire of some Republicans last month by introducing a temporary spending bill opposed by some fiscal conservatives over what they viewed as excess spending.\n\nHe faced difficult math, needing 218 votes to remain speaker. Republicans hold 219 seats in the House (with one vacancy in the seat previously held by former Florida Representative Matt Gaetz who resigned late last year), meaning he needed to win all but one GOP votes without any Democratic support.\n\nJust before the vote, Johnson took to X, formerly Twitter , to outline commitments to conservative lawmakers, including to create a working group to work with Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and committees to recommend spending reforms, task that group with reviewing existing audits of federal agencies.\n\nHe also said he would request House committees undertake \"aggressive authorizations and appropriations reviews, including providing additional resources where needed, to expose irresponsible or illegal practices and hold agencies/individuals accountable that have weaponized government against the American people.\"\n\nRepresentative Thomas Massie on X: \"I respect and support President Trump, but his endorsement of Mike Johnson is going to work out about as well as his endorsement of Speaker Paul Ryan. We've seen Johnson partner with the democrats to send money to Ukraine, authorize spying on Americans, and blow the budget.\"\n\nMike Johnson to CNN earlier Friday: \"My simple message to my colleagues is, make suggestions about process improvements, we're open to that at all times. But I don't make deals with anyone. There's no quid pro quo here. I don't do anything in exchange for a vote.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on MSNBC: \"There will be no Democrats available to save him or the extreme MAGA Republicans from themselves based on the breaching of a bipartisan agreement that reflected priorities that were good for the American people.\"\n\nMaggie Haberman, New York Times White House correspondent: \"The vote is yet another test of Mr. Trump's ability to hold together a fractious House Republican Conference with an extraordinarily thin majority.\"\n\nDemocratic strategist Maria Cardona on CNN: \"I do think that his hold on the MAGA world isn't as strong as before, because let's also remember, he's a lame duck president. He is not running again. He can't run again.\"\n\nLawmakers will now be sworn in after Johnson's victory and the House's official business can begin.
