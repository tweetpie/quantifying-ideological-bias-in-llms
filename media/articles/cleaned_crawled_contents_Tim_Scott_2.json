      "text": "Trump: Tim Scott 'wasn't a good presidential candidate' but is 'a great surrogate'\n\nDuring the 2024 GOP presidential primary, Sen. Tim Scott (R-South Carolina) was, at times, critical of frontrunner Donald Trump. But it was mild criticism compared to the scathing anti-Trump attacks coming from fellow primary candidate Chris Christie, former two-term governor of New Jersey.\n\nNow, Scott is reportedly on Trump's short list for a possible running mate , along with Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida), Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nAccording to Punchbowl News' Andrew Desiderio , Trump was especially favorable to Scott during a recent conversation with Senate Republicans.\n\nIn a June 13 thread on X , formerly Twitter, Andrew Desiderio reports, \"Trump heaped praise on Tim Scott during Senate R mtg - more than any of the other VP shortlisters. He mentioned Rubio/Vance by name but talked the longest about Scott. Trump joked that Scott 'wasn't a good presidential candidate' but has been a 'great surrogate for him.'\"\n\nDesiderio also noted that during the meeting, Trump wasn't attacking Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky). Despite all the bad blood there has been between Trump and McConnell during the Biden era, McConnell is now endorsing Trump.\n\nDesiderio tweets , \"MORE, per two attendees - Trump said abortion was the reason R's lost Senate in 2022, 'not because of Mitch, not because of me.' Trump went out of his way to be nice to McConnell, per R senators.\"\n\nThe Punchbowl reporter also observes , \"Not only did Trump go out of his way to praise McConnell (albeit in a subdued way), he did *not* take open shots at any of his GOP critics, per multiple attendees. One GOP senator said to me sarcastically: 'I was like, who's this guy and what did he do with Donald Trump?'\""

      "text": "'Who's the Black guy?' Evangelicals prefer Tim Scott as anti-choice running mate for Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump needs conservative evangelicals to mobilize for him ahead of the November election. But the surest way to do that may cost him women voters.\n\nAccording to a Thursday report in Politico , Trump's evangelical base is encouraging him to pick a vice presidential candidate who will be staunchly anti-abortion. Some are hoping the former president will tap Sen. Tim Scott (R-South Carolina) to be his 2024 running mate.\n\n\"Who's the Black guy?\" said Bonnie Fitch of the Carter Creek Missionary Baptist Church in Greenville, Kentucky, referencing Scott. Her husband, Sid, reportedly \"lit up\" when Politico asked if Bonnie was talking about the South Carolina Republican and former GOP presidential candidate, and told the publication \"I just like the way he's been speaking.\"\n\nDuring the recent Southern Baptist Convention, Scott Colter - who is CEO of the anti-abortion Danbury Institute - introduced video of Trump's remarks by acknowledging his appointment of Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision in 2022.\n\n\"We took a risk on what he said he would do, and he came through and he delivered in that case,\" Colter said. \"And so we can debate all day long the merits of who Donald Trump is and his personality and all of those different things. But he did what he said he would do... And I'm tremendously grateful for that.\"\n\nHowever, Trump leaning hard on his anti-abortion record may be a double-edged sword in courting the coveted demographic of suburban women voters. Women who live in suburban areas played decisive roles in the failure of every single abortion-related ballot measure failing across the country in the wake of Roe's demise.\n\nEven though Ohio broke for Trump both in 2016 and 2020 and has a Republican trifecta in its state government, voters nonetheless chose to enshrine abortion rights in the Buckeye State's constitution last fall. Voters in the deep-red state of Kentucky also reelected Democratic Governor Andy Beshear , partially over his pro-choice stance.\n\nKevin McClure, who is a member of a Louisville, Kentucky-based Baptist church, told Politico that Trump's running mate choice likely wouldn't impact evangelical turnout.\n\n\"I think evangelicals will generally, by and large, vote for him regardless of who he picks,\" McClure said. \"Because the Republican platform currently, in the very least, has a place for pro-life priorities, even if they're not as strong as many of us would want.\"\n\nTrump has indicated he would likely announce his running mate at the 2024 Republican National Convention, which will kick off in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on July 15 - just four days after he'll be sentenced for 34 felony crimes in New York."

Tim Scott (R-South Carolina) launched his 2024 presidential campaign, his supporters hailed him as a traditional non-MAGA conservative who could rescue the GOP from Trumpism if he won the nomination and become the United States' second Black president by defeating Democratic incumbent Joe Biden in the general election.\n\nBut Scott's critics argued that his criticism of Trump during the primary was tepid at best. The South Carolina senator is now campaigning for Trump, and the Rev. Al Sharpton is among the Scott critics who believe he is debasing himself in the process.\n\nAfter Trump defeated former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the New Hampshire primary, Scott stood alongside the GOP presidential frontrunner during his victory speech. Trump told Scott, \"Did you ever think (Haley) actually supported you, Tim? And you're the senator of her state. And (you) endorsed me. You must really hate her.\"\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\nScott responded, \"I just love you.\"\n\nDuring a January 24 appearance on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Sharpton slammed Scott's behavior in New Hampshire as \"humiliating to watch.\"\n\nThe civil rights activist and MSNBC host argued, \"I think (Trump) will be the nominee. And I think he's demanding people bow to him. There are few moments in my life I've been more embarrassed than to watch Tim Scott. You know, I know Tim and I are both practicing Christians, but I don't know if he could pray like that to the other side. I mean, it was humiliating to watch what Tim Scott did as a sitting senator. And one time, he wasn't even on the script; he interrupted Trump to pay homage.\"\n\nSharpton went on to tell \"Morning Joe\" hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, \"He has a right to be a Republican. He has a right to do Donald Trump. But to do it in such a way that is so humiliating was troubling.\"\n\nSharpton isn't the only one who is calling out Scott's obsequious behavior on behalf of Trump.\n\nNever Trump conservative Tara Setmayer said of Scott, \"Who's worse? Trump or his court jester enablers?\"\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, author Jeff Sharlet posted , \"I hold Tim Scott in contempt, but the depth of self-abasement here is hard to look at. All the more so for understanding how Trump's supporters see it, a racist inoculation against charges of racism that in turn 'permits' more racism.\n\nWatch the full video of Al Sharpton's MSNBC appearance below :"

Tim Scott (R-South Carolina) - who was one of former President Donald Trump's opponents in the 2024 Republican presidential primary just a few months ago - has endorsed the ex-president just days before the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary. He's expected to give an endorsement speech at a rally in the Granite State tonight.\n\nThe endorsement of South Carolina's junior US senator likely came as a shock to former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, who appointed Scott to his seat after former Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) resigned in 2012 to lead the Heritage Foundation. This fact was not lost on commentators taking to social media to call out Scott's hypocrisy.\n\n\"This man owes his entire political career to Haley and yet...\" tweeted housing policy advocate Seth Bynum, who also responded to the news of Scott's endorsement of Trump with \"HAHAHA\" in a separate post.\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\nNews of Scott's endorsement also surprised journalists and pundits. CBS News reporter Kathryn Watson pointed out that in October, Scott cast doubt on Trump's electability in swing states, saying \"I don't think he can win. You have to be able to win in Georgia. I don't think he can win in Georgia. I think you'll have to be able to win in Pennsylvania.\"\n\nMassachusetts journalist Adam Bass opined that Scott endorsing Trump over Haley was \" the nail in the coffin \" for the former South Carolina governor's presidential hopes. Political strategist Dennis Herring observed \"One by one, they topple.\" And political commentator Chris Cillizza simply tweeted \"It's. All. Over.\"\n\nSome social media users used the news of Scott's endorsement to critique the South Carolina senator's apparent flip-flopping. Joe Perticone, who writes for anti-Trump conservative website The Bulwark, responded to the news by posting a 2020 headline of Scott referring to Trump's retweet of a supporter yelling \"white power\" as \"indefensible.\" Biblical scholar Michael Kinsman was more direct in his criticism of the evangelical South Carolina senator, calling him a \" spineless coward. \"\n\nScott's endorsement comes on the heels of former GOP contender Vivek Ramaswamy's endorsement, who dropped out after placing fourth in the Iowa Republican Caucuses earlier this week. New Hampshire voters will head to the polls on Tuesday."

REUTERS/Nathan Howard\n\nThe U.S. Senate just advanced a resolution on a party-line vote to give banks more leeway to charge customers exorbitant fees if they don't have enough money in their accounts.\n\nOn Wednesday, senators passed a bill by Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, aimed at undoing a rule imposed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) under former President Joe Biden to cap overdraft fees at just $5. The rule was set to go into effect in October, though if it passes the House and is signed into law by President Donald Trump , it will never go into effect. Banks' overdraft fees can be as high as $35.\n\nWhile Senate rules normally allow the minority to filibuster legislation to where it can't pass without 60 votes, Wednesday's vote was done as a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution. As the American Prospect reported, CRA resolutions \" cannot be stopped by a filibuster, \" meaning Wednesday's 52-47 vote in the Senate is final.\n\nAs Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) - who is the ranking member on the Banking Committee - explained in her Senate floor speech , the CFPB rule in question allows for banks to recoup all losses associated with a customer drawing funds they don't have, which is typically less than five dollars. And if a bank can demonstrate that their losses for an overdraft were more than $5, they can recoup the full amount.\n\nHowever, Warren pointed out that many commercial banks \"play a game of gotcha\" by stacking customers' transactions in a way that maximizes overdraft fees. She further elaborated that revenue from overdrafts disproportionately impacts low-income Americans, and can cost them more than $400 per year.\n\n\"$400 can be the cost of a mortgage payment or rent for someone with a modest income. $400 can be the difference between their kids' medication or just going without. $400 for some families can be several weeks' worth of groceries,\" Warren said. \"This money matters to millions of families. Altogether the CFB rule saves American families up to $5 billion a year.\"\n\n\"Republicans say they care about lowering costs,\" she continued. \"But overturning this rule will make big banks richer, and hard-working families poorer.\""

Tim Scott (R-SC) after he tried to flip every question about Donald Trump into an attack on President Joe Biden.\n\nDuring a Sunday interview on CNN, Bash noted that some Republicans like Steve Bannon had suggested Biden tried to assassinate Trump because a search warrant on Mar-a-Lago authorized deadly force.\n\n\"Federal prosecutors are now asking for a gag order in that classified documents case after the former president said that FBI agents who searched Mar-a-Lago were, quote, locked and loaded, ready to take me out, and that he nearly escaped death,\" Bash noted. \"But, Senator, that same language was also in the order for President Biden's home.\"\n\n\"So, do you agree with the attorney general that this is not only false, what the former president said, but extremely dangerous?\" the CNN host asked.\n\n\"I haven't found myself agreeing with Attorney General Garland on any issue,\" Scott replied. \"I will say I saw the video of the SWAT team from the FBI raiding Mar-a-Lago. I have not seen the same video of them raiding Joe Biden's garage. So I'd love to have that comparison.\"\n\nAccording to Scott, Trump faced a \"two-tiered justice system.\" But Bash pushed back.\n\n\"The reality is that, I mean, just using this case as an example, it's not two tiers if you have the Justice Department, which is the Justice Department, as Joe Biden is currently president, also going in to get classified documents into his house,\" Bash pointed out. \"And what I really am asking you about is the language being used, which is misleading.\"\n\n\"People like Steve Bannon called this an assassination attempt,\" Bash said. \"Doesn't that kind of language concern you?\"\n\nScott, however, appeared not to be concerned about the dangerous language used by Trump supporters.\n\n\"Well, I will simply say that watching the treatment of Joe Biden by the justice system, when they have found him unable to stand before a jury of his peers because he's too old, frankly, and his memory is shot, that is not the kind of simple, fair justice system that Americans expect,\" Scott said.\n\n\"Yeah, you're referring to Robert Hur and his report,\" Bash noted. \"There were other reasons why they said they didn't prosecute Joe Biden.\"\n\n\"Okay, and I just want to, one last time, what I'm asking you about is rhetoric that could end up dangerous, and you keep answering about Joe Biden,\" she continued. \"So, is there anything you want to talk about with regard to that rhetoric?\"\n\nScott deflected by talking about \"anti-Semitism\" on college campuses.\n\n\"We're actually seeing violence on college campuses, and yet the Democrat Party sits there, hands folded, letting it play out,\" he insisted.\n\nWatch the video below from CNN or at the link .\n\nCNN host calls out Tim Scott for not answering questions www.youtube.com"

French Hill (R-Ark.) and Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) - who chair the House and Senate Banking Committees, respectively - are introducing a bill to repeal a rule capping overdraft fees implemented by former President Joe Biden's administration. That rule capped overdraft fees at $5 , whereas they were previously as high as $35. It also allowed for banks to find ways to control overdrafts without needling customers with excessive daily fees. The legislation Hill and Scott rolled out would deem the rule to \" have no force or effect \" if passed and signed into law.\n\nActing Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) director Russell Vought (also the director of Trump's Office of Management and Budget) said he was \"grateful\" to Hill and Scott for introducing the bill. He added: \"Passing this important legislation will immediately further President Trump's deregulatory agenda.\"\n\nAccording to the Associated Press , overdraft fees are a significant source of revenue for banks, allowing them to bring in roughly $8 billion annually. CFPB data shows that roughly 70% of overdraft fees were charged to accounts that had between $237 and $439, meaning that those fees disproportionately impact the poorest Americans.\n\nThe rule - which Trump and the GOP majorities in the House and Senate are likely to undo - is slated to go into effect in October of this year, and is projected to save bank customers about $5 billion per year, or $225 per household. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told Rolling Stone that Trump would be breaking his key campaign promise of lowering costs for working-class Americans if he allowed the rule to be eliminated.\n\n\"He is now sidelining the agency that over the last dozen years, has returned $21 billion directly to people who got cheated by giant financial institutions,\" Warren said. \"In other words, his plan is to do nothing on reducing costs, but sure enough, put in place a plan to raise costs for people who are working hardest in our economy.\"\n\nCampaign finance data from OpenSecrets shows that both Hill and Scott are favorites of donors in the banking industry. The top two industry contributors to Hill's campaign are securities & investment and commercial banks, respectively. The securities and investment sector is also the #2 industry for Scott's donors ."

      "text": "A Republican Rising Star's Plan to Reopen America\n\nSenator Tim Scott of South Carolina is keenly aware that COVID-19 is especially dangerous for African Americans. He's also worried about small businesses.\n\nSenator Tim Scott tells the story of his life as a constant fight to help people at the bottom of society. \"Our country has been struggling and striving in the right direction,\" the Republican told me from Hanahan, South Carolina, where he was temporarily riding out the coronavirus outbreak and a spate of bad weather in his home state. But \"we still have progress that needs to be made.\" During his decade in Congress, Scott has pushed the Republican Party to remedy America's inequality, largely focusing on programs that promote American business. The GOP's 2017 tax-cut bill included a provision, championed by Scott, to create so-called Opportunity Zones meant to incentivize investment in poor areas around the country, although so far, the program has had mixed success .\n\nNow Scott and the rest of his colleagues are facing an enormous test of their philosophy. Nothing in recent history has revealed America's inequalities like the COVID-19 outbreak. White-collar employees get to remain at home while grocery-store clerks and warehouse workers continue risking their health. The rush to stock up on basic supplies has favored the rich, who can afford to spend hundreds of dollars on groceries at a time. And the virus has hit communities of color particularly hard , with black Americans dying and being hospitalized at alarmingly high rates.\n\nScott has called on the Department of Health and Human Services to track data on these racial disparities. (He is one of just three African American senators, and the only Republican.) In our conversation, he was frank about the risks facing black Americans. But like other Republicans, Scott is also starting to call for the country to open back up. South Carolina is one of a few southern states that are beginning to ease restrictions, and Scott thinks that's justified. \"People are restless. They're also ready to go back to work,\" he said. \"You cannot maintain a fully closed economy when ... there are areas that you can start some activity without much risk.\"\n\nThis is the tricky balance that Scott is constantly navigating: He is distinctively positioned to advocate for the needs of poor communities and people of color in the conservative world. But he is also set on protecting the pro-business interests of his party. In his new book, Opportunity Knocks , Scott writes about his desire for a \"cultural renaissance\" to replace the culture wars that \"[pit] economic and racial classes against each other.\" He has long prized his reputation as a politician more focused on practicalities than partisan bomb-throwing, regularly seeking out opportunities for bipartisan cooperation. But in our conversation, he bristled at any suggestion that the GOP, led by President Donald Trump, has recently leaned into the culture wars, stoking the exact resentments that Scott wishes to salve.\n\nThis conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nEmma Green: Do you think the United States is ready to reopen?\n\nTim Scott: The plan that's been laid out is a very effective overview of what it takes for us to be able to reopen. It starts with a decline in cases, followed with making sure hospitals have capacity. We want to make sure we're able to isolate hot spots and mitigate the spread of the virus. And the icing on the cake-as well as the flour for the cake-is testing.\n\nTo the extent that we continue to see testing increase, I think we can slowly walk towards reopening the economy in parts. It's really important not to think of an economy as if it's just one economy, but think about it in phases, sectors, and regions. Take South Carolina. Our governor is going to give our municipalities and our counties flexibility to start the process of reopening our cities, and some of those counties are going to say, \"No, thank you.\" The good news is the government closest to the people happens to be the government that people trust the most. Those local leaders will weigh in heavily on whether they're prepared and ready for their communities to open, and if they're not, then they won't.\n\n[Read: The conscience of a conservative]\n\nGreen: As you probably know, protesters have recently called on state governments to reopen the country-including in Columbia, South Carolina . Do you think these protesters are disregarding the potential health consequences for the populations that have been hit hardest by COVID-19?\n\nScott: I don't think so. Six weeks ago, the estimates were that we were going to lose between 1 and 2.5 million Americans. We went into the social-distancing protocols. And because of that kind of energy and focus on flattening the curve, we are now seeing estimates around 60,000 lost lives .\n\nSixty thousand lost lives are 60,000 too many. But we should anticipate that people are restless. They're ready to go back to work and to do those things that are productive and essential for their lives. We're going to have a tightrope to walk in many ways, but you cannot maintain a fully closed economy when, in fact, there are areas where you can start some activity without much risk. If we're going to wait until there's no risk, we're going to wait until a vaccine is out and everybody has it. That could be at least 18 months away. And there's no way in the world a free country like America is going to wait that long for reopening.\n\n[Read: Our pandemic summer]\n\nGreen: You write eloquently in your book about the need for opportunities to be created for low-income communities. Right now, the disparity in opportunities available to those communities is on display. Different groups, including African Americans and working-class people, are experiencing this pandemic in vastly different ways from their fellow Americans. Why do you think it is that some communities, and specifically people of color, are being hit so hard by this pandemic?\n\nScott: African Americans are not more predisposed to the virus. We simply have more of the underlying conditions that make it very difficult. Add on top of that, some of the social factors: 80 percent of African Americans cannot telework . The economic reality for so many African Americans is that we are below the middle class. Even more are living close to the poverty line. Folks living close to the border of poverty, they're probably working and exposed more than the general public.\n\nCouple that with high blood pressure, asthma, obesity, and other underlying conditions, and you find yourself in a very vulnerable state. Van Jones said it well : If you take a pill every day, or you should, stay home as much as you can. The same is true if you have pressure or low sugar-those are two colloquial phrases that mean high blood pressure or diabetes.\n\nGreen: So much of your work involves talking to communities and bringing their messages back to Washington. But certain policies from Washington also affect the conditions for fighting the pandemic. South Carolina is one of roughly a dozen U.S. states that has refused to accept federal money to expand access to Medicaid . Do you think policies like that have harmed people who are now getting sick, who haven't been able to get consistent access to medical care?\n\nScott: I have to reject the premise of your question based on the reality of statistics. In Michigan, where they've expanded their Medicaid, 14 percent of the population is black, and they've been 40 percent of the deaths . So I'd be very careful not to try to blame some other action for where we are today. Medicaid expansion has not flattened the curve around the country. You can have that conversation in multiple ways, but then you'd have to have that conversation as well about the effects of Obamacare on the closure of rural hospitals throughout the states. I just think either conversation is unhelpful for trying to figure out how to go forward today. I don't want to blame the Obama administration or the Trump administration or any administration for a global pandemic that seems to be wreaking havoc from China to America, from Italy to Mexico.\n\n[Read: The social-distancing culture war has begun]\n\nGreen: I think your record shows that you're a classic Republican in one sense: You believe in promoting small business and creating opportunities through the private sector. But in your book, you also criticize people who would rather wage a culture war that pits racial and economic classes against each other than make things happen.\n\nI wonder if you feel like the Republican Party has moved away from that party where you used to feel at home, where you could get things done as a legislator rather than pitting people against each other.\n\nScott: It almost sounds like you're asking me if the Republican Party is pitting people against each other. Is that your question?\n\nGreen: I think there's a case to be made that both Democrats and Republicans engage in that. But certainly you could point to some of President Trump's tweets and other campaign rhetoric that absolutely tries to pit groups against one another.\n\nScott: I'm not sure if you paid attention to the Hillary Clinton campaign for president in 2016, where she spoke about the \"deplorables.\" I don't know that I would suggest that either party intentionally looks for ways to divide our country into racial groups. If we are, then I would say that the [Democratic] Party has focused on tribalism, trying to divide the pie based on who you are, what you look like, far more than the Republican Party has.\n\nOur nation is blessed with really good leadership on both sides at times. But I think the philosophy of what leads to a better America is the Republican philosophy. We're not perfect and I don't think we ever will be, but I do think we hold out the best hope-especially for the folks who are at the bottom of the food chain economically-more than the other side. The Democrats, who may be well intentioned, have a basis in socialism, which is unhelpful for people at the bottom. Socialism aggregates decisions and money to the top. That hasn't worked in any place on Earth so far. The best shot, without any question, is a system where you, the individual, have the greatest impact on your life.\n\nOur country has been struggling and striving in the right direction to make the playing field as fair and as equal as possible, and we still have progress that needs to be made. And I'm going to continue to fight for it. I'm going to work with folks who are looking for ways to make progress, no matter what Republican/Democrat label they wear or don't wear. I think if we all do that, we'll be better off.\n\nGreen: Do you think there's an opportunity to create unity in America in the wake of the pandemic?\n\nScott: Oh, yeah. I think America sees her best days after a crisis. The aftermath mentality-when Americans bind themselves to other people no matter what they look like, no matter where they're from, no matter what they believe-and they fight together, not against each other: that is the most amazing and beautiful picture of what's possible in this nation.\n\nWhat I offered in the book is this: If you want to see us at our best, it's the aftermath mentality. The question is: Can we live the aftermath mentality without having to go through a crisis? That is quite a conundrum."

      "text": "The Battle for the Future of the GOP Is No Contest\n\nHow can Tim Scott and Nikki Haley be what's next for a party that has so completely embraced Trumpism?\n\nT im Scott stood in front of a row of American flags in a stately, COVID-emptied Washington, D.C., auditorium, talking about family. The South Carolina Republican explained that his grandfather, who grew up in the segregated South and never learned to read or write, had to cross the street if a white person was passing his way. Scott leaned to the left to represent the discrimination his grandfather suffered. His eyes pierced the camera. \"Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,\" the senator told viewers on the first night of the 2020 Republican National Convention. \"That's why I believe the next American century can be better than the last.\"\n\nMuch of Scott's speech, measured and searching, would not have seemed out of place at the Republican National Conventions in 2004, 2008, or 2012-before President Donald Trump seized control of the party. The senator's sedate address sparked speculation that he may hope to ascend to the White House himself after Trump leaves office. \"Tim Scott 2024!\" Trey Gowdy, the former South Carolina congressman who co-wrote a book with Scott, tweeted. A similar performance from Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who served as Trump's first UN ambassador, triggered a similar reaction. \"Nikki Haley walks in tonight as the probable GOP front runner in 2024,\" tweeted Ari Fleischer, who served as President George W. Bush's first press secretary.\n\nAnnie Lowrey: The party of no content\n\nBut if Scott's hope comes from his family's story, many in his party have put their faith in a different family. An hour before Scott took the podium, Kimberly Guilfoyle, the Trump campaign's finance chair and the eldest Trump son's partner, was shown in front of those same American flags, shaking her head. \"Just take a look at California: It is a place of immense wealth, immeasurable innovation, and immaculate environment. And the Democrats turned it into a land of discarded needles in parks, riots in streets, and blackouts in homes,\" Guilfoyle said. She raised her fists to the sky and her voice to a yell as she proclaimed that the only way to avoid this dystopian hellscape spreading across the country was four more years of a Trump administration. \"The best is yet to come!\"\n\nThirty-five minutes later, Guilfoyle's boyfriend, Donald Trump Jr., bounded onto the stage. He approached the lectern and spoke with his hands, punctuating sentences by rocking side to side. \"Joe Biden and the radical left are now coming for our freedom of speech,\" he said. \"They want to bully us into submission. If they get their way, it will no longer be the silent majority. It will be the silenced majority.\"\n\nScott and Haley spoke late in the night, during the hour that broadcast networks aired the convention, which suggests that the event's organizers wanted a broad universe of potential voters to hear the two speakers. But in tone and content, both spoke to the fringes of the president's coalition-the Republicans who need to be persuaded to hold their nose and vote for Trump, the Republicans and independents who might not vote for him at all. Haley and Scott may be effective messengers, and they may help Trump win. They're not necessarily the future of his party, though.\n\nDavid Litt: The U.S. is facing the possibility of a truly illegitimate election\n\nMany Republicans like Scott and Haley, traditional politicians who focused on expanding opportunity, lowering taxes, and bringing the country together, ran against Trump in 2016. They all lost. And the Republican base doesn't even prefer their less combative political style within the Trump family. In public appearances and carefully managed relationships with the media, Ivanka Trump has long tried to soften the president's most inflammatory rhetoric, to distance herself from his most unpopular policies. But as my colleague McKay Coppins has written , Don Jr., who imitates the president's language and manner, has become his father's \"most skilled warm-up act\" and most natural political successor. Way-too-early polls of the 2024 Republican primary tend to show Don Jr. well ahead of Ivanka in the race for the nomination.\n\nLast night, Don Jr. pinched his index finger and his thumb together as he steered into fear. \"Anarchists have been flooding our streets and Democrat mayors are ordering the police to stand down. Small businesses across America, many of them minority-owned, are being torched by mobs,\" he warned. But, he told viewers, it didn't have to be that way. \"It starts by rejecting radicals who want to drag us into the dark and embracing the man who represents a bright and beautiful future for all.\" The embrace of Trump is a complete and lasting one-and no one gives tighter hugs than family."

      "text": "The Conscience of a Conservative\n\nIt should not fall to the only black Republican senator to block a man who spent his career seeking to disenfranchise minority voters from being appointed to the federal bench.\n\nSenator Jesse Helms of North Carolina opposed the Civil Rights Act , calling it \"the single most dangerous piece of legislation ever introduced in the Congress.\" He opposed the Voting Rights Act. He filibustered a bill to establish a federal holiday to honor Martin Luther King Jr., accusing the civil-rights leader of \"action-oriented Marxism.\" He protected South Africa's apartheid government from sanctions. He backed white rule in Rhodesia . And when he died in 2008, President George W. Bush called him an \"unwavering champion of those struggling for liberty.\"\n\nIt makes perfect sense that a party that celebrates a man like Helms, whose many former aides retain positions all over Washington, would nominate Thomas Farr to the federal bench. The Justice Department identified Farr, an attorney for Helms in 1984 and 1990, as aiding the Helms campaign's effort to keep black voters from the polls. The campaign mailed postcards to some 125,000 black voters in North Carolina threatening them with prosecution if they had lived in a given precinct for less than a month and attempted to vote. Disenfranchising black voters was of the utmost urgency because Helms was running against Harvey Gantt, the black former mayor of Charlotte, and his campaign feared an energized black electorate. After running a campaign on naked appeals to white racism, including the infamous \"white hands\" ad, Helms prevailed.\n\nRead: The long, bitter fight over Thomas Farr\n\nFarr has spent much of his post-Helms career attempting to weaken the influence of black voters or to keep them from the polls. He defended gerrymandered maps that were drawn with race as \"the legislature's paramount concern.\" He defended a North Carolina voting law that a federal court said targeted \"African Americans with almost surgical precision.\" In response to the the court's ruling finding that the North Carolina voting restrictions \"constituted racial discrimination,\" Farr said the decision \"insults the people of North Carolina and their elected representatives by convicting them of abject racism.\" Attempting to disenfranchise or otherwise diminish the power of black voters was not, in Farr's view, cause for outrage. Rather, it was accurately describing those attempts as targeting black voters that he found offensive.\n\nIf Donald Trump's administration had its way, Farr would be a federal judge. Senator Tim Scott scuttled Farr's nomination on Thursday by joining his colleague Jeff Flake in opposition. Scott said he could not support Farr following the release of the 1991 Justice Department memo that \"shed new light on Mr. Farr's activities.\" In July, Scott sank the nomination of Ryan Bounds, whose past writings were replete with racist generalizations . But neither of these men should ever have been nominated in the first place, and blocking their confirmation should not have rested on the conscience of the Republican Party's only black senator. If the Republicans decide to renominate Farr when the new Senate is inaugurated, then Scott's stand will be insufficient to stop him.\n\nThe fact that Farr came so close to being seated on the federal bench is a symptom of a greater sickness afflicting American democracy, which is that one of the two major parties has decided that disenfranchising a core constituency of its rival party is a legitimate political approach . The polarization of the two parties into one that is almost entirely white and one that relies substantially on the support of racial and ethnic minorities has exacerbated a trend toward conservatives believing that their opponents' political victories are illegitimate. It is no coincidence that the voter-fraud conspiracies of Trump and his defenders center around undocumented immigrants or black neighborhoods -alleging criminality allows them to suggest political victories that rely on minority voters are usurpations, without saying so explicitly.\n\nRead: The Senate's only black Republican opens up about being mistreated by cops.\n\nThe rhetoric with which conservatives describe elements of the Democratic coalition-black voters are frequently described as being stuck on a \"plantation\" -denies black agency and also Republicans' responsibility for their difficulties attracting minority voters. Suggesting that voters of color are somehow coerced or brainwashed into voting for Democrats not only justifies efforts to disenfranchise them, it means that criticism of the Republican Party's record on racism can easily be dismissed as fake news.\n\nThose who hold these beliefs naturally conclude that extraordinary measures are justified in order to maintain power. Whether it's deliberately baroque voting rules , prohibitive costs to casting a ballot , voter-suppression campaigns , or racial gerrymanders , the alternative-allowing Democrats to steal elections-is ultimately worse. They're just trying to protect democracy.\n\nMuch has been said about the diversity of the incoming class of Democratic freshman representatives, and about the corresponding whiteness of the Republican delegation. Until the Republican Party is beholden to diverse constituencies, until its base properly regards attacks on the right to vote as attacks on democracy, until it sees its path to power in appealing to minority voters rather than in disenfranchising them, it will continue to produce more Thomas Farrs than Tim Scotts. And the most basic of democratic rights-the right of citizens to cast a ballot-will continue to be contested by those seeking to restrict the electorate to their advantage. But it should not be this way, and it does not have to be.\n\nJulian Zelizer: How conservatives won the battle over the courts\n\nIt is a common rhetorical trope among liberals to suggest that conservative giants of the past would not recognize today's party of Trump. But Jesse Helms almost certainly would. That's the problem.\n\nFarr should never have been nominated, and once nominated, the vote against him should have been 0-100. Scott's stand against Farr was admirable. But it should not fall to him alone to conclude that a man who spent his career trying to prevent his fellow citizens from voting does not belong on the federal bench. Scott has no obligations to the American people that his Republican colleagues do not share. And one of those obligations is to defend the American people from those who would seek to infringe on their basic constitutional rights, no matter what party they belong to, no matter what their racial background might be, and no matter whom they might vote for."

      "text": "The Post-racial Republicans\n\nOne of the core beliefs that binds the modern GOP coalition is rejection of the idea that minorities and women face structural bias in American society.\n\nThe sharp exchange between former President Barack Obama and two nonwhite 2024 GOP presidential candidates captures how diverging perceptions about racial inequity have emerged as a central fault line between the Republican and Democratic coalitions.\n\nIn their presidential campaigns, Republican Senator Tim Scott, who is Black, and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who is Indian American, have repeatedly insisted that systemic or structural racism is no longer a problem in America. That drew a sharp rebuke earlier this month from Obama, who said the pair had joined \"a long history of African American or other minority candidates within the Republican Party who will validate America and say, 'Everything's great, and we can all make it.'\"\n\nBoth Scott and Haley responded by accusing Obama of treating minority voters as victims and repeating their claims that racism and structural inequities can no longer hold back anyone who will \"work hard\" and display \"integrity\" and \"grit,\" as Scott told a mostly white audience at a Fox News town hall with Sean Hannity last Tuesday.\n\nRead: 'People who are different are not the problem in America'\n\n\"When I hear people telling me that America is a racist nation, I got to say: Not my America, not our America,\" Scott declared to loud applause.\n\nScott and Haley have leaned into the criticism from Obama, highlighting it to raise their profile in a Republican presidential race where each has attracted just single-digit support in national polls. But in responding to Obama, they have demonstrated how difficult it has become for any GOP leader-especially one who is not white-to challenge the party consensus that the nation has transcended discrimination against minorities and women.\n\nFor a Republican coalition that still relies predominantly on white voters, hearing nonwhite GOP candidates dismiss racism offers \"acquittal and absolution,\" says Robert P. Jones, the founder and president of the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonpartisan group that studies American attitudes toward race and culture. Such comments from figures like Scott and Haley, he told me, provide \"permission\" for other Republicans \"to not even have to ask the questions\" about whether systemic discrimination still shapes U.S. society.\n\nLikewise, Michael Steele, the Black former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told me he believes that Scott is expressing such an absolutist rejection of racism-despite Scott's acknowledgment that he has faced racial profiling in his own life-because he recognizes that that assertion is what the GOP's mainly white electorate wants to hear.\n\nRepublicans, Steele told me, like finding \"the Black man to put out there to say that shit to begin with. You pick someone to affirm the lie in a way that you ostensibly take your fingerprints off it. You create this artificial legitimacy around an illegitimate point.\"\n\nOne of the core beliefs that binds the modern Republican coalition, particularly since the rise of Donald Trump, is rejection of the idea that racial minorities and women face structural bias in American society.\n\nStudies of the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections conducted by the Tufts political scientist Brian Schaffner and his colleagues used the Cooperative Election Study , a large-scale national poll, to determine the factors that predicted which candidate voters supported in those races. Those studies found that in each contest, the single best predictor of who voted for Trump was the belief that systemic racism no longer exists in the U.S.; the second-best predictor was denial that systemic bias exists against women.\n\nWithin the GOP, those views command overwhelming support. In an email, Schaffner told me almost nine in 10 Republicans reject the idea that structural discrimination exists against racial minorities; about three-fourths doubt that women face entrenched bias. Fully two-thirds of Republicans say there's little bias against either minorities or women. Only one in 20 Republicans, Schaffner found, believes that both groups still face systematic discrimination.\n\nAs Trump more overtly identified the GOP with white racial resentments, Democrats have moved in the opposite direction. Since Obama's presidency, polls show, the share of Democrats who say that Black Americans and other minorities face structural discrimination has dramatically increased. With more Democrats describing systemic racism as a problem, the gap between the two parties on racial questions has notably widened over roughly the past 15 years.\n\nOther surveys document a further step in thinking among Republicans. Not only do a majority of Republican voters assert that structural barriers no longer constrain women or minorities; a majority also claim that core GOP constituencies are the real victims of bias.\n\nIn PRRI polling , about two-thirds of Republicans agreed that discrimination against white people is now as big a problem as bias against minorities. In a 2022 national survey, PerryUndem, a firm that polls for progressive organizations, found that about seven in 10 Republicans agreed both that \"white men are the most attacked group in the country right now\" and that \"these days society seems to punish men just for acting like men.\"\n\nTom Nichols: The pointless Nikki Haley campaign\n\nSimilarly, in a national 2021 survey conducted by a UCLA  polling project, Republicans believed there to be more discrimination against white people than against other racial groups, more against men than women, and more against Christians than other religious groups, such as Muslims and Jews. \"Republicans see a racial order in which historically privileged groups, like white Americans, are now the real victims,\" the political scientists John Sides, Chris Tausanovitch, and Lynn Vavreck wrote in their book The Bitter End , which cited the UCLA research.\n\nSides, a professor at Vanderbilt University, points out that the claim that white people are the victims of \"reverse discrimination\" has been a rallying cry for the right since the civil-rights era. But, he told me, that long-standing conservative complaint \"has become supercharged in this current climate\" because of \"the demographic reality that white Americans, and white Christian Americans, are not going to be as numerically dominant or as politically powerful as they used to be.\"\n\nAs Obama correctly noted, both Scott and Haley are following a long line of earlier nonwhite GOP candidates who similarly declared that America has transcended racial discrimination. The late Herman Cain, a Black Republican who sought the party's 2012 presidential nomination, insisted at the time , \"I don't believe racism in this country holds anybody back in a big way.\" Ben Carson, who ran against Trump for the 2016 GOP nomination and then served as his secretary of housing and urban development, offered his audiences similar assurances. Herschel Walker, the GOP nominee last year to run in Georgia against Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock, released an ad in which he declared, \"Senator Warnock believes America is a bad country full of racist people. I believe we're a great country full of generous people.\"\n\nScott and Haley have regularly issued similar pronouncements. Both have stressed America's racial progress over the past several generations. Scott has pointedly contrasted his experience with that of his late grandfather, who he said had to step off the sidewalk when a white person passed. Scott's emphasis on that progress marks a shift that his critics find jarring after his candid acknowledgments earlier in his career that he faced racial profiling from Capitol Hill police even after his election to the Senate. Scott is \"kind of whistling past the point, when you want to create this impression that there's no racism, where in the next sentence you tell us how you have been profiled by Capitol Hill police,\" Steele told me.\n\nIn their campaigns, Scott and Haley have each contended that they succeeded in life because family members encouraged them to take personal responsibility for their fate and not to identify as a victim. The same path, both say, is open today to any American regardless of race or ethnicity. \"The left,\" Scott insisted at the Hannity town hall, refuses \"to deal with America in 2023 and not 1923 because they know that the truth of my life disproves the lies of their radical agenda.\"\n\nObama, though, in his comments on The Axe Files , a podcast hosted by his former top political adviser David Axelrod , acknowledged racial progress over his lifetime: \"The good news is that I think we are closer to an approximation of the ideal than we were 100 years ago or 200 years ago.\" But he said that Scott, Haley, and the other Republicans stressing individual responsibility are disregarding the persistence of wide gaps between white Americans and racial minorities on a broad array of economic and social measures. If political leaders \"pretend as if everything's equal and fair,\" Obama said, \"then I think people are rightly skeptical\" of their commitment to ensuring equal opportunity.\n\nSteele agrees with Obama. \"I cannot give quarter to this idea that people in this country don't hold racist attitudes, No. 1, and No. 2, the institutions that a lot of these folks built reflect that racism in a variety of ways,\" he told me. Steele wants Haley and Scott to try to convince an audience of Black people otherwise. \"Come to Prince George's County, and you look Black people in the eye and tell them there's no racism,\" said Steele, who served as Maryland's lieutenant governor in the mid-2000s. \"Or let's take that conversation to Howard University. It's easy to do when you have 1,000 white people hooting and hollering at every word you say.\"\n\nCarlos Curbelo, a Cuban American Republican former U.S. representative from Miami, also believes that, for Scott, accepting the party consensus discounting racism is the prerequisite for GOP voters listening to him on anything else. \"Part of what he is banking on is that he is a man of color who is making these pronouncements,\" Curbelo told me.\n\nBut Curbelo also maintains that each side in this exchange is overstating its case. Obama and other Democrats, he says, downplay the extent to which individual minorities can now overcome discrimination, while Republicans like Scott unrealistically excuse the persistence of structural racial barriers. \"There is some validity to what he and Haley are saying,\" Curbelo told me. \"I just wish they would explain the whole issue, not just the half that is more convenient for them right now.\"\n\nAs the sparring between Obama and Scott and Haley demonstrates, the two parties appear locked in an action-and-reaction cycle that is pushing them further apart on racial questions. The more traditionally marginalized groups demand greater recognition and influence, the more aggressively conservatives push back, and vice versa. For at least the rest of this decade, that cycle seems far more likely to intensify than abate.\n\nThe Democrats' increased reliance on voters of color-and the increased focus on racial equity by the white voters in their coalition-has pressured them to direct greater attention on racial injustice in everything from school curricula to the behavior of police departments.\n\nRepublicans, whose Trump-era coalition has grown more reliant on the voters most uneasy with all the ways America is changing, have responded by digging in against these demands for new approaches. Across the red states, Republican-controlled governments are moving with remarkable speed and consistency to pass laws limiting classroom discussion of racial or gender inequities, banning books, and barring programs meant to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nRepublicans portray this wave of legislation as a fundamentally defensive attempt to prevent radical \"woke\" ideas from indoctrinating young people. But to Democrats and their allies, it's GOP officials like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis who are seeking to suppress the nation's diverse younger generations with restrictive new laws on voting, LGBTQ rights, and how teachers can discuss America's racial record.\n\nSarah Isgur: What Nikki Haley can learn from Carly Fiona\n\nPRRI's Jones, who has written several books on race and religion, offers a telling example of how the conservative approach to racial injustice has hardened. He notes that as recently as the 1990s, the deeply conservative Southern Baptist Convention, in a formal statement repudiating its role in supporting slavery , apologized \"to all African Americans for condoning and/or perpetuating individual and systemic racism in our lifetime.\"\n\nGiven the current climate on racial issues within conservative circles, Jones told me, he considers it virtually inconceivable that the Southern Baptist Convention today would acknowledge that systemic racism even exists, much less apologize for it. \"The external historical reckoning the country is going through,\" Jones told me, is prompting an \"internal response\" within the GOP that has generated a virtually lockstep rejection of racism as an ongoing problem.\n\nThere's no question that all of these cultural causes now generate more passion inside the GOP coalition than such traditional party priorities as cutting taxes, limiting regulation, and promoting a strong national defense. \"Issues related to race alongside gender identity and similar things, that's their bread and butter,\" Vanderbilt's Sides says of GOP candidates today. \"That's what they want to talk about.\"\n\nHaley and Scott have placed themselves directly in that current. Their insistence that America has moved beyond racial inequality will surely win them loud applause from a mostly white Republican primary electorate that gets an extra jolt of satisfaction from hearing a person of color validate that view. Their endorsement of those arguments may not be enough to allow either to overtake better-known, better-funded alternatives, chiefly Trump and DeSantis, who are offering very much the same case. But echoing the claim that discrimination is in the past may be their ante for any future advancement in the Trump-era GOP."

      "text": "The Senate's Only Black Republican Opens Up About Being Mistreated by Cops\n\nCiting recent killings by police, Tim Scott of South Carolina asked his colleagues to stop ignoring the struggles of those who face racial prejudice.\n\nTim Scott of South Carolina is the only black Republican in the United States Senate. This week, moved by police killings of Eric Garner, Walter Scott, and Philando Castile, he rose to the floor to deliver a moving speech about his personal history being stopped by law-enforcement officers for what amounted to driving while black. \"While I thank God that I have not endured bodily harm,\" he declared, \"I have felt the pressure applied by the scales of justice when they are slanted. I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes from feeling that you are being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself.\"\n\nThe first time he was stopped by police, his car had a malfunctioning headlight. A cop approached, hand on his gun, and told him, \"Boy, don't you know your headlight isn't working properly?\" He felt \"embarrassed, ashamed, and scared. Very scared.\"\n\nOther traffic stops followed. Skipping past many of them, he chose to focus his remarks on \"a time in my life when I was an elected official,\" noting that while he would not share every interaction, \"please remember that in the course of one year, I've been stopped seven times by law-enforcement officers. Not four, not five, not six, but seven times in one year as an elected official. Was I speeding sometimes? Sure. But the vast majority of the time I was pulled over for nothing more than driving a new car in the wrong neighborhood, or some other reason just as trivial.\"\n\nOnce incident began as he was leaving the mall.\n\n\"I took a left. And as soon as I took a left the police officer pulled in right behind me. I got to another traffic light. I took another left into a neighborhood. Police followed behind me. I took a third left on the street that led to my apartment complex. And then finally I took a fourth left coming into my apartment complex, and then the blue lights went on. The officer approached the car and said that I did not use my turn signal on the fourth turn. Keep in mind, as you might imagine, I was paying very close attention to the law-enforcement officer who followed me on four turns. Do you really think that I forgot to use my turn signal on that fourth turn?\"\n\nAnother time, he said, a cop pulled him onto a roadside median and declared that he believed the car Scott was driving might be stolen. \"I also think about the experiences of my brother, who became a Command Sergeant Major in the United States Army, the highest rank for an enlisted soldier. He was driving from Texas to Charleston,\" he said. \"Pulled over by a law-enforcement officer who wanted to know if he had stolen the car that he was driving because it was a Volvo. I do not know many African American men who do not have a very similar story to tell no matter their profession, no matter their income, no matter their disposition in life.\"\n\nA former staffer of his was the subject of one such story. He drove a Chrysler 300, \"a nice car, but not a Ferrari. He was pulled over so many times here in D.C. for absolutely no reason other than for driving a nice car.\" He sold that car to stop being targeted.\n\n\"Imagine the frustration, the irritation, the sense of a loss of dignity that accompanies each of those stops,\" Scott said, relating that even on Capitol Hill, as a member of the Senate, he has been stopped by police and asked to prove his membership.\n\n\"There is absolutely nothing more frustrating, more damaging to your soul, than when you know you're following the rules and being treated like you are not,\" he declared. \"But make no mistake. No matter this turmoil, these issues should not lead anyone to any conclusion other than to abide by the laws... there is never, ever an acceptable reason to harm a member of our law-enforcement community, ever.\"\n\nWhat did he hope to achieve with his remarks?\n\n\"Today,\" he concluded, \"I simply ask you this. Recognize that just because you do not feel the pain, the anguish of another, does not mean it does not exist. To ignore their struggles, our struggles, does not make them disappear, it simply leaves you blind and the American family very vulnerable. Some search so hard to explain away injustice that they are slowly wiping away who we are as a nation. But we must come together to fulfill what we all know is possible here: peace, love, and understanding. Fairness.\"\n\nIn future remarks Scott will propose solutions.\n\nOne solution springs immediately to my mind. In a recent article, I called for ending needless interactions between police officers and motorists during traffic stops.\n\nSubsequently, a reader turned me onto a fascinating Yale Law Journal article by Sarah Seo, who traces the bygone decision, shortly after the rise of the automobile, to charge police officers with enforcing traffic laws in addition to criminal statutes, rather than creating a separate entity to discharge that discrete task. The result: Over time, cops gained enormous discretionary power to stop and search individuals.\n\nIs it time to revisit that decision?\n\nSays Seo:\n\nThis authority has essentially become a general warrant--what the Framers actually intended to prohibit-in light of the reality that, at some point, all drivers violate traffic laws. To repeal the twentieth-century version of the general warrant and to put some limits on police discretion may require severing the two sources of power. Berkeley Police Chief August Vollmer had already proposed one way of doing so: establish a separate agency to deal with traffic. Vollmer's intention was to free the police from pesky traffic duties so it could focus on fighting crime. But a division of labor would also curb the use of traffic-law enforcement as a prelude to the criminal process, which, as Reich had pointed out, handed the police too much leverage and created opportunities for abuse.\n\nPerhaps a non-police agency charged with enforcing traffic laws could safely discharge its duties without being armed, much as parking-enforcement teams do today. In doing so, they could perhaps defuse a large part of the fear that pervades traffic stops that involve armed cops and motorists who don't know their intentions."

Tim Scott to fill Jim DeMint's Senate seat following DeMint's resignation for a top position with the Heritage Foundation. Scott will be the first black senator from the South since the 19th century. Read his profile, written by the Almanac of American Politics staff, below.\n\nRep. Tim Scott was elected to the House in 2010 to succeed the retiring GOP Rep. Henry Brown. Scott is one of two African-American Republicans in Congress and is a freshman-class representative to the GOP leadership. He earlier made history as the first black Republican elected to the South Carolina Legislature since Reconstruction.\n\nScott and his siblings were raised by a single mother who worked 16-hour days as a nurse's assistant. Scott got his first job at age 13. He was on the verge of flunking out of high school when he met the man who he says changed his life - John Moniz, the owner of the fast-food restaurant next to the movie theater where Scott worked, and where he would regularly buy french fries, the only food he could afford. Moniz, who considered himself a born-again Christian, became a father figure for Scott, teaching him the value of personal discipline and hard work, according to newspaper accounts of Scott's life. Scott finished high school and went on to earn a partial football scholarship to Presbyterian College. He eventually transferred to Charleston Southern University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science.\n\nScott ran an insurance company and owned part of a real-estate agency. His first elected office was a seat on the Charleston County Council in 1995. Just after his election, he received a handwritten note of congratulations from then-Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who had run for president on a pro-segregation platform in 1948. Thurmond's past didn't stop Scott from accepting the job as statewide co-chairman of the now-deceased Thurmond's final senatorial campaign in 1996. Asked how an African-American could help Thurmond, Scott told The New York Times , \"The Strom Thurmond I knew had nothing to do with that,\" and noted that Thurmond's views on race had evolved. Scott also said that Thurmond taught him the value of constituent service.\n\nIn the GOP primary, Scott faced opposition from candidates with better name recognition, including Carroll Campbell III, son of former South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell Jr.; and Paul Thurmond, the former senator's son. But Scott got help from national Republican organizations. He came in first in the primary and Thurmond took second, but neither got the necessary 50% to avoid a runoff. There were few differences between the two, although Thurmond did not share Scott's willingness to abide by term limits and to swear off earmarked spending. Scott claimed that in his 15 years in elected office, he has never voted for a tax increase. His conservative credentials won him praise from prominent Republicans such as former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia. In the runoff election, Scott defeated Thurmond, 68% to 32%. In the general election, he easily beat Democrat Ben Frasier, a retired federal worker, 65% to 29%. His race appeared to be a non-issue for the district's voters, about 70% of whom are white.\n\nScott opposes many of President Barack Obama's major initiatives that are backed by the liberal Congressional Black Caucus. Scott favors repeal of the health care overhaul and opposes a proposed Democratic bill to limit carbon emissions. He says he will abstain from earmarking funds for his district. Scott supports school choice and government-funded tuition vouchers, and he opposes same-sex marriage. Scott has said he will serve no more than four terms. He has a brother in the Air Force and one in the Army, and takes a strong interest in military issues."

      "text": "The Tim Scott Primary\n\nSouth Carolina's new \"kingmaker\" is about to get a lot more popular among GOP presidential candidates.\n\nWith the GOP presidential contest intensifying, Tim Scott is about to get a lot more knocks on his door.\n\nSouth Carolina is poised to play a major role in the 2016 campaign, and Scott plans to walk each of the Republican hopefuls through his state and pick their brains in a series of town-hall events that he's organizing for later this year. Unlike in 2012, when Scott held smaller town hall events with the candidates, this year he may actually endorse, offering up a prize no serious presidential contender could scoff at.\n\nThe South Carolina primary could provide an opportunity for lower-tier candidates to make their mark after contests in Iowa and New Hampshire-or for leading contenders to begin sewing up the nomination. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is expected to play well in New Hampshire's primary, while the Iowa caucuses are leaning in Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's favor (a caveat: it's April 2015), giving a quartet of senators and other candidates the chance to steal headlines of their own in the Palmetto State.\n\nScott's predecessor in the Senate, Jim DeMint, became known as the \"kingmaker\" for his influential role in picking conservative candidates for Senate contests. Now Scott is in position to play the same role in the presidential race.\n\n( RELATED: Sign up for TwentySixteen - National Journal 's daily guide to 2016 )\n\nThe first-term senator is by far the most popular politician in South Carolina, and one of the most popular in the country. A March Winthrop University poll showed Scott with a stunning 54 percent approval rating from his fellow South Carolinians. Among Republicans, a full 71 percent approve of the job he's doing in the Senate.\n\nThose approval ratings are far higher than for any of the presidential primary contenders, and support from Scott could help broaden the voter base for any of them. Scott is well-liked among the business community as well as fiscal conservatives and among evangelical Christians; a trifecta of supporters for a fledgling presidential campaign. He is well-liked among conservative groups and the establishment. And as the party's only African American in the Senate, Scott represents a core constituency that the GOP is focused on this cycle.\n\nIn a phone interview from New Hampshire, where he is testing the waters on a presidential campaign of his own this week, Sen. Lindsey Graham praised Scott as an incredibly smart, humble man; a man of faith whose popularity in the state has not surprised his senior senator. \"Tim in general is one of the nicest people I've ever met in my life in politics,\" Graham said. \"Everybody likes Tim.\"\n\nDuring the Senate's late-night budget vote-a-rama last month, Graham said he and fellow Republicans were sitting around chatting and watching basketball at around 11 p.m. when he noticed Scott off in a corner and asked what he was doing. \" 'Doing my Bible study'-he said it very sheepishly. That's just him. He's unpretentious,\" Graham said.\n\n( RELATED: Inside Jeb Bush's Stealth Campaign to Woo Christian Conservatives )\n\nGraham said that he and Scott have discussed the possibility of the senior senator's presidential campaign, but emphasized that he has not made a decision yet-and neither has Scott. \"He's been very encouraging, thinks I have a lot to offer on national security,\" Graham said. \"He says I'll make the state proud.\"\n\nA Scott spokesman said that the senator has had very general conversations with a number of potential presidential candidates, including Graham, but emphasized that he will wait until after he has had an opportunity to commune with each of them before making a decision about an endorsement.\n\nScott is planning several town hall meetings with individual candidates some time in the late summer or early fall that will occur all over the state. The idea is that Scott and the candidate will take questions from attendees, and Scott and his constituents will have an opportunity to discuss issues of importance to South Carolina with a would-be president ahead of the primary. Rep. Trey Gowdy plans to join them at a few events in the Upstate as well.\n\nOne candidate who could benefit greatly from a Scott endorsement is Sen. Rand Paul. The Kentucky Republican, who announced that he was running just this week, is honing in on South Carolina as a major target in his presidential campaign and already has earned the backing of former governor and current Rep. Mark Sanford. And Scott could help Paul in his quest to improve the party's share of the African American vote nationally.\n\nPaul, who was an avid supporter of Scott's appointment to the Senate in 2013, has not yet gotten in touch with the South Carolina senator about his presidential ambitions, the Scott spokesman said, despite a planned fundraiser and a separate campaign appearance in Charleston on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nBut Scott's endorsement will be highly sought-after. His conservative bona fides could aid candidates such as Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who are viewed as more moderate, while his business acumen could offer establishment cover to someone like Paul or Ben Carson.\n\n\"His popularity is just broad and wide, among evangelical Christians, among Chamber of Commerce types. He has a disposition that it's just hard not to like Tim Scott. He's got a lot of talent,\" Graham said. \"He's got a quiet passion.\""

      "text": "Trump's VP Search Is Different This Time\n\nHis 2024 considerations are less about logic or persuasion and more about personality.\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nBy killing her dog, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem may have also killed her chances of becoming Donald Trump's vice president. So who else is on the list? We'll get into Trump's options after four new stories from The Atlantic :\n\nTrump's Big Decision\n\nAs a reporter, it is my duty to remind you that Trump's team loves messing with the media almost as much as it loves jockeying for influence with the big man himself. Trump's advisers might dish, for example, that after careful consideration, so-and-so is off the vice-president list, and you know who is back on. They might explain that, actually, some of the usual considerations of geography and gender aren't playing a role in this VP decision.\n\nBut the truth is, none of these supposed insiders really knows much. No one has any idea what Trump is thinking, except for Trump himself. And the former president is quite famously unpredictable, with a well-established tendency to make decisions based on his most recent conversation. Predicting his Veep pick, then, is a bit futile. It's also really early: Candidates don't typically choose a running mate until around the party convention, in late summer. And Trump will likely try to milk as much media coverage as he can out of making people wait.\n\nStill, without prognosticating too much, we can anticipate what Trump is probably looking for in a vice president. He'll want someone who looks good on television but not someone who might outshine him. Someone who isn't polarizing to the MAGA base but who demonstrates range. He'll choose a candidate with experience, or at least with some record of being a winner . He is probably not looking for a politician to \"balance\" out his ticket like Mike Pence did in 2016, when Trump desperately needed to win over evangelicals.\n\nAbove all, of course, Trump will want someone unfailingly loyal to him. This time around, it's not about logic or persuasion-it's about personality. The Republican strategists Doug Heye and Mike Murphy, neither of whom are involved with the Trump campaign, walked me through some of Trump's VP options.\n\nSouth Carolina Senator Tim Scott\n\nWhy does this name keep floating around? Well, the senator, who's been in office for more than a decade, has always been popular. He's a former insurance salesman who knows how to schmooze, and, Heye told me, he's also a \"prodigious fundraiser.\" Scott never fully cozied up to Trump while the latter was president, but he didn't criticize him much either. \"He played it smart,\" Murphy told me, by not getting too close or too far. The dynamic changed when Scott launched his own presidential campaign last year. \"He was the puppy on his back, supplicant,\" even while he was running against Trump, Murphy said, and that loyalty \"will appeal to Trump.\"\n\nScott could also-the thinking goes-help Trump appeal to Black voters, who have already started peeling off from Democrats, albeit in a small way. Trump and his campaign have seemed obsessed with this task as they try to avoid a repeat of 2020, and Scott could help them do it.\n\nArkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders\n\nTrump's former press secretary was on even the earliest iterations of his 2024 VP shortlist. She is in her first term as a state governor and has enacted plenty of MAGA-style legislation. She's smart and spent two years working for Trump, which means that she's familiar with handling the D.C. media and that Trump is probably pretty comfortable with her. Having a woman like Sanders on the ticket could help Trump pick up women voters, another demographic he's struggled with. \"She's never going to have any agenda or not be the completely loyal type,\" Murphy said. \"And [she's] less of a star, so no worry of [Trump] being diminished at all.\"\n\nNorth Dakota Governor Doug Burgum\n\nBurgum has been governor for eight years and seems well liked. He's personally wealthy, like Trump, but not famous. He's ambitious, but not in a way that intimidates Trump. He ran for president this cycle too, remember? If you don't, that's probably a plus for Trump.\n\nWhen you pick a vice president, you should \"pick a slightly less impressive version of yourself,\" Murphy told me-like when Bill Clinton picked Al Gore, another moderate, Protestant white man. \"When you're John McCain, [if] you pick a Sarah Palin, it's just trouble,\" he said. Could Burgum be that slightly less impressive version of Trump?\n\nNew York Representative Elise Stefanik\n\nThis 39-year-old House Republican has been openly auditioning for the VP slot for years now. She's a gifted fundraiser and easily the most powerful Republican in New York. She has establishment bona fides-Harvard, the George W. Bush White House, aide to Paul Ryan-but has devoted herself entirely to Trump's defense and the MAGA cause. She's a competent woman who could help Trump appeal to other educated women. The problem, of course, is that he may not find her particularly authentic. \"She'd poison her mother to get two points on Election Day,\" Murphy said. \"And I think he would smell that.\"\n\nOhio Senator J. D. Vance\n\nThe Hillbilly Elegy author and former venture capitalist seems to share Trump's populist sensibilities. Vance was once a Trump critic but changed his tune when he ran for the Senate. He's ambitious in a way that Trump might read as disingenuous-probably because it is . \"If I were Trump, I'd be troubled by the fact that J. D. Vance was calling [Republican strategists] to ask about running as an anti-Trump Republican when he first looked at running statewide in Ohio,\" Murphy said. Then again, he said, \"Vance is a clever-enough chameleon to be able to suck up to Trump with skill.\"\n\nFormer Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson\n\nCarson, a former neurosurgeon, ran for president against Trump back in 2016. He worked in the administration for a while, heading up HUD. We haven't heard much from him since then, but he does seem to hang out in Trump's circles, and has been spotted at Mar-a-Lago on more than one occasion.\n\nCarson could, in theory, help Trump appeal to Black voters. But he doesn't have quite the political credentials that Scott does. \"I was meeting a friend for drinks back in February, and he said he knows for a fact that it's going to be Ben Carson,\" Heye told me. \"I'm like, 'Okay, well, one, it's February. Two, why Ben Carson?'\"\n\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio\n\nRubio is young and telegenic, with two terms in the Senate (plus a failed presidential campaign) under his belt. The son of Cuban immigrants, he could theoretically help Trump appeal to Latino voters. The problem is, Rubio would have to resign from the Senate. He'd also have to change his residence, because the Constitution bars electors from voting for a president and a vice president from the same state. Trump picking Rubio is \"completely far-fetched-with the caveat that when you're dealing with Donald Trump, far-fetched things happen,\" Heye said.\n\nKari Lake\n\nThe Arizona TV anchor turned Stop the Steal devotee would clearly love to serve as Trump's vice president. (See her here , vacuuming a red carpet for the former president.) But Lake has never actually won a race, and Trump, as we all know, prefers a winner.\n\nSouth Dakota Governor Kristi Noem\n\nShe's still on the list, because in Trumpworld anything is possible. But shooting a dog in a gravel pit? It's about the worst thing you can do for your political career.\n\nRelated:\n\nToday's News\n\nDispatches\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nRacehorses Have No Idea What's Going On\n\nBy Haley Weiss\n\nThis weekend, more than 150,000 pastel-wrapped spectators and bettors will descend upon Louisville's Churchill Downs complex to watch one of America's greatest competitive spectacles.

A number of Black lawmakers have spoken at the RNC , including South Carolina Senator Tim Scott and North Carolina Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson. Lusane says that \"Donald Trump never has anything positive to say about the Black community,\" and that his effort to showcase diversity at the RNC is to \"gaslight the Black community.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, \"War, Peace and the Presidency: Breaking with Convention.\" I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nAs the Republican National Convention enters its third day, we look now at how Donald Trump is trying to increase his appeal with Black voters. During the first presidential debate, Donald Trump slammed President Biden for allowing migrants into the country, claiming they're taking, quote, \"Black jobs.\"\n\nDONALD TRUMP : The fact is that his big kill on the Black people is the millions of people that he's allowed to come in through the border. They're taking Black jobs now. And it could be 18, it could be 19, and even 20 million people. They're taking Black jobs, and they're taking Hispanic jobs. And you haven't seen it yet, but you're going to see something that's going to be the worst in our history.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're joined right now by Howard University political science professor Clarence Lusane. His latest book is titled Twenty Dollars and Change: Harriet Tubman and the Ongoing Fight for Racial Justice and Democracy , also author of The Black History of the White House . His piece in The Nation is headlined \"Don't Believe Trump When He Claims He's Not Racist: Trump does not deserve a single Black or Hispanic vote. Nada . None.\"\n\nProfessor Lusane, thanks for joining us again on Democracy Now! Can you talk about the point that he is making - we just had a long discussion about immigration - President Trump pitting Latinos, immigrants against African Americans in this country, and the significance of this?\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : So, thank you for having me.\n\nSo, as your previous guest just pointed out, it's important to know that this idea of a replacement theory, that whites are being threatened by these cultural invaders, is something that the Donald Trump wing of the party has been using ever since Donald Trump stepped onto the national stage.\n\nThe article I wrote in The Nation was to point out that we don't have to memory hole what Donald Trump's history of racism has been, but, more importantly, also who has supported Donald Trump. Ever since he stepped onto the stage, every avowed racist in the country - Ku Klux Klaners, neo-Nazis, avowed fascists - have backed Donald Trump. And he's been able to get away with that kind of support, because in many ways the media has evaded questioning him about that.\n\nBut this has become the way in which the Republican Party in 2024, a party of grievance, extremism and racism, operates and functions. And so, it's really critical to not let this memory be lost of Donald Trump's policies and behavior over the last number of years, and how that has permeated the Republican Party.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : As you point out, in a recent interview in Time magazine, Trump suggested the problem was really anti-white racism. \"If you look right now, there's absolutely a bias against white [people] and that's a problem,\" Trump said. Your response, Professor Lusane?\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : So, Trump again is leaning in to his base. And what the data is showing is that for at least the last 10 years or so, if not even before then, that a majority of whites, and particularly Republican voters, believe that racism in this country exists against white people, that Black people, that Latinos, that Asians basically do not have issues with institutional or systemic racism, but it's actually whites that are being targeted.\n\nAnd this isn't just kind of rhetoric. This is actually manifesting itself both in the Republican Party platform and Republican Party activists. Stephen Miller, for example, who your earlier guest referenced, heads up America First Legal. Its entire purpose is to go after what they argue are racism, racist attacks against whites. So, America First Legal has filed lawsuit after lawsuit after lawsuit against private sector entities that they claim are discriminating particularly against white males.\n\nAnd so, when Donald Trump says that anti-white racism is actually a thing, he is very serious that his second administration, if he comes to power, will operate on that. He has pledged, for example, that he will end every DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion - program that exists anywhere in the federal government. Now, that's not just talking about specific programs about diversity; that's talking about any effort in any branch of government to recognize that there needs to be inclusive hiring, there needs to be inclusive policies. So, this is a very real tactic on the part of Donald Trump.\n\nThe problem is that it actually conflicts with what they're trying to do and win Black voters. Donald Trump recognizes that in the swing states - in Georgia, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, in all of these key battleground states - the Black vote has been extremely decisive in helping the Democrats. So, they have to figure out a way to either drive down the vote for the Democrats or, if possible, if they can win votes. But that's very difficult to do, given Donald Trump's record and history.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On Monday, Democracy Now! 's Renée Feltz was on the floor of the convention. She spoke to a man wearing a large cowboy hat who was attending the RNC with members of the Florida delegation.\n\nLARRY WILCOXSON : Larry Wilcoxson, from Florida.\n\nRENÉE FELTZ : And are you here as part of the delegation?\n\nLARRY WILCOXSON : I'm just here.\n\nRENÉE FELTZ : All right. Can you say a little bit about why you're here?\n\nLARRY WILCOXSON : I'm here to support the president, Donald J. Trump. That's the only reason why I'll come here.\n\nRENÉE FELTZ : It sounded like he might have even been talking to people like you, his supporters, when he spoke about preserving Black jobs. Can you talk about, you know, what that might have meant to you? And what's the difference between Black jobs and other jobs, for example?\n\nLARRY WILCOXSON : See, I think a lot of stuff be taken out of context. And what he mean was just mid-level jobs. I mean, and that's just the truth, mid-level jobs as far as, like, trades. Those are mid-level jobs to me. And so, that's what he meant. And, yes, a lot of illegals are coming over here, a lot of migrants coming over here, and that's the jobs they're getting, because a lot of our own employees' employers, they're hiring those individuals for cheaper wages. And that's just the truth.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Your response, Professor Clarence Lusane?\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : So, when Donald Trump refers to \"the Black people\" and he refers to \"Black jobs,\" what he said is that his view of where Black people fit in this country, in employment, in culture and otherwise, is always at the bottom. Donald Trump never has anything positive to say about the Black community. He never talks about Black doctors, for example, or Black engineers or Black accountants or Black people who are in many, many different professions up and down the spectrum of employment. He essentially sees, through racist-tinted eyes, Black people at the very, very bottom. And that's how he sees immigrants, or, to be more precise, immigrants of color. And so, that's the conflict that he's trying to pitch.\n\nBut what the data shows, of course, what the Department of Labor shows, is that in every single area of occupation, you have Black people, you have Latinos, you have Asians, kind of across the spectrum. And so, Donald Trump, though, feeds into this narrative among conservatives that there are categories of work for certain people, and that that is how he then seeds attacking immigrants and creating, again, this conflict between the Black community and the immigrant community.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On Tuesday night, Democracy Now! 's Messiah Rhodes caught up with Forgiato Blow, a pro-Trump rapper, who debuted his video, \"Trump Trump Baby,\" featuring Amber Rose, at the RNC , a day after she spoke. This is what he said to Messiah.\n\nFORGIATO BLOW : I've been supporting Trump, like, die-hard since 2015. Before that, I was with Rick Ross, French Montana, a lot of big-name rappers, had a lot of big-name songs, so I was already very successful in that side of the industry, you know, grinding my way in.\n\nBut Donald Trump was like the boss. You know what I mean? He's getting money. He's a rapper's dream, you know? He's out here now dodging bullets, getting indictments. He's a real rapper.\n\nBut, you know, back in 2016, when he came in, it was just about proving people wrong. That's one thing I'm big on. Nobody believed that he would be the president. He knocked that door down, right?\n\nHe's very successful. He's made a lot of money. He's got the beautiful wife, nice cars. So, it was just, you know, being young, trying to chase that dream and be like Trump - you know what I'm saying? - and just have a positive role model to look up to. ...\n\nAnd even though at one time we didn't see eye to eye, I could bring you in. Amber Rose, she spoke yesterday. She's a model. She was big against Trump for years. I have a new video that just came out with her, a song called \"Trump Trump Baby.\" She's on the song. It's number eight on Billboard right now.\n\nBut the thing is, a lot of people don't realize, like, we need new voters. Right? So, when these people - like, you know, we're out here making all this content for Donald Trump and, you know, trying to sell Donald Trump on people, and they're not buying it, and then, when they finally buy it five years later, and we're like, \"Boo! You can't do it,\" that hurts us. We need to get the new voters. We need new voters and to get people equal opportunity.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Soon after they spoke, rapper Forgiato Blow and Amber Rose took the stage of the RNC .\n\nFORGIATO BLOW : Yeah, it's the mayor of Magaville, baby! Amber Rose! Hey, you know who we voting for! We voting Donald Trump, baby. Donald Trump, baby. America needs saving. America needs saving! We voting Trump, Trump, baby. Trump, Trump, baby. November 5th we going crazy. November 5th we going crazy!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's rapper Forgiato Blow and Amber Rose, \"Trump Trump Baby.\" Professor Clarence Lusane, your response to the appeal that President Trump is making right now and what rapper Forgiato Blow is saying?\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : So, what we see with Forgiato Blow and Amber Rose, as well as the Black congressmembers, Republican congressmembers, that they're bringing on stage is this effort to basically gaslight the Black community on what really has been the Donald Trump record. And so, what we see is this argument that the Democrats have for decades created the circumstances under which Black people are living in the worst conditions possible, and that somehow Donald Trump will be able to overcome that, although there's literally no record of that.\n\nTim Scott, for example, who's the senator from South Carolina, gave a speech on Monday where he argued that racism - America is not a racist country, that, essentially, racial discrimination, systemic and institutional, don't exist. In fact, Tim Scott should look at his own state, South Carolina. South Carolina is one of the poorest states in the country, as are many of the states that are controlled by the Republican Party. In South Carolina, the governor is Republican. The two senators to the Congress are Republicans. Six out of the seven House members are Republican, James Clyburn being the exception. The state Legislature, controlled by Republicans. And what we see is this is a state where poverty is high, is above the national average. But then, when you break it down, about 9% to 10% of whites in the state fall under that poverty line, but almost 25%, almost a quarter, of Black people. How do you explain that? Tim Scott explains it by saying that, essentially, it's those people's fault. It has nothing to do with the policies of the state, has nothing to do with systemic racism.\n\nBut we're talking generations of ways in which people, again, across these Republican states have been mired in poverty, and, again, disproportionately racialized. And if you look at educational attainment, you look at access to healthcare, in all of these situations, racial disparities tend to manifest. But none of this is being addressed by the Tim Scotts, the Ben Carsons, the Amber Roses and the other people of color that they're putting on stage at the Republican convention, because those are inconvenient truths.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Clarence Lusane, I want to thank you for being with us, political science professor at Howard University, director of the International Affairs Program there. His piece in The Nation , we'll link to, headlined \"Don't Believe Trump When He Claims He's Not Racist.\"\n\nComing up, a jury has convicted New Jersey Democratic Senator Bob Menendez. We'll get more.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Trump won by about 11 percentage points: He received about 54.5% of the vote; Haley received about 43%. On Tuesday night, Nikki Haley vowed to stay in the race.\n\nNikki Haley : \"Well, I have news for all of them: New Hampshire is first in the nation; it is not the last in the nation. This race is far from over.\"\n\nDuring his victory speech, Donald Trump stood alongside two of his former rivals, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott and Vivek Ramaswamy. Trump called Haley an imposter and falsely claimed he had won the general election in New Hampshire twice before, even though he lost to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and to Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nDonald Trump : \"This is a great, great state. You know, we won New Hampshire three times now. Three. Three. We win it every time. We win the primary. We win the generals. We've won it. And it's a very, very special place to me. It's very important.\"\n\nWith his victory on Tuesday, Trump becomes the first nonincumbent Republican candidate to win both the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary in the modern era, as he moves closer to a rematch with President Joe Biden in November.\n\nIsrael has killed at least 210 Palestinians in Gaza over the past 24 hours as it intensifies its bombardment of the city of Khan Younis. Israel has issued new evacuation orders to over 500,000 Palestinians in Khan Younis, where many had sought refuge from Israel's attacks in the northern Gaza Strip. On Tuesday, at least six Palestinians died when a missile hit one of the U.N.'s largest shelters in Khan Younis.\n\nAt the United Nations, Secretary-General António Guterres reiterated his call for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nSecretary-General António Guterres : \"The entire population of Gaza is enduring destruction at a scale and speed without parallel in recent history. Nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.\"\n\nGuterres went on to criticize statements by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders opposing a two-state solution.\n\nSecretary-General António Guterres : \"Last week's clear and repeated rejection of the two-state solution at the highest level of the Israeli government is unacceptable. ... This refusal and the denial of the right to statehood to the Palestinian people will indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security.\"\n\nGuterres's comments came as The Wall Street Journal reports a group of five Arab countries have proposed a plan to end the war in Gaza and create a pathway toward a Palestinian state. As part of the deal, Saudi Arabia would also recognize the state of Israel.\n\nIsrael has revealed more details about how 21 Israeli soldiers died in a single incident in Gaza on Monday. The IDF says the reservists were planting explosive mines to blow up two buildings in eastern Gaza. During a firefight, Hamas militants hit one of the mines, setting off a chain reaction that toppled the buildings with Israeli troops trapped inside. Israel says the buildings were being leveled to create a so-called buffer zone in eastern Gaza. The Intercept reports this appears to be the first time the Israeli military has publicly admitted that it's systematically destroying whole areas of Gaza with the intent of depopulating the area.\n\nPresident Biden traveled to Virginia Tuesday for a campaign rally focused on abortion rights. Biden's speech was interrupted at least 13 times by protesters calling for him to support a ceasefire in Gaza. One protester screamed out, \"Genocide Joe, how many kids have you killed today?\"\n\nProtester : \"Genocide Joe, how many kids have you killed today?\"\n\nBiden supporters : \"Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\"\n\nThe New York Police Department has launched an investigation after pro-Palestinian students at Columbia University were sprayed on Friday with a hazardous, foul-smelling chemical during a protest on campus. Eight students were hospitalized. The group Students for Justice in Palestine has alleged the chemical attack was carried out by two students who are former members of the Israeli military. No arrests have been made yet.\n\nThe U.S. military has carried out strikes inside both Yemen and Iraq as fears of a regional war in the Middle East grow. In Iraq, the U.S. hit three sites connected to a militia with ties to Iran. Iraq's national security adviser, Qassem al-Araji, condemned the attack, saying, \"The U.S. should pile on pressure for a halt to the Israeli offensive in Gaza rather than targeting and bombing the bases of an Iraqi national body.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. bombed Yemen again earlier today, targeting what officials described as Houthi anti-ship missiles. This comes as Houthi forces continue to target commercial ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden as part of a campaign to pressure Israel to halt its assault on Gaza.\n\nA Russian transport plane reportedly carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war has crashed in Russia's Belgorod region near Ukraine. According to Russian media, all 74 people on board died. Russia's Foreign Ministry has accused Ukraine of downing the military plane but provided no evidence. Ukraine said it is investigating what happened, and has accused Russia of \"carrying out special information operations directed against Ukraine.\"\n\nThe crash comes a day after at least 18 Ukrainians were killed and 130 were injured as Russia fired a barrage of missiles at several cities, including Kyiv and Kharkiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said 130 residential buildings were struck in the attacks on Tuesday.\n\nIn other news from Europe, Sweden is now a step closer to joining the NATO military alliance. On Tuesday, the Turkish parliament voted to finally approve Sweden's membership. This leaves Hungary as the only country remaining that needs to approve Sweden's accession. This comes as 90,000 troops from the United States and other NATO nations are preparing to take part in NATO's largest military drills since the Cold War.\n\nThe Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is warning the world remains as close to global annihilation as ever before. The Bulletin has announced its Doomsday Clock remains at 90 seconds before midnight, where it was first set for the first time last year. Princeton University professor Alex Glaser spoke on Tuesday.\n\nAlex Glaser : \"When we set the clock last year, there were major concerns that nuclear weapons could be used in Ukraine. And today's clock setting was still overshadowed by the war in Ukraine, but also the war in Gaza, which has caused enormous human suffering and could lead to a broader conflict in the region involving several nuclear weapon states and regional powers.\"\n\nA U.S. federal appeals court has revived a $10 billion lawsuit filed by the Mexican government against U.S. gunmakers. In 2021, Mexico sued six gun manufacturers, including Glock and Smith & Wesson, for aiding and abetting the unlawful transfer of hundreds of thousands of guns annually into Mexico, helping to fuel drug cartel violence. Mexico estimates 70% of the guns trafficked into Mexico come from the United States.\n\nIn related news, Mexico is calling on the Biden administration to investigate how drug cartels are increasingly obtaining U.S. military-grade weapons, including rocket launchers, grenades and belt-fed machine guns.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times has laid off about 115 journalists, slashing the size of its newsroom by 20%. Many of those who lost their job were journalists of color, including Jean Guerrero, who was the only Latina columnist for the opinion desk. The paper also laid off its only reporters who focused on covering Black and Asian communities in Southern California. The layoffs are the largest at the L.A. Times since billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong bought the paper in 2018.\n\nIn other media news, Time magazine has laid off 30 journalists - that's 15% of its unionized editorial staff. Meanwhile, The Baltimore Sun is in a state of turmoil after it was recently purchased by David Smith, the chair of the right-wing news network Sinclair."

Tim Scott (R-S.C.) on Wednesday after the Republican made a wild claim to defend Donald Trump for threatening to hit John Deere with a 200% tariff should he win the election.\n\nThe Trump surrogate, who has gone to bat for the former president's \"Black jobs\" remarks and pushed conspiracy theories to support him, was asked by \"Squawk Box\" host Joe Kernen about the GOP nominee's plans to impose such a tariff on the agricultural equipment company if it brings some of its manufacturing in the U.S. to Mexico.\n\n\"You agree with all the tariffs. Do you think John Deere, 200% ? Do you think companies that make stuff here should have a 15% tax ? That's industrial policy, isn't it?\" Kernen asked of Trump, whose tariff proposals have prompted warnings by economists .\n\n\"I believe that President Trump oftentimes talks in the abstract, number one,\" Scott replied.\n\nAs he attempted to continue, co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin interrupted, \"What are we supposed to believe then?\"\n\nScott has previously criticized Trump after the GOP nominee entertained imposing a 10% tariff on all imported goods in 2023.\n\n\"An across-the-board 10% [tariff would] increase in the cost of everything,\" Scott told the New York Post at the time .\n\n\"In the current inflationary environment [that] would not be helpful.\"\n\nScott, in his CNBC appearance, called for the co-hosts to evaluate Trump's \"performance\" between 2017 to 2020 - one year before he left office.\n\n\"We should believe the 7 million jobs that he created and two-thirds of those jobs went to African Americans, Hispanics, and women,\" Scott declared. \"We should actually believe what he produced.\"\n\n\"Obviously, that excludes Covid, right?\" Sorkin said. \"Part of what you're saying is we should sort of take this time out period around Covid and not include that in.\"\n\n\"That's not what I'm saying at all,\" Scott argued. \"I would actually say that if you look at Covid itself, specifically, they said that you couldn't get a vaccine in 10 years or five years. He did it in nine months.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Tim Scott wouldn't give a straight answer when asked if he would commit to accepting the result of the 2024 presidential election ― no matter who wins.\n\nDuring an appearance Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" the South Carolina Republican repeatedly deflected questions about the election outcome, telling moderator Kristen Welker there won't be any issues since former President Donald Trump is already the inevitable victor.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the 47th president of the United States will be President Donald Trump,\" said Scott, who is reportedly being considered as a vice presidential pick.\n\nAsked for a simple yes or no, he replied, \"That is my statement.\"\n\nWelker pressed several more times before Scott told her, \"The American people will make the decision, and the decision will be for President Trump.\"\n\nMore back and forth did nothing to move the politician, who went on to accuse the left-leaning television network of bias.\n\n\"This is why so many Americans believe that NBC is an extension of the Democratic Party ,\" Scott claimed.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I said what I said,\" he went on. \"I know that the American people, their voices will be heard, and I believe that President Trump will be our next president. It's that simple.\"\n\nTrump, who continues to claim the 2020 election results were rigged, has also left open the possibility of challenging this cycle's winner.\n\n\"If everything's honest, I'd gladly accept the results,\" he told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel earlier this month. \"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Tim Scott's Run For President Was Never Real, And Neither Was He\n\nOpinion Editor\n\nGoodbye, Sen. Tim Scott! We barely knew you.\n\nNo, literally, we don't know you. If the South Carolina Republican were walking down the street wearing a hoodie with the words \"HI EVERYONE, I'M SEN. TIM SCOTT!\" on the front, I'd argue that still no one would know him.\n\nAnd Republicans want it that way.\n\nOn Fox News' \" Sunday Night In America with Trey Gowdy ,\" a show watched only by Republicans, Scott announced Sunday that he is no longer running for president.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to getting back on the campaign trail without question,\" Scott told Gowdy, a former U.S. representative from South Carolina. \"But when I go back to Iowa, it will not be as a presidential candidate. I am suspending my campaign.\"\n\nIf Tim Scott drops out of the presidential race, does it make a sound?\n\nDoes anyone wonder why we learned of Scott's girlfriend right before he left the race? I mean, he literally introduced America to \"Mindy Noce, an interior designer and mother of three from Charleston, South Carolina,\" opening her up to scrutiny just before telling the waitress to \"hold the presidential campaign, I couldn't eat another bite.\"\n\nA bizarre turn of events for a candidate who seemed to have the support of major donors, having accumulated some $22 million in donations and a $35 million bump into the senator's super PAC, Opportunity Matters Fund, from Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle Corporation.\n\nSo if it wasn't money, then what stopped the lone Black Republican senator, who had the opportunity to possibly become the first Black GOP presidential nominee, from continuing his campaign? Well, Tim Scott is not a full-throated, full-fledged politician, as he's allowed himself to become a Republican sideshow who wasn't quite ready for the big stage.\n\nTo understand Tim Scott is to understand America's relationship ― more specifically, white America's relationship ― with the Black friend. Since the beginning of time, there has always been a Black friend, sometimes as a guardian (think Jim in \" Huckleberry Finn\" ), or the voice of God (again, Jim in \" Huckleberry Finn\" ), or just literally God (think Morgan Freeman in \" Bruce Almighty\" ).\n\nThe main role of the Black friend has always been to propel his white counterpart. Never the main attraction, the Black friend is always a sounding board to show the moral qualities of their white protagonist. So Tim Scott has become a caricature of an archetype. When a Republican says he has a Black friend, he's referring to Tim Scott. Whenever Republicans have been accused of being racist, they bring up Tim Scott. Remember, after the massacre last year in Buffalo, New York ― where a white man walked into a grocery store and killed 10 Black people and wounded three more ― there was a huge conversation about whether America is a racist country? It was Tim Scott who argued, honestly, as the lone Black senator in the Republican Party and one of only 13 Black senators in the country's history, that America doesn't have a race problem.\n\nDuring his speech, Scott said he's \"experienced the pain of discrimination.\" But he cautioned that \"race is not a political weapon to settle every issue the way one side wants.\" This was said by a Black man who truly believes that he worked harder than other Black folks to become a member of Congress, and not that Congress has a race problem.\n\nScott is a lap dog who does it all for the head rubs because the white gaze is a powerful drug. He learned during his brief campaign that he wasn't ready for prime time, having spent the majority of his career as a sideshow. Prime time means that all parts of your life get examined. I'm guessing Scott felt it necessary to bring out his girlfriend because he was getting tired of the speculation about his sexuality .\n\nThis is the dirty part of politics that is actually one of the only areas of true bipartisanship: minding other people's business. Whatever Scott does in his private life is his business, and he shouldn't be forced to parade his partner as proof of anything. He should be allowed a full life with whomever he chooses, but this is the problem when you've always been an opening act.\n\nTim Scott has never been a fully actualized politician. At this point, he is a kindergartner's drawing of a politician from memory. Scott is a Black man who was endorsed by the National Rifle Association during his run for Senate in South Carolina, which means he believes that America doesn't have a race problem or a gun problem. And the two have collided more than once in Scott's own backyard. Think about this: Scott was a senator in South Carolina on June 17, 2015, when 21-year-old Dylann Roof walked into Charleston's Emanuel AME Church and shot and killed nine Black people after having been welcomed into the church for Bible study. This was not a random attack. Roof, a white supremacist, targeted the church because of its history and its connection to the Black community. Scott didn't just lose constituents on that day. He lost his friend, senior pastor and state Sen. Clementa C. Pinckney.\n\n\"I remember Wednesday, June 17, 2015, like it was yesterday,\" Scott wrote in a 2020 op-ed for The Post and Courier titled \" We Must Meet Racism with Love and Peace .\" \"I had just finished having dinner with my good friend, U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, in Washington, D.C., and was sitting on my bed when the phone rang.\"\n\n\"It was the Charleston County Sheriff's Office with news of the shooting at Emanuel AME Church,\" Scott wrote. \"I texted the Rev. Clementa Pinckney: 'Are you okay?'\"\n\nBut that still wasn't enough for Scott to support commonsense gun laws. He either punted ― like he did after the 2019 mass killing in Odessa, Texas, where Scott claimed that mental illness was to blame, and that he needed more information on private gun sales before he could take a position ― or else he simply voted in lockstep with other Republicans to uphold America's allegiance to the Second Amendment.\n\nWhen the people of South Carolina demanded that something be done after losing nine members of their community to racist gun violence, Scott and Gov. Nikki Haley, a fellow Republican, decided that it was finally time to take down the Confederate flag.\n\nWait , I hear you say. Nine people died in a racist, savage killing, and all they did was remove a flag?\n\nYes.\n\n\"The Confederate battle flag did not cause the hateful, racist actions that left nine families and our entire state grieving, and it remains part of our state's rich and provocative history. But for so many, the flag signifies pain and division that has no home here, and that does not represent the present or the future of our great state,\" Scott said on July 9, 2015, less than a month after the Emanuel AME slayings.\n\n\"I do not believe that the vast majority of those who support the flag have hate in their hearts,\" he said. \"But it is clear that this is the right step forward for our state.\"\n\nI'm confused as to why a definitive act to denounce not only racism, but a symbol of hate and the continuation of slavery, feels like an apology. But such is life for the lone Black Republican senator: always sorry, even when you're doing the right thing.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Log in to hide these messages.\n\nThe truth of the matter is this: No matter how much Scott allowed himself to be a trophy for Republicans, they were never going to choose a Black man as their presidential nominee. Strom Thurmond would roll over in his grave so much, it would sound like a rock tumbler.\n\nBut the real reason Scott dropped out of the race was because of one fact he was forced to accept; one fact he couldn't deny; one fact that he couldn't pretend didn't exist - he was never a viable candidate .\n\n\"He never cracked 4 percent in 538's average of national polls ,\" ABC News noted Tuesday. \" He plowed much of his campaign cash into TV ads in early states , and that did seem to work at first: By mid-August, according to 538's averages, he was polling at 12 percent in Iowa , 12 percent in South Carolina (his home state) and 8 percent in New Hampshire . \"\n\nIt may be difficult to admit that America was built on a foundation of racism, or that loose gun laws make it easier for bad actors to get access to firearms. But it's hard to stare reality in the face and realize that no matter how much you shine yourself up to make yourself presentable to the folks whose acceptance you desperately want, you are still a Black man, and the group you've aligned yourself with will always have a problem with that."

      "text": "Sen. Tim Scott Marries Fiancee Mindy Noce In South Carolina Ceremony\n\nBreaking News Reporter, HuffPost\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott is now a married man.\n\nThe Republican lawmaker and one-time presidential candidate wed Mindy Noce on Saturday at their home church in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, according to multiple outlets, including local paper The Post and Courier.\n\n\"Tonight, we promised to cherish and nourish each other and our marriage for the rest of our lives,\" he later posted on Facebook with photos from the ceremony.\n\nAmong those in attendance were Republican Sens. John Thune (S.D.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), James Lankford (Okla.), and John Barrasso (Wyo.), former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), former Sen. Cory Gardner (Colo.), former Rep. Trey Gowdy (S.C.), and former Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, according to local station WCBD .\n\nFormer President Donald Trump expressed his congratulations to the couple on social media.\n\n\"You have a GREAT future. God bless you both!\" he wrote .\n\nThe ceremony comes roughly six months after the couple announced their whirlwind engagement , and nine months after their relationship was first put in the public spotlight.\n\nNoce, 47, a previously married interior designer and mother of three who resides in Charleston, was first publicly introduced as Scott's partner while he was campaigning for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination in November and had just wrapped up a primary debate in Miami. Scott, 58, at the time said that he and Noce had been dating for several months.\n\nHer primetime TV debut followed Scott repeatedly getting hammered about his relationship status while on the campaign trail. It was pointed out that an unwed man hadn't been elected president since Grover Cleveland in 1884, and Cleveland later married while in the White House. Top GOP donors also reportedly expressed concern about his bachelor status.\n\nScott at the time dismissed such opinions about his relationship status as archaic.\n\n\"It sounds like we're living in 1963 and not 2023,\" Scott told Axios last year.\n\nIn an interview Friday with The Post and Courier, Scott said he prayed for a wife nearly every week for the last 30 years. But today he's grateful to have met Noce exactly when he did.\n\n\"Part of the blessing for me was not getting married before now,\" he said, saying that he needed more time for self-growth. \"Right girl, wrong time is a mess. Wrong girl, right time is chaos.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Tim Scott (R-S.C.) tried to distract from real questions about gun control when asked about the Supreme Court's recent decision to reverse a ban on bump stocks during an appearance on ABC's \"This Week\" Sunday morning.\n\nThe South Carolina politician turned his attention to President Joe Biden and immigration when asked about the court overturning a Trump-era ban on the gun accessory, which Scott previously said he'd help pass into law.\n\n\"What we need to focus on is the violence we're seeing across the nation,\" Scott told journalist Jonathan Karl. \"Under Joe Biden, communities have been devastated and ravaged by a wave of violent crime that we haven't seen in five decades.\"\n\n\"Focusing on ways for us to reduce that crime means getting four more years of Donald Trump ,\" added Scott, who is said to be on the short list for the Republican vice presidential pick.\n\nScott got a swift fact-check from Karl, who reminded him, \"Actually senator, as you probably know, the latest stats on violent crime and on the murder rate show they're actually down this past year.\"\n\nAccording to a report from the FBI released last week, violent crime dropped 15% nationwide during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThough the senator said it was \"nice to see\" the numbers \"plateau,\" he claimed the threat of violent crime was leaving people \"trapped in their houses\" from sundown to sunrise.\n\nKarl tried to return to the topic of bump stocks, asking Scott if he'd still back a bump stock ban, a move which he said would \"fly through congress\" in 2018. The politician again punted and said, \"Well, I'm strongly in support of the 2nd Amendment.\"\n\nThe Trump administration tried to ban bump stocks through executive action after the attachments were used during the 2017 attack on a Las Vegas music festival which killed 60 people. The tragedy remains the deadliest mass shooting in American history.\n\nWhen Karl returned to his question, Scott shifted the blame to immigrants crossing the southern U.S. border.\n\n\"We're gonna focus on the priorities of the American people, and what the priorities of the American people are today is to focus on closing our southern border,\" he said.\n\n\"Under Donald Trump, we had a precipitous drop in illegal border crossings ... under Joe Biden, we've seen an explosion. Ten million illegal immigrants have invaded our country, leading to migrant crime that we just saw just yesterday.\"\n\n\"OK, so you're not going to answer that question,\" Karl concluded.\n\nWatch ABC's full interview with Tim Scott here:\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas).\n\nBut in an interview with The Root on Friday, Scott attempted to defend the former president.\n\n\"I think what he meant to say was the fact that two-thirds of the jobs he created ... went to African Americans, Hispanics, and women,\" Scott said. \"I think we should take a whole look at the picture, and I don't think that happens.\"\n\nHe added that when looking at inflammatory comments, \"a lot of people close their eyes if it's a Democrat,\" later mentioning a conversation Biden had with \"The Breakfast Club's\" Charlamagne Tha God during his 2020 presidential bid where he told voters , \"if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't Black.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Tim Scott Tries Spinning A 2020 Question And Jake Tapper's Look Says It All\n\nReporter, HuffPost\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) on Sunday dodged CNN anchor Jake Tapper's question on whether he would have certified President Joe Biden 's 2020 election win over Donald Trump had he been vice president on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nTapper noted how Scott's fellow vice presidential hopefuls, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), have both said they wouldn't have done so had they been in the shoes of then-Vice President Mike Pence .\n\n\"Would you have?\" Tapper pointedly asked Scott.\n\nScott said he wasn't \"going to answer hypothetical questions,\" claimed he \"didn't know that I was a vice presidential hopeful,\" and thanked Tapper \"for letting me know where I am on the scale\" before pivoting to lavishing praise on former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Having four more years of President Donald Trump means that we'll have low inflation, low crime, we'll have record low unemployment,\" said Scott, who ran against Trump in the GOP presidential primary, but then abandoned his campaign in November to become one of the biggest boosters of his onetime rival.\n\nTapper looked unimpressed with the response. The anchor later noted how Scott had voted to certify the election results in the Senate and had previously said Pence \"absolutely did the right thing.\"\n\n\"I have not changed my view,\" said Scott, who was mocked last month for telling Trump on stage, \" I just love you .\"\n\nScott then added to Tapper, \"You are asking a hypothetical question that you know can never happen again.

As the chair of the Senate committee that oversees the agency, Tim Scott wants to reinstate these junk fees - a key priority for his donors in finance.\n\nTim Scott  speaks during a hearing of the Senate Banking Committee on May 18, 2023, in Washington, DC. (Anna Moneymaker / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAs the Trump administration dismantles key consumer protection agencies, the Senate Republican now tasked with overseeing these financial regulators has received millions from banking and financial interests, defended their right to charge \"junk fees,\" and just introduced a resolution allowing banks to once again charge customers unnecessarily high fees when they overdraft their accounts.\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R-SC) has received more than $5.3 million in campaign donations from banking, securities, and investment interests since 2009. His largest individual donors include financial executives who have given him nearly $1 million to fund his campaign efforts, and he's taken thousands from donors affiliated with major banks targeted by financial regulators for excessive overdraft fees, according to federal data we reviewed.\n\nAs the newly elected chair of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Scott is responsible for setting the agenda of the committee, which oversees key federal banking and financial regulatory agencies such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Scott has promised to support cutting CFPB funding to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, slash regulations for credit lending, and help cryptocurrencies and fintech platforms become more entrenched within the traditional banking systems.\n\nOn February 13, Scott and Rep. French Hill (R-AR) introduced a resolution that would roll back a recent CFPB rule placing a $5 cap on what most banks can charge customers when they overdraft their accounts. Prior to the new rule, such overdraft fees earned banks billions of dollars each year, a practice Scott passionately defended by calling the CFPB's overdraft reform efforts a \"smear campaign\" against big banks.\n\n\"The Biden administration's CFPB routinely targeted legitimate payment incentives and practices in pursuit of political headlines over sound policies,\" Scott said in a statement . \"The overdraft rule was yet another example - many consumers rely on overdraft services to make ends meet and limiting this practice will push Americans to riskier financial products.\"\n\n\"I'm proud to lead the effort to overturn this misguided rule and protect Americans' access to important financial services,\" he added.\n\nIt's no coincidence that Scott is trying to roll back junk fee protections after receiving millions from banking and financial interests, said Bartlett Naylor, financial policy adviser at the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen.\n\n\"It's impossible to divorce the financial sector [campaign] contributions and the resulting policy,\" Naylor told us. \"One joins the Banking Committee because it's a lucrative source of campaign contributions. That's certainly true of Republicans; it's also true of Democrats.\"\n\nAccording to comment letters we reviewed, Scott twice wrote to the CFPB during the Biden administration in support of allowing financial institutions to charge consumers high overdraft and credit card late fees.\n\n\"The CFPB has launched a relentless smear campaign against banks that offer optional overdraft services to their customers,\" Scott and other Republican senators on the Banking Committee wrote in a September 12, 2022, comment letter to the CFPB. \"Charging fees that customers chose to pay should not be disturbing or illegal, and yet, the CFPB appears to have developed a particular disdain for banks charging their customers for services, pejoratively calling overdraft protection 'junk fees.'\"\n\nScott and other Republican senators sent ten letters to the CFPB between April 2021 and July 2024. The letters span a variety of issues and range from \"modest questions to acerbic, antagonistic, aggressive questions of the regulator,\" Naylor said, adding that Scott \"is not a friend to the American consumer.\"\n\nSome financial experts argue that overdraft fee collection is an unnecessary banking practice designed to exploit consumers for profit. In 2021, regulators found the average penalty for consumers for overdrawing their bank accounts was around $35, and such charges earn banks billions of dollars in revenue each year.\n\nScott has a history of defending banks that have preyed on consumers , and his tenure as the chair of the Senate Banking Committee comes amid a widespread effort by the Trump administration to dismantle consumer protections and financial regulatory bodies.\n\nScott's office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn February 8, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent ordered CFPB staff to suspend nearly all of their activities, including supervision of financial institutions. The following day, Bessent ordered all bureau employees to stay home because the CFPB headquarters would be closed for a week. And two days after that, Donald Trump announced his choice for a permanent CFPB chief: Jonathan McKernan, a former banking regulator who has opposed increased oversight of bank mergers and protections for bank customers.\n\nThe same day Scott announced his intention to roll back overdraft fee limits, more than 185 Democratic Senators and House members wrote a letter claiming that the Trump administration \"has effectively fired the financial cop on the beat\" by trying to shutter the CFPB.\n\nThe CFPB was established in 2010 in the aftermath of the 2008 financial collapse, during which more than six million people lost their homes due to foreclosure and more than thirty million people lost their jobs. While other agencies like the Justice Department, the SEC, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission focus mostly on white-collar crimes, the CFPB is tasked with policing large financial institutions as well as debt collectors, payday lenders, and mortgage providers and protecting consumers from unfair financial practices.\n\nSince 2010, the bureau has returned more than $20 billion to consumers who were victims of financial scams, fraud, and other predatory practices. For example, in 2024, the CFPB ordered a group of credit repair companies to return more than $1.8 billion to 4.3 million consumers for charging illegal fees and using deceptive marketing practices.\n\nThe bureau has also focused on eliminating \"junk fees\" that banks and other financial institutions charge consumers for overdrawing their accounts and restricting other practices, such as capping how much credit card companies can charge for late payments. In 2019, the top twenty banks in the United States collected more than $11 billion in overdraft and insufficient fund fees issued to consumers, according to the CFPB. In 2023, banks earned more than $5.8 billion in overdraft fees, federal data shows.\n\nYears ago, banks charged overdraft fees for customers who wrote bad checks or overdrew their accounts because the process for banks to retrieve their money came with a cost, said Naylor with Public Citizen. But that is largely no longer the case.\n\n\"In the days of electronics, where the bank knows that you have insufficient funds, it can just set an algorithm to block that payment,\" he said. \"So the concept that it costs you to get penalized $32 on average [for overdrawing your account] is simply useless, and many banks don't charge. There are banks, though, [for which] this is how they make their profit.\"\n\nPost-pandemic, overdraft fee revenue for the top banks spiked in 2022, with banks collecting $7.61 billion in fee revenues. Around that time, the CFPB began scrutinizing the practice by issuing reports highlighting how much money banks were raking in from overdraft fees and issuing enforcement actions.\n\nIn January 2022, the CFPB announced a request for public comment on how overdraft and hidden banking fees were affecting consumers, in anticipation of possible regulations.\n\n\"Many financial institutions obscure the true price of their services by luring customers with enticing offers and then charging excessive junk fees,\" said former CFPB Director Rohit Chopra in a January 2022 press release . \"By promoting competition and ridding the market of illegal practices, we hope to save Americans billions.\"\n\nThe CFPB's scrutiny of overdraft fees led Scott and other Republican senators to condemn the bureau's efforts in their September 12, 2022, letter.\n\n\"Rather than operating as a tough, but fair and sensible regulator, the CFPB is again pursuing a radical and highly-politicized agenda unbounded by statutory limits,\" the senators wrote.\n\nCFPB regulators also began working to lower the cost of late credit card payment penalties . In 2022, major credit card companies charged their customers more than $105 billion in interest and more than $25 billion in fees, the highest amount ever measured .\n\nOn April 13, 2023, Scott and other senators again wrote to the bureau to complain about its banking crackdowns.\n\n\"Last year, the CFPB launched an unfair initiative targeting standard fees charged by credit providers that included reasonable payment incentive mechanisms such as overdraft and credit card late fees,\" the senators wrote. \"This initiative mislabeled lawful payment incentives by calling them 'junk fees' and falsely suggested that their only purpose is corporate greed.\"\n\nThe senators continued: \"In truth, these fees are used for a variety of legitimate purposes, including encouraging consumers to make responsible financial decisions such as balancing their checkbooks and discouraging consumers from paying their bills late or otherwise violating the terms of financial agreements.\"\n\nDespite the senators' concerns, the CFPB finalized a rule capping late credit card payment penalties to $8 in March 2024. Then, in December 2024, the CFPB finalized its rule on overdraft fees, requiring large banks and financial institutions to in most cases charge no more than $5 in overdraft fees.\n\nScott is now working to rescind the overdraft fee rule using the Congressional Review Act , which empowers Congress to repeal any agency rule issued within the last few months of a previous president's administration. On February 12, House Republicans voted to extend the Congressional Review Act's scope to include the entire final year of a previous president's term - meaning the late credit card late fee cap could also be at risk if the bill becomes law.\n\nBefore being elected to the Senate in 2013, Scott, a former insurance salesman, held various state and local positions and was a member of the US House of Representatives. In 2023, he mounted a short-lived campaign for the Republican Party's presidential nomination.\n\nThroughout his federal career, Scott has been a major benefactor of campaign contributions from the banking and financial sectors.\n\nThe largest contributor to Scott's election efforts throughout his career has been employees and political action committees affiliated with the multinational investment bank Goldman Sachs, according to campaign finance watchdog group OpenSecrets . These individuals and groups have donated more than $278,000 to Scott since 2009. This includes nearly $26,000 from Goldman Sachs executive vice president John Rogers and $10,000 each from company executives David Solomon and David Philip, according to federal data we reviewed.\n\nScott and his campaign committees have also received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from hedge fund magnates - including more than $266,000 from Paul Singer, CEO and president of Elliott Investment Management, and nearly $395,000 from Daniel Loeb, CEO of Third Point LLC.\n\nHe's furthermore received money from big banks targeted by regulators for gouging consumers with junk fees.\n\nA political action committee made up of Wells Fargo employees has donated more than $29,000 to Scott's election efforts since 2013. Additionally, political action committees affiliated with Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have donated $18,500 combined to Scott's election efforts since 2013.\n\nIn 2022, the CFPB published a chart highlighting how Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America together collected more than $2.7 billion in overdraft fees over a nine-month period in 2021.\n\nNow, having been elected chair of the Senate Banking Committee in January, Scott has the power to set the agenda for the committee that oversees the CFPB - which helps regulate his financial industry donors.\n\nLast month, Scott said he would support cutting the CFPB's funding as a way to pay for extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts - an economic plan that will largely benefit corporations and the wealthy, according to Trump's own Treasury Department.\n\nAccording to the Banking Committee's website , Scott's agenda will focus on cutting regulations for credit, capital, and other financial lending services including financial technology companies - a key focus of billionaire Elon Musk, who posted \"CFPB RIP\" on February 7 and claimed that the bureau \"did above zero good things, but still need to go.\"\n\nX/Twitter, Musk's social media company, partnered with Visa in January to allow X users to send money through their accounts, similar to apps like Venmo or Zelle. The move would place Musk's business under CFPB oversight .\n\n\"Elon Musk is turning X into a payments platform, and the CFPB would have been a primary impediment to his doing so,\" said Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University. \"Given the ascendance of Silicon Valley interests in this government, I think that's an important layer to the story of why we're losing the CFPB.\"\n\nScott also promised that one of the committee's major goals would be to slash regulations for the crypto industry.\n\nIn January, Trump's SEC, an agency that Scott oversees, rescinded a key advisory bulletin that essentially blocked banks and large financial institutions from holding large stores of cryptocurrencies and conducting certain crypto transactions, due to crypto's potential to cause widespread volatility in the financial markets.\n\nScott became a staunch supporter of cryptocurrencies this past summer when he vowed to help pass a bill establishing a federally held Bitcoin stockpile , which would likely be a massive handout to the largest Bitcoin owners. Scott received more than $38,000 in campaign donations this past election cycle from a number of crypto figureheads, despite not facing reelection, federal data shows.\n\nExperts warn that allowing largely unregulated and volatile cryptocurrencies to become enmeshed in the country's financial system could lead to economic disaster .\n\n\"We're in a position where without consumer safeguards, there can be contagion for the rest of the financial system,\" Allen said. \"So if we lose the CFPB, consumers are losing someone that they can go to for help.\"\n\nIn the Senate Banking Committee's policy agenda, Scott also promised to \"ensure all agencies within the committee's jurisdiction are open and transparent, follow the law, and advance commonsense policies that create economic opportunity.\"\n\nBut Allen is doubtful that Scott will hold Musk and other Trump officials accountable for their efforts to dismantle these agencies. So is Naylor at Public Citizen, who believes efforts to gut consumer protections will hurt the average consumer.\n\n\"Bankers have long known that they are highly regulated, and they need to buy off both the Democrats as well as the Republicans,\" Naylor said. \"It's unfortunate that banking policy is relatively unmonitored by people sitting around their kitchen table, and even though they might be angry at an overdraft fee and so forth, they may not link that back to their senator.\"\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nFreddy Brewster is a freelance reporter and has been published in the Los Angeles Times , NBC News, CalMatters, the Lost Coast Outpost , and other outlets across California.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

(David Crane / Los Angeles Daily News / SCNG via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThree years ago, \"populist\" Republican senator Josh Hawley tweeted , \"We are a working class party now. That's the future.\" The next year, his colleague Ted Cruz announced that the future had arrived. \"The Republican Party,\" he said, \"is not the party of country clubs\" but \"the party of hard-working, blue-collar men and women.\"\n\nIn the real world, neither Haley nor Cruz is even a cosponsor of the PRO Act, which would make it easier for workers to organize unions. Nor are any of their Republican colleagues. Marco Rubio, another senator who likes to preen as an economic populist, actually introduced a bill last year to legalize company unions .\n\nSo the \"party of the working class\" schtick has always rung pretty hollow. But it's striking that on stage at last night's Republican debate, no one was even going through the motions.\n\nSouth Carolina senator Tim Scott got the first question. He'd previously commented on the autoworkers strike by bringing up the \"great example\" set by Ronald Reagan in firing striking air traffic controllers. \"You strike, you're fired.\"\n\nScott was asked if that meant he'd fire the thousands of striking autoworkers. He admitted that as president he wouldn't have the power to fire striking workers in the private sector - but immediately went on to say that he found it absurd that the autoworkers \"want more benefits working fewer hours.\" Rather than visiting a United Auto Workers picket line, Scott said, Joe Biden should be \"on our southern border, working to close our southern border, because it is unsafe, wide open, and insecure.\"\n\nIf you take the rhetoric of Hawley and Cruz seriously, you'd expect the rest of the Republicans on stage to jump on that with denunciations of Scott for siding with bosses against workers. Instead, everyone seemed to have come with the kind of sound bites that would get standing ovations at the Chamber of Commerce. Former vice president Mike Pence said that, instead of being on \"a picket line,\" Biden should be on \"an unemployment line.\" Disenfranchisement enthusiast Vivek Ramaswamy said the workers should switch to \"picket[ing] in front of the White House in Washington, DC\" - not, mind you, to demand government intervention on behalf of their strike but to advocate deregulation of the energy industry.\n\nFormer New Jersey governor Chris Christie's advisors didn't seem to have gotten the memo to prepare a line like this about the autoworkers, but later in the debate, he did have one on teachers' unions. When he got a question about education, he managed to work in a line about how the \"stranglehold\" of political influence supposedly exercised by these unions wasn't going to go away as long as \"you have the president of the United Stated sleeping with a member of the teachers' union.\" As Jacobin editor Bhaskar Sunkara write s , the reference to First Lady Jill Biden \"had all the crassness of a Trump line, but none of the political acumen.\"\n\nPolls show that a crushingly large majority of the American public sides with the striking UAW workers. The closest anyone on stage came to reflecting popular opinion was Vivek Ramaswamy, vaguely expressing \"a lot of sympathy\" with rank-and-file workers - but even that comment was prefaced by saying that he and Tim Scott had \"a common view\" in not having much patience for \"the union bosses.\"\n\nReality check: Workers don't get to elect real bosses, but UAW \"boss\" Shawn Fain was directly elected by the membership. He was a reformer who ousted the leadership that had been running the union for decades. And the vote to authorize the strike against the Big Three automakers carried a margin of 97 percent to 3 percent. Trying to situate yourself as a friend of \"the workers\" while badmouthing the democratically elected \"union boss\" carrying out the will of 97 percent of the membership is absurd on its face.\n\nThe debate opened with a video featuring Ronald Reagan, adoringly referred to as one of America's \"most beloved presidents.\" It included a clip of the Gipper saying that the \"nine most terrifying words in the English language\" are \"I'm from the government and I'm here to help.\"\n\nNo one terrified by those words would be even slightly alarmed by anything they heard last night. No government help was promised for struggling working-class people - not on education, not on health care, not on wage levels, and not on much of anything else.\n\nIn fact, in the alternate dimension that many GOP candidates seem to inhabit, the government has already done too much to help, and it needs to be rolled back. Mike Pence promised to \"repeal\" the Green New Deal - which would have created many millions of good, unionized jobs to implement a rapid energy transition. Of course, the Green New Deal was never passed . In the real world it never came close to passing.\n\nNot to be outdone, Tim Scott said that he was going to \"restore capitalism.\" In Tim Scott's version of reality, has the United States nationalized the means of production? I'm not so sure about that.\n\nWhat I am sure of is that none of the GOP candidates onstage at last night's debate would do a single thing in the White House that would upset the 1 percent. It's clarifying, at least, that they're not even pretending.\n\nBen Burgis is a Jacobin columnist, an adjunct philosophy professor at Rutgers University, and the host of the YouTube show and podcast Give Them An Argument .

With or without Donald Trump, the GOP has absolutely lost it.\n\nNikki Haley and Ron DeSantis during the Republican Presidential Debate at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts on November 8, 2023.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn May 2022, Nancy Pelosi told a gathering at the Aspen Ideas Climate Conference in Miami that she hoped true conservatives would liberate the Republican Party from the clutches of Donald Trump and the faction around him. \"Rather than saying, 'Well, we have to defeat them,'\" Pelosi declared, \"no, let's just try to persuade them . . . I want the Republican Party to take back the party, take it back to where you were when you cared about a woman's right to choose, you cared about the environment.\" Pelosi herself has made similar comments a number of times , issuing yet another plea for Republicans to \"take back their party\" as recently as last month.\n\nPutting aside the obvious issues with the first statement - the consensus within the GOP was neither green nor pro-choice prior to Donald Trump - the sentiment remains emblematic of a kind of thinking that has been prevalent in elite liberal circles since 2016. The Republican Party, we are endlessly told, has been taken over by a narrow cult (or \"fringe element\" in Pelosi's words ) that has corrupted and debased the noble spirit of American conservatism. Once that element has been defeated, it is typically implied, the Republican Party will resume its historic role as an honest and honorable interlocutor of the country's progressives and liberals.\n\nMuch in this story has never really made sense. In their revulsion toward Trump, too many liberals have invested themselves in an idealized version of pre-2016 Republicanism that has never really existed. Since his hostile takeover of the party, meanwhile, Trump has remained resoundingly popular with actual Republican voters and rarely faced serious resistance from GOP lawmakers during his term as president. Both these facts are evident in the current primary polling, which has continued to show Trump so far ahead of his rivals that the race's outcome is basically a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe primary contest has also underscored the absurdity of thinking that the mainstream Republican Party would somehow be saner or less terrifying without Donald Trump. At last night's debate in Miami, the five qualifying candidates spent the better part of two hours trying to one-up each other's reactionary rhetoric and zealous commitment to militarism. Though peppered with the usual conservative boilerplate - Nikki Haley thinks America needs \"an accountant in the White House\"; Tim Scott is a big fan of Ronald Reagan; Ron DeSantis is worried about America's national debt - much of the evening was focused on foreign policy and saw the candidates dial up \"war on terror\"-style jingoism to eleven.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, all five candidates were evangelical in their support for Israel's relentless bombing of Gaza - the word \"Palestine\" not being uttered once over the entire debate. But what was most striking was the way the likes of Haley and Scott basically free-associated whenever they invoked a perceived adversary. Calling Israel \"the tip of the spear when it comes to Islamic terrorism,\" Haley proceeded to link Hamas with Iran and Iran with China and Russia. Not to be outdone, Scott pledged to \"cut the head off the snake\" and launch a direct strike against Iran, later insisting that America is currently home to \"thousands of terrorist sleeper cells.\" At one point, Christie seemed to improvise a new Axis of Evil on the spot, linking Russia (led by a \"communist KGB dictator\"), China, Iran, and North Korea as if they represented a unitary geopolitical adversary.\n\nWith the sole exception of Vivek Ramaswamy, who attacked neoconservatism while also spouting plenty of his own insanity, the vision of the world projected by the Republican presidential hopefuls was one where the United States should consider itself under existential threat at all times - facing a nonstop invasion on its southern border, sleeper cells consisting of Chinese agents and jihadists who are poised to strike at any moment, and an alliance of foreign powers so menacing that no amount of military spending should ever be considered enough.\n\nGiven Trump's iron grip on the GOP, last night's debate will mean very little and will soon be forgotten by the few who remember it at all. Nevertheless, it stands as a useful reminder of how completely insane the Republican Party is capable of being in his absence - and the absurdity of liberal fairy tales about a righteous conservatism in exile.\n\nLuke Savage is a staff writer at Jacobin .

Yesterday, presidential candidate Tim Scott chose to say what Republicans actually think: \"You strike, you're fired.\"\n\nSen. Tim Scott speaks to a crowd during a presidential campaign event at Charleston Southern University on May 22, 2023. ( Washington Post / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nFrom the moment it was declared, the United Auto Workers' (UAW) strike has presented Republican politicians with something of a dilemma. The immediate reason is that public opinion is firmly and overwhelmingly behind the union and its demands. More broadly, the GOP has in recent years gone to great pains to rebrand itself as a party of the working class. That's always been nonsense, of course, and the rhetorical gymnastics offered by leading conservative politicians over the past few days is an excellent case in point.\n\nQuick out of the gate was Missouri senator Josh Hawley, who remarked, \"Auto workers deserve a raise - and they deserve to have their jobs protected from Joe Biden's stupid climate mandates that are destroying the US auto industry and making China rich.\" As media critic Adam Johnson pointed out , Hawley's superficially pro-worker statement contained a number of revealing evasions and omissions. Most obviously, it referred to autoworkers without actually mentioning their union. And while Hawley did endorse an unspecified raise, that position is by no means in tension with the current posture of management at the Big Three automakers - all of whom have offered raises significantly below what the union has demanded.\n\nParticularly emblematic, and equally disingenuous, was Hawley's attempt to represent the strike as a regrettable by-product of the Biden administration's (rather moderate) green policies while invoking geopolitical rivalry with China. Donald Trump, for his part, has triangulated in much the same way : issuing statements vaguely supportive of \"autoworkers\" while openly attacking the UAW and misrepresenting the dispute as a case of liberal green quackery run amok. Florida governor Ron DeSantis and North Dakota governor Doug Burgum both offered variations on the same themes, with the former blaming \"Biden's push for electric vehicles\" and the latter commenting, \"The union workers are going, wow, we're gonna switch to all EVs, we're going to have less jobs, we're gonna switch to all EVs, you know, we're shipping our future and you are going to be dependent on China for our transportation needs.\"\n\nStatements like these all express the rather challenging predicament of right-wing politicians keen to brandish their workerist credentials without actually supporting the aspirations of workers themselves. Needless to say, the act is unconvincing.\n\nThe recent interventions of Republican senator Tim Scott therefore stand out for their ideological clarity and candor. Asked during a recent campaign stop if he would intervene in labor disputes as president, Scott - who has evidently not received the post-2016 memo directing conservative politicians to at least feign sympathy for workers - was unequivocal in his response : \"I think Ronald Reagan gave us a great example when federal employees decided they were going to strike. He said, you strike, you're fired. Simple concept to me. To the extent that we can use that once again, absolutely.\"\n\nAt a policy roundtable in South Carolina a few days earlier, Scott not only took aim at the UAW but also made clear his belie f that workers are a subordinate class whose waking lives should be subject to the whims of management:\n\nWe're seeing the UAW fight for more benefits and less hours working. . . . More pay and fewer days on the job. It's a disconnect from work, and we have to find a way to encourage and inspire people to go back to work. That's one of the things that, as your president, we would have. We would have a nationwide, sea-to-shining-sea focus on . . . you pick the type of work. But if you're able-bodied, you are going to work.\n\nSen. Scott on auto workers strike in comments at policy roundtable in South Carolina, \"...We're seeing UAW fight for more benefits and less hours working. More pay, fewer days on the job. It's a disconnect from work and we have to find a way to encourage...ppl to go back to work\" pic.twitter.com/yuQ5qKwgPz\n\n- Eva McKend (@evamckend) September 15, 2023\n\nIt's refreshing, in a grotesque sort of way, when conservative politicians are this candid about their hierarchical view of society and their contempt for the working majority.\n\nThroughout much of the twentieth century, the advent of mass democracy and universal suffrage often compelled the Right to cloak its arguments in the language of fairness and equality. However fraudulent, the gesture was an implicit concession to the reality that democratically empowered citizens and workers were unlikely to vote for the kinds of policies favored by capitalists. The great innovation of figures like Margaret Thatcher and Scott's hero, Ronald Reagan, was to represent the likes of crushing unions and trickle-down economics in popular terms. The underlying project remained the same, but it now came packaged in quasi-democratic rhetoric of individual autonomy and collective uplift.\n\nScott's various statements, however, usefully strip the right-wing project of everything but the barren moral vision at its core. Hope to work less? Forget about it. The essence of life, at least for all but a few, is to work and be subordinate to someone else. Want higher pay? Not a chance. The market alone should set prices, and the function of wages is to keep people desperate enough to accept work regardless of the conditions. Go on strike? The state will smash you to pieces and replace you like an engineer replaces a defective part in a machine. Even Scott's conclusion is phrased less as a descriptive statement than a commandment from above issued to people outside the room. You are going to work .\n\nIt's a succinct summation of what the Right, beyond its deflections and unconvincing workerist appeals, really thinks about the UAW strike - and how it actually regards so many of the ordinary people for whom it claims to speak.\n\nLuke Savage is a staff writer at Jacobin .

There's an easy solution: scrap the byzantine and expensive scheme Dems have concocted, and just give everyone universal childcare.\n\nDemocrats could change the design of the childcare program to avoid creating a \"childcare gap,\" but they don't seem to want to. (Atikah Akhtar / Unsplash)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nVarious Republicans have recently highlighted one of the critiques I made of the Democratic childcare proposal ( Mitch McConnell and Tim Scott , among others). The critique is that the proposal's wage, quality, and credential mandates, combined with its hard subsidy cliffs , will result in individuals with incomes above the subsidy cliff paying substantially more for childcare than they currently pay.\n\nWhen Republicans bring up this point, they like to cite my October 20 piece , which showed that increasing childcare worker wages to elementary school worker wages would cause the cost of unsubsidized infant care to go up from around $15,900 to around $29,000, an increase of around $13,000. These numbers closely mirror similar figures produced by the Center for American Progress (CAP), with the lower figure being CAP's \"base quality\" infant care cost and the higher one being CAP's \"high-quality\" infant care cost.\n\nMore significantly, my estimate is very similar to one produced by the District of Columbia's Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE). The DC OSSE report uses a much more sophisticated cost model than the one used by me or CAP and includes direct data from DC childcare providers. Despite these differences in method, it reaches a nearly identical conclusion that wage rules like those in the Build Back Better childcare plan will increase the unsubsidized prices of center-based infant and toddler care by around $12,000. These days, when people ask me about this issue, I tell them to read the DC OSSE report, because it is much better than anything I have produced on the topic.\n\nWhen I first raised this issue a couple of months ago, there was a fierce but ultimately very brief effort to discredit it. The effort featured mostly unspecific objections, and at times even some objections that seemed to prove my point. After the DC OSSE report came out, I privately sent it to some of the staunchest objectors and asked where they think it went wrong, but so far, I have not heard anything back.\n\nThe only significant objection in the initial fury that was at least cognizable was one that said that the wage, credential, and quality hikes are meant to be phased in over three years and therefore the unsubsidized prices would not rise immediately. This objection is at odds with what the advocates tend to say about the bill when speaking to other audiences, but more important than that, it is utterly detached from the reality of what happens when a sector with a labor shortage that pays the 2nd percentile wage is flooded with new demand from newly subsidized users. The pay hikes in the legislation are not merely nice to have. They are necessary to actually dramatically increase the size of the sector to deliver the promised services.\n\nFor the past month or so, I haven't really seen anyone contest this point anymore, even though it's become more prevalent with media coverage of the proposal regularly including this as one of the issues with the legislation and elected officials occasionally mentioning it as well.\n\nOf course, watching Republican senators talk about the problem is kind of silly, because they would oppose a childcare proposal regardless of its content and would especially object to my proposed solution to this specific problem, which is to get rid of the subsidy cliffs and provide subsidies to all childcare users.\n\nBut it's even sillier that the Democrats have put together a proposal so sloppy and ill-conceived that Republicans can take these shots at it. The problems with this subsidy cliff design are very well-known at this point. In fact, they are so well-known that, in this same piece of legislation , Democrats have included a provision to permanently get rid of a virtually identical subsidy cliff used to compute subsidies for insurance purchased on an Obamacare exchange.\n\nHow do you see the problem well enough to want to fix it when it comes to Obamacare but don't see it well enough to want to avoid it when it comes to creating a childcare subsidy scheme?\n\nWhat's sad is that this isn't even the worst instance of policy amnesia when it comes to this proposal. That honor belongs to designing the program as a cash grant to states that choose to participate in it. We know from Medicaid expansion that the result of this design will be that many states won't participate. Indeed, we know this well enough by now that, in this same piece of legislation , Democrats have included a provision to directly provide health insurance to people in nonparticipating states who fall into the so-called \"Medicaid gap.\" They could change the design of the childcare program to avoid creating a similar \"childcare gap,\" but they don't seem to want to.\n\nMatt Bruenig is the founder of People's Policy Project .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

It was how attendees described the mood at the event, in line with Donald Trump's own directive to stress unity and tone down incendiary rhetoric; it was their response to the former president's close dodging of an assassination attempt this past weekend; and it was how they felt about this coming election, one in which Trump has taken the lead in battleground states in multiple polls and the respected Cook Political Report predicts six states moving toward the Republicans.\n\nOnly two days after a bullet nearly ended their candidate's life, Republicans had practically, like the candidate himself, come face-to-face with death and come out the other side defiant. One attendee had burst into tears when she heard the news. One said she hadn't been surprised. Another had been getting a haircut.\n\nMany described a sense of relief. Trump's death would have not only been the end of a beloved political figure, it seemed, but of an irreplaceable political force, no matter how deep they imagined their bench.\n\nMany others described the political equivalent of a shot of adrenaline.\n\n\"We're all jacked up,\" said one. \"We're more determined than ever.\"\n\nThe candidate's near-death experience had, for attendees, made clear the election's existential stakes, as it hit home how quickly and easily their political project could have collapsed. Like their political opponents, these Republicans talked about November as a must-win election that will decide the country's future.\n\nThese pitched emotions spiraled into the night's climax, when a bandaged-up Trump emerged, on camera, from a stadium corridor into the convention hall to a rapturous, extended ovation. Nearby fire-service workers rushed to the gate to witness the scene, before one lamented, \"Now I've got to get back to work.\"\n\nBut the big news of the day was the announcement of J. D. Vance as vice presidential candidate. Vance was not necessarily the top pick of many of those I spoke with, but they gamely identified benefits he would bring to the ticket: he has potential Rust Belt appeal, is more on the same page with Trump than the \"turncoat\" Mike Pence, and, most of all, unlike the political leadership of both major parties, he is young. (Vance is thirty-nine.)\n\nOne such person was Shalira Taylor-Jackson, a backup delegate from Ohio, who was attending her second Republican Convention after 2016's in her hometown of Cleveland. Jackson, who is black and chafed at charges that the GOP is the party of \"rich, white men,\" had started out as a Barack Obama volunteer in 2008.\n\n\"They had me with the 'Hope and Change,' but nothing changed,\" she told me. \"Honestly, they sold us out.\"\n\nJackson's first pick had been South Carolina senator Tim Scott, pointing to his work on the First Step criminal justice reform legislation and his move to defund police departments that didn't implement certain reforms after the murder of George Floyd. But Jackson, whose husband is a police officer, was happy with the Vance pick, believing that his \"Never Trump\" past would help unite the party, and appreciated the fact that the senator had campaigned with her during her 2022 run for a blue House seat.\n\nAt the end of the day, for many, it was simply enough that Vance was Trump's pick. The Republican rank and file have inherent trust in the former president, and not just for the sake of the presidential ticket but for the man himself.\n\nStill, for all the confidence convention attendees said they had going into November, many were wary of counting their chickens, anticipating \"shenanigans\" from the Democrats, as one put it. Those shenanigans ranged from lawsuits and electoral tampering to \"importing\" voters. Many believed the assassination attempt this past weekend - carried out, based on what we know so far, by a single, disturbed shooter with unclear motives, who was a registered Republican , grew up in a house with pro-Trump yard signs , and was described by one classmate as conservative - had been the doing of Joe Biden and the Democrats.\n\n\"A wounded serpent bites the deepest,\" one twenty-four-year-old Republican warned.\n\nAttendees resented what they viewed as cynical Democratic efforts to thwart Trump's presidency and the \"lawfare\" waged against him after he lost the previous election. Some predicted Trump would wage his own in return.\n\n\"If they win, there are going to be investigations, and people will go to jail,\" one attendee told me.\n\nDespite the Trump team's directive, plenty in the convention night's official programming did not point to unity or cooled-down rhetoric. The first speaker of the night was North Carolina gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson, who, among other things, has a history of Holocaust denial and recently told a crowd that \"some folks need killing\" as \"a matter of necessity.\" Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson called the other side's policies \"a clear and present danger to America, to our institutions, our values and our people\" in his speech, then claimed the teleprompter simply hadn't been updated with a more positive message. Tim Scott declared America wasn't a racist country, except for those parts governed by Democrats. Numerous speakers used insulting language toward LGBTQ people. Messages on trucks around the convention area implored participants to \"fight left-wing media.\"\n\nRegardless, the inescapable takeaway from day one of the convention was that the movement behind Trump is unified, fired up, more committed than ever to the president and his political program, and laser-focused on winning. By contrast, polls leading into the event showed that more than two-thirds of Democrats are unhappy with Biden as their nominee, including 46 percent in the must-win battleground state of Pennsylvania. The same night, Biden sat down for a twenty-minute interview with NBC's Lester Holt in which he again struggled to speak coherently and lost his train of thought several times. For Democrats, it's looking like a very worrying matchup.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Tim Scott said he would vote to certify the 2024 election results after having avoided the topic in recent weeks.\n\n\"Well, certainly,\" Scott, R-S.C., said Sunday when he was asked in an interview with CNN anchor Dana Bash whether he would vote in favor of certifying. \"We expect a fair and honest election, and as a result of that expectation, we will certify the election - and certify President Donald Trump as our 47th president.\"\n\nScott, a top contender to be Trump's running mate this year, recently dodged similar questions about accepting this year's election results, including i n an appearance on NBC's \" Meet the Press \" early this month.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the 47th president of the United States will be President Donald Trump,\" he told moderator Kristen Welker, declining to answer several questions about accepting the outcome.\n\nEven if Trump picks him as his vice presidential ticket mate, Scott will still be a sitting member of the Senate when Congress convenes to certify the 2024 election results. That could put him in the position of certifying his own election outcome in the Senate in January, win or lose.\n\nTrump continues to falsely claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Several of his vice presidential contenders have waffled o ver whether the 2020 election was indeed stolen and over whether they will commit to accept this year's results .\n\nScott has acknowledged President Joe Biden's win in 2020 and voted to certify it. In a statement released on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, he explained his vote to approve certain states' elector slates because \"no justice, judge or fact finder has found evidence indicating the election results in those states should be overturned.\"\n\nAt the first Republican presidential primary debate last year in Milwaukee, Scott said former Vice President Mike Pence \"absolutely\" did the right thing by certifying the election results.\n\nDuring his own campaign for president, Scott also disagreed with voters who claimed that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\n\"I do not believe the election was stolen. I do believe that states created a new system, mail-in ballots, that did not have signature verification,\" Scott said at a campaign event in Davenport, Iowa, in June.\n\nAlec Hernández is a 2024 NBC News campaign embed.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

That wouldn't have been especially notable, except for the fact that Wiles delivered a curious message to her deep-pocketed audience .\n\nAs NBC News reported at the time, she specifically warned the GOP donors that they'd probably hear the former president say all kinds of ridiculous things in the coming days, weeks and months, and they should simply disregard those comments . The prospective campaign contributors were instead told to focus on the fact that Trump was likely to win, whether his public comments made sense or not.\n\nThis came to mind watching Sen. Tim Scott on CNBC trying to defend the former president's stated plans for inflation-driving tariffs. HuffPost noted what happened after the South Carolina Republican was asked to defend Trump's threat to hit John Deere with a 200% tariff in a possible second term.\n\n'You agree with all the tariffs. Do you think John Deere, 200%? Do you think companies that make stuff here should have a 15% tax? That's industrial policy, isn't it?' ['Squawk Box' host Joe Kernen] asked of Trump, whose tariff proposals have prompted warnings by economists. 'I believe that President Trump oftentimes talks in the abstract, number one,' Scott replied.\"\n\nIt was at that point when CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin interjected, asking, \"What are we supposed to believe, then?\"\n\nThat need not be a rhetorical question.\n\nIn reality, the GOP senator almost certainly knows that Trump's increasingly bizarre tariff agenda would be a disaster. I can say this with some confidence because Scott is on record already having said so .\n\nThe result, of course, was a challenge for the South Carolinian: He was on national television as a surrogate for Trump, whose tariff plan he opposes. And so, asked about his party's nominee and his bad idea, Scott was reduced to saying that Trump \"talks in the abstract.\"\n\nThis generated on-set chuckling, and for good reason. For one thing, as far as the former president is concerned, there's nothing \"abstract\" about his economic and trade plans, which he talks up on a nearly daily basis.\n\nFor another, to Sorkin's point, we're in the midst of a presidential campaign. The stakes couldn't be much higher. If Americans are supposed to see the Republican Party's presidential nominee and perceive his promises as \"abstractions,\" the result is a race in which no one will know - or even can know - what the candidate actually intends to do with power.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

      "text": "Tim Scott focuses on his pitch to Black voters amid Trump VP speculation\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nLast July, a town hall attendee in Salem, New Hampshire, asked Sen. Tim Scott if he \"believed he could swing the historically Democratic-supporting African American community.\" Scott's response was guarded.\n\n\"Maybe,\" the then-presidential candidate replied. \"I'm a fairly conservative candidate. That does not necessarily bode well for my ability to persuade die-hard Democrats, Black or white or any other color.\"\n\nBut now, with Scott in the middle of speculation about former President Donald Trump's pick for a 2024 running mate, the South Carolina senator is leaning into his ability to engage with the growing number of Black voters that polling data suggest are open to voting for Trump in this election.\n\nScott has launched a weekly series, \"America's Starting Five,\" with other Black Republicans in Congress, in a bid both to make Black conservatives more visible and to reach Black voters. The series, which will discuss \" politics, race, and the 2024 election\" and which Scott hopes to continue at least through the summer, is also a vehicle for him to lean into a skill set that could be an asset for Trump: his perceived ability to expand the party's tent.\n\n\"Sen. Scott recognizes that he can draw people into the party, particularly Black men,\" said a source familiar with the planning of the series. \"This is an effort to highlight that.\"\n\nA composite analysis of NBC polling data from 2023 found that among Black voters, men under 50 years old gave by far the lowest ratings to President Joe Biden - and the highest ones to Trump, though a majority still viewed Trump negatively.\n\nStill, almost 40% of those voters said they'd vote for Trump over Biden in a general election, compared to no more than 15% in any of the other age and gender categories among Black voters, a split well outside the margin of error for those subgroups.\n\nThat's largely what's behind other recent surveys showing Trump garnering more support from Black voters than ever, cutting into Biden by double digits compared to the 2020 results, even though the president still leads among Black voters.\n\nScott's willingness to focus on his race is a departure from the early days of his presidential campaign, when he was at times hesitant to lean too deeply into his identity, even as supporters encouraged him to highlight a factor they believed made him the most electable 2024 presidential candidate on the GOP side.\n\n\"Here are four non-Black, Black people,\" Scott said while leading a roundtable discussion alongside four other prominent Black Republicans in the first episode of his new series: Reps. Burgess Owens of Utah, Byron Donalds of Florida, John James of Michigan and Wesley Hunt of Texas.\n\nThe panelists were taking their turns dissecting a past misstep by Biden, and the focus of the group had turned to a 2020 interview he did with radio host Charlamagne tha God, during which Biden suggested that Black Americans who don't vote for him \"ain't really Black.\"\n\n\"The good news is in 2024, it looks like four out of 10 of us ain't Black enough for Joe Biden,\" Scott continued.\n\nAs Scott's presidential campaign went on last year before he dropped out in November, his tune began to shift. He became more vocal not only about his appeal to the small but growing number of Black conservatives nationwide, but also how he was uniquely positioned to help the party make more inroads with voters of color, as arguably the most prominent Black Republican elected official in the country.\n\n\"I believe that I create a red wave where we win back the Senate, we expand our majority in the House, and you do that by having the kind of candidate who - the literal truth of my life - destroys the lies of the radical left and creates a red wave,\" Scott said at one of his final campaign stops in October.\n\nThat \"red wave,\" in his view, would be fueled in part by his life story: A Black man from South Carolina, raised by a single mother in a low-income neighborhood, who went from \"cotton to Congress\" in a single generation, as he often riffed during his events.\n\n\"I have lived a similar experience to people who find themselves trapped in poverty, who are today growing up in single parent households, who are wondering whether the American dream can work for them,\" Scott said.\n\nTrump seems aware of Scott's potential and has certainly worked to keep his former primary opponent close.\n\nIn addition to appearing alongside Trump at several campaign rallies in the waning days of the Republican primary, Scott was invited by Trump to attend and speak at his Mar-a-Lago fundraiser last week, which the campaign said netted $50 million across groups including Trump's main super PAC and other fundraising committees.\n\nA day before the South Carolina Republican primary, Scott accompanied Trump to the Black Conservative Federation's annual gala, where Trump was the recipient of the \"Champion of Black America\" award. Scott was the only former Trump rival to appear at the event.\n\nAnd Trump has repeatedly said that Scott is better at campaigning on his behalf than he was campaigning for himself.\n\nThe Biden-Harris campaign appears skeptical that Scott - or whoever Trump ultimately selects as a running mate - will be successful in recruiting more Black voters to the Republican Party.\n\n\"Regardless of who Donald Trump's running mate is, these are the facts: While he was president, Black unemployment and uninsured rates spiked, his encouragement of white nationalism divided the nation, and his botched Covid-19 response disproportionately left Black people dead,\" said Jasmine Harris, the Biden campaign's Black media director. \"Black voters remain some of the most informed and engaged voters every election, and this November they will get behind Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who put Black Americans at the forefront of their administration's work.\"\n\nI am a politics reporter covering breaking news for NBC News, based in Washington, D.C.

Tim Scott hasn't exactly been subtle about his national ambitions. After the South Carolina Republican's presidential campaign was an expensive flop - Scott struggled to reach 5% in the polls, in part because he appeared terrified of differentiating himself from Donald Trump - the senator started embarrassing himself in the apparent hopes of joining the former president's 2024 ticket.\n\nThere's one important part of Scott's résumé, however, that his intraparty critics seized on .\n\nTime magazine reported a few months ago that the senator \"will have to surmount an irredeemable MAGA World sin: He voted to certify Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.\"\n\nHe did, indeed. Just hours after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, the Senate voted to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. Of the chamber's 100 members, only eight far-right Republicans voted against certification - and Tim Scott wasn't one of them.\n\nWhat's more, during a presidential primary debate last summer, the senator said then-Vice President Mike Pence \" absolutely \" did the right thing on Jan. 6. In case this isn't obvious, that's not Trump's position.\n\nWith this in mind, what, pray tell, is the South Carolinian prepared to do about his partisan \"problem\"? As NBC News noted , Scott appears to have settled on the most unfortunate fix possible.\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina on Sunday did not directly answer multiple questions about whether he'd accept the results of the 2024 presidential election, regardless of who wins. \"At the end of the day, the 47th president of the United States will be President Donald Trump,\" Scott, a Republican, said the first time he was directly asked whether he would commit to accepting the election results on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nOver and over again, host Kristen Welker pressed the Republican to simply say, \" yes or no ,\" whether he was prepared to accept the results of the 2024 presidential election. He wouldn't say - though Scott was willing to question the integrity of NBC News' journalism for reasons unknown.\n\nIt's worth pausing to appreciate the extraordinary circumstances we find ourselves in. Traditionally, high-profile senators weren't even asked whether they were prepared to accept their own country's election results, because the answer would've been clear.\n\nBut in 2024, as the radicalization of Republican politics intensifies, Scott wasn't just asked, he also refused to answer - no doubt because the senator knew that if he answered in such a way that expressed support for democracy, this would've caused fury at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIn other words, Scott believes the key to addressing his Team Trump \"problem\" is to appear more openly hostile toward the American political system, which in turn might boost his national ambitions.\n\nAs the GOP's race to the bottom unfolds, I continue to believe that no one should want to be vice president this badly.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

It's a lesson Tim Scott is learning the hard way - and he's furious about it.\n\nScott's obsequious praise for Donald Trump over the last week has earned widespread mockery. Specifically, video of him endorsing Trump with a preacher-style affect ahead of the New Hampshire primary, as well as video of Scott sidling up to Trump midspeech to say , \"I just love you\" after Trump had some unkind things to say about Nikki Haley. Both episodes had people clowning him online and in the press.\n\nDuring MSNBC's New Hampshire coverage, Joy Reid noted that Trump was using his victory speech \"to ritually humiliate people like Tim Scott.\" And Rev. Al Sharpton essentially said much the same thing on \"Morning Joe\" the next morning, opining that \"it was humiliating to watch what Tim Scott did as a sitting senator.\"\n\nOn Sean Hannity's show Thursday night, Scott lashed out at liberals who've been mocking his pro-Trump performance, calling them \"vile and disgusting\" and claiming \"the most racist [people] in the country are liberals.\"\n\n\"They're trying to make sure that any other minority who will think for themselves and consider the GOP - they want to send a message to every single one of them: 'Step outta line and we'll attack you, too,'\" Scott said.\n\nThat's quite a warped interpretation of what actually happened. Critics weren't taking issue with Scott for stepping \"out of line\" with liberals, they were mocking him for his cringeworthy fealty to Trump and his reluctance to challenge the former president even as he suggested Scott \"must really hate\" Haley.\n\nTo Scott, being Black and clinging to such a man may seem like he's stepping \"out of line\" in some righteous way. To many observers (myself included), it looks like he, alongside so many others , is simply bending the knee to an authoritarian bigot. Trump is a man who denounced largely Black countries as \"s---holes,\" accused largely Black cities of being squalid and rife with voter fraud , attacked civil rights figures , advocated for police violence and vowed to shield police from accountability for wrongdoing.\n\nAnd that, at least, seems worthy of mockery.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

Are any of the hopefuls fit to be president? Read this installment of MSNBC's 2024 profile series and find out.\n\nThe Republican Party has, since the 2024 race began , appeared on track to nominate a four-time indicted, twice-impeached former president who undermined our peaceful transfer of power less than three years ago.\n\nSo, with Ron DeSantis' campaign a distant, chaotic second , is there any other credible alternative to Donald Trump ?\n\nStep forward, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina .\n\nScott has been framed by pundits and the press as a down-to-earth, plain-speaking Black moderate who could save a far-right Republican Party from itself.\n\nThe New York Times has described him as an \"amiable scripture-quoting\" man. The National Journal dubbed him \"a natural.\" Politico called him \"magnetic.\" And everyone talks about his socks. How can you dislike someone with a strong sock game ?\n\nScott has been framed by pundits and the press as a down-to-earth, plain-speaking Black moderate who could save a far-right Republican Party from itself.\n\nBut what if I told you that on issues like religion, race and Trump himself, Tim Scott is no moderate? That Scott's conservatism actually places him in the company of the most extreme right-wingers in his party, on both social and economic issues? This is a conservative politician who has spent years pushing for tax cuts on the rich and celebrating anti-union laws in his state. His voting record on LGBTQ issues has earned him a consistent zero rating from the Human Rights Campaign - that's the same score as people such as Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert.\n\nOr take religion, an increasingly serious issue in American politics with the rise of Christian nationalist types like the aforementioned Greene of Georgia and Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano . In the 1990s, one of the GOP's favorite causes was pushing to have the Ten Commandments on public display. Scott, then a Republican councilman in Charleston County, introduced a bill to hang the Ten Commandments on a plaque outside the chamber.\n\n\"I want it to be in gold,\" the councilman said. He later clarified to a local paper that \"being a cost-conscious Republican, some other material might be more suitable.\" He later got to be the one who hammered the Ten Commandments to the wall of his building - yes, he literally hammered them on the wall.\n\nAnd what about that whole pesky separation of church and state thing? As a local paper reported at the time, Scott (falsely) claimed that \"the Constitution was constructed to protect the church from government, not the government from the church.\"\n\nOf course, that was nearly 30 years ago . Perhaps he's tempered that extreme - and extremely inaccurate - view? No. We asked him. Today, as a U.S. senator and presidential candidate, Tim Scott still believes that.\n\nAs for race, to be fair, Scott still has a better record than most of his fellow Republicans, though that is nothing to brag about.\n\nAs for race, to be fair, Scott still has a better record than most of his fellow Republicans, though that is nothing to brag about.\n\nBack in 2015, South Carolina was thrust into the center of the story about racial tensions in America after police killed a Black man named Walter Scott - no relation to Tim Scott - and following the Charleston church shooting in which white supremacist Dylann Roof killed nine Black people.\n\nTo his credit, the senator from South Carolina seemed to meet that moment.\n\nHe introduced a police accountability bill , to reduce police funding for states that failed \"to report certain data on deadly shootings by law enforcement officers.\"\n\nHe delivered an emotional speech on the Senate floor about the church shooting, and he spoke openly about his experiences with police, even with police on Capitol Hill, who did not recognize him even though he was an elected official.\n\n\"In the course of one year, I've been stopped seven times by law enforcement officers,\" Scott said. \"While I thank God I have not endured bodily harm, I have however felt the pressure applied by the scales of justice when they are slanted.\"\n\nThat was remarkably refreshing to hear from a Republican lawmaker.\n\nBut the story doesn't end there, and not only because Scott was unable to come to a compromise on police reform with his Senate Democratic counterparts. The truth is that Scott tends to use his unique position as a Black Republican not to force his fellow Republicans to confront the challenge of systemic racism, but to give them an excuse to ignore it. When the GOP picked the South Carolina senator to give the response to President Joe Biden's address to Congress in 2021, Scott used the same six scripted words that his fellow nonwhite Republican, Nikki Haley, used less than a year earlier at the Republican National Convention:\n\n\"America is not a racist country.\"\n\nYes, Scott told his party that he doesn't believe in systemic racism, even after delivering an earlier speech in which he revealed that he had been stopped by police seven times in one year. What does he call that? Random? Seven coincidences?\n\nThat's systemic racism, senator.\n\nSurely, Scott knows this. So while I'll admit that it takes courage to open up about one's own experiences of racism, as Scott has done, how much of that is genuine and based on principle, and how much of it is just political opportunism and self-promotion?\n\nPerhaps the biggest problem with the fantasy that Tim Scott might save the Republican Party from nominating Donald Trump is that Scott routinely gives Trump a pass for his worst acts and ideas. Even after the 2020 election, he refused to call out Trump's big lie.\n\nAfter the Jan. 6 riot, he could have cast a vote to convict Trump in the Senate impeachment trial, sparing the Republican Party from another Trump campaign. Instead, Scott voted to acquit. Worse, when asked about the insurrection, he said: \"The one person I don't blame is President Trump.\"\n\nSheesh. To be clear, even Sen. Mitch McConnell and Rep. Kevin McCarthy, at the time, blamed Trump for the insurrection. But, no, not Tim Scott.\n\nMore recently, after a grand jury indicted Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election , Scott's response was to complain on social media \"about the weaponization of Biden's DOJ and its immense power used against political opponents. What we see today are two different tracks of justice. One for political opponents and another for the son of the current president.\"\n\nSo forget his colorful socks, forget his occasional acknowledgments of racism. Tim Scott is both a true believer in an ultraconservative Christian right agenda and a cynical enabler of the GOP's authoritarian excesses: on religion, race, Trumpism and the rest.\n\nIn the words of New York magazine , the senator has \"played his part ably - telegenic cover for whatever the GOP wants to get done, plausible deniability with a pulse.\"\n\nSo, \"moderate\"? \"Mainstream\"? I mean, he's obviously better than Donald Trump, and Ron DeSantis, but Tim Scott still qualifies as a right-wing extremist, much like the rest of the current crop of GOP presidential candidates trying - and failing - to beat their perennial front-runner.\n\nMehdi Hasan is host of \"The Mehdi Hasan Show\" on Peacock and an MSNBC political analyst.

      "text": "Trump's humiliation of Tim Scott and Lindsey Graham is straight out of the authoritarian playbook\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nAuthoritarian politicians are fragile and insecure creatures, always looking over their shoulders to see who is after them. To build themselves up and deter potential challengers, they take others down in public, letting them know exactly where they stand. They apply this same vicious treatment even to their most loyal collaborators, so that no one ever feels safe and thus everyone continues to act in a slavish manner. Throughout history, such leaders have never lacked a steady supply of opportunists and profiteers who are all too willing to play this game, even to the detriment of their dignity. The Donald Trump-era GOP is the latest example.\n\nTrump has used ritual humiliation to make the GOP his personal tool, and the list of Republicans he has mocked publicly is long. In classic autocratic tradition, the more submissive Republican elites are with Trump - supporting him through impeachments, indictments and a coup attempt that sent them running for their lives - the more he openly scorns them, losing few opportunities to cut them down.\n\nScott has been performing self-abasement spontaneously, likely to Trump's delight.\n\nWhen Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the former GOP presidential candidate, showed up at Trump's victory rally after a January campaign stop in New Hampshire, he might have thought he would earn points. Instead, Trump scorned him: \"Did you ever think [Haley] actually supported you, Tim?\" a smirking Trump said , referring to Nikki Haley's pledge to support Trump if he becomes the GOP nominee. \"And you're the senator of her state. ... You must really hate her,\" Scott's response? \"I just love you ,\" he told Trump.\n\n\"That's why he's a great politician,\" Trump declared with a self-satisfied smile.\n\nSince then, Scott has been performing self-abasement spontaneously, likely to Trump's delight. \"I'm far better encouraging and being excited and motivated for President Trump than I was for myself,\" Scott said after voting in the South Carolina primary . And at the post-primary rally, he assured the audience that he would keep his speech short because \"the longer I speak, the less you hear of him.\"\n\nScott might seem to win the award for bowing and scraping. But his fellow senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, is giving him some stiff competition. Graham is forever paying for the sin of criticizing Trump in 2016. \"If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed......and we will deserve it,\" Graham tweeted in May 2016 ; he also called Trump \"a race-baiting, xenophobic religious bigot.\"\n\nScholars use the term \"hollowed out\" to describe institutions that lose their independence in autocracies when they have been purged of anyone who is not loyal to the leader. But individuals who collaborate with authoritarians can end up hollowed out, too, bereft of their morals and their self-esteem. This is what has happened to Graham.\n\nGraham is a former military lawyer and national security hawk (including on Russia), but his main cause now seems to be defending Trump, to the point of reversing his view expressed after Jan. 6 that presidential conduct is subject to American law. Since that opinion clashed with Trump's claim that he should have presidential immunity for everything and anything he has done, including inciting an insurrection, Graham's opinion could not stand.\n\nPoliticians who play the leader's ritual humiliation game may think that if they show him enough public support, at the right moments, their past indiscretions will be forgotten. That is never the case. Even worse, the politician can find that he or she has become the enemy of the leader's rabid followers, as well.\n\nThough Graham called Trump \"the most qualified man to be president,\" audience members booed him.\n\nThat's the situation of Graham, booed regularly at Trump rallies by MAGA members, including in his home state, as though all of his slavish behavior to Trump has meant nothing to them. At a July rally with Trump, Graham was jeered and called a \"traitor\" by the crowd, prompting Trump to give him a halfhearted compliment (\"he's there when you need him\") while also promising the crowd he would get Graham \"straightened up.\"\n\nAnd lest there be any doubts that Trump intended this display of debasement, he pulled the same move after Saturday's South Carolina primary. Though Graham called Trump \"the most qualified man to be president,\" audience members booed him. The former president, playing the enlightened despot, once again assured his minions that \"I love him, he's a good man.\"\n\nScott may have mastered the philosophy of ritual humiliation - I am nothing, my leader is everything, and everyone should know it - but Graham's journey provides the stuff of a morality tale.\n\nAs reported by Michael Isikoff and Daniel Klaidman , Graham flipped on Trump when he was forced to testify to a grand jury about a request he made after the 2020 election on behalf of Trump to Georgia's secretary of state to discard mail-in ballots from several Georgia counties. Graham had dutifully fought the subpoena for months, but after he told the truth, he hugged Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and thanked her for the opportunity to testify, saying: \"That was so cathartic. I feel so much better.\"\n\nGraham knew a grand jury had recommended indicting him in Georgia's election interference case , but this was not just opportunism: His words suggest that his conscience was bothering him. And that's why he will likely continue to be a target of Trump's scorn. Trump knows that ritual humiliation breaks down the morale of his enablers, who try so hard to please him but never receive absolute validation and at any moment can be taken down again.\n\nPerhaps one day, the GOP will understand that Trump needs its acclaim and loyalty as much as it needs his and will treat him as the weak and insecure individual he really is. Until then, it will be a willing accomplice in its own humiliation, owned by Trump for all the world to see.\n\nRuth Ben-Ghiat is a historian and commentator on authoritarianism and propaganda.

Other vice presidential prospects like Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., are also using the opportunities afforded to them in Congress to burnish their credentials to appeal to Trump. That includes using their vote cards, committee seats, procedural tools and - perhaps most importantly - their ability to get on TV to speak to an audience of one.\"He understands the devil's in the details. So he puts his brilliant daughter-in-law in charge of our RNC apparatus,\" Scott said on Sean Hannity's Fox News show after Trump installed Lara Trump as new co-chair of the Republican National Committee.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you want the ball in the hands of the best player on the field. That player is Donald Trump,\" he added in what came across as a thinly veiled VP audition tape.\n\nFor decades, Capitol Hill has been a powerful launching pad for vice presidential nominees. In the last two decades, five out of the seven chosen were sitting members of Congress. A sixth, Mike Pence, was a former member turned Indiana governor. Going back to 1992, 10 of 11 running mates had experience serving in Congress (the exception was Sarah Palin, the Alaska governor, in 2008).\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who was Hillary Clinton's vice presidential pick in 2016, said the nature of the GOP jockeying on Capitol Hill is \"different\" than it was in the past.\n\n\"Normally, being too bold about your ambition is probably not a good thing. But Donald Trump's not the normal guy. So I think the jockeying is very unusual, but it's kind of in character with what people understand about Trump,\" Kaine said in an interview. \"The way to impress him is not by being a dutiful soldier who just keeps your head down and works. The way to impress him is to really flatter him and suck up to him.\"\n\nGreene, the far-right congresswoman who has indicated interest in being VP , has sought to curry favor with Trump by engaging in a weekslong push to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., accusing him of betraying the GOP and the MAGA movement. Her push failed Wednesday as a vast majority of Republicans and Democrats voted to shoot down her motion. Trump largely steered clear of the melee, offering words of support to both sides.\"I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" Trump said on social media after the vote closed, while adding that it was \"not the time\" for her motion to vacate the speaker's chair.\n\nVance, a former Trump critic turned staunch ally who was first elected in 2022, has toured the Sunday show circuit to align with a central theme of Trump's campaign: that Congress shouldn't have certified the 2020 election for Biden, even though he won.\n\n\"If I had been vice president, I would have told the states - like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others - that we needed to have multiple slates of electors and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there,\" Vance said recently on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"That is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020.\"\n\nBy contrast, Rubio and Scott voted with the vast majority of the Senate to certify Biden's win in the hours after police cleared the Jan. 6 rioters out of the Capitol. Stefanik and Greene were among 139 House Republicans who voted to overturn the 2020 result.Trump's election denial claims have been a central theme of his campaign as he promises revenge against his foes. Scott and Rubio have taken note. Scott repeatedly refused to say this month on NBC's \"Meet The Press\" whether he'd accept the result of the 2024 election. Rubio said on ABC that some Jan. 6 defendants have been \"egregiously charged\" for trespassing onto the Capitol grounds.\n\nVance has also carved out a niche as an outspoken opponent of U.S. assistance to Ukraine, aligning with many Trump voters.\n\nA recent vote on a package of aid to Ukraine and Israel highlighted divisions. Vance and Rubio voted against it, while Scott came out in favor of it but missed the vote. In the House, where the bills were broken up, Stefanik voted to help Israel but not Ukraine. Greene voted against both measures.In his statement , Scott took a swipe at Biden: \"The effort of Congress to support our allies should be applauded, but President Biden's foreign policies have been an utter failure.\"\n\nRubio's \"no\" vote on aid to Ukraine and Israel highlights his evolution since 2016, when he presented himself as an outspoken foreign policy hawk who favors an active U.S. role in shaping world affairs. Critics accuse Rubio of pandering to MAGA-style nationalism, but Rubio's allies say his views reflect changing realities in the U.S. and around the world.\n\nAmong the rumored VP contenders this year, Rubio has been less bombastic about Trump and instead leaned on his legislative resume. He has used his perch as the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee to highlight his hawkish approach to China , including as an early proponent of legislation to ban TikTok, a popular app owned by a Beijing-based company that answers to the Chinese Communist Party. Allies note that he helped shape parts of the 2017 tax cuts, Trump's main domestic achievement as president.\n\nPart of the appeal of Rubio and Scott is that both are well-liked by Republican donors who are skeptical of Trump and his MAGA movement. That's less true of Vance and Greene.\n\nBut Rubio is also cautious to avoid criticizing Trump and quick to dismiss questions from reporters about his controversial or offensive statements. He appears conscious of Trump's red line not to grant any legitimacy to the dozens of criminal charges he's facing. Rubio has even endorsed Trump's sweeping claims of presidential immunity from prosecution for potentially committing crimes.\n\n\"Hillary said to me, 'There's better political picks than you but if something happens to me, you would be a good president.' That's not the way that Donald Trump is going to approach this,\" Kaine said. \"He's going to approach it as: 'Who will be the most loyal to me?' When it seems like, to be in the running, you can't even say you'll abide by the election outcome? That's pretty dangerous.\"\n\nI'm a reporter for NBC News covering Capitol Hill, elections and the intersection of politics and public policy in Washington.

He also brushed off the idea that he could serve as someone else's running mate. \"Being vice president has never been on my to-do list,\" he said.\n\nMr. Scott's decision was in many ways unsurprising: He has struggled in polls and with recent fund-raising, and would have had to hit a new threshold of 80,000 donors as well as a higher number in public opinion surveys in order to qualify for the next debate sponsored by the Republican National Committee, which will be held in December.\n\nMr. Scott conducted the Fox News interview from a television studio in his home, and told his staff on a call after he spoke to Mr. Gowdy, according to a person familiar with the events. A number of staff members learned that the campaign was being suspended from watching television, three people familiar with the matter said.\n\nMr. Scott had canceled events in Iowa over the weekend , with his campaign saying he had the flu.

He stopped to hug and greet adoring supporters in his path. Mr. Scott, who grew up idolizing professional wrestlers, looked the part of the fan favorite on his way to the ring.\n\n\"I am a huge fan of America,\" Mr. Scott, 58, the Senate's only Black Republican, said. \"We are the greatest country on God's green earth.\"\n\nHe delivered this message to an almost entirely older, white group.

Bender\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nSenator Tim Scott of South Carolina, one of the top contenders to become Donald J. Trump's running mate, will host a gathering in Washington next month featuring Republican donors who so far remain publicly uncommitted to the party's presidential ticket.\n\nPitched as a meeting of Great Opportunity Policy, a tax-exempt group that supports Mr. Scott's political agenda, the private event on June 19 will double as a fund-raiser just as Mr. Trump's vice-presidential search is expected to start heating up.\n\nA financial show of force for Mr. Scott's group could lift his chances of being selected by Mr. Trump, who has spoken to advisers at Mar-a-Lago about which potential running mates could help the campaign raise money . For Mr. Scott, the event may help signal that he is a more palatable political figure for centrist donors and that adding him to the ticket could expand the network of financial resources Mr. Trump could tap into this year.\n\nAccording to a copy of the invitation obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Scott's event will feature remarks from a range of major donors and other well-known figures:\n\nMarc Andreessen, the software engineer turned investor who has given more than $11 million to non-Trump political causes this cycle\n\nKenneth Griffin, the founder of the hedge fund Citadel, who has made nearly $60 million in political contributions this cycle, much of which helped finance Mr. Trump's Republican primary challengers\n\nMarc Rowan, the chief executive of Apollo Global Management, who supported Mr. Scott's presidential bid\n\nBill Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, who has said he is deciding whether to support Mr. Trump or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , an independent presidential candidate\n\nTim Dunn, a founder of CrownQuest, who has already supported Mr. Trump with a $5 million contribution to Make America Great Again Inc., the former president's super PAC\n\nKellyanne Conway, a former senior counselor in the Trump White House\n\nMr. Trump has become increasingly worried about a range of money problems. On the campaign trail, his advisers expect to be outgunned by President Biden's fund-raising operation. In the courtroom, his four criminal cases have led to sky-high legal bills, sapping roughly $50 million from his Save America political action committee last year.\n\nThe former president has responded by leaning into his own fund-raising efforts - a major shift from his first campaign, in 2016, when he appealed to voters by portraying political donors as a malignant force undermining the interests of working-class Americans.\n\nAt a private fund-raiser on Saturday at his Mar-a-Lago club in South Florida, Mr. Trump told donors that they would not receive a picture with him if \"you didn't pay enough,\" and added that he occasionally told his aides they scheduled too many photos before an event.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

He meant the question, he added, \"not in a condemning way - just genuinely want to know a little bit more.\"\n\nMr. Scott told the group that he was in a relationship with a woman whom he was serious about but not yet ready to introduce to the public, according to two accounts of the meeting.\n\nMr. Demastus said that Mr. Scott's response satisfied him in the moment, and that his congregation hasn't seemed to care much one way or the other. It's not a topic voters have clamored to ask the candidate about during town halls. And yet, as Mr. Scott joked at an evangelical conference in Des Moines, queries about the woman in his life have been \"one of the more asked questions recently.\"\n\nAnd Mr. Scott is answering, however reluctantly.\n\n\"I am dating a lovely Christian girl,\" he told Iowa's attorney general, Brenna Bird, who asked him what she called the \"personal\" question right off the bat. \"One of the things I love about the Gospel of Jesus Christ is that it points us always in the right direction. Proverbs 18:22 says, 'He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the Lord.'

Trump on Friday evening at a rally in New Hampshire, according to two people briefed on the matter.\n\nMr. Scott was traveling to Florida on Friday so that he could fly with Mr. Trump to New Hampshire for the rally, the two people said. His endorsement of Mr. Trump is likely to spur additional discussion of Mr. Scott as a potential running mate for the former president. He is the highest-ranking elected Black Republican in the nation.\n\nMr. Scott arrived at his decision only recently. After ending his own campaign for president on Nov. 12 , he had said he would not endorse \"anytime soon.\" But he came to the conclusion that Mr. Trump was the best candidate to defeat President Biden, according to one person familiar with his thinking.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Scott declined to comment. A spokesman for the former president did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMs. Haley, in a statement, said: \"Interesting that Trump's lining up with all the Washington insiders when he claimed he wanted to drain the swamp. But the fellas are gonna do what the fellas are gonna do.\"\n\nDuring the race, Mr. Trump avoided criticizing Mr. Scott, a sign that he held warmer feelings for the senator, whom he worked alongside while president.

His television ads weren't working. His operation was burning through far more cash than it was raising. And his super PAC had canceled its own television ads days before Ms. DeCasper's staff call.\n\nThere was one other detail that had been closely guarded: The man long expected to be the super PAC's biggest donor, the billionaire Larry Ellison, wound up not giving anything to the group after Mr. Scott entered the race, according to four people aware of the group's finances. From 2020 to 2022, Mr. Ellison donated $35 million to Scott-aligned groups, and a huge check had seemed a foregone conclusion when Mr. Ellison showed up at the Scott kickoff and got a shout-out from the stage.\n\nBefore his run, Mr. Scott telegraphed to allies that he had expected a significant sum to flow into his super PAC, according to three of the people familiar with the discussions and planning, and the super PAC wrote a budget for roughly half the amount that Mr. Scott had predicted. But donations fell well short of even that smaller sum.\n\nBy early November, Mr. Scott had sunk so low in polls that he barely qualified for the third presidential debate in Miami.

      "text": "Tim Scott's Purity Culture\n\nIf Sen. Tim Scott were elected president of the United States-and, given polling , that looks like a pretty big \"if\" for now-he would be a historic winner. Not only would he be the second Black president and the first Black Republican, but he would also make history as the first unmarried president since James Buchanan in 1857-and the very first president, as far as we know, to have once proclaimed himself, unabashedly, an adult virgin.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the Bible is very clear: abstinence until marriage. Not to do so is a sin,\" Scott told the National Journal in 2012.\n\nThe politician's public claims of virginity date to the early and mid-'90s, when he was running for city council in Charleston, South Carolina. Often described in more recent coverage as a \"proud\" 30-year-old virgin , Scott earned the support of the National Abstinence Education Association and later went on to co-sponsor the Abstinence Education Reallocation Act , which would have funded abstinence education and called for teaching the \"skills needed to resist the negative influences of the pervasive sex-saturated culture.\" (The bill went nowhere.)\n\nBut Scott can no longer claim to be a virgin, it seems. After he was appointed to the Senate in 2012, the National Journal asked him if he was sticking to his pledge of abstinence.\n\n\"Not as well as I did then,\" Scott said. He was 46 at the time.\n\nBut he hadn't changed his mind about sex before marriage. \"The Bible's right,\" he said. \"You're better off to wait. I just wish we all had more patience.\"\n\nIt's impossible to say if or how Scott's own personal sexual journey will play into his political image. But according to experts, among a certain set of the constituents he is trying to reach, it probably won't hurt.\n\n\"It's a testament to his faith,\" said Kera Street, a researcher and incoming professor of religious studies at Brown University. \"Particularly [to] this kind of conservative, evangelical Christianity.\"\n\n\"White evangelical voters will say he's someone who has lived faithfully,\" said Sara Moslener, author of Virgin Nation: Sexual Purity and American Adolescence and a lecturer in the department of philosophy and religion at Central Michigan University. \"He maintains that this is an important value to him, even though he hasn't lived it perfectly. And that works well with white evangelical voters.\"\n\nAs for Scott's personal background, Moslener said, the pattern makes sense.\n\nIn the 1990s, when Scott was entering politics, the Southern Baptist Convention had launched its \"True Love Waits\" initiative; in its first public event in 1994, it staked more than 200,000 abstinence pledge cards in the lawn of the National Mall. Just a year later, the organization the Silver Ring Thing launched, pushing purity rings with concert-style events. In the New York Times, teenagers urged their fellow Christian teens to \" come out \" as virgins. Joshua Harris' popular book I Kissed Dating Goodbye , a kind of manifesto for purity culture, was published in 1997.\n\n\"That was the decade of the proud virgin,\" Moslener said.\n\nThe purity culture of the '90s was also one that tied abstinence to politics, in a way that tracks with Scott's conservative values. According to Moslener, in a Bible annotated by the True Love Waits initiative, the movement's founder spoke of sexually pure people bringing about a national renewal. Sexual morality among young people represented a healthy moral climate; a healthy moral climate represented a strong and secure nation.\n\n\"The SBC was clear about making this effort to connect sexually pure adolescents with U.S. nationalism,\" Moslener said.\n\nShe noted that during the Cold War, many Christians believed that sexual profligacy corrupted the moral fabric of the country and made it more susceptible to communism. Even moving beyond the Cold War, people such as Anita Bryant and Jerry Falwell connected sexual immorality with danger-to the innocence of children-and to the deterioration of the nation overall.\n\n\" 'This increase in sexual immorality is a sign of a declining civilization': This is an idea that is very much in the DNA of the United States,\" Moslener said.\n\nSo for Scott to have embraced purity culture at that moment, during that stage of his career, made a great deal of political sense. Which is not to say that it didn't come from a genuine place of belief. Purity culture emerged out of the 1980s, when Scott was in his teens and early 20s, undergoing his spiritual formation. The Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which requires its student leaders to sign a sexual purity statement, helped him discover his faith.\n\nAnd in the '90s and 2000s, as Scott was heading toward the start of his real political career (he won a seat in the South Carolina Statehouse in 2008), Christianity was being marketed as an extreme and radical identifier for young people, Moslener said. Celebrities were getting into it; the Jonas Brothers proudly flaunted their purity rings. And purity culture, long thought of as a feminine matter, began to attract more men. \"In the 2000s in particular, there was an injection of muscular Christianity into evangelicalism,\" she said.\n\n\"The people who were teens in the '90s and 2000s were in the thick of purity culture,\" Moslener added. \"He's older than that, but he lived in that world and does seem like someone who's transparent about his values and how he lives out his Christianity.\n\n\"He sounds like the really thoughtful, earnest Christian kid who really has a sincere relationship with Jesus,\" she continued. \"He's someone who's always been the exemplar.\"\n\nBut Scott isn't just any politician. He's specifically a Black male Republican . And for Black political candidates, claims of abstinence can mean something more.\n\nAccording to Street, there's one obvious way in which such a claim to abstinence can help politically: It counteracts racist stereotypes of Black men as extremely sexual.\n\n\"For Sen. Scott to make this pledge of public purity, it makes him safe,\" Street said. \"It allows the public to see him as something different-that he's not that kind of Black guy.\"\n\nBut it also makes him out to be a particular kind of Christian. Black politicians, in the public's imagination, are often associated with historically Black churches-churches with a tradition of participating in the Civil Rights Movement and supporting Black and usually more progressive candidates. To the many white Republican voters, the Black church is likely associated with political opposition.\n\n\"To make this public commitment, it aligns himself with a type of evangelical Christianity that's not typical for Black male Christians,\" Street said.\n\nIn other words, it aligns him with white evangelicalism.\n\nScott grew up in a historically Black church, but a partial sports scholarship took him to a largely white Christian college-a place where he \"heard the N-word many times off and on campus,\" according to his memoir, Opportunity Knocks: How Hard Work, Community, and Business Can Improve Lives and End Poverty . He would transfer to a Baptist college associated with the SBC. As an adult, he attended a nondenominational megachurch called Seacoast, which has 13 campuses in the Carolinas but is based in the wealthy, largely white town of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. He has been a member of Seacoast since 1997, and called it \"the most powerful force in my adult life.\" For Scott, who, according to the 2012 profile, twice in his life considered going into seminary, that is likely no exaggeration. As Moslener put it, \"His adult life has been in white evangelicalism.\"\n\nOf course, purity culture is not the sole purview of white churches. According to Moslener, Black purity culture has been historically intertwined with ideas of \"racial uplift\" and fighting ugly, racist stereotypes. This tracks somewhat with Scott's own ideas about personal responsibility when it comes to racism: The senator has said he learned early on that he \"could think my way out of poverty.\"\n\nStill, Street, who has studied Black women who make purity pledges, argues that reducing Black purity culture to \"respectability politics\" misses just how powerful purity culture is more broadly. As in white churches, she noted, purity culture in historically Black churches can reach deep into members' lives. It calls for people to live out a \"pure life\" that relates to the media they consume and the broader lifestyles they have. But bearing that in mind, Street said, abstinence in Black churches tends to be less tied up in high-stakes conflicts over the very soul of the country.\n\n\"It doesn't reach the grand narrative status that it does in [white] evangelical megachurch circles,\" she said.\n\nThere is at least one other major reason a political candidate might claim religiously motivated abstinence. Bachelorhood can become a political liability, raising questions among homophobic voters as to whether the politician is simply closeted about their sexuality. Historically, many voters-particularly religiously conservative voters-do not typically trust unmarried candidates.\n\nAnd as unfair as it may be, Scott has faced speculation about his sex life. On one end, there are raised eyebrows over his sexual orientation. On the other, there were headlines about his decision to invite a female lingerie store manager-a \"close family friend\"-to a resort on a three-day getaway. (Never mind that his mother also stayed in the suite with them.) Scott has explained it all-his abstinence, his singledom-as a matter of pursuing the right Christian relationship.\n\n\"In the right time, I will meet Mrs. Right, and she'll want to have a couple kids,\" he told Politico in 2018. \"Or she ain't Mrs. Right. Right?\"\n\nThus far, questions about Scott's romantic life haven't mattered too much; Lindsey Graham, the state's other senator, is also unmarried. (Graham has faced homophobic whispers and jokes for years, but he has never faced a competitive challenger for his seat.) But as a presidential candidate, Scott may face more scrutiny. A religious reason behind his quiet romantic life may help. (Graham's 2016 White House campaign fizzled out; he has long defended his bachelorhood but has never given his evangelical base a faith-based reason for his marital status.)\n\nThough Scott has said he's no longer sticking to his abstinence pledge, he has, understandably, not elaborated. The clarification makes political sense: Being a virgin at 30 sounds quite different from being a virgin at age 57. According to Moslener, in evangelical purity culture, it's not odd to still be a virgin at 30; it's understandable if you haven't found the right partner by then. But purity culture was not developed to apply to those of a more advanced age.\n\n\"The official word is that it's this badge of honor, for someone who's older,\" she said. \"But the entire evangelical purity-culture movement is about preparing people for marriage, which assumes people are getting married in their early 20s. It has little to offer anyone who is single into their late 20s or 30s or 40s.\n\n\"Having to maintain this very restrictive commitment-my guess is he's outgrown that,\" she said.\n\nAnd having broken a promise shouldn't hurt either.\n\n\"Those who heralded Donald Trump as Christian despite his not knowing how to reference Corinthians, his multiple divorces, or his history of sexual misconduct should be just fine with Scott failing to meet his purity goal,\" Monique Moultrie, a religious studies professor at Georgia State University, wrote in an email. \"I think the way that Scott, like Trump, promises to be the 'most conservative protector of life' is going to be more the pull for Christian voters than purity rhetoric.\"\n\nMoslener agreed that professed values matter more than any single pledge, pointing to Sarah Palin's daughter Bristol, who became pregnant as an unwed teenager. Her admission that she had made a mistake and her subsequent affirmation of abstinence and pro-life talking points endeared her to many evangelicals.\n\n\"The problem of having messed up was no longer a problem as long as she still committed to those particular ideals,\" Moslener said. \"So it won't hurt him in any way with that particular part of his base.\"\n\nSo, in a certain light, Scott's stance on sex is extremely politically savvy: It works to deflect rumors, portray him as harmless and chaste, show his commitment to Christian values, and signal solidarity with white evangelicals-while stopping short of making him a sexual oddity. An older adult virgin may seem strange to secular voters, but to Christians who grew up immersed in purity culture, Scott may just come off as the real deal.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Tim Scott's Vice Presidential Debasement Is Almost Complete\n\nDuring an interview on CNN this weekend, host Jake Tapper made a passing reference to guest Sen. Tim Scott as one of a handful of Republican \"vice presidential hopefuls.\" And, goodness, was the South Carolina senator shocked to hear that.\n\n\"I didn't know that I was a vice presidential hopeful,\" Scott said. Who? Moi? \"Thank you very much, Jake, for letting me know where I am on the scale.\"\n\nThe only way that Scott might not be a vice presidential \"hopeful\" is that the phrase undersells it. He's not merely sitting by his phone and hoping he gets the call. He's actively running for the position in all but declaration. And since the selection of vice presidential nominee is determined by a party of one, Scott-who was, at one time, a senator who avoided the limelight-is undergoing the sort of transformative debasement required for a successful audition.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, Scott maintained a good relationship with the president. But like much of the Senate GOP, he wasn't a MAGA evangelist and would flatter the president only as a means to get his pet projects enacted into law. He would occasionally chide Trump for crossing the line, but mostly, he was in the Senate GOP's broad \"haven't seen the tweet\" contingent when it came to responding to daily outrages.\n\nBut he would respond . Even if he wasn't particularly forthcoming in his answers, Scott would reliably take reporters' questions about upcoming votes, his work on bipartisan police reform measures, and what have you. When he decided he might be interested in running for president, that changed. The senator became much more guarded about speaking freely both in the run-up to and after his presidential campaign launch. Risky endeavors-i.e., potential bipartisan accomplishments-like police reform negotiations came to a halt.\n\nScott's presidential campaign, with its nebulous message of optimism and strategic avoidance of talking about Trump, never took off. He dropped out in November during a television interview, to the surprise of his campaign staff.\n\nDespite the end of his presidential campaign, Scott has maintained a campaignlike presence on the Hill. A few weeks ago, I watched as a couple of reporters separately tried to approach Scott to ask some questions. Before they could speak more than a few words, a flack following the senator handed them business cards and told them to reach out to the office with any questions. There would be no impromptu commentary from the principal on this day. The pivot from walking alone to moving-around-by-phalanx is a well-worn move from senators who are nearing an election and don't want to screw something up. But Scott isn't up for reelection in the Senate until 2028.\n\nScott's vice presidential campaign began in earnest when he endorsed Trump in a way that would ensure maximal damage to his fellow South Carolinian, Nikki Haley. It was on the weekend before the New Hampshire primary, the lone early state where Haley-the last best chance to stop Trump-stood a fighting chance of getting a victory. Scott stood behind Trump at his New Hampshire victory party a few days later, on camera, making himself available as a prop.\n\n\"Did you ever think that she actually appointed you [to the Senate], Tim?\" Trump asked Scott from the microphone. \"Think of it: appointed, and you're the senator of her state.\" After noting that Haley had previously endorsed Trump anyway, Trump said, \"You must really hate her.\"\n\nScott laughed nervously and briefly took the microphone to say, \"I just love you!\"\n\n(Speaking of love: Around this time, Scott also got engaged, a life-changing decision that is not unprecedented among men seeking the vice presidency. Unmarried politicians frighten the American voter.)\n\nScott has served as a key Trump surrogate and campaigner during the past month on the trail and on television as he competes with the likes of Sen. J.D. Vance and Rep. Elise Stefanik for the VP bid. It's hard to best those two in a competition of giving oneself fully to Trump. Their transformations have been years in the making , and they are now total. Vance flew to Europe just last week to heckle the Munich Security Conference on Trump's behalf.\n\nVance and Stefanik were the other \"vice presidential hopefuls\" whom Tapper was asking Scott about. Tapper noted that Vance and Stefanik \"have both said that they would not have certified Joe Biden's Electoral College victory if they had been vice president on Jan. 6, 2021.\"\n\n\"Would you have?\" he asked Scott.\n\nWell, Scott couldn't easily say he wouldn't have certified Biden's victory, since he, in fact, did vote to certify the election results. And it's this vote that Scott's rivals are reminding Trump of as they seek to block his vice presidential candidacy.\n\nScott chose to dodge Tapper's question altogether, saying he \"wouldn't answer hypothetical questions,\" and noted that the Electoral College certification process in Congress has since been reformed .\n\n\"You're asking a hypothetical question that you know can never happen again,\" Scott said. \"That's the challenge. What CNN and you are focused on are the past. Americans, voters are focused on the future. So what I want to make sure that I do is actually focus on the primary issues confronted by the American people.\" There will be a great deal of time for a great many questions during this campaign. How a candidate would have acted in a leadership position during a recent coup attempt is among the worthwhile ones.\n\nWe'll know in a few months whether Scott's record of less than 100 percent loyalty to Trump over the years trips up his vice presidential candidacy. But for now, Trump is loving this version of Scott. In a Tuesday town hall on Fox News, Trump confirmed that Scott was on a list of vice presidential candidates he was eyeing. Scott was in the room, and Trump called him out for special attention and some light belittlement.\n\n\"A lot of people are talking about that gentleman right over there,\" Trump said, referring to Scott. \"He's been such a great advocate. I have to say this in a very positive way: Tim Scott, he has been much better for me than he was for himself. I watched his campaign, and he doesn't like talking about himself. But, boy, does he talk about Trump. ... I called him and I said, 'Tim, you're better for me than you were for yourself.' \"\n\nIt's hard to contest that.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "True Love Is Telling Fox Nation You Snubbed Donald Trump to Propose to Your Secret Girlfriend\n\nTim Scott, a contender to be Donald Trump's running mate , had a big weekend. On Friday, the South Carolina senator, who ended his own presidential campaign in November, endorsed Trump. He appeared with Trump onstage in New Hampshire, in a clear blow to Nikki Haley, who appointed Scott to his Senate seat in 2012.\n\nBut the biggest news (one hopes) for the senator came from a chilly visit to the beach the next evening. The 58-year-old Scott, perpetual bachelor and former proud adult virgin , is now engaged.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, which first reported the news Sunday night, Scott proposed to Mindy Noce, an interior designer he met at church and had been dating for about a year, on the beach in Kiawah Island in South Carolina. He had chosen a conventional setting after first contemplating popping the question after a game of pickleball.\n\nBut he wasn't done being romantic. On Sunday Night in America , the Fox News program hosted by Trey Gowdy, a former South Carolina congressman, Scott made about as big a romantic gesture as you can on a Fox News show-by announcing that he had said no to an invitation from Donald Trump to make the ask.\n\nThe segment began with a discussion of how great Trump is, but then Gowdy wrapped up Scott's appearance with the announcement that \"the world most eligible bachelor is no longer a bachelor,\" and \"hearts [are] breaking all over the world.\"\n\nScott responded with a chuckle. \"As a matter of fact, when the former president called and said, 'I really want you to endorse me, and I'd love for you to be somewhere on Saturday,' I said, 'Off the table-I've got something more important to do on Saturday,' \" he said. \"It's the second most important decision you'll make in a lifetime. Making Jesus Christ the Lord of my life was No. 1. And the woman I'm going to marry, No. 2. And so, going to the beach and getting on my knee and asking Mindy to marry me was so much more important than anything else, and I wanted to make sure that that sacred day would not be disturbed by anything political.\"\n\nEven assuming he's telling the truth about spurning Trump, this news may still be good for Scott's political prospects. Voters can be uncharitable toward bachelor candidates when it comes to major, national-level contests. Faithful evangelicals, the demographic Scott aims to represent, claim to want family-values candidates. (Trump's popularity with them, of course, undermines that claim. The former president is twice divorced, has admitted to adultery, has been found liable for sexual assault and lying about it, and has been accused of sexual abuse by more than two dozen women.) If Scott is a potential VP pick, the timing of his engagement could be more politically meaningful than a campaign trail appearance.\n\nBut let's not be cynical here. Scott has, for a while now, made it clear that he is eager to find a good Christian wife. (In his announcement on social media, Scott cited Proverbs : \"He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord.\") In 2018 he told Politico, \"In the right time, I will meet Mrs. Right, and she'll want to have a couple kids, or she ain't Mrs. Right.\" He brought Noce onto the stage after the Miami presidential primary debate in November, months after telling the Post that he would not bring his girlfriend on the campaign trail without the \"intention of marrying her.\" He said, at the time, \"I hope that happens , to be honest with you.\" In his interview with the Post on Sunday, the senator acknowledged that he'd been \"very patient and prayerful\" and described himself as \"really excited and somewhat nervous.\"\n\nThe two plan on marrying this year, the Post reported. In the shorter term, though, Scott made up for his Saturday absence on the campaign trail by attending Trump's rally in New Hampshire Monday night and will campaign with him throughout the primary election day on Tuesday. For the couple's sake, let's hope Scott schedules his next romantic milestone on a less politically significant week.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Tim Scott Presidential Long Game\n\nThe telltale sign was when he stopped taking questions.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, for years, denied that he had much interest in running for president. He kept a low national profile for most of his time in the Senate, maintaining good relationships on both sides of the aisle alongside a strictly conservative voting record. He maintained a cordial, if not gushing, relationship with President Trump, and worked with him to develop Opportunity Zones to invest in low-income communities. His national profile grew substantially in the wake of the George Floyd protests, when he put forward a Republican-only police reform bill that failed, and then spent years, to no fruition, working with Democratic Sen. Cory Booker to develop a bipartisan police reform measure.\n\nFor most of this time, Scott was a senator whom reporters could walk up to outside the Senate subway, bug with questions, and get decent responses. That all changed within the past year. Suddenly, he was flanked by more aides, who would tell reporters to reach out to the office when they dared ask the senator a question.\n\nIn short: He was in.\n\nScott made his presidential campaign official on Monday morning with a launch in North Charleston, South Carolina. That makes him the first, and potentially last, Senate Republican to throw his hat in the ring.\n\nScott practices an optimistic form of politics; he's not the type of showy, grievance-based senator who would, say, use his committee chairmanship to investigate Bud Light for doing a social media promotion with a trans person. This much was evident in his campaign kickoff rally.\n\n\"Our party and our nation are standing at a time for choosing: Victimhood or victory?\" Scott said . \"Grievance or greatness? I choose freedom and hope and opportunity.\"\n\nHope, opportunity, aspiration: This is not a message being offered by either of the top two Republican contenders, Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis. It's not one that senators who declined presidential bids, like Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, or Tom Cotton, were capable of presenting, either. And it's not one that has a great track record, within Republican primary politics, against Trump's black hole of grievance politics. But, it's a worthy experiment , something even Scott's early backers, like Senate Minority Whip John Thune, openly acknowledge.\n\n\"There's a lane out there,\" Thune told the Washington Post at Scott's launch. \"We're going to figure out how wide that lane is, for somebody who represents an inspirational, aspirational message.\"\n\nA happy-smiley-magical-unicorn Republican presidential primary campaign might stand a slim chance against the politics of Trump and DeSantis. But what makes it worth attempting, for Scott, is that it's extremely easy to finance: Republican donors disgusted by Trump lap up the cheery archetype.\n\nScott is a prolific, well-connected fundraiser who starts his campaign with $22 million transferred from his Senate account. But the sky's the limit with outside cash. Centibillionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who's already contributed tens of millions of dollars to the fund, is reportedly willing to contribute tens of millions more. The partnership began years ago when Scott visited Ellison on his \"remote Lanai Island home.\" (Ellison doesn't just own a home on Lanai, by the way. He effectively owns Lanai. )\n\nThere will be much more donor cash to come if DeSantis, who will also formally join the presidential race this week, proves to be a paper tiger as the main alternative to Trump. Only in a situation where DeSantis collapses does Scott have a chance.\n\nBut Scott, at the moment, is polling at just about zero. The way Trump greeted Scott into the race Monday was telling of how unthreatened he feels.\n\n\"Good luck to Senator Tim Scott in entering the Republican Presidential Primary Race,\" Trump wrote on his social media network. \"It is rapidly loading up with lots of people, and Tim is a big step up from Ron DeSanctimonious, who is totally unelectable. I got Opportunity Zones done with Tim, a big deal that has been highly successful. Good luck Tim!\"\n\nScott didn't mention Trump in his campaign announcement and, according to the Washington Post, \"his allies don't expect him to spend much time talking about the former president, at least in the early days of his campaign.\"\n\nWill Scott ever \"spend much time talking about the former president\"? What is he really in this race for? It's not just that Scott presents no threat to Trump when he's polling near zero. He becomes actively helpful to Trump if he polls a little bit higher, because then he will start diluting the anti-Trump vote that DeSantis hopes to consolidate. Trump is aware of this as he welcomes Scott into the race, and might look fondly toward Scott as a potential vice-presidential pick so long as Scott doesn't \"spend much time talking about the former president,\" so to speak.\n\nSo, again, why is Tim Scott running for president? Well, why not? He has no plans to run for Senate another time. He will have the financial resources in place to test an optimistic message against a field of candidates inveighing against the marketing campaigns of Bud Light or The Walt Disney Company. And if he doesn't take off, he'll have done Trump a solid in holding off DeSantis. If he then becomes a running mate pick for Trump to balance the ticket, he's positioned to be the 2028 Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThere are worse ways to spend the next year.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Trailing Trump by 30 Points, Ron DeSantis Plans Attack on Tim Scott\n\nRon DeSantis might win the Republican nomination for president in 2024. It could still happen! Lots of things could happen. For example, the guy who's well in front of him in the polls could go to federal prison. But in the meantime, the Florida governor's campaign is mostly employing the kinds of tactics, like spreading word of a \"reboot\" eight months before voting starts , that troubled campaigns employ while they're on their way to becoming a cautionary tale about early hype.\n\nThis week's milestone in the process was the circulation of an internal DeSantis team memo , first published by NBC News . This is a time-honored practice-making a supposedly frank and confidential case, which somehow leaks out to the press, that your candidate still has a clear path to victory, even though he or she is currently mega-behind one or more competitors.\n\nThe DeSantis team begins by noting that its candidate has banked a lot of money (true) and says it's still early enough in the 2024 cycle for voters to change their minds.\n\nEarly state voters are only softly committed to the candidates they select on a ballot question this far out -including many  [Donald] Trump supporters. Our focus group participants in the early states even say they don't plan on making up their mind until they meet the candidates or watch them debate.\n\nThis is a fair point. The assessment of most of the other candidates in the race is also reasonable:\n\nWe've found low to no interest in Vivek [Ramaswamy], [Doug] Burgum, and Nikki [Haley] while far too many voters will not consider [Mike] Pence and [Chris] Christie for them to feel remotely viable.\n\nIt's true, none of them probably have a chance, LOL. But that's about it for claims in the memo that believably convey something like strength. After stating that \"Trump and DeSantis remain the only viable options for two-thirds of the likely Republican primary electorate,\" for instance, the document signals an imminent behind-the-scenes attack on .... South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who is currently averaging 3.2 percent in national polls :\n\nWhile Tim Scott has earned a serious look at this stage, his bio is lacking the fight that our electorate is looking for in the next President. We expect Tim Scott to receive appropriate scrutiny in the weeks ahead.\n\nDeSantis's team likely feels this is necessary because, as Politico reported on Thursday , some of the Republican donors whose highest priority is avoiding another Trump nomination are considering switching their allegiance to Scott.\n\nThe rest of the memo, a year from now, will look either like a testament to remaining calm and steady or to having run out of ideas very quickly. It says DeSantis will continue to discuss Trump's \"failings\" when asked but will otherwise not bring the ex-president up. It says he will continue to earn free media coverage by introducing \"big, bold ideas that will get people talking,\" presumably along the lines of his late-June statement that suspected drug traffickers should be shot dead at the border . (The memo promises an autumn rollout of takes on subjects including \"woke military\" [sic] and \"the deep state.\") And the campaign's plan to build up its candidate's \"positives\" may sound familiar as well:\n\nWe've found that when voters hear about the Governor's bio principally as a Dad and as a veteran- they like him and are open to hearing more about him ... A major paid media effort featuring the Governor's bio (dad/family/veteran) will help us to convert image to ballot.\n\nCompare that to what the Wall Street Journal wrote in April :\n\nMr. DeSantis is also preparing to introduce himself more on a personal level, aides say, drawing on his modest upbringing, athletic and academic achievements, military service and as a husband and father of three young children.\n\nThe major question of the DeSantis campaign is whether he can win the nomination by going around Trump rather than through him. On this question, the memo issues a resounding verdict of \"maybe.\" A really frank and confidential version of the campaign's current strategy would go something like, \"sit on a pile of money, eliminate threats like Tim Scott when necessary, and stay in a clear second place while Trump's indictments play out.\"\n\nWhile that isn't very inspiring, it's also not necessarily stupid- as the memo says, \"Trump is always the most efficient driver of his own negatives.\" In other words, the introduction of Ron DeSantis to voters as a father and veteran will continue until morale improves.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "GOP Senator Defects, Sinks Trump Judicial Nominee With History of Racist Writing\n\nRyan Bounds' nomination to the 9 th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was derailed on Thursday when South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott announced he could not support the nominee because of his history of racist writing.\n\nDonald Trump nominated Bounds, who currently serves as an assistant U.S. attorney, to the 9 th Circuit in September. A staunch conservative, immigration hardliner , and member of the Federalist Society, Bounds appeared to be coasting to an easy confirmation until the liberal group Alliance for Justice uncovered bigoted statements he made as a Stanford student in the 1990s. Among other inflammatory claims, Bounds wrote that:\n\n• multicultural groups on campus \"divide up by race for their feel-good ethnic hoedowns.\"\n\n• \"race-focused groups\" should be abolished, as the \"existence of ethnic organizations is no inevitable prerequisite to maintaining a diverse community-white students, after all, seem to be doing all right without an Aryan Student Union.\"\n\n• \"strident racial factions in the student body ... seem always to contribute more to restricting consciousness, aggravating intolerance, and pigeonholing cultural identities than many a Nazi bookburning.\"\n\n• some campus communities think that the \"opponent\" is \"the white male and his coterie of meanspirited lackeys: 'oreos,' 'twinkies,' 'coconuts,' and the like.\"\n\n• \"Expelling students [found guilty of rape] is probably not going to contribute a great deal toward a rape victim's recovery; there is no moral imperative to risk egregious error in doing so.\"\n\nBounds did not disclose these past statements to the Senate Judiciary Committee. After they came to light, he apologized for his \"obnoxious tone and misguided sentiments.\" That, apparently, satisfied the committee's Republicans, who approved his nomination on a party line vote. Ever since, the two Democratic senators from Bounds' home state of Oregon have struggled to peel off the single Senate Republican necessary to sink his nomination. (With John McCain absent indefinitely, the chamber is divided 50-49.) On Wednesday, they succeeded, as Scott declared his opposition to Bounds. Sen. Marco Rubio quickly joined him, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell withdrew the nomination.\n\nA handful of Republican senators, John Kennedy chief among them , have balked in the past over Trump's more questionable nominees. Kennedy successfully tanked the nomination of Brett Talley (who appears to have defended the first KKK), Jeff Mateer (who called transgender children evidence of \"Satan's plan\"), and Matthew Petersen (who flubbed a basic law quiz ). But none of these nominees ever reached a floor vote, as an embarrassed White House quietly yanked their nominations before they reached that stage. Talley, Mateer, and Petersen were notable exceptions to Trump's successful effort to stack the courts with dogmatic conservatives. Thanks to Republican cooperation, the president has already appointed 23 judges to the courts of appeals and 20 district court judges, far outpacing his predecessors.\n\nBounds is the first Trump judicial nominee to fail to get approval on the Senate floor, an outcome that will undoubtedly empower Democrats steeling themselves for the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. But the reason for Bounds' ouster is more telling than the ouster itself. Unless they can uncover flagrant racism in the nominee's past, Senate Democrats shouldn't expect an eleventh hour defection to save them from a Justice Kavanaugh.\n\nRead more from Slate: • Brett Kavanaugh's Legal Opinions Show He'd Give Donald Trump Unprecedented New Powers • Trump Shows That if You Challenge the Truth Long Enough, Reality Will Conform to Your Delusion • Republicans Just Refused to Spend More to Secure States' Vulnerable Election Systems • Michelle Obama Launches Splashy Midterm Effort, but Not the One Democrats Wanted\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Did the GOP Debate Show the Slipping Grip of the Religious Right?\n\nDuring the Republican debate Wednesday night, the first question about abortion didn't arrive until there were just 15 minutes left in the two-hour event. Fox News' Dana Perino, one of the moderators, turned to Ron DeSantis and asked: \"How are you going to win over independent pro-choice voters in Arizona?\"\n\nDeSantis used the opportunity to attack Donald Trump's comments about abortion. \"I want him to look into the eyes and tell people who have been fighting this fight for a long time,\" he said. Later in his answer, he added: \"I think we should hold the Democrats accountable for their extremism, supporting abortion all the way up until the moment of birth. That is infanticide and that is wrong.\"\n\nChris Christie used the moment to boast about vetoing Planned Parenthood funding. \"But what you need is a leader who could talk to people and make them understand that if you're pro-life, you have to be pro-life for the entire life, not just the nine months in the womb,\" he said.\n\nAnd that was it.\n\nAfter years of elevating abortion as the preeminent social issue among Republicans, abortion barely came up during the second GOP debate. The late timing of the question was  the network's decision and not the candidates', but the limited airplay certainly suggested how little Republican figures are prioritizing the issue-as did the other candidates' decision not to dwell on it or bring it up on their own. Roe v. Wade was struck down, yes, but abortion remains an unsettled political issue. The debate over abortion hasn't been resolved; Republicans have simply figured out that, in this particular moment, railing against abortion isn't a winning political strategy.\n\nAnd that wasn't the only culture war issue that was underplayed at the debate. Candidates spent more time discussing border security and government spending than LGBTQ+ rights and race. And it was noticeable that the conversations that did come up omitted one particular word: God.\n\nThe religious right has long been behind some of the biggest culture war debates in this country-white evangelicals stirred up anxiety over gender roles as part of the earliest culture wars-and yet none of the candidates spoke of their religious conviction behind their policy positions. School choice and \"parental rights\"-key terms in the debates over \"critical race theory\" and LGBTQ+ acceptance in schools-came up during the debate, but not alongside arguments about parents' religious rights. Instead, there was an almost scientific note to the discussion.\n\n\"Transgenderism, especially in kids, is a mental health disorder,\" Vivek Ramaswamy incorrectly asserted. He also made the case (again, baselessly) that schools keeping parents ignorant of their child's sexual orientation and gender identity increased the risk of the child's suicide.\n\nMike Pence, one of the two more explicitly religious-right candidates on the stage, vowed to \"pass a federal ban on transgender chemical or surgical surgery anywhere in the country.\"\n\nIt was all consistently secular. No one expects the candidates to give sermons, but all candidates likely know that they need support from white evangelicals if they stand a chance at nabbing the GOP nomination: White evangelicals make up more than a quarter of all voters, and they vote overwhelmingly Republican. So why not use the major televised moment to make an explicitly religious case for your candidacy?\n\nIt may be that these candidates have come to one conclusion: The religious right is losing some control of their party.\n\nThe explicitly Christian nationalist candidates, such as Pennsylvania's gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, were walloped in the most recent midterm elections, their losses ultimately helping to shrink the GOP's hold on the House to an embarrassingly thin margin. That poor showing served as a wake-up call for Donald Trump, who went on to distance himself from the more extreme abortion bills that state and local Republicans have pushed. As Ron DeSantis hoped to argue Wednesday night, that could have been seen as a betrayal to the religious right.\n\nAnd yet, it's unlikely that Trump's turn on abortion will hurt him. No matter how much Trump acts counter to evangelical ideals, or fumbles when quoting the Bible, or fails to even really mention religion, Republicans believe him to be a man of God. New polling from the Deseret News found that some 53 percent of Republicans believe Trump is a man of faith-a higher percentage than Mike Pence received. The deeply religious Tim Scott garnered only 31 percent in this poll. The religiously evasive DeSantis beat Scott with 47 percent. It seems almost as if the perception of the candidate's religiosity has more to do with their popularity and name recognition than anything else.\n\nAnd some scholars have been arguing this for some time. In 2021, Pew Research Center put out a poll that validated what some had already been noticing anecdotally: During Trump's presidency, the number of white people who identified as \"evangelical\" increased.\n\nRyan Burge, a political science assistant professor at Eastern Illinois University, explained what he saw going on in an analysis in the New York Times :\n\nInstead of theological affinity for Jesus Christ, millions of Americans are being drawn to the evangelical label because of its association with the G.O.P.\n\nThis is happening in two different ways. The first is that many Americans who have begun to embrace the evangelical identity are people who hardly ever attend religious services. ... The evidence points in one direction: For many Americans, to be a conservative Republican is to be an evangelical Christian, regardless of whether they ever attend a Sunday service.\n\nThe second factor bolstering evangelicalism on surveys is that more people are embracing the label who have no attachment to Protestant Christianity. For example, the share of Catholics who also identified as evangelicals (or born again) rose to 15 percent in 2018 from 9 percent in 2008.\n\nIt used to be that when many people thought about evangelicalism, they conjured up an image of a fiery preacher imploring them to accept Jesus. Now the data indicate that more and more Americans are conflating evangelicalism with Republicanism - and melding two forces to create a movement that is not entirely about politics or religion but power.\n\nTo be a Republican culture warrior is to be an \"evangelical,\" as these new \"cultural evangelicals\" see it-and what matters is the cultural victory, not the theology behind the politics.\n\nSo as Trump supporters have said again and again over the years, he is a \"fighter\" for their cause. It doesn't matter how much of a believer he actually is. But ironically, the swell in the evangelical ranks may have loosened some of the rhetorical power of the religious right, simply by diluting their actual religious intensity. If \"cultural evangelicals\" care more about having a \"fighter\" than a spiritual leader, the culture war issues can become more secularly political while still working as a political tool. And then Republican candidates, standing on a debate stage, don't need to say \"God.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Let's Catch Up on How All of Trump's Vice Presidential Candidates Are Humiliating Themselves\n\nDonald Trump needs to pick a vice presidential candidate soon. The Republican National Convention in Milwaukee is in mid-July, and Trump's relationship with Mike Pence, who served as his running mate the last time he ran for office, became strained when Pence refused to help carry out a coup on Trump's behalf and came somewhat close to getting murdered by a mob as a result.\n\nWhich is to say, the job is open because the previous employee who held it was nearly killed by the person doing the hiring. Other Republicans have nonetheless been beating down Trump's door, in some cases almost literally , for several years to increase their chances of being chosen. \"Sounds great!\" they say, looking at what happened to Pence and the many other Trump right-hand men and women who have ended up in jail , indicted , bankrupt , or giving interviews to anyone who will listen about how he is a fundamentally delusional and narcissistic person whose election would threaten the continued existence of the country. \"Let's do this!\"\n\nThe point is that wanting to become Donald Trump's running mate is an intrinsically debasing activity. But the individuals in contention for the role understand that they also have to earn his respect publicly through humiliating acts of exaggerated loyalty and disavowals of anything they've ever said previously that he might not like. Here's some of what's been going on in that department in recent weeks.\n\nWhat she'd bring to the ticket: Aggressive TV \"surrogate\" skills, being a woman How she's demeaning herself and/or civil society as a whole: Stefanik's major liability as a potential veep is that she was a moderate Republican with a documented history of disparaging Trump both in public and in private before she chose, in roughly 2018, to adopt a MAGA identity. Asked about this history by Fox News' Shannon Bream on Sunday, she said the line of questioning was a \"disgrace\" based on \"smears,\" claimed the New York Times' reporting about her disparagement of Trump relied on anonymous sources (in fact, several former friends of hers spoke to the paper on the record), and implied that the Democratic Party released the Access Hollywood tape (which appears unlikely ). Stefanik has also begun presenting herself as a crusader against antisemitism despite having run campaign advertisements in 2021 whose claims about immigration appeared to be influenced by the \"great replacement\" and \"white genocide\" theories popular among neo-Nazis. She moreover supported the congressional candidacy of Carl Paladino, a New York state extremist who said in 2021 that Hitler was \" the kind of leader we need today .\" (Not true, in our opinion.) In other words, an Elise Stefanik vice presidential run is likely to lean heavily on the claim that it is inappropriate to bring up many (most?) of the things Elise Stefanik has done or said during her career.\n\nWhat she'd bring to the ticket: Rural blue-collar authenticity, female-hood How she's demeaning herself and/or civil society as a whole: Ha ha, how much time do you have? Noem seems to have been aiming to sell herself as a mama bear/Sarah Palin type with the May 7 publication of a memoir called No Going Back , but overshot the mark, if you will, by proudly including stories about having executed a misbehaving dog, and also a misbehaving goat , in a gravel pit. (Don't laugh! Goat delinquency is a big problem in the Badlands.) Then people noticed her book described her having personally stared down Kim Jong-un-mama bear stuff-despite there being no evidence that Noem and Kim have ever met. She responded by saying the claim would be removed from future printings of the book, but also by telling interviewers that she didn't think it was appropriate to discuss her conversations with world leaders (despite being on a publicity tour for a book in which she describes conversations with world leaders). Long story short, Kristi Noem is probably not going to be the GOP vice presidential nominee, and No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong With Politics and How We Move America Forward is probably not going to win the 2024 National Book Award for Nonfiction.\n\nWhat he'd bring to the ticket: Credibility with \"New Right\" populist conservatives How he's demeaning himself and/or civil society as a whole: As Slate has written , Vance is an upwardly mobile tech investor with a high-achieving lawyer wife who lives in a liberal, diverse urban neighborhood ... and ran for office as an enemy of the tech industry who is repulsed and appalled by white-collar cosmopolitan norms regarding diversity and women in the workplace. Which is to say that he's a man who's comfortable with some cognitive dissonance. That's been useful given that Vance, too, publicly described Donald Trump as a dangerous creep-an \" idiot \" and a \" moral disaster ,\" in fact-until it became necessary for his personal career advancement to be a Trump supporter. (You may notice something of a theme developing here.) Last week, the senator-whose book Hillbilly Elegy decried what he described as an epidemic of divorce and personal irresponsibility-attended Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan in order to express his support for the former president, whose position in the case is that while he did make a nondisclosure payment to a pornographic actress with whom he (allegedly) had sex shortly after his third wife had given birth, it wasn't illegal per se to do so. Vance's views about fidelity and accountability, it would appear, have evolved somewhat.\n\nWhat she'd bring to the ticket: Fire, flair, conspiracy theories How she's demeaned herself and/or civil society as a whole: Lake was perhaps the earliest entrant in the veep striver game, traveling so frequently to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida that People magazine reported, in what seemed to be a pointed leak , that she had logged more time there than Trump's wife Melania. (Lest you think I'm reading between the lines a little too much here, take a look at Lake's statement in the piece, which strains to note that her \"overnights\" in Palm Beach took place in the company of \"her loving husband of 25 years.\") Lake ended up running for Senate in Arizona instead of holding out for the veep slot ... but according to a late-April report in the Washington Post , she's still spending so much time at Mar-a-Lago that Trump himself has \"gently suggested\" that she should \"leave the club and hit the campaign trail in Arizona.\" And if Donald Trump thinks you are spending too much time near a golf course instead of working, it is probably true.\n\nWhat he'd bring to the ticket: Unclear How he's demeaning himself and/or American civil society as a whole: Rubio arrived on the national scene in 2010 as a next-generation Republican who supported a so-called path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. When he ran in the 2016 presidential primary, he argued to voters that Trump was not trustworthy enough to be given control of nuclear weapons and implied that he (Trump) has a small penis . In 2020, even, Rubio voted to certify the results of the presidential election despite various right-wing claims about voter fraud. This weekend on Meet the Press , though, Rubio said he now supports Trump's plan to mass-deport more than 10 million undocumented immigrants and believes that Democrats committed fraud in 2020. Sadly, it does not appear that any Sunday-morning host has confronted him yet about what we hope the Beltway press will start referring to as \"the penis factor.\"\n\nWhat he'd bring to the ticket: MAGA/Freedom Caucus energy How he's demeaning himself and/or American civil society as a whole: Donalds didn't become a member of Congress until 2020, and his past criticisms of Trump are limited to some stuff he wrote on social media in the early 2010s . So there's not a lot to disavow, although he did attract some ridicule when he appeared at the hush money trial dressed exactly like Trump (blue jacket, white shirt, red tie) alongside several other surrogates who were also dressed exactly like Trump .\n\nWhat he'd bring to the ticket: Who? How he's demeaning himself and/or civil society as a whole: There's no way there is a guy named Doug Burgum who is going to be vice president. Get out of here with that .\n\nWhat he'd bring to the ticket: Evangelical cred, sunny disposition How he's demeaning himself and/or civil society as a whole: Tim Scott's whole thing was supposed to be that he's a cheerful, optimistic believer in God and American ideals, which made it funny to see him determine after dropping out of the presidential race earlier this year that he needed to enthusiastically endorse Trump , who makes only the barest pretense of knowing anything whatsoever about God and the Bible, and who generally describes the country as a carnage-strewn crap-scape that is on the verge of total collapse. Anyway, after years of speculation that national voters would find it weird , if not outright gay , that he had never been married, the 58-year-old Scott announced in March that he will be wed this August to a South Carolina interior designer named Mindy Noce.\n\nSo, have any of these contenders rearranged their lives, abandoned their convictions, attested to enough dog shootings, and deflected enough questions about Hitler to earn the worst job in American politics? For some reason, they can't wait to find out!\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Hello, Marco Rubio\n\nThis is part of Hello, Trumpworld , Slate's reluctant guide to the people who will be calling the shots now-at least for as long as they last in Washington.\n\nAround this time nine years ago, during the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, candidates Marco Rubio and Donald Trump were engaged in a dispute about penis size.\n\nRubio, then still a freshman senator from Florida, had \"dealt\" with Trump the way most other primary candidates had that cycle: by ignoring him and hoping that his candidacy would collapse under its own ludicrousness. By late February, though, Trump was beginning to run away with the thing, and Rubio was the Republican establishment's last best hope. The usual tricks weren't working. I covered a South Carolina rally in which Gov. Nikki Haley and Sen. Tim Scott-two other figures Trump would go on to smother eight years later-endorsed Rubio, presenting themselves as the future of the party. Trump easily won the South Carolina primary.\n\nSo, in his desperation, Rubio began to let it rip.\n\n\"You know what they say about guys with small hands,\" Rubio said at a Virginia rally on the last day of February. He paused for effect. \"You can't trust 'em!\"\n\nBig mistake. As soon as Rubio began to engage Trump on Trump's terms, \" Little Marco \" became fresh meat. Trump, in what remains one of his funnier clips , elaborately mocked Rubio's infamous State of the Union water bottle lunge . And during a debate in early March, Trump responded to the penis joke.\n\n\"He hit my hands. Nobody has ever hit my hands. I have never heard of this. Look at those hands. Are they small hands?\" Trump said. \"And he referred to my hands-if they are small, something else must be small. I guarantee you, there's no problem. I guarantee you.\"\n\nRubio would end his campaign halfway through that month, after losing his home state's primary. (This was before Florida also became Trump's home state.) After licking his wounds for a couple of months, he decided to run for a second term in the Senate. He would, of course, go on to endorse the man whom he'd described during the presidential primary as a \"con artist\" who couldn't be trusted with the nuclear codes.\n\nRubio's political trajectory ever since that primary has been flat, and he has often seemed bored. Though he's done some meaningful work in Congress, serving as the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee since 2020, Rubio wasn't built to be a Senate lifer. Too ambitious. It was just unclear where he would go . The era of the mid-2010s, during which he, Ted Cruz, and Rand Paul were the future of the party, was long gone, and a new generation of young Republican senators, like J.D. Vance, with trendier postliberal instincts , had replaced them.\n\nTrump's selection of Rubio to be secretary of state, then, is an unlikely resurrection of Rubio's political career. What's unclear is whether this is the valediction of that career, or something that propels him back into the presidential conversation going forward.\n\nRubio isn't a great fit for Trumpworld. On foreign policy and national security, he's an interventionist by nature, a stance that is out of step with the \"America First\" nationalism of Trump's base. During the ancient times of Rubio's peak a decade ago, he was seen as Republican hawks' standard-bearer standing athwart the burgeoning \"isolationism\" of Rand Paul and the \" libertarian moment .\" (This is all so fun to remember.) Rubio, however, is savvy at blurring his own views to stay afloat in shifting ideological tides. He voted against Ukraine aid last year, for example. There's no doubt he was hoping it would pass anyway.\n\nRubio's hawkish history and warm relationship with the pre-Trump Republican establishment-however much he worked to muddy it-ensured that his selection would be met with MAGA detractors . More nationalist Republicans preferred the bomb-throwing Rick Grenell for the State Department; the lag between reports about Trump's selection of Rubio and Trump's official announcement of it indicated that the president-elect might have been having second thoughts. But Rubio, who was a finalist to be Trump's vice president, ultimately received his consolation prize.\n\nRubio is a lock for Senate confirmation for the same reasons he was a controversial selection within the MAGA universe. Among the major Cabinet nominees, he's the most traditional, qualified pick Trump has made. Members of both sides trust him not to do anything too, well, disruptive.\n\nTrump, however, may-or will- ask him to do something \"too\" disruptive. Frequently. The fate of his suddenly revived political career can end in one decision with which his boss disapproves, and he can go from a Republican whom MAGA tolerates to one it abhors. For Rubio to be a potential successor to Trump in 2028, he'd have to make it to 2028 while still in Trump's good graces. That would be an achievement. Trump fired his first secretary of state, former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson, via tweet a little more than a year into his tenure. He was replaced by Mike Pompeo, whom Trump showily turned down for a job in the coming administration. These are the lifespans from just one department. The streets of Washington are littered with excommunicated Trump attorneys general, defense secretaries, FBI directors, and so on.\n\nMaybe Rubio will earn the constant praise and admiration of President Trump II and receive his endorsement for president in 2028. We'd bet, instead, that Trump hasn't uttered the words \"Little Marco\" for the last time. Either way, for Rubio, it beats another however many years of sitting in the Senate, staring at his desk.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Slate's guide to the most important figures in politics this week.\n\nWelcome to this week's edition of the Surge, Slate's beloved politics newsletter, written by the same A.I. chatbot behind \"Melania Trump.\"\n\nThis week: Who is crying the most in the Republican presidential primary field? Is Dianne Feinstein still a senator? On which Easter in the next six years will Joe Biden \"hang up the ol' presidential boots\"?\n\nBut first, the latest on the pride of Western civilization: the American federal court system!\n\nBy Jim Newell\n\nHow do conservatives get what they need out of the federal courts? With great ease. The process starts by going to this guy, Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Donald Trump-appointed judge and conservative activist . He's got a little federal courthouse in Amarillo, Texas. You show up there and you say, \"Psst! We don't like this medication abortion drug that's been around 23 years-you should suspend its FDA approval.\" And Kacsmaryk goes, \"I was JUST about to do that!\" and suspends FDA approval of mifepristone nationwide. Then, what can the Democratic presidential administration do? It can, and did, appeal the decision to the 5 th Circuit, a very conservative appeals court. Early Thursday morning, the 5 th Circuit decided , after a few days of giving it a think, that it would allow mifepristone to remain available but would sharply limit its access while a full appeal is being heard. These are people who don't like abortion, but also don't like big freakouts, trying to negotiate their impulses. They can do whatever they want! And as with all federal policy, this one may come down to whether Chief Justice John Roberts has any leverageable dirt on Brett Kavanaugh from the Chevy Chase Club .\n\nThe 89-year-old senior senator from California has been away from Washington since a shingles diagnosis in early March. She has no timetable of her return. And this week, the question became if she would return. Her indefinite absence has affected the majority's agenda. Democrats, who want to continue confirming federal judges at a rapid pace to combat the whole situation described in the previous entry, can't advance many of their judicial nominees without Feinstein's vote on the Judiciary Committee. By midweek, certain restless Democrats had begun to call on Feinstein to resign. California Rep. Ro Khanna, a fellow Bay Area member of the delegation, tweeted , \"It is obvious she can no longer fulfill her duties.\" (Keep in mind that Gov. Gavin Newsom has said he would appoint a Black woman to finish Feinstein's term should she resign, and being a sitting senator would give Rep. Barbara Lee a leg up in the 2024 Senate primary. Khanna supports Lee.) Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips quickly echoed Khanna's call. Before the calls could snowball into a pitchforked mob, Feinstein('s staff) said she had asked Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to temporarily replace her on the Judiciary Committee until she can return. We'll see next week what kind of opposition that change, which will have to go before the full Senate, invites from Republicans. Senators on both sides are leery of setting a precedent for meddling with the other party's committee appointments. But Republicans have no interest in allowing Democrats to speed up their judicial confirmations either.\n\nThe South Carolina senator launched a presidential exploratory committee this week before visiting several early primary states. We wouldn't rule him out just yet. If enough of the Republican primary electorate comes around to deciding against nominating a member of the FBI's Most Wanted list for president, and if Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis proves a paper tiger, Scott could present a reasonable third choice: experienced, conservative, affable, and well connected with donors . Do not underestimate, too, how much Republican primary voters love a manifested response to liberals' accusations of racism. The trouble we foresee for Scott, though, is difficulty committing to the type of candidacy he wants to run. On the one hand, he is very conservative and wants to make a play for evangelical voters in Iowa and his home state. But part of his draw to donors is his general election appeal: He's not a firebrand, and he would be a compelling candidate for independent voters. Even on the first day of his exploratory committee launch, this tension left him tongue-tied. In a CBS News interview, he repeatedly refused to answer a question about whether he would support the 15-week federal abortion ban introduced by his fellow South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham. All that means is that the same question will be asked again and again until he chooses a side, at which point he will have a new set of problems. It's fun to run for president! Have a nice time, Tim Scott.\n\nTrump has been leaning on one particular category of lie in his 2023 lying record: claiming that people were crying. He's made waterworks a key new element of his story about DeSantis asking for his endorsement in 2018, saying that \"there were tears coming down from his eyes\" when he \"begged\" for Trump's support. He's saying this often! Now there's a whole new ensemble of criers in town: court employees in Manhattan sobbing during his indictment. \"When I went to the courthouse, which is also a prison in a sense, they signed me in, and I'll tell you, people were crying,\" Trump told Tucker Carlson (who \" passionately \" hates Trump). \"People that work there, professionally work there, that have no problems putting in murderers, and they see everybody-it's a tough, tough place, and they were crying,\" he continued. \"They were actually crying. They said, 'I'm sorry.' They said, '2024, sir. 2024.' And tears were pouring down their eyes.\" (Yahoo News, bless its heart, sought out sources to prove that this did not in fact happen.) We don't know who he's going to pretend was crying next month. It could be you, reader!\n\nYou just love to see it: DeSantis, before even announcing a presidential candidacy, is already at the point of attempting to \"rebound\" and \"sharpening his message\" as \"he copes with a drop in his poll numbers,\" the Wall Street Journal reported this week. A pro-DeSantis super PAC is putting in a national ad buy that \"portrays the governor as a leader of a movement surrounding his rejection of Covid-19 lockdowns, support for parental rights in education and fights over the 'woke left.' \" Et cetera, et cetera, so on and so forth. The more interesting behind-the-scenes action this week, though, came in the form of DeSantis working to stop Donald Trump from drinking his milkshake. In the past week, two Florida Republican congressmen, Reps. Cory Mills and Byron Donalds, have endorsed Trump, sending the DeSantis proto-campaign into a tizzy. They've reached out to six undecided Florida Republican members of Congress, \"asking that they hold off on making any endorsements in the near future,\" according to NBC News. Why doesn't DeSantis just launch his presidential campaign already? And hey, speaking of, why doesn't Joe Biden?\n\nWill Old Joe Biden-who's not young!-run for a second term? Let's track the record of statements. Last September, he said it was his \"intention\" to run again. He said the same after November's midterms. In a February interview, first lady Jill Biden said her husband was ready to run and that they just needed to figure out the announcement logistics. \"How many times does he have to say it for you to believe it?\" she said . (Once?) This week, at the White House's annual Easter Egg Roll, Biden told the Today show's Al Roker that \"I plan on running,\" but that \"we're not prepared to announce it yet.\" Sure. He also said the following: \"I plan on at least three or four more Easter Egg Rolls. Maybe five. Maybe six-what the hell? I don't know.\" Stop yanking the president's chain, Al. His plan is to be president through the Monday after Easter of either 2026 or 2027, maybe 2028, and ah, hell, maybe 2029. What more is there to ask?\n\nEven if/when Biden announces his candidacy, don't think that Republicans get to have all the fun in the 2024 primary cycle. Democrats have their own headache reportedly launching on April 19: the presidential campaign of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a conspiracy theorist and vaccine denier . It's not that he is going to win . But he is going to get attention. He has a famous political name and a modest cult following among the more conspiracy-minded elements of the left. An early poll showed him earning 10 percent of the Democratic primary vote, just enough to earn him a few more interviews. An element to watch here, too, is how much stupid celebrities will push him. He already appears to have the support of NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers, another prominent anti-vaxxer (and all-around oddball). There will be more! Good, good.\n\nThe most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Tim Scott becomes longest-serving Black senator in US history\n\nHe's set to chair the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee.\n\nSixty years after Black Americans gained the right to vote in the United States through the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Sen. Tim Scott on Friday makes history, becoming the longest-serving African American in the 235-year history of the United States Senate. This historic moment will be shared alongside four other African-American senators, making this the largest group of Black senators to ever serve concurrently in the U.S. Capitol, a building constructed with the labor of enslaved Black people.\n\nThe previous longest-serving Black senator was the late Republican Sen. Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, who held office from 1967 until 1979. Scott, the first elected Black senator from the South, is the first to serve in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nIn his first speech as a freshman senator, Scott said, \"I believe in the greatness of America because I have experienced the goodness of our people in America. An ordinary guy like me can be blessed with an extraordinary opportunity like this.\"\n\nBorn and raised in North Charleston, South Carolina, Scott was raised in a single-parent household after the divorce of his parents. He was a troubled teenager who failed English, Spanish, geography, and civics in his freshman year in High School. He often recalls his close relationship with his grandfather, who was forced to drop out of school in the third grade, picked cotton to survive, and was not allowed to vote for more than half of his life. His grandfather was also unable to learn how to read, only to witness his grandson's career rise from those humble beginnings in South Carolina to become both a member of Congress and a U.S. senator.\n\n\"Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,\" Scott said at the Republican National Convention in 2020.\n\nAfter serving in the House of Representatives from 2011 until 2013, Scott was appointed by then-South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley to the Senate in 2012 after former Senator Jim DeMint left to become president of the Heritage Foundation. Democratic Senator Cory Booker, who was elected in a special election did not join the Senate until months after Scott's appointment.\n\nIn 2024, the Senate will see its highest-ever Black senators serving concurrently. This group includes Sens. Raphael Warnock, Booker, Scott, Angela Alsobrooks, and Lisa Blunt Rochester. Rochester and Alsobrooks will also break barriers as the first two women to serve together in the Senate concurrently.\n\nDuring his early days in the Senate, Scott occasionally would serve as the only Black person in the Senate. In 2016, following the controversial deaths of Eric Garner, Walter Scott, and Philando Castile he delivered a poignant speech about the deep divide between law enforcement and communities in America. He revealed that, as an elected official, he had been stopped and questioned seven times while driving. Even as a senator, Scott was questioned about his identity by Capitol Police despite wearing a pin identifying himenator.\n\n\"While I thank God I have not endured bodily harm, I have, however, felt the pressure applied by the scales of justice when they are slanted. I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself,\" Scott said in 2016.\n\nAs his career extends into the 119th Congress, Scott will make history as the first Black chairman of a Senate standing committee. He will lead the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and will also chair the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the only Black Republican to hold such a position.\n\nMarking the milestone achievement, Scott said in a statement, \"My goal is simple: make America work for Americans. As we get to work cleaning up the mess from the previous administration, I look forward to working with President Trump on his priorities, including paving a path for all Americans to have the necessary tools and resources to achieve their version of the American Dream.\"\n\n\"We will unlock opportunity, strengthen our nation, and make America the shining city on the Hill again,\" he added.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Why Tim Scott's presidential campaign failed\n\nA strong candidate on paper didn't capture voters' hearts in practice.\n\nAnd then there were seven ( major Republican candidates for president ).\n\nOn Sunday, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott surprised everyone - including, reportedly, some of his own staffers - by dropping out of the race for president . It was an anti-climactic end for a campaign that, on paper, looked like it had a lot of potential . But the debates really took a toll on Scott's campaign, and rather than prolong the inevitable, he left the race early enough to keep his options open for the future.\n\nWhen Scott jumped into the presidential race in May, there was a good case to be made that he was the third-most-likely Republican nominee , after former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. He had $22 million socked away from his Senate campaigns that he could use for the presidential race - more than any candidate not named Trump. He had managed to stay on the good side of both the pro-Trump and anti-Trump sides of the party with his positive message about America. The share of Republicans who had a favorable view of him was much higher (41 percent) than the share who had an unfavorable view (12 percent), and the fact that the other half didn't have an opinion of him indicated he had room to grow.\n\nBut all that potential never became reality. He never cracked 4 percent in 538's average of national polls . He plowed much of his campaign cash into TV ads in early states , and that did seem to work at first: By mid-August, according to 538's averages, he was polling at 12 percent in Iowa , 12 percent in South Carolina (his home state) and 8 percent in New Hampshire .\n\nBut then came the debates. According to the three 538/Washington Post/Ipsos polls conducted using Ipsos's KnowledgePanel after each debate, Scott failed to use the debates to make the case for himself.\n\nAt the first debate , only 4 percent of likely Republican primary voters who watched the debate said he had the best performance, which was tied for third-lowest among the eight candidates. But at the same time, only 2 percent said he had the worst performance - in other words, he simply didn't make much of an impression either way. He got similarly average marks at the second debate . And at the third debate , just last week, only 5 percent said he had the best performance, the lowest of any candidate. And 12 percent said he actually had the worst performance.\n\nOur polls also found that Scott's net favorability rating among Republicans got worse after each debate. Clearly, voters weren't buying what Scott was selling.\n\nBut by dropping out relatively early (other candidates with even worse polling numbers, such as North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, remain in the race), he may have kept his options open for his political future. He never went nuclear on any other candidate, and he departs the race with still-solid favorability numbers, so he remains a viable future presidential candidate. At age 58, he could run again in 2028, 2032, 2036 or even 2040 and still be younger than Trump (or President Joe Biden) is today.\n\nAs for becoming the Republican vice presidential nominee - something that's widely rumored - Scott said on Sunday night , \"Being vice president has never been on my to-do list for this campaign, and it's certainly not there now.\" Of course, it's always possible he could change his mind.\n\nNow that Scott is out of the race, which other candidate(s) might benefit? Normally, this question is overrated - if a candidate drops out, it means they don't have much support, which means no one else stands to benefit much from their departure. But Scott actually does still have meaningful support in some of the early states. As of Sunday, he was at 7 percent in our Iowa polling average, 7 percent in South Carolina and 5 percent in New Hampshire. If most of that support goes to one candidate in particular - say, DeSantis or former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley - that could make them the main alternative to Trump in the early states.\n\nThe problem is, his support probably won't go to one candidate in particular. Scott says he won't endorse any of his one-time rivals. And according to a September poll from WPA Intelligence and FairVote , which showed what the GOP primary might look like if it used ranked-choice voting, Haley stood the most to gain nationally from Scott's elimination from the race ... but DeSantis gained the most in the early states. (Still, it does look like those two will be the biggest beneficiaries of Scott's withdrawal, rather than Trump and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy.)\n\nSomething I wrote when former Vice President Mike Pence dropped out of the race bears repeating here too, though. Even if all of Scott's support goes to one candidate, that candidate will remain far behind Trump, who is polling at 57 percent nationally, 50 percent in South Carolina, 46 percent in Iowa and 44 percent in New Hampshire. In the grand scheme of things, Scott's withdrawal and where his supporters go won't matter unless something fundamentally changes and Trump loses significant support.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Whether or not they would have certified the 2020 election results has emerged as a dividing line among some of the possible vice presidential picks.\n\nVance told ABC News in February that \"we needed to have multiple slates of electors, and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there.\"\n\nRubio voted to certify the 2020 election results but said in May that he did so \"because at that stage in the process, you have no options.\"\n\nBurgum has accepted Biden as the legitimate 2020 election victor but has been more circumspect on accepting the results of the 2024 race.\n\nTrump made his first trip back to the Capitol last week since the riot to discuss future policy plans with congressional Republicans. Scott, who met with Trump, praised the former president's policies to help working class Americans.\n\n\"The working-class coalition that is now supporting Donald Trump is supporting Donald Trump because they know ... they were better off under Donald Trump,\" Scott said. \"And so, what we talked about during the meeting with President Trump is the importance of focusing on the actual working class.\"\n\nKarl also pressed Scott on whether or not he supported a recent Supreme Court decision on bump stocks.\n\nScott said \"we trust and believe and respect the decision of the Supreme Court,\" though he demurred when asked about his past support for legislation codifying a ban on the device.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "South Carolina natives Nikki Haley and Tim Scott's complicated history on display as they battle for GOP nomination\n\nHaley, who once appointed Scott to the U.S. Senate, leads him in several polls.\n\nSen. Tim Scott has spent the past few weeks hurling insults at fellow South Carolinian Nikki Haley following a feisty exchange between the two at the second Republican primary debate , exposing a rift between the two South Carolinian candidates with a history that goes back over a decade.\n\n\"She drew first blood,\" Scott told Fox News' Neil Cavuto. \"She started off by making it personal. I, frankly, did not have a negative comment about her.\"\n\nAt that Sept. 27 Republican debate, Haley did cast the first stone.\n\n\"Twelve years. Where have you been? Where have you been, Tim? Twelve years. We've waited, and nothing has happened,\" Haley said to Scott during an attack on Congress' record on spending, which she attempted to tie him to.\n\nA few minutes later, Scott sniped back, referencing a controversy from 2018 surrounding expensive curtains installed at then-U.N. ambassador Haley's residence in New York, a decision the New York Times reported was made during the Obama administration.\n\n\"You got bad information,\" she said as Scott talked over her.\n\n\"Did you send them back?\" he asked her repeatedly.\n\n\"Did you send them back? You're the one that works in Congress,\" an exasperated Haley shot back. \"They were there before I ever showed up at the residence. You are scrapping.\"\n\nHaley was the first to live there, but the Obama administration had decided to purchase the drapes, according to officials who spoke with the New York Times.\n\nWhile the exchange marked a tense point in the relationship between the two Palmetto State natives, 11 years earlier, it was Haley, the first minority female governor of the state -- and one of the first in the country -- who tapped then-Rep. Tim Scott to fill former Sen. Jim DeMint's seat after his retirement.\n\nIn doing so, Scott became the first Black senator from the American South since the end of Reconstruction after the Civil War.\n\nAt the time, Haley acknowledged the gravity of the appointment, calling it \"very important\" to her \"as a minority female, that Congressman Scott earned this seat.\"\n\n\"He earned this seat for the person that he is; he earned this seat for the results he has shown; he earned this seat for what I know he's going to do in making South Carolina and making our country proud,\" Haley said.\n\nBack then, both were rising political stars.\n\nNow, over a decade later and both eyeing the Oval Office, their exchange at the debate brought a quietly brewing cold war to a simmering boil.\n\nThe back-and-forth at the second debate was perhaps Scott's most-discussed moment -- perhaps not attracting the attention his campaign was hoping for going into the evening.\n\nIn the weeks since the debate, his polling has dropped precipitously, hovering just above 2% nationally, according to the most recent 538 modeling . By contrast, Haley has continued to gain ground both with donors and in her overall position among the primary field.\n\nAppearing on \"The Daily Show,\" Haley burst into laughter when host Charlemagne tha God asked why she hadn't told Scott to drop out yet.\n\n\"Yeah, you want to tell him that? I'll leave that to you,\" she said. \"You know, I'm not going to be the one to tell him to get out. I'll leave that up to you.\"\n\nRecently, Haley has downplayed her initial attack against Scott during the debate, calling him \"a good senator\" when asked at her ballot filing ceremony in Columbia, South Carolina, last month whether she regretted her decision to appoint him to the seat.\n\n\"I think he's been a good senator. I think South Carolina should be proud of the work that he's done,\" Haley said.\n\nFor its part, Scott's campaign recently announced that it will be spending the bulk of its resources in Iowa until the caucus in January. Campaign manager Jennifer DeCasper announced that Scott will be going \"all in\" to boost his numbers in the Hawkeye State.\n\nIn the latest Des Moine Register/NBC/Mediacom poll , despite heavy early ad investments, Scott's share in the polling has dropped to 7%, 9 points behind Haley, who has moved ahead of Scott to third behind Donald Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\n\"I don't know why his political people are telling him to attack me. I think that's a mistake,\" Haley told a town hall audience in South Carolina, adding that she's \"not focused on him or any other candidate.\"\n\nScott has repeatedly said that he will not indulge in personal attacks on the campaign trail, but he has deemed Nikki Haley too \"moderate.\" He's evoked the fictional character John Rambo to describe how he plans on handling their differences.\n\n\"The way we respond is not by being petty and being personal, but helping people understand what is already clear: the moderates are rallying behind her,\" he said in a radio interview with hosts Clay Travis and Buck Sexton.\n\nAt the Florida Freedom Summit , Scott told the audience that what America needs is a \"forward-looking optimistic conservative warrior.\"\n\n\"She's leaving conservatism behind on life and social issues and key principles. She is playing in the lane of the Never Trump. It won't unite our party, though. And we can't win with a moderate in 2024,\" Scott said.\n\n\"You think about her initial response to the Palestinian refugees coming to America,\" Scott continued. \"She thought there was a way for us to vet them. You think about where she stands on the issue of abortion and the issue of life not having a 15-week national limit.\"\n\nHaley has not endorsed Scott's national 15-week ban on abortions, saying any national legislation on the issue is unlikely to pass in a closely divided Congress.\n\nAt the third Republican primary debate, Haley dinged Scott on abortion, saying he did not co-sponsor Sen. Lindsey Graham's 2022 legislation attempting to implement a 15-week ban. Scott, who co-sponsored a similar bill introduced by Graham in 2013, defended his record, contending the attack was \"not true.\"\n\nOn the matter of Palestinian civilians, Haley did tell Jake Tapper that \"America has always been sympathetic to the fact that you can separate civilians from terrorists\" in response to a question about Flordia Gov. Ron DeSantis's assertion that all Palestinians were antisemitic.\n\nBut Haley's response has been repeatedly mischaracterized by the DeSantis campaign, and now by Scott, in recent weeks despite the fact that during the same interview, Haley said nothing about resettling Palestinian refugees in the United States. Instead, she called on countries closer to the Gaza Strip to take on the responsibility.\n\nHaley has also continued to gain ground in the pair's shared home state.\n\nIn October, The Post and Courier, South Carolina's largest newspaper, ran an editorial saying she was \"one GOP candidate [who] can defeat Trump\" and giving her its endorsement.\n\n\"We call on all the other Republican candidates for president to drop out and support her in a decidedly uphill battle against Donald Trump,\" Cindy Ross Scoppe, an editorial writer for the publication, wrote in a piece published the same day.\n\nShe continued: \"Although Ms. Haley should never be confused with a moderate, she could easily be next year's choice of independents and traditional Republicans. But that requires the other candidates getting out of the way.\"\n\nAnd just a few weeks prior, George Will, a columnist for The Washington Post, called on Scott and other candidates to drop out of the race and consolidate around Haley.\n\n\"Disclosure,\" Will's column read at the top, \"The columnist's wife, Mari Will, an adviser to Republican presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.), disagrees with this column.\"\n\nHaley is solidly polling in second place in the state, albeit distantly, clocking 22% of the vote as Trump continues to dominate the pack, nabbing 53%, according to the most recent CNN/SSRS poll . She's followed by DeSantis at 11% and Scott at 6%, a three-point drop from a September Washington Post/Monmouth poll .\n\nThe South Carolina Republican Party declined to comment for this story.\n\nUniversity of South Carolina freshman Ella Papazenif, a Haley supporter, told ABC News last month that she thinks the former governor could be a change-maker in American politics.\n\n\"I feel like she'd beat well-known people,\" she said after hearing Haley speak at the ballot-filling ceremony in Columbia. \"So I really liked that she's running for president. I loved her as governor and love that she's running for president. I feel like it's a change in America that we need.\"\n\nSouth Carolina conservative political strategist Dave Wilson told ABC News it is Haley's momentum and experience that is keeping her in the spotlight.\n\n\"Nikki Haley and Tim Scott are taking two very different approaches when it comes to the state. Nikki Haley has consistently been building up an infrastructure of people around her. She says state representatives, she's got us representatives. She's got advocates across the state who are out there, building momentum for her. Nikki Haley has consistently shown that momentum begets momentum when it comes to the way that she campaigns.\" he said.\n\n\"Tim Scott has a strong force. He's a strong conservative voice. But he doesn't have the spread of networks across the state like Nikki Haley does,\" he added.\n\nWilson said that Haley's past experience in her uphill primary battle for the governor's office in 2010 would give her an edge over Scott.\n\n\"Nikki Haley consistently builds momentum behind her. And that has been what you have seen happen with her in this race,\" he said. \"Tim Scott has strong, steady conservatives. And that strong, steady conservative approach, while good for holding an ongoing position, is not giving him the momentum he needs to be able to gain any level of traction with the voter base.\"\n\nScott indicated before he announced that whatever happens on the campaign trail, the two will still remain friends.\n\n\"We were friends before,\" he added. \"We'll be friends after.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Tim Scott is 2024's only Black Republican candidate, and he wants America to focus less on race\n\nA major speech he recently gave at a Black church faced tough questions.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott is the only Black candidate vying for the GOP's presidential nomination and while he has talked openly about race in America -- sometimes seizing the moment to challenge his competitors -- his messaging on the issue hasn't often separated him from the other candidates in the field.\n\nSince he's launched his bid for the White House, Scott, like his Republican rivals, has leaned into his belief that America is \"not a racist country\" and his opposition to so-called \"critical race theory\" and other views that emphasize identity.\n\n\"Joe Biden and the radical left are attacking every rung of the ladder that helped me climb,\" he said in his campaign launch speech , in May.\n\n\"When I cut your taxes, they called me a prop. When I re-funded the police, they called me a token. When I pushed back on President Biden, they even called me the N-word,\" he said. \"I disrupt their narrative. I threaten their control. The truth of my life disrupts their lies!\"\n\nIn October, Scott deviated from usual stops in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to visit a Black church on the South Side of Chicago.\n\n\"There is a radical movement on the far left, and the more progress that America makes on race, the more some leaders want to deny it,\" Scott told the congregants of New Beginnings Church. \"Our country has made, however, tremendous strides since then on the issue of race -- but lawlessness and fatherlessness and joblessness have gotten worse in the last 60 years and not better.\"\n\nHis speech in Chicago was intended, in part, to clarify controversial remarks he made at the second Republican Primary debate in September. Scott drew criticism then after he appeared to suggest that President Lyndon B. Johnson's \"Great Society\" federal welfare program in the '60s had been more difficult for Black Americans than slavery.\n\nFormer Republican National Committee Chair Michael Steele, who is Black, called Scott's debate comments a \"load of crock.\"\n\nHis more than an hourlong speech at New Beginnings Church also called out Democratic leadership in Chicago for, in his view, failing the Black community. Many of those elected officials are Black.\n\n\"If everything can be based and blamed on systemic racism, the problems can't be the liberals' fault,\" Scott told the audience. \"They want us to sit down, shut up and don't forget to vote as long as we're voting blue. Instead of solutions, we are offered distractions and division.\"\n\nAfterward, attendees were eager to pepper Scott, who rarely addresses Black audiences on the campaign trail, with tough questions. Many of the exchanges were tense.\n\nAttorney Rodrick Wimberly said he came to the church with his wife, Evelyn, \"out of respect\" for what Scott has accomplished. When it was his turn to speak with the South Carolina senator, Wimberly challenged Scott.\n\n\"I've seen both in the debate and also in statements you've made where you indicated that you don't feel that there's systematic racism,\" he said. \"There is statistical data to show, or suggest at the very least, that there is some issue where it's systemic.\"\n\nScott told him, \"I'm saying that there is racism, but it's not the system.\"\n\nThe pair went back and forth on education, redlining -- referring to discrimination in financial loans -- and inequities in wealth before Scott was ushered away by his staff.\n\nAfter the conversation, Wimberly told ABC News he came that day open to voting for Scott, but after their interaction he and his wife wouldn't cast a ballot for him \"at this time.\"\n\nThe disconnect illustrates a challenge Scott, and more broadly the Republican Party, has in making significant inroads with Black voters. In the last presidential election, 87% of Black voters backed Democrat Joe Biden, according to ABC News' exit polling.\n\nNadia Brown, a political scientist and professor at Georgetown University argued that Scott's messaging on race is most likely not directed at Black voters at all.\n\nInstead, the senator, who has struggled so far to gain traction in the polls, is pitching himself as a non-white candidate who agrees with the issues that motivates the GOP base, Brown said.\n\nThe vast majority of Republican primary voters (92%) were white in 2020, the last presidential election year, according to a 538 analysis.\n\n\"What Tim Scott and those of his ilk are doing, they're trying to play on these emotional push pins that most African Americans don't see. It's not landing for them,\" Brown said. \"I think that is a call out to other conservatives, particularly white conservatives, who want to say, 'I have a Black senator,' or, 'I feel comfortable voting for a Black candidate.'\"\n\nIn rare moments, Scott has cited his race to break from others in the Republican primary field.\n\nIn July, he criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for supporting a change to the state's standards that directed educators to teach middle school students enslaved people \"developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.\"\n\nScott suggested to reporters that DeSantis should rethink his position. \"What slavery was really about was separating families, about mutilating humans and even raping their wives. It was just devastating,\" he said.\n\n(DeSantis has defended the standards, telling ABC News' Linsey Davis in September: \"It was not saying that slavery benefited. It was saying that these folks were resourceful.\")\n\nThough the audience for his Chicago speech was predominantly Black, the crowds at Scott's typical campaign stops are overwhelmingly white. At those events, Scott often declares that he will \"speak like a pastor,\" in the famous tradition of Black clergy.\n\nLeah Wright Rigueur, a history professor at Johns Hopkins University and author of \"The Loneliness of the Black Republican,\" analyzed how Scott presents himself in the primary field.\n\n\"Because Tim Scott doesn't have certain markers of what the Republican base wants in a candidate, he's not white and he's not married, he plays up on other things: He plays up certain tropes about Black people and he leans into this kind of religious identity that I think really brings out a comfort for white audiences,\" Wright Rigueur said.\n\n\"[Scott] has to talk about race, but he has to do it in a way that doesn't alienate the main players in the party, and that's extremely hard to do given that the standard line on race in the party right now is that 'we don't have a problem and in fact it's other people who are the real racists,'\" Wright Rigueur told ABC News.\n\nIn response to Scott's speech at the Chicago church, Rep. Jonathan Jackson, D-Ill., who is Black and represents part of the city in Congress, told ABC News, \"He's trying to capitulate and kowtow to an extremist right wing group, and he ought to be ashamed of himself.\"\n\nWhen criticized for his stance on race, Scott responds with an oft-repeated refrain placing the blame on the political left for, he argues, trying to silence another view.\n\n\"I've been called a prop, a token, the N-word and more ugly names than I can share,\" Scott said in a recent fundraising appeal.\n\nOther Black conservatives agree with Scott's sentiments.\n\n\"It's quite obvious what America's past has been, but there's nobody alive today that could sit up and say, 'Well, I didn't develop into my full potential because I wasn't given an opportunity,'\" said Raynard Jackson, a Republican political consultant, who is Black. \"I think [Scott] hit all the right notes in the right key.\"\n\nWilliam Oden, chairman of the Sumter, South Carolina, Republican Party, who is also Black, voted for Scott in his Senate bid and loves Scott's \"optimistic message.\"\n\n\"His message dispels the rumor that people talk about our country being racist,\" Oden said.\n\nAlthough Scott had told ABC News that his team discussed giving his Chicago church speech \"for a very long time,\" he delivered it amid signs that his campaign is faltering.\n\nA super PAC supporting Scott announced it would pull fall ads from TV and he's still polling in the single digits nationally as well as in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, according to 538's average . He only just managed to qualify for the third Republican primary debate, set for Wednesday.\n\nBefore Scott's Chicago speech, his team held a call to announce a plan to shift resources from New Hampshire and increase staffing in Iowa so that they were equipped to go \"all in.\" Campaign manager Jennifer DeCasper also joined him in the city, in a rare appearance to signal what the campaign saw as a major moment.\n\nDeCasper is the only Black woman at the helm of a Republican presidential campaign this cycle and some point to the diversity within Scott's staff as an illustration of his commitment to communities of color.\n\n\"Tim doesn't just believe in diversity. He is diverse,\" said Jackson, the consultant. \"If you go to his office, it's nothing but the definition of diversity, and it's not forced or contrived diversity. That's just who he is.\"\n\nWright Riguer, the history professor, said that DeCasper is an important reflection of how Scott is approaching the issue.\n\n\"Given that there was a Black woman who is essentially guiding his larger political future, that is really important for how he is thinking and talking about race right now,\" she said.\n\nScott's campaign declined to comment for this article.\n\nHis recent remarks at the University of Mississippi are perhaps most emblematic of how he will continue to address the topic of race in a party that de-emphasizes identity.\n\n\"I don't want to be the Black conservative. I don't want to be the Black southerner,\" he said in late October. \"I want to be Tim Scott, who happens to be Black.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Tim Scott delivered a blow to Nikki Haley ahead of the New Hampshire primary, appearing on stage with former President Donald Trump and endorsing him at his rally in Concord.\n\n\"IS THIS TRUMP COUNTRY?\" Scott said to the crowd, hyping them up.\n\nScott touted Trump's immigration, social security and his war against crimes before he declared his endorsement.\n\n\"That's why I came to the very warm state of New Hampshire to endorse the next president of the United States, Donald Trump,\" Scott said.\n\n\"We need a president who will unite our country,\" Scott said. \"We need Donald Trump.\"\n\nTrump thanked Scott, praising him as a \"very good man,\" and a \"very respected man\" - at the same time disparaged other Republicans for \"wasting hundreds of millions of dollars\" attacking him.

Scott slammed the rumors, saying he did not run for president to be in second place.\n\nScott, who has pledged not to run for reelection in the Senate, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in December that his endorsement \"certainly won't happen this year, if I do it at all.\" A source confirmed to ABC News that he arrived at this decision only recently.\n\nHaley, who served as South Carolina governor from 2011 to 2017, appointed Scott to the Senate in 2012.\n\nHaley finished in a close second to DeSantis in the Iowa caucuses -- both of whom lost to Donald Trump .

      "text": "Tim Scott's bachelorhood puts spotlight on how few US presidents have been single\n\nExperts say the presidential spouse's role has been key, too -- but is changing.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott is one of the relatively few people who has ever run for president of the United States . If elected, he would join an even more elite club -- as one of only three White House occupants to never be married at the time he took office.\n\nScott's bachelorhood isn't directly on the ballot in the same way his policies on the economy and abortion are.\n\nBut it's become a headline-making topic on the campaign trail and, historians and experts told ABC News, it reflects the political ramifications of having a partner even as society's attitudes around relationships have shifted through the years.\n\nScott, a Republican, has a standard answer for the curious or the chatty, including anonymous sources who claimed to the news website Axios that the matter was affecting potential donors.\n\n\"I'm dating a lovely Christian girl,\" Scott enthusiastically said in Iowa at the Faith & Freedom Coalition's fall banquet earlier this month when state Attorney General Brenna Bird asked him in an interview, \"Other than your mama, is there any special lady in your life?\"\n\nThat echoes what he told Fox News earlier in September -- \"God has blessed me with a smart, Christian woman\" -- and what he told The Washington Post in an interview also this month, when he said a friend at church connected them.\n\nDenise Gitsham, a former administration staffer for President George W. Bush and a \"good friend\" of Scott's, said in a recent podcast appearance that Scott's past girlfriends have included a beauty queen and that his current girlfriend is the screensaver on his phone.\n\nScott said on Fox News that he intends to introduce the woman he is dating \"at some point.\" (His campaign, asked to comment for this story, referred ABC News to his interview with the Post.)\n\n\"I have been very protective of my family and my loved ones,\" he told the paper. \"I signed up for this. If we make it, she will be signing up for it as well, but at least then she'll know what she's getting into.\"\n\nThe country has only elected two single presidents, and neither in modern history: James Buchanan in 1856 and Grover Cleveland in 1884.\n\nCleveland actually got married in the White House -- the only president to do so -- while Buchanan never married and ultimately transferred most of the first lady's duties to his niece, a then 26-year-old named Harriet Lane.\n\nBut their personal lives were likely not seen by the public in the same way as today. For example, for about 40 years before Buchanan's time in office, there had been a string of widowers in the White House.\n\n\"Public perceptions around marriage, and particularly our politicians who were unmarried, have changed,\" Dr. Thomas Balcerski, author of \"Bosom Friends: The Intimate World of James Buchanan and William Rufus King\" and an associate professor at Eastern Connecticut State University, told ABC News.\n\nOne could argue that having a first lady is actually more of a modern concept, Balcerski said.\n\n\"What's occurred is that the presidential couple has emerged as a really important unit for a politician,\" he said. \"And without that presidential spouse, without the modern first lady at his side, a president is weakened.\"\n\nThe role of presidential spouse is entirely ceremonial -- not prescribed by the U.S. Constitution or the country's other founding documents. Still, first ladies have traditionally served as chief hostesses at state functions; as diplomatically important counterparts in forging relationships with other world leader couples; and as informal but influential advisers to their husbands, the president.\n\nSouth Carolina's other Republican senator, Lindsey Graham, ran for president in 2016 and his single status was, as with Scott, a topic that followed his candidacy. He proposed that there would be a \"rotating first lady\" role shared by his sister and some of his friends.\n\nEleanor Roosevelt \"was the eyes and ears of the White House\" while her husband was in office, according to Kate Anderson Brower, author of \"First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies.\"\n\nShe would go out and encourage then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who grew up wealthy, to take up issues that were affecting people who were more disadvantaged, Brower said. Decades later, Nancy Reagan served as something like husband Ronald Reagan's \"human resources department,\" determining who was going to be given access to the president.\n\nMore recently, then-first lady Hillary Clinton used her role to advocate for major domestic policies in husband Bill Clinton's administration, including a failed health care reform proposal.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's wife, Dr. Jill Biden, is the first first lady to also keep her job -- as a college English teacher -- outside the White House.\n\nThere are benefits in having someone share the immense stress and that comes with being in the Oval Office, experts said. Representatives from the historic site that marks Cleveland's birthplace in New Jersey told ABC News that according to Allan Nevins' book of Cleveland's collected letters, \"Cleveland experienced some pangs of loneliness in his first year at the White House.\"\n\nOn Sept. 15, 1885, a few months into his first term, Cleveland wrote to Wilson Bissell, a politician from New York: \"If I did not keep one of the waiters here I should be absolutely alone in the upper part of the house.\"\n\nIn modern times, Brower said, \"Michelle and Barack Obama are a great example of a first lady who really helped the president get to where he was.\" Brower, however, notes that Michelle Obama gave \"not only ... the emotional support, but also raising their children and taking this kind of backseat in her own career for him.\"\n\nBrower believes that a highly visible spouse may not be needed to win a presidential election going forward. She cited the tiny role that Melania Trump has so far played in Donald Trump's 2024 campaign. (He recently said his wife is a \"private person\" but \"she'll be out there.\")\n\nBalcerski, the author and professor, said a president's family around the White House can bring its own complications. He pointed to Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden's younger son, who is facing firearm charges that he denies and has been dogged by controversy over his past business dealings. Other presidents have also had to deal with relatives and children involved in scandal.\n\n\"There's always gonna be the baggage that comes with having a wife and kids and maybe hopefully someday a husband and kids,\" Balcerski told ABC News.\n\nAt the Iowa banquet this month, Scott said his approach to relationships was shaped by his upbringing. \"As a guy who was raised in a single parent household, mired in poverty, I understand the devastation when a family breaks up. I live with the consequences of a father who was not there,\" he said. \"I made a commitment to make sure that never happened in my life.\"\n\nSue Ewalt from Mason City, Iowa, told ABC News of Scott's bachelorhood that she didn't \"really think it's a big issue myself. I heard about it the other day and it just shouldn't be an issue. It's his personal thing.\"\n\nAmerica is increasingly a single country -- about 46% of people are unmarried, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau -- and Balcerski believes voters are \"ready\" to elect another single president.\n\n\"We're ready, again, is how I would say it. We've been ready, we were ready, we will be ready,\" he said. \"We will adapt to the changing family structure, to the changing social world of our times.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "How Tim Scott's run for president is affecting his role as senator\n\nScott is the only member of Congress running for president in the 2024 election.\n\nJust a few hours before the Saturday night deadline , the Senate overwhelmingly voted to keep the government open for 45 more days by a vote of 88-9. Only two senators were not present: Michigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who posted on X that she was sick with COVID, and South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott, who was the keynote speaker at the California GOP Convention Friday.\n\nScott is the only member of Congress running for president in the 2024 election.\n\nWhen asked last month at Faith & Freedom's Fall Banquet in Iowa if he would vote to shut down the government over the budget, Scott responded he would vote against a deal as he did back in June.\n\n\"Unless we have a deal that controls spending, I'm absolutely, positively, undeniably no again -- we have to protect our next generation,\" he told Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird.\n\nThe text of the continuing resolution Congress passed Saturday to avert a government shutdown was published just a few hours earlier, and it's unclear how Scott would have voted on that specific measure.\n\nABC News has reached out to Scott for comment; the campaign has not responded.\n\nIt's not the first time Scott has missed a Senate floor vote.\n\nRecently, he missed the confirmation of Gen. Charles Q. Brown to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- the highest ranking general in the military.\n\nIn June, he was the only senator to miss the confirmation of civil rights lawyer Dale Ho as a federal judge. Since Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., sided with Republicans, Scott's presence could have forced Vice President Kamala Harris to break a 50-50 tie.\n\nAlthough none of the votes he has missed have had an influence on the final result, the public is losing insight on how Scott would approach key issues as president.\n\nThis cycle is unlike others when a handful of senators have run for president.\n\nIn 2015, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., should be \"showing up to work,\" but Rubio wasn't the only candidate that election cycle susceptible to attacks for missing senate votes: Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Rand Paul, R-Ky.; and Ted Cruz, R-Tx., were a part of the same club. This cycle, Scott shoulders the burden alone.\n\nTo sway voters, frequent retail politicking is required in the early-voting states, and day-to-day life on the campaign trail can be brutal for anyone without the added pressures of a day job.\n\nMissing key votes is to be expected while senators are on the trail.\n\nAccording to data from Govtrack.us then-Sen. Barack Obama missed nearly 89.4% of Senate floor votes a year out from the 2008 general election. Former Sens. Hillary Clinton missed 83.5% during her 2008 presidential run, and Rubio missed 90% a year out from the 2016 election in which he ran.\n\nScott, who is planning a stop in Dallas, Texas, Tuesday, just spent the week in California following the second Republican presidential debate raising money in San Francisco at a fundraiser where tickets were up to $8,300 per person. Fundraising could help to bolster his campaign, which has hovered in the single digits since he joined the race back in May, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling average.\n\nThe Oct. 15 deadline for 2024 presidential candidates to file their third-quarter campaign finance reports is swiftly approaching. There is a push to up fundraising ahead of Sept. 30, the same day as the government shutdown deadline, which was the last day to make it into the report.\n\nCongress will again get a chance to vote to pass a budget in 45 days on Nov. 17 -- that's nearly two months out from the Iowa caucuses and an important time to be on the campaign trail.\n\nIf Congress fails to reach a budget agreement by that deadline, the government would shut down. Past shutdowns have lasted as long as 35 days -- that's weeks off the campaign trail during which Scott could see himself stuck in D.C.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Tim Scott has become the longest-serving Black US senator.\n\nScott will also serve as the first Black chairman of a Senate standing committee, leading the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee , where he previously served as the ranking Republican member when Democrats held control of the chamber in the previous session.\n\n\"My goal is simple: make America work for Americans,\" Scott said in a statement to CNN. \"As we get to work cleaning up the mess from the previous administration, I look forward to working with (President-elect Donald) Trump on his priorities, including paving a path for all Americans to have the necessary tools and resources to achieve their version of the American Dream.

      "text": "Sen. Tim Scott endorses Trump in New Hampshire amid full-court press against Haley\n\nFollow:\n\nFormer GOP presidential candidate and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott endorsed Donald Trump on Friday in New Hampshire.\n\nThe endorsement is a blow of sorts to his fellow South Carolinian Nikki Haley, who appointed him to his Senate seat in 2012, and another sign of Trump's commanding presence on top of the party.\n\n\"We need a president who will close our southern border today. We need Donald Trump,\" Scott said while appearing on stage with the former president at a campaign event in Concord, New Hampshire.\n\n\"We need a president who will unite our country. We need Donald Trump,\" he continued. \"We need a president who will protect your Social Security and my mama's Social Security. We need Donald Trump.\"\n\nWhile introducing Scott to the stage, Trump said the senator gave him his endorsement two da﻿ys ago. The decision to wait to publicly roll it out emphasizes how significant the Trump campaign views his support, and its desire to play up his endorsement with as much fanfare as possible in the final days before the New Hampshire primary.\n\nCNN previously reported that Trump had been in talks with Scott behind the scenes about winning his endorsement, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the talks.\n\nTrump's inner circle had originally hoped that Scott would endorse before the South Carolina primary, sources familiar with internal discussion told CNN. The timeline was accelerated, however, as Haley saw a spike in the polls in New Hampshire.\n\nWhen asked about Scott's plans during a visit to a New Hampshire diner on Friday, Haley replied, \"We'll wait and see if it happens.\" She then ignored other questions on her way out.\n\nLater Friday, she said in a statement, \"Interesting that Trump's lining up with all the Washington insiders when he claimed he wanted to drain the swamp. But the fellas are gonna do what the fellas are gonna do.\"\n\nThe former South Carolina governor did not know that Scott was planning to go ahead with the endorsement, a source close to Haley said. Haley had called Scott in recent days to seek his endorsement in the 2024 race, a source familiar with the call confirmed to CNN.\n\nPeople who know them both weren't surprised by Scott's decision to ultimately endorse the former president, but the timing of his endorsement - four days before the New Hampshire primary - was noted in both of their circles, given that Trump has been concerned about Haley's standing in the state.\n\nBy announcing the endorsement ahead of the New Hampshire primary, Trump's team aims to paint Haley as disliked by the people who would theoretically know her best in her home state.\n\nTrump on Friday said Haley would \"probably\" not be his running mate should he win the Republican nomination as he viciously attacked her ahead of the primary in the state.\n\n\"She is not presidential timber. Now when I say that, that probably means that she's not going to be chosen as the vice president,\" Trump said at the campaign event.\n\nSouth Carolina Reps. Russell Fry and William Timmons are also expected to campaign with the former president in New Hampshire this weekend, Fry told CNN, as Trump's team launches a full court press against the former South Carolina governor.\n\nThis includes South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, who will campaign with Trump in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Saturday.\n\nWhile Trump's team has projected confidence that the former president will win the New Hampshire primary Tuesday, his advisers have admitted that they believe the margins are closer in New Hampshire than any other early voting state.\n\nScott launched his presidential campaign in May and made his personal story a central narrative, often speaking about growing up in poverty in South Carolina raised by a single mother.\n\nBut after several months of failing to gain traction, the senator suspended his bid in November. He told Fox News' Trey Gowdy at the time that he would not back another Republican candidate, saying he believed \"the best way for me to be helpful\" was to withhold an endorsement in the primary. Scott also said he had no intention of accepting a vice presidential nomination, reaffirming a position he had repeated frequently on the campaign trail.\n\nThroughout his campaign, Scott's criticism of Trump was relatively tame compared with his attacks on other primary contenders. He often expressed support for policies enacted during the Trump administration, but regularly argued that Trump lacked the support in key swing states needed to carry Republicans to victory in a general election.\n\nPrior to the 2024 campaign, Scott had long been friends and political allies with Haley. In 2012, Haley appointed Scott to the vacant seat left by Sen. Jim DeMint, saying Scott had \"earned the seat\" from his personality and record. Following Scott's departure from the primary, several of Scott's financial backers quickly pivoted to Haley.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN's Kaitlan Collins, Manu Raju and Alayna Treene contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Tim Scott's likability is fueling his rise. But how high can he climb?\n\nAfter two hours at the Iowa State Fair spent posing for photos, glad-handing attendees visiting the livestock barn and indulging in carnival games and the famous pork chop grill, Tim Scott was heading for the exits when he stopped to meet a group of voters.\n\nThe South Carolina senator and Republican presidential candidate had been greeting voters throughout the day, many of whom enthusiastically thanked him for running.\n\nAmong this group, however, were some people who might otherwise cast aside the chance to meet any other Republican candidate. Yet they eagerly approached Scott in the middle of the fair's main thoroughfare.\n\n\"I'm actually a Democrat,\" one voter said as he shook the senator's hand.\n\n\"Well, that's OK, I'll still be your president,\" Scott replied. \"When you need something, call the White House, and I'll be happy to help.\"\n\nMoments later, another man approached Scott, this time a Republican, albeit one who appeared to be leaning toward one of Scott's rivals in the GOP field.\n\n\"I know I got a Trump shirt on, but it doesn't matter,\" the man said. \"I like you, you're a good guy.\"\n\n\"That's OK, we're all Americans,\" Scott replied.\n\nIn the early stages of a primary race that has otherwise been defined by former President Donald Trump's legal drama, bitter attacks between rivals and warnings over the future of the Republican Party, Scott has distinguished himself by projecting a hopeful and rosy vision of America. And as the Republican field turns its attention to the first presidential primary debate in Milwaukee next week, voters appear to be giving Scott consideration. In a New York Times/Siena College poll conducted at the end of July, Scott had the support of 9% of likely Republican voters in Iowa, putting him in third place behind Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, but hovering above a wide field of candidates similarly angling to pitch themselves as alternatives to Trump.\n\nRelated video Hear Trump's response to Sen. Tim Scott's presidential bid\n\nScott, who has made Iowa a priority since launching his campaign in May, feels his message is connecting with voters. He's seen the rise in his poll numbers and an increase in attendance at his events, which he attributes to his bullish outlook on the future.\n\n\"We're going to continue to do what we have been doing, which is focusing on the optimistic, positive message anchored in conservatism with a backbone,\" Scott said Tuesday at the state fair. \"That's one of the reasons why we continue to see more people show up. ... It is refreshing, people tell me, to have an actual conversation about the substance of issues.\"\n\nRival campaigns are sensing Scott's growing popularity. In a memo obtained by CNN in July, the super PAC supporting former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley identified Scott as a rival who could potentially win the nomination, along with Trump and DeSantis. A memo obtained by CNN in July from the super PAC backing DeSantis conceded that Scott had received \"a serious look\" from voters but added that \"we expect Tim Scott to receive appropriate scrutiny in the weeks ahead.\"\n\nAt a town hall in New Hampshire last week, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie paid Scott a backhanded compliment, categorizing himself and the senator as the only candidates who have expressed a desire to unify the country.\n\n\"Tim has, in his heart, the willingness to want to do that. I really do,\" Christie said. \"I don't know if he has the ability to do it, because he's never run anything.\"\n\nScott may find himself a target of attacks on the debate stage given his campaign's relative momentum. His campaign is preparing for the debate with a combination of traditional preparation and reminders for him to maintain the cheerful attitude that's resonated with voters so far.\n\n\"Our strategy is just to get him in front of the podium a lot, throw a lot of tough questions at him. Get a lot of experts out, debate experts, to kind of poke and jab at him, throw him some, you know, crazy-fast pitches and just get him ready,\" Scott campaign manager Jennifer DeCasper told CNN.\n\nRelated video Obama criticizes this 2024 GOP presidential candidate's remarks on race in America\n\n\"I think he just needs to have fun. He's on fire when he has fun, when he views it as just him giving the answers that he always knows how to give,\" she added. \"He's going to be great.\"\n\nFor his part, Scott has no intention of taking big swings at other candidates, content with reiterating the message he feels is working with voters rather than using the missteps of his opponents to score political points.\n\nHe said he feels his campaign's current message is working and is focused on growing his support over time.\n\nScott's rise in the polls comes as Trump, the field's front-runner, faces four criminal cases against him. The latest came this week, when an Atlanta-based grand jury indicted him and 18 others on state charges related to their efforts to overturn Trump's 2020 defeat in Georgia.\n\nRather than attack Trump, Scott continues to characterize each indictment as politically motivated.\n\n\"We see the legal system being weaponized against political opponents,\" he said Tuesday.\n\nRecent polling signals there may be some Trump fatigue settling in among voters. In that same New York Times/Siena College poll, Trump's support among likely Republican voters in Iowa was 10 points lower than his nationwide support among likely GOP voters, a possible indication that voters in Iowa could be pleased with their candidate options ahead of the state caucuses in January.\n\nScott's position in the race is bolstered by a significant fundraising advantage over other candidates, allowing the senator to make his face and his philosophy familiar to voters in early-voting Iowa and New Hampshire. His most recent fundraising report showed Scott had $21.1 million in his campaign account at June 30, more than any other candidate, except for Trump, and boosted by a $21 million transfer from his Senate campaign account.\n\nRelated gallery In pictures: Presidential candidate Tim Scott\n\nThe Scott campaign has used that cash advantage early in the race, frequently rolling out TV and radio spots in Iowa and New Hampshire as part of a $5.5 million media reservation made in the days following the campaign's launch. The ads serve to crystallize for voters Scott's background and policy positions on a broad range of issues, including immigration, agriculture and foreign policy.\n\nIn the latest example of the campaign flexing its financial strength, Scott's campaign is placing a new $8 million ad buy, including $6.6 million in TV reservations, in its second major ad buy since the campaign launched in May, a senior Scott campaign official tells CNN.\n\nAt an event Tuesday evening in Cambridge, Iowa, 30 minutes outside Des Moines, Scott saw firsthand the lasting effect his campaign advertising is having on voters in the state. During his remarks, he referenced a television commercial rolled out in May, which features clips of him speaking at events and outlining a series of beliefs around economic policy and violent crime.\n\nScott repeated one of his lines from the commercial - \"If you take out a loan, you pay it back\" - and was surprised to hear the audience finish the line in unison with him.\n\n\"Hallelujah, y'all, this is great. Y'all are starting to see the commercials, this is good news. I was wondering if they were buying anything with all that money I'm spending here,\" Scott joked.\n\nThe feedback loop apparent in that moment speaks to the consistency of the Scott campaign's messaging, something he feels is an important element in his appeal. Later Tuesday evening, Scott spoke about how he tries to be a role model in response to a question from an audience member.\n\n\"I consistently try to make sure that I practice what I preach. And whether it's here in front of you all, we were talking about this earlier, there's not a single ad on TV, that every single word I say, I endorsed it,\"  Scott said. \"I wrote them, rewrote them and got them exactly as I would say it, no matter where I am, whether I'm talking to a ruby-red audience or a big-blue audience.\"\n\n\"I think you have to be consistently the same if you want to have impact,\" he added.\n\nScott's hope is that his policy views and his overall outlook will earn the trust of voters heading into the first GOP debate.\n\n\"Our strategy is to be who we've always been. Bottom line is to remain an optimistic, positive guy anchored in conservatism, talking about the issues that the American people care about,\" Scott told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nRelated video GOP presidential candidate won't criticize Trump on this issue\n\nScott has made taking on \"the radical left\" a cornerstone of his campaign. He's emphasized bringing his evangelical faith and conservative, business-friendly policies to the White House. He also has spent recent weeks talking about confronting China and the need for tighter border security with a visit to the southern border earlier this month.\n\n\"Victory or victimhood\" is a rallying cry Scott often invokes at campaign events as he argues that Democrats emphasize the country's racial strife too deeply. Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate, is steadfast in his assertion that America is a on a path to redemption when it comes to race relations, a message he typically delivers before largely White audiences.\n\nScott has long been well-liked by his fellow Republicans in Congress, as evidenced by a pair of uncharacteristically early endorsements from two GOP senators, South Dakota's Mike Rounds and John Thune, the latter being the No. 2 Republican in the Senate. But the question remains whether Scott can go from being a likable candidate to a viable one.\n\nPatrick Anderson, a Republican from Ames, Iowa, has already decided that Scott's campaign has the potential for longevity. Anderson voted for Trump twice and would vote for him again if Trump won the nomination. But right now, he's pulling for Scott.\n\n\"I like what he's doing in the Senate. He's got a good solid moral message. He stands up for traditional values, American values,\" Anderson said. \"I like that.\"\n\nHe said he doesn't regret voting for Trump but does wish the former president would alter his conduct so that \"just because somebody throws a rock at you doesn't mean you need to throw it back, especially when you're president.\" Scott, he said, serves as a model for how other candidates should campaign.\n\n\"I like Tim's message,\" Anderson said. \"He's got the same message that I'd like to see in all of our candidates, and I think it's a great time to support him now.\"\n\nGinger Nearmyer also voted twice for Trump, but after seeing Scott speak Tuesday at the state fair, she said she's leaning toward voting for him.\n\n\"I like what he stands for,\" Nearmyer said. \"He's a good man, a decent man.\"\n\n\"I like his background, I like where he's from, I like how he's pulled himself up. He comes off as a really good, good man, too,\" she added. \"I'm impressed by him.\"\n\nBut even some who described Scott as a \"solid conservative\" whom they loved - as Cheryl Soden of Ames did - have indicated they see him more as a potential running mate for Trump.\n\n\"I think he would make a great VP,\" Soden said. \"I think him and Trump would be a really good fit.\" This story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN's Steve Contorno, Kate Sullivan and Ali Main contributed to this story.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Tim Scott launches multimillion dollar outreach effort to get Black and Latino voters to support the GOP\n\nFollow:\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott , a contender to be former President Donald Trump's running mate , is launching a multimillion dollar effort to recruit Black voters to support Republicans in 2024.\n\nThe effort will target swing and low propensity Black and Latino voters. Scott will tour battleground states and host smaller events in the coming weeks as he makes direct appeals to voters of color, with the hope that they will shift their support to the GOP.\n\nThe plan, which is being backed by Scott's Great Opportunity PAC, is to spend more than $14 million, including $5 million on earned and paid media. It will focus primarily on Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania, where thin margins may determine the outcome of the presidential election.\n\nA source familiar with the plans said that the goal is to get started as soon as possible. The Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign are aware of the initiative, and the source said that they plan to be a resource where needed and vice versa. But, the source said, this wasn't a directive from the Trump campaign.\n\nScott, the only Black Republican in the Senate, argued Black voters and other minorities are turning to the GOP because of the contrast between the Trump years and the Biden administration, which he deems a failure on the economy, the border and crime.\n\n\"A lot of reasons why the shift is becoming just so blatantly obvious that it's now undeniable that there is something amiss,\" Scott said at a briefing this week with reporters in Washington, DC. \"It's not just racial, but it's going to manifest itself in a racial shift that we haven't seen in probably three decades of politics.\"\n\n\"What we haven't had before was a recent president on the right vs. the current president on the left. And that translates into a lot of ticked off people who are looking at the Republican Party,\" he said.\n\nScott says working class Americans and African American men in particular are wide open for a political shift. He'll tout what he characterizes as wins under the Trump administration, like forgiving debt for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and the signing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nCentral to his argument is that many Black voters are faith oriented and culturally conservative and they are not voting in alignment with their social values by continuing to support Democrats.\n\nScott believes this message will resonate in places like Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Detroit - all major cities in key battleground states.\n\nThe senator also stressed the importance of showing up in places where Republicans aren't typically welcome. Trump recently had a campaign event in the Bronx, a county that voted overwhelmingly for Biden over Trump in 2020, according to CNN's election results .\n\n\"I've been talking about this for years that we have to go where we're not invited,\" Scott said. \"We have just not had enough candidates doing that from the party, and now we do, and we're gonna see the results that are consistent with that.\"\n\nThis effort from Scott comes at a time when the Biden campaign sees cracks in their support from Black voters.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College survey of battleground states released in May found Trump winning more than 20% of Black voters in a two-way matchup with Biden. Trump won roughly 1 in 10 Black voters nationally in 2020, according to multiple estimates, including 12% in CNN's exit poll .\n\nIn the same survey, 14% of Black voters said that if the election were held today, they would vote for Trump vs. 49% for Biden. Hispanic voters were 31% for Biden and 31% for Trump. When it comes to non-White voters without a college degree, 32% said they would vote for Biden if the election were held today while 27% said they would back Trump.\n\nWhile 69% said there is \"not really any chance\" they would vote for Trump, 24% of Black voters in the poll said there is \"not really any chance\" they would cast their vote for Biden.\n\nBiden campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika cast Scott's outreach as a \"last-ditch effort\" to defend Trump's \"racist agenda.\"\n\n\"President Biden is on the campaign trail showing up - himself - to earn, and not ask for, Black Americans' support. That is what leadership looks like,\" Chitika said in a statement.\n\nJust last week, the Biden campaign went to Philadelphia launching a nationwide effort to mobilize Black voters, characterizing the Trump campaign as one with a \"racist and toxic agenda.\"\n\nAn April New York Times/Siena poll suggested that Biden's support continues to lag behind typical Democratic performance among several key subgroups within the party's usual coalition, with Black voters breaking 69% for Biden to 16% for Trump and Hispanic voters dividing 50% for Biden to 41% for Trump. Younger voters were split about evenly, 46% for Biden to 45% for Trump.\n\nScott is making the case that there are voters up for grabs, and in a tight election, it could make the difference if they turn out for Trump, rather than coming home to Biden or not voting at all.\n\nScott also said that he thinks that Trump's conviction on 34 felony charges is helping drive \"more folks to the Republican Party period.\"\n\nHe suggested that the conviction, which he told Fox News is unifying the Republican Party, has the potential to pull more Black men into the fold.\n\n\"I think African American men, specifically, have experienced a lot with the justice system, not all of the good, and therefore, watching an injustice play out that is just so blatant, a lot of African American men have said, 'You know what, I'm gonna take a closer look at the Republican Party,'\" Scott said.\n\nTrump recently suggested something similar in February at a gathering of Black conservatives in South Carolina ahead of the state's Republican primary.\n\n\"A lot of people said that that's why the Black people like me because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against, and they actually viewed me as I'm being discriminated against,\" Trump said.\n\nSeparate from Trump, the Great Opportunity PAC sees this opportunity to close the gap with voters who feel like Democrats let them down.\n\nAs CNN's Kevin Liptak reported last week , Biden's aides say they aren't taking Black voters for granted as surveys suggest an erosion of support, particularly among Black men.\n\n\"They feel like their vote has been taken for granted,\" Jennifer DeCasper, executive director of the Great Opportunity PAC said, referring to Black and brown Democrats. \"That doesn't mean they're going to jump on the Republican bandwagon anytime soon. But I do feel like now we are on a level playing field where we can also compete for their votes and compete for their ears, and I don't think that that's happened in a really long time.\"\n\n\"We are in a position where we want to step into that space, step in pretty heavy handed and show that we have not only the right policy, but we actually care about winning their vote and keeping their vote,\" DeCasper said.\n\nCNN's Jennifer Agiesta contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate, enters the 2024 GOP primary\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott on Monday formally entered the Republican presidential primary , promising to take on \"the radical left\" and bring faith and conservative, business-friendly policies to the White House, as he seeks to upend a contest that has so far been dominated by coverage of former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is expected to enter the fray in the coming days.\n\nThe most prominent Black figure in the Republican Party, Scott addressed supporters at his alma mater, Charleston Southern University, in his hometown of North Charleston.\n\n\"I'm the candidate the far-left fears the most. You see, when I cut your taxes, they called me a prop. When I refunded the police, they called me a token. When I pushed back on President Biden, they even called me the 'n-word,'\" Scott said. \"I disrupt their narrative. I threaten their control. The truth of my life disrupts their lies.\"\n\nFollowing the announcement , Scott heads to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina - states he frequented on his \"Faith in America\" tour in the run-up to his announcement - before returning to the Hawkeye State next week for GOP Sen. Joni Ernst's annual \"Roast and Ride\" gathering.\n\nScott, 57, is no stranger to pathbreaking campaigns. In 2010, he became the first Black Republican elected to the US House of Representatives from South Carolina in more than a century. Years later, after being appointed to his Senate seat (he won a special election to retain the seat), Scott made history as the first Black US Senator from his native South Carolina.\n\nAhead of his entry into the presidential race , senior campaign officials briefed reporters on their view of the path forward, acknowledging he will need to win over support from Trump and DeSantis , but vowing - in a veiled dig at both - that his candidacy will strike a more optimistic tone and condemn the culture of victimhood and grievance that, as his aides described it, has taken over both parties.\n\n\"Our party and our nation are standing at a time for choosing,\" Scott said. \"Victimhood or victory? Grievance or greatness? I choose freedom and hope and opportunity.\"\n\nTrump and his team will avoid going after Tim Scott for now, two sources close to the former president told CNN. The directive from Trump has been to stay away from attacks on the South Carolina senator at the moment.\n\nLast week, the Trump-aligned super PAC, MAGA, Inc., weighed in on Scott's looming announcement, but used it to level an attack on DeSantis, not Scott.\n\nThe former president used that approach on Monday as he wished Scott \"good luck\" while taking a shot at DeSantis.\n\n\"Good luck to Senator Tim Scott in entering the Republican Presidential Primary Race. It is rapidly loading up with lots of people, and Tim is a big step up from Ron DeSanctimonious, who is totally unelectable. I got Opportunity Zones done with Tim, a big deal that has been highly successful. Good luck Tim!,\" Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\nThe South Carolina senator received a boost on Sunday, less than 24 hours before his kick-off event, when news broke that his colleague Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, planned to endorse him .\n\n\"I think he'd be a great candidate. I'm excited about it. I've been encouraging him,\" Thune previously told CNN. \"I think he's getting a lot of encouragement from his colleagues. He's really well thought of and respected.\"\n\nCory Gardner, the former Republican senator from Colorado and leader of Scott's aligned super PAC, also argued that his old colleague posed a unique threat to liberal Democrats.\n\n\"I think they're terrified of him, and he's right to say that, because he defies every narrative they have,\" Gardner said. \"And this is exciting for conservatives who believe that they have a candidate who carries their values, can implement their values and do so in a way that will make all Americans proud.\"\n\nA senior campaign official said Scott will continue to invest resources and time in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, as the campaign ramps up.\n\nThough Scott hails from South Carolina, they won't count on it as a firewall, according to one senior campaign official, who emphasized Scott will have to compete as a top-tier candidate in other early primary and caucus states like New Hampshire and Iowa.\n\nEven before the official launch, Scott revealed plans to pluck from his deep campaign coffers - with millions now transferred over from his Senate account - through a series of big-dollar ad buys in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nThe initial $5.5 million TV ad buy - including broadcast, cable satellite and radio - will air statewide starting Wednesday and run through the first GOP debate in August.\n\nDuring the same period, Scott will also launch a seven-figure digital ad campaign.\n\n\"The biggest thing going for Tim Scott right now is $22 million in the bank. He is getting ready to spend $6 million in Iowa and New Hampshire that will garner tremendous name ID, and it's gonna be a key factor that many of the other candidates are not doing right now,\" said Dave Wilson, a South Carolina conservative strategist and former president of the Palmetto Family Council.\n\nThough he is only officially entering the race now, Scott has already gotten caught in the churn of the campaign season. Shortly after announcing an exploratory committee last month, he was tripped up by questions over his position on a potential national abortion ban.\n\nAfter initially sidestepping the matter and refusing to say whether he would back a 15-week ban, Scott told WMUR he would support restrictions beginning at 20 weeks. Days later, though, Scott said in an interview with NBC News that he \"would literally sign the most conservative pro-life legislation that they can get through Congress.\"\n\nPressed on what precisely that meant, given he had applauded DeSantis for signing a six-week ban in Florida, Scott demurred - saying it was a decision for the states to make.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about six (weeks) or five or seven or 10,\" Scott said.\n\nBack at the senator's home church near Charleston, there are hundreds of worshipers that see him most weekends.\n\n\"I've heard him talk about hope and opportunity for 25 years. It's who he is. It's a part of his story. And so I don't think he's going to change,\" said Greg Suratt, founding pastor of Seacoast Church.\n\n\"I think a misconception that people might have about him is that his niceness, his humility, translates as weakness. And they don't know the Tim Scott I know, I would like to kind of see it as an iron fist in a velvet glove,\" Suratt added, noting that even people who disagree with his politics tend to like him as an individual.\n\nScott's faith and his humble beginnings will be a central theme in his campaign, an aide said. Scott grew up in a single parent household in North Charleston, where his mother worked long hours to keep their family afloat.\n\n\"Think about the kid whose grandmother has to open the stove to heat the home in the middle of the winter. I think to myself, it kind of feels like that now,\" Scott said at a town hall in New Hampshire this month. \"So many people with our energy prices doubling in just the last couple years, are experiencing a crisis similar to the one that I had when I was just a kid.\"\n\nOn his listening tour, Scott said that between the ages of 7 and 14, he \"kind of drifted,\" failing world geography, civics, English and Spanish in his freshman year of high school. But through the \"tireless\" encouragement of his mother and mentor, the late John Moniz, a Chick-fil-A manager, Scott says he was able to graduate from Charleston Southern University. He would eventually open his own insurance agency affiliated with Allstate.\n\nScott credits Moniz with teaching him that anyone can \"succeed beyond their circumstances\" if they take responsibility for themselves - a message he repeated in North Charleston.\n\n\"John taught me that anyone, from anywhere, at any time, can rise above their wildest expectations and imagination,\" Scott said after giving roses to Moniz's widow and his own mother at the beginning of his speech. \"But first, I had to take responsibility for myself. He told me in the most loving way possible to look in the mirror and to blame myself.\"\n\nScott's political career began in 1995, when he ran in a special election to the Charleston County Council, winning a seat he would keep for nearly 15 years. After one term as a state lawmaker, Scott won a US House seat representing South Carolina's 1st District.\n\nFellow presidential candidate and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley then appointed Scott to the US Senate in 2012 to fill a vacancy left by Sen. Jim DeMint's retirement. He retained the seat in a 2014 special election, was reelected to a full term in 2016 and later won for a third time last year.\n\n\"To every single mom who struggles to make ends meet, who wonders if her efforts are in vain, they are not,\" Scott said after being appointed by Haley.\n\nDuring his time in the Senate, Scott has amassed a strictly conservative voting record, but has also led bipartisan police reform talks alongside New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat.\n\nThose talks have gone on for years now, beginning in the summer of 2020 with then-California Sen. Kamala Harris also involved, but hopes for a comprehensive deal were effectively abandoned in 2021. (The conversations reportedly continue, but there is no legislation currently in the offing.)\n\nIn 2017, his \"Investing in Opportunity Act,\" which had some Democratic support, was included in the controversial Republican tax cut bill. The provision called for the establishment of \"Opportunity Zones,\" which would create tax incentives for businesses that invested in parts of the country struggling with poverty and stalled economies.\n\n\"I was one of the lead authors of the Republican tax reform bill that slashed taxes for families, brought jobs and investment back from overseas, and created my signature legislation, the 'Opportunity Zones,' that's brought billions of dollars into the poorest communities that have been left behind,\" Scott said in his speech. \"That was just one bill. Imagine what we could do with an entire agenda.\"\n\nStill, Democrats in South Carolina welcomed Scott to the race with harsh words about his political record - and an attempt to tie him to the GOP's far right.\n\n\"We know how dangerous Tea Party extremist Tim Scott is,\" South Carolina Democratic Party chair Christale Spain said in a statement. \"From promising to sign the most conservative abortion ban possible as president, to doubling down on his role as 'architect' of the 2017 GOP tax scam that pushed tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy at the expense of working families, Scott has proven himself to be just as MAGA as the rest of the 2024 field.\"\n\nThough Scott has expressed more openness to working with Democrats than most Republicans in Washington, he also owns one of the most conservative voting records in Congress. He rarely broke with Trump during the latter's presidency, though he did criticize Trump's response to White supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.\n\n\"What we want to see from our president is clarity and moral authority,\" Scott told Vice News at the time. \"And that moral authority is compromised.\"\n\nScott largely backed off that line, though, after a meeting with Trump in the White House.\n\n\"(Trump) was certainly very clear that the perception that he received on his comments was not exactly what he intended with those comments,\" Scott told CBS News.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting and reaction.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect the elected office Sen. Tim Scott first won in 1995.\n\nCNN's Alayna Treene and Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Republican Sen. Tim Scott suspends presidential campaign\n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina is suspending his presidential campaign, he announced in an interview with Fox News on Sunday.\n\n\"I love America more today than I did on May 22. But when I go back to Iowa, it will not be as a presidential candidate. I am suspending my campaign,\" he said.\n\nThe announcement Sunday night took many of Scott's aides and donors by surprise. Two people close to his campaign said they were not given advance notice, even though it was becoming increasingly clear Scott was facing an uphill struggle to break through in the GOP primary.\n\nThe super PAC supporting Scott pulled its slate of television ads in October, and, following last week's third GOP presidential debate , decided not to make a new investment.\n\nScott's presidential prospects dimmed over the last several weeks, beginning with the super PAC's decision to pull its ads. Last month, the Scott campaign said it was going \"all in\" on Iowa in an effort to gain on his primary rivals by targeting the first nominating contest on the GOP calendar.\n\nScott kept the decision to exit the race close to his vest, people linked to his campaign said, but the timing was more surprising than the announcement itself. His team had been worried about qualifying for the fourth Republican debate next month, after being the last candidate to meet the donor and polling thresholds to make last week's debate. He had been hoping a strong debate performance would jumpstart his candidacy, but even he conceded to advisers and allies that hadn't happened.\n\nBy leaving the race now, people close to his campaign said, he can return to the Senate without an embarrassing finish in Iowa. He preserves the possibility of a future political run - and leaves without getting in the crosshairs of Donald Trump, should the former president become the nominee.\n\n\"Tim ran an optimistic, hopeful message - but that's not where the Republican base is right now,\" a GOP official who supported Scott told CNN.\n\nScott told Fox News' Trey Gowdy that he will not back another Republican candidate, saying he believes \"the best way for me to be helpful\" is to withhold an endorsement in the primary.\n\nScott said he has no intention of accepting a vice presidential nomination, reaffirming a position he repeated frequently on the campaign trail.\n\n\"I ran for president to be president,\" he said. \"I think I was called to run. I was not called to win, but I certainly was called to run. ... Being vice president has never been on my to-do list for this campaign, and it's certainly not there now.\"\n\nProminent Scott donor and metal mogul Andy Sabin told CNN he's \"disappointed but not surprised\" that the senator decided to step aside and said he now plans to back former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the GOP primary.\n\nScott launched his campaign in May, hoping to bring an optimistic message to a Republican field dominated by figures such as Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who portrayed America as a nation in decline. He made his personal story a central narrative of his campaign, often speaking about growing up in poverty in South Carolina raised by a single mother and using those experiences to counter Democratic arguments on a wide range of issues, from criminal justice to education to economic policy.\n\n\"The truth of my life disrupts their lies,\" he said often at campaign events.\n\nThe South Carolina senator entered the race with a major cash advantage after he converted his Senate campaign account into a presidential fund. This gave him a $21 million head start on fundraising and allowed him to flood the airwaves with early advertising in Iowa and New Hampshire. Scott's TV spots became so ubiquitous in early states that by the summer, audience members at campaign events were able to quote lines from his ads back to him.\n\nScott campaign officials often touted his war chest to explain his path to the nomination, arguing they'd have the resources to stay in the race through the South Carolina primary while other candidates would face pressure to drop out.\n\nYet it was the Scott campaign that began to feel pressure in the fall after Trust in the Mission PAC, the super PAC supporting the senator's White House bid, cut the remainder of its $40 million TV ad reservation, citing difficulties with \"breaking through\" to Republican voters. The announcement came shortly after the release of fundraising reports showing the campaign burning through its cash reserves at a high rate.\n\nIn response, the Scott campaign pivoted its strategy to a single-minded focus on Iowa, shifting staff and TV ad reservations into the state and significantly increasing his visits. The focus on Iowa was accompanied by a more aggressive rhetorical approach, with Scott increasingly leveling sharp criticisms at President Joe Biden and Republican rivals such as DeSantis, Haley and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, a notable departure from an earlier more affable approach to campaigning.\n\nAs perhaps the most prominent Black Republican politician in the country, Scott frequently leaned into conversations about race as a means to boost his fundraising and court voters. He cited his own experiences to suggest that America's struggles with racism were largely in the past. At the second Republican primary debate in California, Scott grabbed headlines when he outlined in stark terms his belief that the country has transcended the history of slavery and Jim Crow-era segregation, while also excoriating anti-poverty programs created in the 1960s.\n\n\"Black families survived slavery. We survived poll taxes and literacy tests. We survived discrimination being woven into the laws of our country. What was hard to survive was [President Lyndon] Johnson's Great Society, where they decided to ... take the Black father out of the household to get a check in the mail, and you can now measure that in unemployment, in crime, in devastation,\" Scott said during the debate.\n\nA devout Christian, Scott also made his faith a recurring theme, often quoting Bible verses at campaign events. His campaign prioritized outreach to Iowa evangelical voters and community leaders, who make up a significant coalition of Republican caucusgoers. Scott quickly came out in support of a 15-week federal ban on abortion and pushed his rivals to do the same, drawing praise from anti-abortion groups and leading evangelical political figures.\n\nScott's exit from the presidential race marks the latest chapter in a political career that began in 1995, when he won a special election for the Charleston County Council. He held the seat for more than a decade before his election to the South Carolina House in 2008. After one term as a state lawmaker, Scott won a US House seat representing South Carolina's 1st Congressional District.\n\nScott joined the US Senate in 2013 after Haley, who was serving as governor, appointed him to fill a vacancy left by GOP Sen. Jim DeMint's retirement. Scott retained the seat in a 2014 special election, was reelected to a full term in 2016 and won a second full term last year.\n\nScott has expressed more openness than most Republicans to working with Democrats in Washington - he has led bipartisan policing overhaul talks alongside Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, which ultimately broke down. But he also owns one of the most conservative voting records in Congress. He rarely broke with Trump during the latter's presidency, and, on the campaign trail, he frequently touted his conservative stances on taxes, criminal justice and education.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Scott's criticism of Trump - the front-runner for the GOP nomination - was relatively tame compared with his attacks on other primary contenders. He often expressed support for policies enacted during the Trump administration, most notably the 2017 tax cuts he helped draft in Congress, but regularly argued that Trump lacked the support in key swing states needed to carry Republicans to victory in a general election.\n\n\"I think if you look at the results in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada ... one of the things that you want to know is: 'What's the difference between Tim Scott and other candidates, Donald Trump specifically?'\" Scott said to reporters at an Iowa campaign event in October. \"The difference is I believe that I am the most electable candidate we have in the field.\"\n\nScott suggested on Sunday that he's going to keep looking for \"another opportunity\" to launch a White House bid.\n\n\"I think the voters, who are the most remarkable people on the planet, have been really clear that they're telling me, 'Not now, Tim.' I don't think they're saying, Trey, 'No,' but I do think they're saying, 'Not now,'\" Scott said. \"And so I'm going to respect the voters ... and keep working really hard and look forward to another opportunity.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

Tim Scott on Sunday refused to say whether he would have certified the 2020 election results if he were vice president at the time, breaking with other high-profile Trump allies whose names have been floated as potential 2024 vice president picks.\n\n\"I'm not going to answer hypothetical questions, No. 1, and I didn't know that I was a vice president hopeful. Thank you very much, Jake, for letting me know where I am on the scale,\" Scott told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\"\n\n\"What I'm actually more interested in is not my future, the future of America,\" said Scott, who Trump has signaled is under consideration for his pick as vice president. \"I want poor kids today, growing up like I did in impoverished neighborhoods and single-parent households to look to America's future and say, 'There's a place for me at the top.'\"\n\nScott's refusal to answer the question comes as other potential Trump running mates, including Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York and Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, have said they would not have certified the 2020 election results had they been Trump's vice president, despite no evidence of fraud.\n\nWith Trump still considering his potential GOP vice president pick, Republican lawmakers are looking to place themselves in the former president's good graces by reviving false claims about the 2020 election.\n\nScott voted to certify the 2020 election in the Senate and said in August, as a presidential candidate, that former Vice President Mike Pence \"absolutely\" did the right thing in certifying the results. Scott said Sunday that his position has not changed.\n\n\"I have not changed my view,\" Scott said. \"You're asking a hypothetical question that you know can never happen again.\"\n\nScott did part with Trump in his response to the death of jailed Russian opposition figure and outspoken Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny , calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a \"murderous dictator\" who \"always looks for ways to take out the competition and send a clear message just a few days or a few weeks before the Russian election.\"\n\nWhile Trump said nothing directly about Navalny in a post that his campaign said was his official response to the opposition leader's death, Scott looked to cast the former president as a stronger candidate against Putin than President Joe Biden.\n\n\"We need strong leadership coming from America that actually pushes back against Russia and other dictators. Unfortunately, Joe Biden is not up for that charge, and Donald Trump is,\" he told Tapper.\n\nCNN's Jack Forrest, Melanie Zanona and Annie Grayer contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

Tim Scott of South Carolina on Sunday did not directly answer multiple questions about whether he'd accept the results of the 2024 presidential election, regardless of who wins.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the 47th president of the United States will be President Donald Trump,\" Scott, a Republican, said the first time he was directly asked whether he would commit to accepting the election results on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nAsked again by moderator Kristen Welker to answer \"yes or no?\" to the original question, Scott simply said, \"That is my statement.\"\n\nPressed a third time to answer the question, Scott said, \"I look forward to President Trump being the 47th president - the American people will make the decision.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Trump himself told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he would accept the results of the presidential election in Wisconsin only \"if everything's honest.\"\n\n\"If everything's honest, I'd gladly accept the results,\" he said, adding, \"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\"\n\nScott ran for president last year, challenging Trump for the Republican nomination.

Some of these lawsuits have even been presided over and adjudicated by conservative judges nominated by President Trump. Thus far, no justice, judge or fact finder has found evidence indicating the election results in those states should be overturned.\"\n\nHe added that \"as I read the Constitution, there is no constitutionally viable means for the Congress to overturn an election wherein the states have certified and sent their Electors\" and later voted to certify the results of the presidential election.\n\nEven later on the campaign trail, Scott disagreed with voters who claimed the 2020 election was stolen.\n\n\"I do not believe the election was stolen. I do believe that states created a new system, mail-in ballots, that did not have signature verification,\" Scott said during a campaign event in June in Davenport, Iowa.\n\nAfter an audience member asked questions about \"cheating\" in the election, Scott added, \"There was cheating, but was the election stolen?

      "text": "Tim Scott tests his campaign on a mostly Black audience - to mixed reviews\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nCHICAGO - Tim Scott's staunch focus on winning over Republicans in early-voting states means he has spoken to predominantly white audiences at nearly all of his presidential campaign events.\n\nThat changed this week in Chicago, where Scott, a senator from South Carolina, delivered a campaign speech before a mostly Black group of prospective voters, testing his messaging on a group that's typically skeptical of the Republican Party - and remained skeptical after it heard what Scott had to say, attendees said in interviews.\n\nScott has largely been hesitant to make his race a focus of his candidacy, though his career has been defined by historic feats like becoming the first Black senator from the South since Reconstruction. Despite that, Scott has fielded repeated questions on the trail from white Republican voters eager to hear about how he could win over more voters of color.\n\nAt a different campaign event Tuesday after the Chicago stop, Scott said he was optimistic that his race could give him better luck in recruiting Black voters to the party, possibly capitalizing on a trend that has been growing since 2020.\n\n\"One of the reasons why we went to South Side is because I have lived a similar experience to people who find themselves trapped in poverty, who are today growing up in single-parent households who are wondering whether the American dream can work for them,\" he said. \"If I can use my personal pain and misery to share the truth - that conservative principles are worth [it] long-term - I think the better off our country will be.\"\n\nCorey Brooks, the lead pastor of New Beginnings Church, invited Scott to the South Side of Chicago to speak before church members and tour a community center under construction. Brooks extended invitations to all 2024 presidential candidates and welcomed Scott as the first to accept the offer.\n\n\"The very fact that we would have a presidential candidate come to the South Side of Chicago and not just grace the South Side of Chicago with his presence, but right here on 'Opportunity Block,' is a major, major thing,\" Brooks said, referencing his name for the neighborhood.\n\nOver the course of an hour, Scott spoke to an audience of roughly 50 people, giving his signature scripture-laced speech that leaned heavily into his upbringing.\n\n\"I grew up with kids who ended up in the graveyard or in jail,\" he said. \"That's why I think this message is absolutely essential for me to preach and for me to share it, because I've lived it. I know the consequences of decisions. I've seen it with my own eyes. I've experienced the pain myself.\"\n\nHe then shifted into a posture more typical of his campaign, preaching about the social ills he says have been propagated by the \"left\" at the expense of cities like Chicago.\n\n\"The far left has spent decades getting soft on crime, defending failing schools, undermining traditional values and weakening capitalism,\" he said. \"If this movement actually cared about Americans of any color, any color, they would admit their failures and change direction. But it's not about inspiration. It's about manipulation, because it's about power.\"\n\nScott reiterated controversial comments he made at the second Republican primary debate, asserting that Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society social programs caused sustained damage to Black and brown communities. He called for more personal accountability and criticized Democrats for feeding communities of color \"this drug of victimhood and the narcotic of despair.\"\n\n\"The government cannot and should not raise our kids. Social programs can never be the breadwinner who gives our family a better life,\" he said. \"You can't have freedom without personal responsibility.\"\n\nFor Scott, the Chicago event was a resounding success. He touted his performance there at a meet-and-greet event Monday evening with an all-white crowd of predominantly older voters in Marshalltown, Iowa.\n\n\"When I finished talking about how the GOP, the great opportunity party, can bring resources, better education, lower crime, higher unemployment,\" Scott said, \"you may have thought we were in the middle of an independent, partially conservative crowd.\"\n\nPeople at the Chicago speech who spoke in interviews afterward painted a more nuanced picture of how Scott's conservative messaging was received. Some said they felt shortchanged by a speech they described as more focused on attacking the left than on highlighting specific policies from the right that would better their communities.\n\n\"I'm disappointed with the speech,\" said Kimberly Wimberly, who attended the speech with her husband, Roderick. \"He never got to the part where he can fix it. You want to be in the highest position in the whole United States of America, and yet you have not come with any solutions to the problem. You just pointed out the problem.\"\n\nRoderick Wimberly said: \"I thought we were going to have a policy discussion. Many times when politicians come to our communities, they're not coming to engage in actual policy discussions, because they may overlook us and think that, well, they won't understand these discussions.\"\n\nHe said he hoped Scott would highlight his stance on abortion, corrective measures he would take to address low property values in the city and his plan to address lackluster funding for city schools.\n\nKimberly Wimberly added: \"We're not looking for the theatrics. We're not looking for the dramatization. We just want to hear you. We're intelligent people.\"\n\nOthers felt Scott's focus on personal accountability while denying the existence of systemic and institutional racism in America overly simplified a nuanced conversation.\n\n\"I'm a personal individual that's been held accountable for my actions. I got locked up in 1989. I was 16 years old. I didn't get out until I was 48,\" said a formerly incarcerated man who asked not to share his full name.\n\n\"The institutional racism looks like this right here: When you try and apply for a job, they got on the application background checks. When you try to get housing, background checks,\" he said.\n\nRoderick Wimberly said, \"It blames the people who are in poverty for their failure to achieve and kind of demonizes us.\"\n\nKimberly Wimberly said: \"We do want to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, but we need boots, and we need the straps. A lot of us are barefoot.\"\n\nDespite the criticisms, Scott's speech did draw some support in the room.\n\n\"I'm glad he came. And I hope that people start to realize that we need to change,\" said Lavondale Glass, who goes by the nickname \"Big Dale.\" \"I'm looking at our neighborhood, and our neighborhood's been the same for the last 47 years, and that's what the Democrats have been doing. So we need a whole new regime.\"\n\n\"I'm a vote for him,\" Glass said.\n\nStill, the overall feeling of most attendees was that Scott's attempt to appeal to the group through his life story was undercut by his politicking.\n\n\"The bottom line is any person that comes through these doors, any other door where they meet the public, they're trying to win votes. Period,\" said Ron Bellamy, a retired educator.\n\nNnamdi Egwuonwu is a politics reporter at NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Tim Scott of South Carolina announced Sunday night that he is dropping out of the 2024 Republican presidential campaign, shocking a TV interviewer and even his own campaign staff with an abrupt departure from the race.\n\n\"When I go back to Iowa, it will not be as a presidential candidate. I am suspending my campaign,\" Scott said in an appearance on former GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy's Fox News program.\n\n\"I think the voters, who are the most remarkable people on the planet, have been really clear that they're telling me: not now,\" Scott continued.\n\nThe announcement was a surprise: Gowdy, a former colleague of Scott's in the House of Representatives, appeared to do a double-take as he made his statement. Multiple Scott staffers told NBC News they got no warning he was ending the campaign, finding out only by watching him say so on TV.\n\nScott's campaign even sent out a fundraising email not long before he announced he was leaving the race. \"We want to give you ONE LAST CHANCE to donate this weekend and help Tim reach his campaign goal. Can you chip in to help Tim win?\" the campaign wrote.\n\nHis decision comes amid efforts to consolidate the GOP opposition to former President Donald Trump, who has big leads in primary polls, including in the first caucus state, Iowa. Scott took 7% support there in the October NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll , putting him in fourth place.\n\nScott's dropout also comes days after the third Republican presidential debate in Miami, after which he canceled a scheduled weekend campaign swing in Iowa, citing the flu.\n\nScott started the 2024 campaign relatively little-known compared to some of his competitors. His campaign and an allied super PAC spent nearly $25 million on ads in Iowa and other early states promoting him as an optimistic conservative, according to AdImpact, an ad-tracking service. Scott saw an uptick in early-state polls soon through the summer.\n\nBut money started to grow tight leading up to Sunday's dropout, according to a source familiar with the campaign. Scott never caught fire in the GOP debates. And his poll numbers stagnated as an in-state rival caught attention. He is dropping out of the race just as former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has pulled into second place in early-state primary polls.\n\nHaley, who appointed Scott to the Senate in 2012, praised him on X , the social media platform. \"Tim Scott is a good man of faith and an inspiration to so many. The Republican primary was made better by his participation in it. South Carolina is blessed to continue to have him as our senator,\" she wrote.\n\nLast month, Scott's super PAC canceled millions of dollars in planned fall advertising, saying the Republican electorate wasn't \"focused or ready for a Trump alternative.\"\n\n\"There comes a point when it's clear that there isn't going to be a breakthrough moment, and one was really needed given where he stood in the field,\" a Scott campaign staffer said. The staffer praised Scott's message and personal favorability numbers, \"but they never translated into support, and that's just the reality of what it takes to win - and if you don't have a path, it's time to help consolidate to beat Trump.\"\n\nWhile Scott's voters are now going to have to find another candidate, he indicated in the interview with Gowdy that he wasn't looking to endorse one of his former rivals at this time.\n\n\"I'm going to recommend that the voters study each candidate and their candidacies and, frankly, their past and make a decision for the future of the country,\" he said. \"The best way for me to be helpful is to not weigh in on who they should endorse.\"\n\nAnd Scott seemed uninterested in the idea of becoming a candidate for vice president later on in the campaign. \"Vice president has never been on my to-do list for this campaign, and it's certainly not there now,\" he told Gowdy.\n\nScott is leaving the race after another well-known candidate dropped out. Former Vice President Mike Pence suspended his campaign in late October, as the Republican presidential field winnows down.\n\nSeveral of Scott's former 2024 rivals reacted to the news on social media.\n\n\"Tim Scott is a strong conservative with bold ideas about how to get our country back on track. I respect his courage to run this campaign and thank him for his service to America and the U.S. Senate. I look forward to Tim continuing to be a leader in our party for years to come,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis posted on X .\n\nVivek Ramaswamy praised Scott as a \"good dude\" before referring to an interaction the two had onstage at last week's Republican debate (and taking a dig at Haley).\n\n\"I gave @SenatorTimScott a congratulatory [gold fist bump emoji] on stage when the other South Carolinian shamelessly copied *exactly* what he said,\" Ramaswamy posted on X . \"Wishing Tim all the best back in the U.S. Senate.\"\n\nNnamdi Egwuonwu is a politics reporter at NBC News.\n\nAlex Tabet is a 2024 NBC News campaign embed.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Tim Scott, R-S.C., attacked Donald Trump on Monday by criticizing the former president for not supporting a federal abortion ban and repeatedly expressing an interest in working with \"both sides\" to reach an agreement on the issue.\n\n\"President Trump said he would negotiate with the Democrats and walk back away from what I believe where we need to be, which is a 15-week limit on the federal level,\" Scott said, referring to comments Trump made during an interview with NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nIn the interview, Trump said, \"We're going to agree to a number of weeks or months or however you want to define it.\"\n\n\"And both sides are going to come together and both sides - both sides, and this is a big statement - both sides will come together, \"he added.\n\nScott's remarks on Monday came in response to a question from a town hall participant asking the South Carolina senator and GOP presidential candidate to distinguish himself from Trump, who the attendee noted was the only sitting president to ever attend the anti-abortion March for Life rally.\n\nScott has made his support for a 15-week federal abortion ban a cornerstone of his campaign, using it to contrast himself with Trump and his other 2024 rivals.\n\n\"Vivek Ramasamy, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, all along with President Trump, have said they will not name a week where we stop California, New York, Illinois, from having abortions on demand,\" Scott said.\n\nRamaswamy has said abortion should be left to the states, while Haley has stated a 15-week ban would never pass Congress.\n\nWhen asked whether he'd sign a 15-week federal abortion ban during a radio interview Monday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he'd \"look favorably\" on any anti-abortion rights legislation that reached his desk as president. During the same interview, DeSantis said Trump is \"going to make the Democrats happy with respect to right to life.\"\n\n\"I think all pro-lifers should know that he's preparing to sell you out,\" DeSantis said. \"And so, I don't think that what he's saying would work, and I don't think he would be able to generate a quote deal that would be acceptable to pro-lifers.\"\n\nAs governor, DeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban that Trump called \"terrible\" in the \"Meet the Press\" interview. DeSantis responded on Monday by saying, \"I think [that] was a terrible statement.\"\n\nNnamdi Egwuonwu is a politics reporter at NBC News.\n\nJillian Frankel is a 2024 NBC News campaign embed.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Tim Scott's presidential campaign is going \"all-in\" on the Iowa caucuses as his White House bid struggles to gain momentum nationally among Republicans.\n\nScott's campaign said it will shift resources from New Hampshire to Iowa, doubling its staff in Iowa and opening new headquarters in West Des Moines. It also plans to spend more on advertising ahead of the first-in-the-nation caucus on Jan. 15, it said in a statement.\n\n\"Tim Scott is all-in on Iowa,\" campaign manager Jen DeCasper said in a statement Monday. \"No other candidate has the resources, the foundation of support and the message to be successful in the Hawkeye State.\"\n\nThe Des Moines Register first reported the campaign's new focus on Iowa.\n\nThe campaign's revised strategy will bring Scott, of South Carolina, back to Iowa every week in the lead-up to the caucuses. Scott will conclude a five-day tour of the state Tuesday.\n\nBut the move also underscores faltering aspects of his campaign. His numbers have plateaued in both early-state and national polls, the main super PAC supporting him recently canceled its planned fall ad buy, and concerns persist about whether he can meet the polling threshold to qualify for the next Republican primary debate .\n\nA new national poll conducted by USA Today and Suffolk University had Scott tied for fourth place with Vivek Ramaswamy at almost 3% among Republican respondents.\n\n\"We are going to make our stake right here in the great state of Iowa first; it will take our momentum wherever we go next,\" Scott said Monday at a campaign event in Marshalltown, Iowa.\n\n\"My message resonates here really well,\" said Scott, adding that he believes his faith-based message will propel him to victory in the state.\n\nBuilding momentum among evangelical voters in Iowa deemed \"persuadable\" may be the Scott's campaign's best opportunity to prove the viability of his White House bid. In a meeting with donors this month in Dallas, senior campaign officials argued that the \"evangelical lane in Iowa is unoccupied\" and positioned Scott as having a better shot than his GOP rivals in appealing to the group, given his high net favorability rating.\n\nAmong likely GOP caucusgoers in Iowa, Scott was second only to former President Donald Trump in favorability, according to an NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll .

      "text": "Tim Scott disappeared at the last GOP debate. His nice-guy routine is up for another test.\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nSIMI VALLEY, Calif. - Sen. Tim Scott is beloved by congressional colleagues, complimented by voters who see him as \"really nice,\" and even praised by his rivals - including barb-trader-in-chief Donald Trump.\n\nBut being Mr. Nice Guy might be one reason why Scott struggled to break through at last month's GOP presidential debate. And Wednesday's second debate is going to be another test of Scott's bet that the nice guy won't finish last - a bet he's answering for on the campaign trail, too.\n\nAt recent town halls across Iowa, one voter asked Scott, \"What makes you think you're not too nice to do the job that needs to be done?\" Another questioned if Russian President Vladimir Putin \"would be afraid of you? Because you seem like a really nice guy.\"\n\nScott first reached for his biography to answer: \"My friends were shot, buried or locked up,\" he said. \"I'm tough enough. I think being tough is having, like, a laser focus, getting things done - not shouting and screaming. The loudest voices are sometimes the quietest on the issues that matter the most.\"\n\nThe loudest voices also got the most speaking time at the first Republican debate, and Scott seemed absent from the conversation at times, unable to get a word in amid the attacks flying between his opponents. In the month since that debate, Scott's average showing in national GOP primary polls has dropped 1 percentage point, from 3.6% to 2.5%, according to FiveThirtyEight . He has also scored lower on average in Iowa and New Hampshire polls taken after the debate than before, and he is now facing more competition on the airwaves in both states after advertising consistently through the summer.\n\nBut ahead of the second debate, Scott's team is pushing back against the idea that he has to change his approach. His campaign manager argued in a new memo to donors and allies that \"a few snappy lines on national television don't change the fundamentals of a campaign\" for president. They are not pointing to horse race polls that show him leading - there are none - but instead to candidate favorability ratings, which show Scott with the highest spread in the GOP field between Republicans who have favorable opinions of him and the relative few who view him negatively.\n\nOne senior Scott adviser told NBC News that it's not a question of Scott adding more \"aggression\" to the mix but offering contrast to other candidates where he sees it.\n\nIn recent weeks, the South Carolina senator has shown new willingness to call out his rivals by name on issues including abortion and Israel policy. Adding Trump's name to that mix this month, he criticized the former president for not supporting a federal abortion ban and repeatedly expressing an interest in working with \"both sides\" to reach an agreement on the issue. The criticism marked a new inflection point for Scott, who has praised the former president in the past.\n\nStill, though Scott's team argues for staying the course, some allies concede the last debate wasn't his best showing. One ally chalked it up to \"Tim being the Southern gentleman that he is - not trying to talk over people, allowing people to speak.\"\n\n\"I know his mom had a conversation with him,\" Maurice Washington, a longtime Scott ally and former chair of the Charleston County Republican Party, surmised. \"Mom probably said, 'Look, I know I raised you to be a good Southern gentleman. When others are not playing by the same kind of rules, perhaps you need to elevate with a little bit more force.'\"\n\n\"A little bit more polite aggressiveness will come out of him. I'm convinced of that,\" Washington continued.\n\n\"I expect you'll see a more spirited performance from him\" this time, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., told NBC News, giving a hearty laugh when asked if his colleague was \"too nice\" to be on the debate stage. Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, was one of Scott's early endorsers for president.\n\n\"The moderators didn't do him any favors at the last debate, but you do have to create your own opportunities and I think he'll be looking for chances to do that,\" Thune said.\n\nThat sentiment was shared by other Scott allies on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"Tim comes from a rough neighborhood,\" said Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., who also endorsed his colleague earlier this year. \"Being courteous and nice doesn't mean that you're not tough. And sometimes the guy that speaks softly can carry a really big stick.\"\n\nScott said much the same thing to the voters he saw in Iowa recently.\n\n\"I'm as nice as I am mean,\" Scott said. \"I prefer the nice side, but I don't mind mixing it up if I have to.\"\n\nAli Vitali is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News, based in Washington.

Tim Scott is quickly rising up the ranks of contenders to be Donald Trump's running mate, and a Trump ally who's spoken with both men about the matter now says it's \"a real possibility\" that the senator is tapped.\n\n\"It's real,\" this person said. \"And he'd take the job in a second.\"\n\nNBC News spoke with roughly a half-dozen Republicans about the potential for Trump to tap Scott, R-S.C., as his vice presidential nominee, most of whom said Scott would be interested in the position but would not try to outgun other contenders behind the scenes.\n\nScott's ascendance on the list of potential running mates comes as he endorsed the former president ahead of the New Hampshire primary and has quickly turned into a frequent surrogate, offering full-throated support on the trail and on television that has been so fulsome it's caught the attention of Trump and his allies.\n\n\"We need a president who will unite our country - we need Donald Trump,\" Scott said in endorsing Trump before a rally of supporters in Concord, New Hampshire, last month.\n\nIn a recent interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo, Trump himself name-dropped Scott when asked about potential vice presidential picks.\n\n\"I called Tim Scott this week, because a lot of people like Tim Scott,\" Trump said. \"I called him, and I said: 'You are a much better candidate for me than you are for yourself.'\"\n\n\"It could be a lot of people,\" he continued of his potential choice. \"But it was interesting. I watched him over the last two weeks. As you know, he endorsed me, fully endorsed me, gave me a beautiful endorsement, and he has been really strong in terms of that, but ... I don't want anybody to take even any inference. But it's incredible.\"\n\nA person close to the senator pointed out that Trump and Scott have a long-standing relationship from Trump's time in office, when they worked together on tax cuts, opportunity zones, increased funding for historically Black colleges and universities, criminal justice reform and other legislative goals.\n\n\"He's enjoying the surrogate role,\" this person said, noting Scott may be doing more media now on Trump's behalf than he was during his presidential run. \"He's having fun with this process.\"\n\nTrump still has a ways to go to clinch the Republican presidential nomination. But so far, he has won all four of the first contests and he's set to notch another win Feb. 24 in South Carolina, the home state of both Scott and Nikki Haley, the state's former governor and the only remaining major Trump challenger in the race.\n\nTrump has already started giving attention to taking over the Republican National Committee once he becomes the nominee, and the question of whom he may tap as a running mate has received  increased scrutiny. That he would not have to make the pick for months only adds to the intrigue as contenders could spend months auditioning for the job.\n\nSpeaking with CNBC on Thursday, Scott said Trump has neither offered him the job nor \"indicated to me anything whatsoever\" about being his running mate.\n\n\"He's not inferred anything whatsoever, but what I can tell you is working towards four more years of low interest rates, low crime, low inflation, is something I'm really interested in doing,\" he said.\n\nThe Trump ally who's spoken with both men said Scott is seen as a potential asset for a ticket both on a policy front and in helping to cut Democratic margins with voters of color, particularly Black and Hispanic men. What's more, this person said, the two are \"compatible\" with each other and don't have a \"forced\" relationship.\n\n\"I don't think [Trump] needs anybody who is a distraction,\" this person said. \"Tim Scott's not a distraction.\"\n\nScott is one of a number of potential picks, including Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, South Dakota's Republican Gov. Kristi Noem - whom Trump also name-dropped in that Fox News interview - and Rep. Elise Stefanik , R-N.Y.\n\n\"He's not auditioning, he's out there helping,\" this person said, adding that one potential negative for Scott is that his name was floated too early. \"Other people are definitely in the 'pick-me' adulation mode.\"\n\n\"But you can't be overly eager with Trump. ... Obsequiousness bores him,\" the person added. \"The idea he needs yes men and women was never true. It bores him.\"\n\nThere are items on Scott's resume that could hurt him in a vetting process at a time when Trump is not only looking for long-standing loyalty , but also continues to falsely insist the 2020 election was stolen from him. Scott was one of many Republican senators who voted to certify the 2020 election Jan. 6, 2021, saying the day before that Congress had \"no constitutionally viable means\" to \"overturn an election.\"\n\nIn May, he told NBC News \"no\" when asked in an interview after his presidential campaign launch whether he would ever try to overturn an election he lost. During the first GOP primary debate in August, Scott said former Vice President Mike Pence - whom Trump excoriated for not agreeing to overturn the 2020 results - \"absolutely\" did the right thing that day.\n\nYears prior, Scott, the Senate's lone Black Republican, said Trump's \"moral authority\" was \"compromised\" after he said both sides were to blame for violence during the 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that turned deadly.\n\nTrump and Scott will \"focus on the 98 things that bind them on which they agree,\" the Trump ally said.\n\nThen there's the idea that Scott is not a terribly strong debater , reinforced by his performance in the first presidential primary debate last summer. Trump is likely to closely consider debate chops when making a pick, wanting someone who matches up well against Vice President Kamala Harris in the event of a debate this fall. Meanwhile, Scott represents a safely red state, not one that will be at the forefront of this fall's general election campaign.\n\nA former senior Scott campaign official noted that in the early days of his bid, Scott took offense at the assertion that he was running only to boost his veepstakes chances.\n\n\"There was no chess game being played,\" the official said. \"He wouldn't dedicate all of that time, effort and resources if he wasn't serious about being president.\"\n\nScott expressed a similar sentiment at the end of his campaign as well. After suspending his campaign in November on Fox News, he told host Trey Gowdy, \"Vice president has never been on my to-do list for this campaign, and it's certainly not there now.\"\n\nTwo Trump advisers either declined to comment for this story or did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn Scott's home state, a number of Republicans expressed excitement at the possibility that he could be tapped.\n\nSteven Wright, chairman of the Dorchester County GOP, said he felt Scott would make a \"phenomenal vice presidential pick,\" pointing to his Senate resume and life story of overcoming childhood poverty.\n\n\"But I think it's premature to begin wondering,\" Wright said. \"As we know, President Trump is pretty unpredictable. And he may pick somebody that we can guess, or he may pick somebody that nobody even thought of.\"\n\nBut the timing of Scott's full-throated endorsement of Trump ticked off some Haley supporters, who noted that she was the one who appointed him to his Senate seat when she was governor. At a campaign event in the Palmetto State on Saturday , Haley's son, Nalin Haley, referred to Scott as \"Senator Judas.\"\n\nThe annoyance and disappointment increased after Trump said at his election-night event in New Hampshire that Scott must \" really hate \" Haley since he didn't endorse her.\n\n\"I just love you,\" Scott responded.\n\nSouth Carolina state Rep. Nathan Ballentine, a Haley backer, said he \"lost respect\" for Scott after that moment, saying the senator is now \"kissing the ring and hoping [he] gets something out of it.\"\n\n\"How degrading is that?\" Ballentine said of the moment in New Hampshire. \"I can't even imagine what his friends told him after he did that. If Trump somehow wins and somehow names Tim Scott VP, well, then Tim got what he wanted.\"\n\nScott seems to have relished criticism from Haley following his endorsement. Responding to a tweet in which a reporter noted Haley questioned if Scott can \"sleep at night\" after endorsing Trump, Scott responded: \" only 8 hours .\"\n\nMaureen Bulger, a Republican voter and Haley supporter from Bluffton, South Carolina, who spoke with NBC News at a Haley event last week, said she was \"appalled\" by Scott's endorsement and suggested it had to have something to do with the potential for being tapped as vice president.\n\n\"I think Trump suggested you'll be my vice president like he did with Chris Christie [in 2016],\" Bulger said. \"And then he threw him out. Once he gets South Carolina, Tim Scott will be distant. I'm sure he probably cringes when he goes back and watches that bit where he goes 'I love you' onstage. Trump emasculated all those guys\" up onstage with him.\n\nTrump supporters, though, had nothing but love for Scott, with some thinking it's all but a done deal that he will be the former president's running mate.\n\n\"He's going to be the guy,\" said Ron Clack, a Trump supporter from Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. \"Without a doubt.\"\n\nAllan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

As president of the United States, I would sign the most conservative legislation, pro-life legislation that can get to my desk,\" he told NBC News' Tom Llamas in an interview Monday.\n\n\"If we don't win the American people on either side of this debate for life, nothing gets through Congress. What legislation do we have today that gets through Congress? I've cosponsored a 20 week bill. I've signaled very clearly I'd sign a 15 week bill.\"\n\nScott has been a longitme supporter of school choice and backed many bills over the years aimed at giving parents more flexibility to choose their child's schooling.\n\n\"I love school choice because I understand the value of a good education. I'll tell you, I've said it several times, the closest thing to magic in America is a good education,\" he said in January to students during a rally for National School Choice Week .\n\n\"I'm excited about your future because you are involved in what I believe is the greatest civil rights issue of our time, and it is quality education.\"\n\nScott has been a vocal critic of Democrats over the issue of critical race theory, arguing they want to stoke divisions.\n\n\"100 years ago, children were taught the color of their skin defined them. If you wanted to ruin America, you bring that back. Tell white kids they are oppressors, tell black kids and brown kids their destiny is grievance not greatness,\" he said on the campaign trail in Iowa this March.\n\nScott voted for Paul Ryan's 2013 budget (in 2012), which would have raised the Medicare age to 67 and, per analysis from KFF News, turned Medicaid into a block grant .\n\nOn taxes, he's touted the tax cuts the GOP Congress passed during the Trump administration and has argued cutting taxes empowers families to make decisions for themselves.\n\n\"A leader with a faith in America would have faith in Americans. That means cutting taxes, not raising taxes, so families can keep their own money, build their own lives and define their own dreams,\" he said on the campaign trail in Iowa in March.\n\nScott voted no on the sweeping immigration compromise in 2013 put forward by the \"Gang of Eight.\" He's backed a \" permanent, compassionate solution for DACA recipients \" in exchange for securing the border.\n\nMore recently, he's criticized the Biden administration over a report that immigrants separated from their family at the border. And he wants to devote money to building a wall with new technology on the southern border to address illegal migration and drugs.\n\n\"Closing that southern border saves perhaps tens of thousands of American lives. 70,000 Americans have lost their lives in a single year because of fentanyl,\" he told NBC News this week.\n\n\"Building the wall, using the latest and greatest technology that's available today, about $5 billion, will provide more surveillance on our southern border to stop fentanyl from crossing our border.\"\n\nScott has broadly voiced support for Ukraine, arguing that \"degrading the Russian military is in America's best interest.\"\n\nScott has been relatively light on specifics in what he would do as president with Ukraine, repeating the no \"blank check\" line and broadly criticizing President Joe Biden's \"lack of leadership,\" even as he's broadly talked about the importance of protecting democracy and America's security, and that America should be supporting Ukraine.\n\nWhile he's criticized the Biden administration for not clearly articulating its goals and accusing it of \" waiting too long to provide too little support ,\" he reiterated this week that \"our presence in Ukraine is actually essential\" to protect American interests and NATO countries.\n\nAfter supporting the Trump campaign's right to exhaust its legal options, Scott said that no judge found \"evidence indicating the election results in those states should be overturned\" and did not vote to object to the election results.\n\nThis week, he told NBC News he would not try to overturn an election he lost.\n\nBen Kamisar is a national political reporter for NBC News\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Republicansâ new Senate campaign chair is already courting top recruit\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nTim Scott just got to the helm of the Senate Republican campaign arm, and heâs already working on a feat that could make his job a lot easier.\n\nThe newly elected chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee met last week with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, whoâs emerging as the top potential GOP recruit for the midterm elections as the party seeks a challenger to Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga. Kemp is listening to Scott: The two met ahead of the inauguration and have been texting.\n\nâWe are looking for a way to make our Number One recruit a senator,â Scott told Semafor of Kemp. âHe would be the best candidate in Georgia weâve had for a very long time.â\n\nKemp is focused on his stateâs legislative session and isnât in a rush to decide on a Senate run, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Until he makes a decision, though, heâs likely to freeze the entire field in Georgia.\n\nIf Kemp does say yes â after patching up his relationship with Trump since their falling-out over the 2020 election â it would be an early boost for Scott as he settles into the Senate GOPâs top campaign role.\n\nIt was a job many of his colleagues were reluctant to entertain, given that Republicans will have to defend 22 seats next year. In addition to the critical task of recruiting challengers to Democrats like Ossoff and Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., Scott must navigate myriad primary threats to his incumbents, while working on deeper Republican structural issues and playing an integral role in selling Trumpâs agenda to the public.\n\nâIt is a very hard cycle,â Scott told Semafor. âOne office I said I never wanted in the Senate was to be the NRSC chairman. âThereâs no way that Iâll ever do that.â And I saw everybody walking away from it, and I had peace about stepping forward.â\n\nIn fact, Scott is a plum recruit himself for the challenging seat he now occupies. Heâs the longest-serving Black senator in US history, a former presidential candidate and the new chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, which is a prime fundraising perch.\n\nThe South Carolinian will need every penny of what he raises: Scott estimated the top five Senate races in 2026 could cost $2 billion total.\n\nHeâs also resolutely on-message: Seasoned congressional reporters know that he long ago stopped holding forth in the halls with spontaneous interviews. But when he does talk, heâs usually got something to say.\n\nIn this article:\n\nScottâs political history features some contrasting influences. He won a House seat in the 2010 tea party wave, then got appointed to succeed conservative former Sen. Jim DeMint by former Gov. Nikki Haley. Running in 2024 as a forward-looking optimist, Scott was an early favorite of Republicans who had hoped to turn the page on Trump.\n\nAfter his White House bid fizzled, Scott became a Trump surrogate and cemented his close ties to the president. Itâs a good thing he did; the NRSC chair will have to work with Trump to nominate candidates and back incumbents who can win primaries and general elections.\n\nTwo years ago, former NRSC Chair Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., adopted a strategy of more forceful intervention in party primaries â usually with Trumpâs support.\n\nDaines said Scott is âthe right leader at the right timeâ and deferred to him on future tactics. Other Republicans are hoping he picks up where Daines left off when it comes to aggressive involvement.\n\nâSen. Daines demonstrated how important candidate recruitment is and worked closely with President Trump â which I still think is going to be important to navigate contested primaries,â said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a former NRSC chair who is up for reelection in 2026 and could face a primary.\n\nIn two states more purple than Cornynâs, incumbent GOP senators are already facing a political balancing act ahead of their re-election runs. Maine Sen. Susan Collins voted against Pete Hegsethâs nomination to lead the Pentagon, while North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis supported Hegseth after keeping party leaders on their toes.\n\nCollins and Tillis will face more tough votes soon, on the confirmations of Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to Trumpâs Cabinet. So will Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who is already facing a MAGA-friendly primary challenge from state treasurer John Fleming.\n\nScott isnât sweating it.\n\nâThere are a lot of people that announce who donât do things,â Scott said, making clear that he trusts Republican incumbents to make âreally good decisions.â\n\nHe specifically praised Collins as a unicorn in deep blue New England, saying the NRSC will âinvest heavilyâ on her behalf.\n\nAcross the aisle, Scottâs rivals are happy to count his challenges. David Bergstein, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Scott faces a âpolitical minefield.â\n\nâTons of seats to defend, tough votes their incumbents will have to explain â and of course, Trump. And a traditional backlash against the party in power looming over every move they make,â he said.\n\nDemocrats run reliably ahead of Republicans in the candidate fundraising department; thatâs critical money and goes much farther in the ad market than super PAC dollars.\n\nNot to mention that several Democratic senators got re-elected in states Trump also won, leaving GOP candidates behind. Scott knows Republicans need to close that gap.\n\nThis is undeniably a tough cycle to lead the NRSC, but Scott has a few advantages.\n\nThe biggest one is his 53-seat majority to defend. Democrats need to net four seats to claw back the Senate, which means defending Ossoff, Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., and the rest of their incumbents â plus beating Collins, Tillis and two more Republicans in red states like Iowa, Texas, Alaska, Florida or Ohio.\n\nAnd while itâs unlikely that every GOP incumbent can avoid a serious primary challenge, Scott has a laid-back demeanor that will be an asset in the coming months. Trump may get tempted or lobbied to stay neutral or support challengers, but Scott gets along with him.\n\nHe also knows the new Republican math.\n\nâIf President Trump is against you, itâs really difficult in our primaries. If heâs for you, itâs much easier,â Scott said, allowing that âthere are some nuancesâ in a few states.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "J.D. Vance visits Trump trial, Tim Scott may be next. Is this the new VP test?\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nDonald Trump arrived at the Manhattan courthouse on Monday with his usual entourage â and a notable addition: J.D. Vance, a close ally widely seen as being on the vice presidential shortlist.\n\nVance isnât the only one eyeing the trial whoâs seen as a potential running mate: Sen. Tim Scottâs team, after Sen. Rick Scott dropped by the trial last week, had discussions about going to the courthouse to show support, according to one person familiar with the situation.\n\nWhile itâs unclear whether Scott will ultimately attend (he will be in New York on Tuesday night for a Trump fundraiser), the conversations, and Vanceâs appearance, reflect the way the trial is emerging as yet another litmus test for would-be running mates.\n\nVanceâs appearance, one person close to him said, wasnât politically motivated, but it clearly could boost his odds, especially given he was the first prominent member of the VP shortlist to make the trip. Heâs also live-tweeting the proceedings with posts that sound likely to please a certain reader : One contrasts the splendor of Trump Tower with the âdingyâ courtroom, for example, and accuses the DA of engaging in âpsychological torture.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nTrump likes to treat his veepstakes as a reality show production, with all the jostling for his approval and speculation about strategy that comes with it. With his public encouragement, candidates have spent weeks vying for his attention with joint appearances, Sunday show interviews, and ostentatious displays of affection.\n\nHis Manhattan trial seems like an obvious way to score points in that context, one that may be especially notable to Trump. Early on in the proceedings, Trump reportedly grumbled about the lack of allies in attendance. Heâs also appeared publicly irritated by the lack of major rallies outside of the courthouse . To put it simply, this is something he cares about and pays attention to.\n\nFor weeks, allies â including those being considered as Trumpâs vice president â have taken to the airwaves to defend him amid this trial. North Dakota governor Doug Burgum, who spoke at Trumpâs New Jersey rally on Sunday, appeared on CNN and backed up the former presidentâs reference to the Biden administration as â Gestapo .â Scott, usually known for his relatively friendly style of politics, has also been sounding Trumpier in his on-air interviews lately.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Tim Scott emerges as a 2024 kingmaker as rivals court his endorsement\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nNikki Haley called Sen. Tim Scott on Friday seeking his endorsement, according to a source familiar with the situation âÂ and sheâs not the only candidate courting him.\n\nThe former governor texted her fellow South Carolinian after he dropped out last month as well, but did not make an explicit ask for his endorsement at that time. The new push for Scottâs backing comes as a new CBS News poll shows her surging into second place in New Hampshire, where consolidating support from independents and moderates could be critical to making the race competitive.\n\nDonald Trump has also privately pushed Scott for his endorsement, the source told Semafor. The two have kept in touch since the senator ended his campaign ââ Scott was one of the only opponents who seemed able to remain on Trumpâs good side as he ran against him for office.\n\nChris Christie previously reached out about an endorsement, as well. Ron DeSantis, meanwhile, has been in touch with Scott too, though the exact nature of their conversation remains unclear.\n\nScott told Fox News in November that he didnât plan on endorsing another Republican candidate, though some close to Scott believe he could be open to endorsing after the new year.\n\nRepresentatives for the Haley, DeSantis, Trump, and Christie campaigns either declined to comment on record or did not respond, as did a spokesperson for Scott.\n\nIn this article:\n\nScottâs choice here could say a lot about his place within the party and future ambitions. Picking Haley, just as sheâs trying to consolidate the non-MAGA vote, would send a clear message to donors, endorsers, and voters that sheâs their last hope to stop Trump âÂ and that her throwback Reaganite brand aligns more with his own. Picking Trump, however, would immediately vault Scott into the top tier of vice presidential speculation for the current runaway leader to win the nomination.\n\nEither decision would also say a lot about how Scott might position himself in a future run in 2028 or beyond. Doing nothing might help preserve his options, but would be noted as well.\n\nScott, who enjoyed some of the highest favorability numbers in the Republican presidential field, including in early voting states, remains well-liked by donors, and has few enemies within any individual wing of the party. That makes him an obvious target for candidates looking to add a high-wattage ally in the home stretch.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump asking for an endorsement isnât entirely surprising: The former president is an avowed admirer of Scott, going so far as to warn his aides against directly attacking the lawmaker while they were running against each other. One of the things Trump is known for is his ability to network: Heâs in constant communication with lawmakers, and has garnered a deep pool of allies in part because he keeps in touch with people. This sits in stark contrast to DeSantis, who faced complaints about his less friendly personality from some Florida lawmakers early on in his presidential campaign.\n\nScott said when he dropped out that the vice presidency âhas never been on my to-do list for this campaign, and itâs certainly not there now,â but itâs hard to imagine that the offer â should it present itself â isnât enticing. At the very least, Scott staying close with Trump leaves the door open for him to pitch himself should he decide thatâs an avenue heâd like to pursue.\n\nHigh-profile endorsements have not been big vote movers in recent GOP presidential contests. Just ask Haley and Scott, who lined up behind Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. in 2016 as part of an unsuccessful effort to stop Trump in South Carolina.\n\nHaley may see a path to victory through New Hampshire , but her opponents arenât going to make it easy for her.

      "text": "Tim Scott backs new super PAC push aimed at Black voters\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nA Super PAC aligned with Sen. Tim Scott is launching a $14 million-plus campaign aimed at Black and Hispanic voters ahead of the November election.\n\nThe Great Opportunity PAC, led by longtime Scott aide Jennifer DeCasper, says it sees an opportunity to win not just the 2024 presidential election, but also ensure control of both the Senate and the House, by consolidating recent polling gains with Black voters, especially men.\n\nâFrom economics to the border to crime, thereâs a lot of reasons why the shift is becoming just so blatantly obvious that itâs now undeniable that there is something amiss, and itâs real,â Scott told a small group of reporters at a roundtable this week. âI think frankly, itâs not just racial, but itâs going to manifest itself in a racial shift that we havenât seen in probably three decades into politics, and thatâs because working class Americans are banding together, being fused together, by the issues that theyâre confronting on a daily basis, and those issues are more pronounced in the African American community.â\n\nIn a memo sent Thursday to interested parties, DeCasper wrote that the PAC has âa unique opportunity to expand the Republican political coalition and be the difference between whether we win the White House, House, and Senate.â The group has been in touch with the RNC about its plan, which includes courting âother working-class racial minoritiesâ as well.\n\nThe PAC plans to ârun a full scale, 360 degree communications and voter contact plan targeting swing and low propensity Black and brown voters.â The over $14 million budget will include various events and media appearances by lawmakers, as well as digital marketing, direct mail and targeted paid advertising, and canvassing, the memo added.\n\nâIn short, how Black Men and other working-class racial minorities vote could decide this election and their votes are up for grabs,â according to the memo. âIf Trump increases his margin among non-college-educated voters by another 2 points in 2024, and his vote margin among nonwhite voters increased by only 3 points, heâd win five additional states, bringing him to a 297-241 victory in the Electoral College.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nBoth of the presidential campaigns have made Black and Latino voter persuasion and turnout a priority this cycle, and the competition for support in both communities looks fiercer than prior Trump races. The Trump campaign announced a new executive director of Black coalitions earlier this week, while the Biden campaign launched a âBlack Voters for Biden-Harrisâ initiative.\n\nScottâs addition to the effort comes as heâs in the running for a potential vice presidential slot â the PAC launch offers a preview of how he might look on the ticket taking a lead role in messaging and events.\n\nAt the roundtable, Scott notably told reporters he believes heâs the right messenger for this topic, saying that heâs performed better with Black voters in South Carolina compared with the average Republican while also winning âblue counties where no Republicans are winning at all.â\n\nDemocratic pollster Cornell Belcher argued back in March that a big focus among Black Americans is âhow they feel about racism and discrimination on the rise â and they point to Donald Trump and what heâs done.â Belcher remained confident that âBlack and brown votersâ¦ are not rushing to embrace Trump or the derelict political party that foisted him on the nationâ because of this, according to a Bloomberg opinion piece.\n\nâDonald Trump is running his campaign the way heâs lived his life: not giving a damn about Black people or our communities,â Biden-Harris senior spokeswoman Sarafina Chitika said in a statement. âTrump entered public life by falsely accusing five black men of murder and political life trying to delegitimize the first Black president as the architect of birtherism. Itâs why the first thing he did after taking over the RNC was shut down its minority outreach centers, and itâs why heâs now trotting out backbenchers and C-listers in a last-ditch effort to defend his racist agenda. President Biden is on the campaign trail showing up â himself â to earn, and not ask for, Black Americansâ support. That is what leadership looks like.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Tim Scott suspended his presidential campaign Sunday evening, just days after participating in the third Republican debate.\n\nâI think the voters, who are the most remarkable people on the planet, have been really clear that theyâre telling me, ânot now Tim,â Scott said on Fox News, adding that he doesnât plan to endorse anyone in the primary.\n\nHis departure from the race comes two weeks after former Vice President Mike Pence, who made his surprise announcement during the annual Republican Jewish Coalition event in Las Vegas at the end of October.\n\nSome Scott staffers were unaware of their candidateâs plan to drop out, learning in real time with the rest of the country.\n\nScott has been floated as a potential vice presidential pick for former President Donald Trump, who is a fan of the conservative lawmaker and has warned aides against attacking him. In recent weeks, Scott began to ramp up his attacks against some of his opponents, though he seemed reluctant to criticize Trump directly.\n\nScott launched his presidential bid in May and sought to offer up a more optimistic message compared to some of his opponents, but was unable to garner a significant standing in state and national polls â and at times seemed to struggle to reach debate stage requirements.\n\nScott attracted a respected team of GOP consultants, and captivated some major party donors â especially Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who poured $30 million into a Scott super PAC before the campaign started. His easy Senate re-elections helped him fill one of the fieldâs largest war chests.\n\nThat helped fund multi-million dollar ad buys that introduced him to early state voters. When he entered the race, Scott had the highest net-favorable rating of any Republican running in Iowa and New Hampshire; at multi-candidate events, where he often leapt offstage to roam around the crowd, he got some of the warmest receptions. He emphasized his faith, including (eventually) his support for a national abortion ban, and his biography as a Black man who rose from humble beginnings with a bootstraps mentality, saying it made him âthe candidate the far left fears the most.â\n\nDespite his popularity, Scott was never able to break out of the crowded Republican field, and his optimistic messaging seemed to fall flat with voters looking for a fighter. While he tried to split the difference with a message that relentlessly attacked the âradical leftâ for dividing Americans and undermining critical institutions, the combination ultimately proved limited in its appeal after that brief and early burst of interest.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

But itâs not clear a rollback is what consumers or manufacturers want â and it could hurt the US data center boom.\n\nâ Tim McDonnell\n\nFor more on the politics of the energy transition, subscribe to Semaforâs Net Zero newsletter . â\n\nFor more on the politics of the energy transition, subscribe to Semaforâs Net Zero newsletter . â\n\nStories that are being largely ignored by either left-leaning or right-leaning outlets, curated with help from our partners at Ground News.\n\nWhat the Left isnât reading: A local Democratic Party official in Florida was arrested on child pornography charges .\n\nWhat the Right isnât reading: A Philadelphia Whole Foods became the Amazon-owned chainâs first store to unionize .\n\nPunchbowl News: Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy is launching a public affairs firm .\n\nPlaybook: Lawmakers and aides are scrambling to understand the scope of President Trump âs order to pause federal grants and loans (more on that below), and also questioning whether he has the legal authority to do it.\n\nWaPo: Republican candidates are poised to win the congressional special elections in Florida today.\n\nAxios: Trumpâs tariff threat-powered foreign policy can be summed up simply: âF--k around and find out,â a top White House official said.\n\nEdited by Morgan Chalfant , deputy Washington editor\n\nWith help from Elana Schor , senior Washington editor\n\nContact our reporters:\n\nBurgess Everett , Kadia Goba , Shelby Talcott , David Weigel\n\nMarlin Stutzman is a Republican congressman representing the 3rd district of Indiana, which he also represented from 2010 to 2017.\n\nActivist investor Starboard is backing down in its fight at Pfizer after seeing little chance of winning board seats or rousing enough shareholder pressure to force out its CEO, Semaforâs Rohan Goswami reported.\n\nThe decision ends an ambitious campaign that stumbled out of the gate and failed to capitalize on Pfizerâs underperforming stock price to rally investors to its side.\n\nFor more news and analysis from Wall Street and beyond, subscribe to Semaforâs Business newsletter. â\n\nFor more news and analysis from Wall Street and beyond, subscribe to Semaforâs Business newsletter. â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nSALEM, NH â Sen. Tim Scott will endorse Donald Trump on Friday evening at a planned rally in Concord, New Hampshire, a source familiar with the situation confirmed to Semafor.\n\nScott dropped out of the presidential race in November and suggested he had no plans to endorse another candidate âanytime soon.â However, shortly after his exit, Scott began fielding calls from a number of presidential hopefuls about endorsing, Semafor first reported â including the former president. The New York Times first reported Scottâs planned endorsement.\n\nHe is the latest in a list of high-level lawmakers who have endorsed Trump in recent weeks. Former 2016 opponent Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. made his announcement just before the Iowa caucus, while another old rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas publicized his backing just after Trumpâs historic victory in the Hawkeye state. Scott supported Rubio at a similarly crucial juncture in the 2016 race.\n\nIn this article:\n\nScottâs endorsement is a blow to Nikki Haley, who also sought his support and is a fellow South Carolinian. The endorsement could boost Trumpâs already sizable lead in the key primary state, and may also dampen Haleyâs momentum as she tries to best Trump in New Hampshire.\n\nThe South Carolina lawmaker has been cited as one of Trumpâs potential vice presidential picks, though heâs previously said the job âhas never been on my to-do list for this campaign.â Still, Scott is one of the few who has remained on Trumpâs good side, even as he ran against him for president â in fact, the former president explicitly told aides not to attack Scott during the race. And, if Scott decides he wants to be a serious contender for vice president, heâll likely have a long list of top allies to tap to help pitch Trump.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Why Tim Scott thinks he has a lane in 2024\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nGOOSE CREEK, SC âÂ Sen. Tim Scott took his first official dip into the 2024 presidential race last week, launching an exploratory committee and hitting up Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. At first glance, his (unofficial) campaign launch hit some speed bumps: Namely, Scott faced tough questions on abortion, and repeatedly struggled to answer them clearly.\n\nNonetheless, his home state of South Carolina greeted him with open arms on Friday. A small crowd stood outside of Alexâs Restaurant in Goose Creek with homemade signs welcoming him back to town, and he entered the locally-owned establishment to a packed house. Inside, Scott spent over an hour shaking hands and chatting with locals âÂ a glimpse at the retail politics one can expect will be at the forefront of Scottâs soft-launch.\n\nJust as it has in speeches to Republican audiences for years, Scottâs personal story as a successful Black man who credits conservative values âÂ not âwokeâ paternalism â with powering his rise went over well.\n\nâIâm voting for Tim Scott, even if he runs on another ticket with somebody else,â 54-year-old Hugh Denton said in South Carolina. âHe stood up in the face of being neglected, being put down, being tossed out, being called names because of his color and what he supports. And I think that heâs shown real integrity and real value and real worth of what he can do in the face of criticism âÂ and not just bow to it, but stand for what he stands for until the very end.â\n\nScottâs team believes his inspiring background is just one of the ways heâll find a lane, however. They also believe heâs the most traditionally conservative Republican in the 2024 race and backed up by the interest groups that matter most. Gun Owners of America gave him an âAâ in the 2022 congressional ratings and heâs earned both a 100% by the National Right to Life and an âA â from the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America group.\n\nJust as importantly, he has resources that others donât to tell voters about his personal story and record. His $21 million cash on hand beats out all the competition for now, including former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn this article:\n\nIâm not yet convinced that Scott can successfully find a lane against big-name, nationally-established opponents like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Trump, and even former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nIf the test for what makes a good conservative in 2023 was a flawless voting report card, then Scott would indeed pass with flying colors. But that was true of lots of Republicans in 2016 that Trump shoved aside for the nomination.\n\nAnd it remains an open question whether thereâs a path for any one candidate to stand out as the most conservative of the bunch, especially when theyâre elbowing each other for the title. Just last week, DeSantis quietly signed a 6-week abortion ban into law, and he has consistently been on the forefront of âanti-wokeâ fights that rev up the Republican base. Meanwhile, Pence has sought to separate himself early and often on social issues, and has been vocal on his anti-abortion stances in particular.\n\nAnd while Scott, due to his background, can certainly speak on various red-meat topics in a way that other candidates canât, that lane isnât entirely clear either: Nikki Haley, who grew up in a small town in South Carolina as the daughter of immigrants, has been hitting the ground with a similar message.\n\nScott also lacks his rivalsâ name recognition , which puts him at an early disadvantage. His team argues itâs an opportunity: They point out that heâs viewed positively by those who do know him, which offers a chance for him to grow in a way that other candidates wonât have. Underdog campaigns have won contests like Iowa in the past by building gradual buzz with an appealing message and a charismatic messenger. Scottâs war chest will help him aggressively make his pitch, but money hasnât been everything in prior races either.\n\nFinally, Scott has to convince voters he isnât running for vice president â something he and his team have explicitly pushed back on . His early reluctance to criticize rivals who might end up leading a ticket is in keeping with his usual style, but could bolster those suspicions.\n\nOn Friday, The Wall Street Journalâs editorial board made the case that Scottâs âoptimistic conservatismâ could help propel him to the presidency. âIf he can make it through the GOP primaries, he could be formidable in a general election as the candidate of national revival for a country that sorely needs it,â the board wrote.\n\nDuring a recent interview with CBS News, Scott declined to commit to backing Trump should he become the nominee, instead saying that he âplan(s) on being the nominee.â The dodge follows remarks he made in 2021, when he said âof courseâ heâd support the former president should he decide to run again in 2024.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Tim Scott is officially running for president. Hereâs his theory of the case.\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nTim Scottâs officially running for president, filing paperwork with the FEC on Friday and kicking off a process that started with a landslide November re-election that left him with nearly $22 million in the bank.\n\nScottâs facing an uphill battle and is currently polling at around 2% nationally. Heâs also trailed Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis in polling of his own stateâs early primary, where former governor Nikki Haley has been competing for home field advantage.\n\nBut his team sees a clear path to victory for the current underdog, arguing in part that he is the best messenger of the 2024 presidential candidates, that heâs the most consistently conservative of the bunch, and that heâs already compiled the resources and infrastructure needed to be successful.\n\nâWe are the land of opportunity, not the land of oppression,â Scott told reporters in Iowa last month, sketching out the basics of his message to GOP voters.\n\nSenior campaign officials on Scottâs team cited his record as a lawmaker as well as his high rankings from notable interest groups like the NRA as examples of his willingness to push forward conservative agendas. After his official announcement event on Monday, Scott plans to hit the ground running, with stops in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nAs for how he plans to beat Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis? His team is optimistic, and senior officials argued that heâs the candidate who will be seen as both garnering wins on important issues for the base and beating the Democrats on Election Day. They also plan to lean heavily on his background, rising from poverty to the U.S. Senate, and said that they found during his short exploratory committee that this type of messaging was resonating with voters across the country.\n\nIn this article:\n\nScott still has a lot to prove. He bungled some interviews after launching his exploratory committee with evasive answers on abortion, eventually endorsing a 20-week ban after previously co-sponsoring much stricter legislation . And â despite being well-liked in the Senate, where he could pick up some endorsements âÂ Scott remains low in the polls as Trump consolidates support.\n\nScottâs message, delivered at campaign events where heâll jump off the stage to get closer to his crowd, is that his background is proof that this country is the land of opportunity, not one defined by systemic racism.But heâs not necessarily alone in that lane. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley tells audiences that âthis is not a racist country,â offering up her story as the daughter of Indian immigrants from a small, rural town â âa brown girl in a black and white world.â And entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has been laser-focused on dismissing victimhood claims throughout his run for president. Both are currently polling ahead of Scott.\n\nThe South Carolina senator does have some major pluses in his pocket that other candidates do not. His team is launching a $6 million ad buy in various states âÂ including Iowa and New Hampshire â next week, and with $22 million cash on hand, heâll have no shortage of opportunities to boost his profile. Early money and a charismatic candidate seems like a strong recipe to generate a polling bounce in the states that matter, which could provide a foundation to garner more national attention.\n\nIn an op-ed published by the New York Times, columnist Jamelle Bouie bluntly declared that Scottâs campaign âis doomed from the start.â Still, he argued that the run is âinterestingâ in part because Scott is effectively operating as a trailblazer as âthe first Black Republican officeholder to run for the partyâs presidential nomination.â\n\nâIt has essentially taken a century for someone like Scott to emerge. And his political position reflects the conditions set by the structure of Black two-party politics in the 20th century. A modern-day Republican, Scott has few Black supporters and even fewer ties to the institutions of contemporary Black politics,â Bouie wrote. âTim Scott, whatever you think of his political views, would be a sui generis figure. Or, if you prefer, an odd man out.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Tim Scott of South Carolina is poised to make history as the longest-serving African American in the 235-year history of the U.S. Senate.\n\nScott, 59, the only Black Republican senator, was appointed in 2012 by then-Gov. Nikki Haley (R) after Sen. Jim DeMint abruptly resigned to run the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\n\"As we begin the 119th Congress, Senate Republicans have high enthusiasm and are focused on delivering for the American people! This Congress, I am thrilled to serve as the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee,\" Scott said in a statement. \"My goal is simple: make America work for Americans.\"\n\nThe title of longest-serving Black senator was previously held by Sen. Edward Brooke R-Mass., who served two full terms from 1967 to 1979.\n\nSo far, there have been 12 African-American elected or appointed senators, according to the Senate Historical Office .\n\nScott, who was a GOP presidential candidate in the 2024 election, endorsed President-elect Trump over Haley, who was also a presidential candidate, when he dropped out of the race after the third GOP primary debate.\n\nOn Friday, he said he was looking forward to working with Trump.\n\n\"We will unlock opportunity, strengthen our nation, and make America the shining city on the Hill again,\" he said.\n\nIn 2025, the Senate will see its highest number of Black senators serving concurrently. Apart from Scott, the group includes Sens. Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Scott, Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland and Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware.\n\nRochester and Alsobrooks will also become the first two Black women to serve in the Senate concurrently.\n\nBorn in North Charleston, South Carolina, Scott's parents divorced when he was seven and he, along with his mother and his older brother moved into his maternal grandparents' house.\n\nAfter graduating from Charleston Southern University in 1988 with a degree in political science, Scott worked as an insurance agent and financial adviser.\n\nHe was first elected to Charleston County Council, to the South Carolina State House, and the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House Correspondent for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Tim Scott, a Christian 'above all other things': How a Ten Commandments fight shaped him\n\nA cornerstone of Republican Tim Scott's political career has been an unyielding faith, which the South Carolina senator has showcased repeatedly during a state-to-state hopscotch exploring his likely 2024 presidential bid .\n\nIt's a message Scott, who officially filed on Friday , is comfortable advertising whether appearing on liberal-leaning programs such as The Daily Show or speaking at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition , where hundreds of Christian conservatives assembled in April.\n\n\"We must tell the story of our Constitution that the First Amendment was written to protect the church from the state, not the state from the church,\" he said last month.\n\nThose words are identical to what Scott said during a formative fight nearly three decades ago as a new member of the Charleston County Council when he made national headlines for posting the Ten Commandments at the local legislative body's building.\n\nIn 1997, television cameras showed a 31-year-old Scott, who took a hammer and \"banged the nail into the wall\" to hang the Old Testament decree outside the council chambers, according to the Greenville News.\n\nU.S. society, he said at the time, was established on principles rooted in those biblical directives.\n\n\"I think if you're a Jew, a Gentile, a Christian or even a Muslim, the Ten Commandments are universal,\" Scott said.\n\nPolitics: Tim Scott moves closer to challenging Trump, other GOP rivals in 2024, forms exploratory committee\n\nMore: Will he or won't he? Republican Sen. Tim Scott weighs a historic White House bid\n\nThose who wrestled with Scott over posting Bible verses at government buildings say it was clear back then that his political views were animated by core Christian values. He was sincere in those beliefs as much as he is today.\n\n\"He is radically evangelical and more than very conservative,\" Armand Derfner, a South Carolina civil rights attorney and one of the plaintiffs in the 1997 case, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"But I think he learns from things, I would be willing to bet that if you asked him today would he post the Ten Commandments on the wall, he'd say no or might not try to answer the question.\"\n\nThe Scott campaign did not respond to USA TODAY's request for comment on whether he still supports displaying the Ten Commandments or similar biblical teachings in public facilities.\n\nWhat's clear is that, since his days as a local elected official, faith is at the forefront of his political thinking and identity.\n\n\"I see myself first as a biblical leader and not as a Republican or conservative leader,\" Scott said during a 2020 video conference with students at Bob Jones University, which is known for its conservative cultural and religious positions.\n\n\"I am first a Christian,\" he added. \"And it is the thing I have chosen to be above all other things.\"\n\nScott senior campaign officials contend this is one of the 57-year-old Republican's strongest attributes which has been on display in the weeks since he announced his exploratory committee for the GOP nomination.\n\nAdvisers assert voters will meet a candidate with shared values and temperament who has the resources and narrative to woo GOP voters away from more fiery rivals-namely former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Rick DeSantis.\n\nMore: Ron DeSantis plans to formally enter the 2024 presidential race next week\n\nScott campaign officials, who asked for anonymity to speak freely, said the senator is at ease when talking about God's impact in his life with conservative evangelical churchgoers in Iowa as well as working-class independents at a New Hampshire diner.\n\nThose skills will be a particular asset in those early states, advisers say, where the Scott campaign has already scheduled events and deposited millions for TV and radio advertisements in the coming week.\n\nEven though recent polling has shown the percentage of U.S. adults who believe in God has dropped to its lowest point since 1944, about half of the country consider religion to be an important factor when picking a president.\n\nA 2020 Economist/YouGov survey, for instance, that found 48% of Americans said a presidential candidate's religious beliefs and practices are important when considering who to support.\n\nBarton Craft, a 52-year-old fine arts school administrator from Huntsville, Alabama, said faith is very important to him and who he votes for to be president. He said their particular religion doesn't matter long as the candidate sticks to the values that their faith espouses.\n\n\"The vibe that I get from (Scott) is that he believes what he's saying. I don't agree with everything he says, but I do believe that he genuinely believes it,\" Craft, a registered independent, said.\n\nPolitics: Biden campaign outlines plan to win battleground states ahead of 2024 election\n\nMore: Marjorie Taylor Greene wants to impeach Joe Biden: 'A direct threat'\n\nEric Bentil, a 24-year-old Massachusetts state trooper and independent voter, said Scott's previous support for displaying the Ten Commandments is something that makes him a more attractive candidate.\n\n\"Taking the whole idea of God out of schools has our society where it is now, and I think it's not a good trajectory in my opinion,\" he said. \"I'm not a Republican but it looks like right now my faith and everything aligns with them for the most part.\"\n\nFlorida real estate agent Adriana Vargas-Hernandez, 51, said she was a Republican but left the party due to Trump. As an independent voter, she said a candidate such as Scott is a needed breeze of fresh air to the 2024 contest.\n\n\"I believe that the Ten Commandments are really the base on what our country is all about,\" she said.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what religion you are,\" Vargas-Hernandez added. \"It's about being good and doing good to everyone else. So I believe that we are where we are because we have forgotten about our values.\"\n\nUltimately Scott and his allies on the Charleston County Council saw the Ten Commandments yanked down after a yearlong legal battle brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and other secular groups.\n\nA judge ruled the council violated the Constitution, but Scott remained steadfast in the face of that early political setback.\n\nIn a 1998 interview, Scott said the fight wasn't over religion but rather history and the fabric and foundation of the country, \"and that is a fight we should always wage.\"\n\nDemocrats have signaled that their plan is to cast Scott, who at times was critical of Trump, as a disciple of his policy pursuits. They called attention to his social views, calling him a \"MAGA Republican\" who wants to ban abortion and block certain types of birth control.\n\nJace Woodrum, executive director of South Carolina ACLU, said much has changed in the state and country since Scott was a local elected official. He said as the senator is gearing up to be a major White House contender, it is worth knowing if he learned a lesson or has changed his mind about the Ten Commandments.\n\nNation: ACLU plans to sue Texas over ban on certain medical treatments for transgender kids\n\n\"These actions in 1997 did not reflect the core value of religious liberty that South Carolinians hold and that is enshrined in our Constitution,\" Woodrum said.\n\n\"Sen. Scott speaks very openly about his faith and about religious liberty, but I think what he's actually talking about is religious dominance, and forcing his own religious beliefs on Americans.\""

      "text": "'Not now.' Sen. Tim Scott drops out of 2024 presidential election days after GOP debate\n\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. said Sunday that he was suspending his 2024 presidential campaign, less than a week after the third GOP primary debate.\n\nScott made the announcement to Fox News' Trey Gowdy, his fellow South Carolinian who also served in Congress.\n\n\"I love America more today than I did on May 22. But when I go back to Iowa, it will not be as a presidential candidate. I am suspending my campaign,\" Scott said. The lawmaker did not immediately endorse another Republican in the 2024 presidential race, and he denied that his campaign was an effort to become vice president.\n\n\"I think the voters, who are the most remarkable people on the planet, have been really clear that they're telling me: 'Not now, Tim.'\" Scott added. \"I don't think they're saying, Trey, no, but I do think they're saying not now. And so I'm going to respect the voters, and I'm going to hold on and keep working really hard and look forward to another opportunity.\n\nThe senator l aunched his 2024 presidential bid in May, when he sought to offer a more optimistic vision for Republican voters and Americans across the country alike. He also had a substantial $22 million squirreled away for his bid.\n\nScott, the only Black Republican senator, in a kickoff at Charleston Southern University, his alma mater, told supporters that \"our party and our nation are standing at a time for choosing: Victimhood or victory.\"\n\n\"I choose freedom and hope and opportunity,\" Scott said at the time, telling the crowd \"we need a president who persuades not just our friends and our base.\"\n\nBut Scott's campaign struggled to pick up steam. In a Real Clear Politics average of polls on the GOP field , Scott garnered 2.5%, compared to former President Donald Trump's 58.5%.\n\nScott on Sunday referenced a passage from the Bible, Romans 8:28, saying \"All things work together for good for those who love God and are called according to his purpose.\"\n\nScott's faith has been not only a cornerstone of his bid for the White House but also for his political career.\n\n\"I see myself first as a biblical leader and not as a Republican or conservative leader,\" Scott said during a 2020 video conference with students at Bob Jones University, which is known for its conservative cultural and religious positions.\n\n\"I am first a Christian,\" he added. \"And it is the thing I have chosen to be above all other things.\"\n\nScott has even focused on his faith while fielding questions about his personal life. The senator revealed earlier this year that he is dating \"a lovely Christian girl.\"\n\n\"I'm so thankful to know a risen savior that has helped guide my way, and I'm so thankful that he's allowed my life to intersect at the right time with the right person. And I just say, praise the living God,\" he said during the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition's annual fall banquet.\n\nScott's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for additional information.\n\nContributing: Phillip M.

      "text": "Tim Scott nice-guy image raises doubts he could be Donald Trump's pick as a bulldog VP\n\nCHARLESTON, S.C - Sen. Tim Scott has been one of Donald Trump's biggest boosters since abandoning his own 2024 White House campaign late last year before Republican primary voters had even cast a single ballot.\n\nBy all accounts, the South Carolina senator's transformation from the sunny-upbeat-optimistic presidential aspirant into a MAGA champion has been part of the audition process as Trump sizes up potential running mates .\n\nBut those who know Scott well from back in his home state told USA TODAY that they're skeptical the 58-year-old lawmaker is going to be Trump's vice-presidential pick. Their primary reason: Scott, who ended his own White House run with an eye toward his prospects in 2028 and beyond, doesn't have the capacity to be the dogged defender Trump says he wants as his loyal No. 2.\n\nFormer Greenville County GOP chairman Nate Leupp said Scott is \"about as good of a person as you get in politics.\" South Carolina political strategist Chip Felkel called him a \"happy warrior.\" FOX News host Trey Gowdy, a former congressman and also a long time friend said, \"most of his colleagues think he is too good for politics.\"\n\nMore than a dozen Republicans have been jockeying for months to be on Trump's VP short list. They've campaigned for the presumptive 2024 nominee and former president at rallies. They've promoted him on cable television and helped fundraise millions of dollars for his campaign. Trump has said he has made his choice and plans to make an announcement around the Republican National Convention that starts July 15 in Milwaukee.\n\nScott has shown he meets some of the basic criteria Trump is looking for. He can tap into the network of billionaires whose money is the lifeblood of a presidential run, holding an event in June that included some of the mega-donors who had not yet signed on to Trump's campaign. That same month, a political action committee associated with Scott announced it will spend $14 million before Election Day in November to turn out Black voters for Trump.\n\nThe South Carolina senator also did make one notable endorsement move that turned heads back home. After declaring \"now now\" upon the end of his own White House run, Scott backed Trump over Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who appointed him to the Senate in 2012.\n\nTrump has noticed the turnaround.\n\n\"He has been one of our great advocates,\" the former president said of Scott in February during an event in Columbia, S.C., after the primary polls had closed. \"He has been doing things that are unbelievable, and I am very happy he did not have that same energy, drive because I think I probably would have been out of the race a long time ago.\"\n\nTraditionally, a president and his campaign look for a running mate who can help them win the general election. The thinking goes that a VP pick should either be an exciting addition to the ticket, sooth an important constituency or hail from a state or region that can help to bring a critical swing state into their Electoral College column.\n\nBut Trump has also demonstrated again and again that he's no normal politician and his pick could differ widely from expectations. Those in his inner circle have hinted Trump wants a vice president that will be among those voraciously defending him on cable news, but who won't steal the spotlight.\n\nFelkel said going mean or tough is so contrary to Scott's disposition that he struggles to pull it off.\n\n\"I guess it really comes down to what Trump's looking for,\" said Felkel.  \"If Trump's looking for somebody to be a balance to his aggressive and less than civil positions and rallies and language and so forth, then I think Tim Scott would get that consideration. It depends on whether Trump wants a cheerleader or whether Trump wants a hitman.\"\n\nThe cornerstone of Scott's life, and campaigns, has been his faith.\n\nRaised by a single mother and his grandparents, Scott drifted in middle and high school, nearly failing out. He dreamed of playing professional football as a running back until an August 1982 car crash when he fell asleep at the wheel. Injuries kept him from playing most of his senior year and he received just a partial scholarship to one school: Presbyterian College in Clinton, S.C.\n\nThere, his life changed during a meeting of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.\n\n\"I'm not sure I ever would have found Jesus if my ego took me where I wanted to go. God didn't cause the accident, but he used it to deliver me into his kingdom,\" Scott said at a 2017 Fellowship of Christian Athletes banquet at Piedmont Technical College.\n\nScott graduated from Charleston Southern University in 1988 with a degree in political science and opened an insurance company.\n\nHis political career began in 1995, when he ran in a special election to the Charleston County Council. He held the seat for nearly 15 years, and made national headlines for hanging the Ten Commandments outside the Council's chambers, though the posting came down after a judge sided with a lawsuit from three residents.\n\nPosting the Ten Commandments was a \"real testament\" to Scott's faith that showed \"courageousness throughout the community blowback ,\" said Maurice Washington, a former Charleston City council member and a longtime friend of Scott's.\n\nScott served one term as a state lawmaker. In 2010, he became the first Black Republican in more than a century to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from South Carolina. He got a promotion from Haley two years later to the Senate to replace Republican Jim DeMint, who stepped down early to run the Heritage Foundation. Scott then won a special election in 2014 to serve the final two years of the term and again made history as the state's first Black elected U.S. senator.\n\nThroughout Scott's tenure in the Senate, he has focused on domestic issues. He's the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. After the death of George Floyd, who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis in 2020, he was the lead Republican negotiator on a proposed bipartisan overhaul of policing standards and legal protections. The bill failed in the Democratic-led Senate, with senators saying it did not go far enough.\n\nIn 2022, Scott worked with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) on a bill designating lynching a federal hate crime, an issue Scott had worked on for years. President Joe Biden signed the measure into law later that year.\n\nIn May 2023, Scott entered the presidential race in a field that would grow to include Trump, Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and a half a dozen others. His core promise: to take on \"the radical left\" and bring faith and conservative, business-friendly policies to Washington.\n\nWatching Scott's rise from county council to the White House campaign stage \"was like watching Opie skip a rock across the lake in Mayberry,\" said South Carolina GOP strategist Dave Wilson.\n\nScott isn't known for his glad-handing presence across the state the way as his counterpart, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Voters also haven't gotten to know him well, Wilson said. But voters do respect Scott's focus on helping the Republican Party and on electing conservatives across the country.\n\n\"He's a political evangelist,\" Wilson said of Scott while making a comparison to Christian televangelist Billy Graham. \"Even his mannerisms and his styles are very evangelistic in the way he talks, the way he presents, the way he gets down with people. He talks to them face to face.\"\n\nBeyond talking about his mother and his faith, Scott has always held his private life off limits. He's 58 and never been married. South Carolina politicos were shocked to learn he had a girlfriend when his now fiancée, Mindy Noce, appeared last November at a Republican presidential primary debate in Miami.\n\n\"When his girlfriend-now fiancé-popped up on stage we were like, 'Oh!' We didn't know who she was or that she even existed,\" Wilson said. \"He keeps himself out there a lot. He is out doing the job. But there's a very, very private side of Tim Scott and that area is kind of roped off and reserved.\"\n\nDespite a multi-state tour, early television ads and a massive war chest, Scott's presidential campaign was short-lived. His 2024 message that oozed optimism and hope for the future didn't resonate with voters who remain captivated by the Make America Great Again movement. Scott quit in mid-November, two months before the Iowa Caucus got the voting started. He snubbed Haley four days before the New Hampshire primary by endorsing Trump .\n\nSome onlookers question why a senator whose piety, moral compass and optimism hangs prominently before him has embraced the twice-divorced and four-times-indicted former president whose campaign rhetoric has so heavily focused on doom.\n\n\"Tim is the epitome of a Christian conservative, which also is a weird juxtaposition when he stands next to Trump with adoration,\" said Bakari Sellers, a Democratic commentator who served alongside Scott in the South Carolina state legislature.\n\n\"I believe he thinks he can better change the world by being vice president of the United States,\" Sellers said, but \"I think Tim probably knows there's not a good chance of him being vice president.\"\n\nWashington, the first Black chairman of the Charleston County Republican party, echoed this sentiment, noting South Carolina is already a predominantly red state and that Trump's \"poll numbers among African Americans are already moving in the right direction.\"\n\n\"What is happening now makes the selection process more competitive. And I'm not naïve to think otherwise. Nor is Senator Tim Scott,\" Washington aid.\n\nScott criticized Trump during the 2016 presidential primaries and supported Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who is now among the VP contenders in the mix for Trump in 2024.\n\n\"If Donald Trump can't take a stand against the KKK, we cannot trust him to stand up for America against Putin, Iran or ISIS,\" Scott said at the time.\n\nThe South Carolina senator also took issue in 2016 with Trump's attack on a judge's Mexican heritage, saying it was \"racially toxic.\" And Scott joined other Republicans later in the fall who denounced Trump after audio leaked from the \"Access Hollywood\" set where the reality show TV star said that he could freely assault women because he was famous. Scott called those Trump remarks \"indefensible\" and \"disgusting.\"\n\nBut in the 2016 general election, Scott took sides with Trump, saying he was the \"lesser of two evils\" compared with the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton.\n\nScott started his movement toward Trump following one of the Republican president's earliest and most controversial first-term statements.\n\nTrump had said many sides were to blame for the violence at an August 2017 neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Scott, at the time the only Black Republican U.S. senator, blasted the president's comments, saying his fellow Republican lacked \"moral authority\" and that he had been \"compromised.\"\n\nSoon afterward, Trump invited him for an Oval Office meeting where the two men talked about race relations. \"He wanted me to share with them my perspective. He listened, and after we finished talking he said, 'Help me help those I have offended,'\" Scott recalled in a recent FOX News interview .\n\nThat fall, the GOP-led House and Senate combined forces to pass Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Included in the major new law because of that Oval Office meeting was a Scott-authored provision creating what they called \"Opportunity Zones,\" which allow governors to designate \"economically-distressed communities\" that are candidates for federal tax incentives as a way to encourage investment. Trump in last week's debate against President Joe Biden credited Scott's work from more than six years ago for his current support among Black voters, deeming it \"one of the most successful economic development acts ever in the country.\n\nDemocrats criticize the Opportunity Zones as primarily benefiting wealthy investors. A 2023 review by the Urban Institute , a Washington, D.C., think tank, found mixed-to-no impact on employment and job creation in the zones.\n\nBut Washington said the program is a sign of Scott's ability to find common ground.\n\n\"There are some drastic differences between Scott's personality and Donald Trump's personality, but the magic is how you understand those contrasts but find those common interests, common ground, and still create magic,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\nTrump's campaign welcomed Scott's entry into the presidential race last year. Notably, Scott never attacked Trump directly during his short-lived run for the White House, which concluded with a speech pledging to \"hold on and keep working really hard and look forward to another opportunity.\"\n\nGowdy, who met Scott when they both entered Congress in 2010, said he's not shocked his longtime friend meshes so well with Trump.\n\n\"He is an evangelist trapped in politics,\" Gowdy said. \"He is not a politician. How can they be friends? You know, Jesus talked to people that other folks probably didn't think he ought to be talking to. He talked to people that you could argue he didn't have a lot in common with and that's kind of the model for the way Tim leads his life.\"\n\nPeople who know the senator said he'd bring a lot of strengths to a potential 2024 ticket.\n\nScott would bring a sense of sobriety and lack of vindictiveness to a Trump presidency, Gowdy added, noting the senator is the type of person who prays for those who criticize him - rather than directly respond.\n\n\"I think he would bring a mollifying effect,\" Gowdy said.\n\nSeveral of Scott's friends said the biggest strength Scott would bring to a Trump campaign is the same thing that didn't resonate in his own White House race: optimism for the future.\n\n\"There's a general sense of angst of whether or not our best days are behind us or not,\" Gowdy said. \"It is impossible to be around Tim without feeling hopeful that things can be better.\"\n\nScott has always been this way, said Darryl Ray Griffin, CEO of the Charleston-based Neal Brothers. They both ran in similar crowds in high school playing football on opposing teams. \"He's the same way today, the same way. He's never changed.\" Griffin said .\n\nTo Griffin, the idea of a VP pick being \"too nice\" is not sensible.\n\n\"How can you be too nice?\" Griffin said. \"He hasn't got to where he's at without having some very good analytical thoughts and making decisions. But, you can tell it a nice way too, right?\"\n\nScott does have some VP credentials that could help Trump in November, Sellers said, listing evangelicals, Christian conservatives, Black voters, establishment Republicans and Haley voters who continued to support her by significant margins in the primary even after she dropped out.\n\n\"This race is going to be close, so even what Tim Scott's able to do around the edges will be helpful,\" Sellers said. \"Outside of Marco Rubio, he probably would be the most frightening [vice president pick for Democrats]. But Trump ain't doing that.\"\n\nJoe Mulé, a resident of Mount Pleasant, S.C., who is also originally from Brooklyn, said if he had to choose a person to be a heartbeat away from the presidency, he would choose Scott.\n\nScott is \"sincere,\" said Mulé, who describes himself as an \"apolitical\" person who votes \"conservative regardless of party designation.\"\n\n\"Not only is he nice,\" Mulé said of Scott, \"but you know, if there's got to be a difficult decision, he can make it and stand by it.\""

      "text": "Tim Scott becomes longest-serving Black U.S. senator but his legacy sparks debate\n\nManage your account\n\nDespite Scott's historic milestone, Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright criticized the South Carolina senator's legislative record and whether it improved the lives of African Americans.\n\nSen. Tim Scott , R-S.C., made history on Friday when the new 119th Congress was sworn in, making him the longest-serving Black U.S. senator.\n\nThe achievement marks a turning point in U.S. politics, where Black Americans were historically shut out of public office, particularly in the South. Scott, 59, has represented South Carolina in the U.S. Senate for 12 years.\n\nThe former U.S. congressman, state representative, and Charleston City Council member was first appointed to the Senate by then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in January 2013. The next year, he won a special election to finish out the term of former Sen. Jim DeMint and later won reelection for two full terms. Scott has previously said his current term, which ends in 2028, would be his last.\n\n\"As we begin the 119th Congress, Senate Republicans have high enthusiasm and are focused on delivering for the American people! This Congress, I am thrilled to serve as the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee,\" Senator Scott said in a statement.\n\n\"My goal is simple: make America work for Americans. As we get to work cleaning up the mess from the previous administration, I look forward to working with President Trump on his priorities, including paving a path for all Americans to have the necessary tools and resources to achieve their version of the American Dream. We will unlock opportunity, strengthen our nation, and make America the shining city on the Hill again.\"\n\nShermichael Singleton, a Republican strategist, told theGrio of Scott's historic milestone, \"His achievement is notable because it has occurred in the GOP and not among Democrats.\" He continued, \"However, more importantly, I hope it inspires young Black men to see beyond their barriers and claim their place as heirs of a great tradition among Black men of faith, family, hard work, and perseverance... To know their roles as men and leaders in our community and nation are needed more now than ever before.\" After an unsuccessful bid for president in the 2024 Republican primary election, Sen. Scott served as a major surrogate for President-elect Donald Trump 's victorious 2024 campaign, helping Trump with support among Black voters, particularly Black men.\n\nDuring Trump's first term in the White House, Scott was credited for ensuring the president's criminal justice reform law, The First Step Act, included Opportunity Zones. The program was intended to provide economic development by providing tax benefits to investors who invested in low-income areas, which are disproportionately Black and brown.\n\nHowever, data analyzing the program concluded that its effectiveness is inconclusive at best. The Center for American Progress's analysis of the tax provisions noted they are \"costly and poorly targeted and do little to create jobs or improve conditions in poor communities.\"\n\nScott is known to be well-liked on Capitol Hill among his colleagues on both sides of the political aisle. He notably worked with Democrats to negotiate the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, key police reform legislation that Black Americans and advocates demanded of elected officials.\n\nHowever, negotiations for the Floyd bill ultimately imploded with Democrats pointing the blame at Scott and Republicans. At the time, Scott said the deal fell apart because Democrats wanted to \" defund the police \" related to grant money for police that would've required departments to implement certain reforms before receiving the federal funding.\n\nAntjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist, said he congratulates Sen. Scott on his historic achievement, telling theGrio, \"While we don't agree on 99.999% of issues, I still think it's monumental when you cross any historic measure.\" He added, \"That means something.\"\n\nHowever, Seawright argued, \"Just because he's made history doesn't mean history cannot be made again as an African-American senator, who's Democrat, who can serve longer than he has to this point, or even longer.\" U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., entered the U.S. Senate just several months after Scott. Assuming Booker remains in the Senate after Scott's planned departure, that history could be made yet again in the years to come.\n\nDespite Sen. Scott's historic milestone, Seawright criticized his record as a U.S. senator.\n\n\"I don't think most African Americans would point to his legislative track record and say, 'Because of Tim Scott's service as the United States Senator, I can directly speak to what he's done, or my life is directly better,'\" said the Democrat.\n\nHe continued, \"I don't think he's led on anything ... taking the sole lead on working on legislative matters that have a direct impact on everyday African Americans.\" Seawright added, \"That may be the difference between how he views his work and how, broadly speaking, the African-American community views his work and his time in the United States Congress.\"\n\nAs a senior Black Republican, Scott will almost certainly wield power and influence on Capitol Hill and the incoming Trump White House. The South Carolina Senator will also serve as the first Black chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which will be responsible for ensuring Republican victories in upcoming Senate elections.\n\nBlack history aside, Seawright argued that Scott's voting record does not reflect someone \"fighting for the people who look like you.\"\n\nIf Republicans \"want to increase the electorate and gain more broad support\" among Black voters, Seawright concluded, \"[Sen. Scott's] gonna have to think about what his governing looks like, and how the campaign trail translates to the governing side.\"\n\nMore must-reads:\n\nRudy Giuliani is in contempt of court in $148 million case defaming Black election workers\n\nTrump's lawyers ask judge to halt Friday's hush money case sentencing while they appeal to block it\n\nSenator Deb Fischer's husband refuses to shake Kamala Harris's hand and sparks backlash (WATCH)"

      "text": "Tim Scott becomes longest-serving Black senator in US history\n\nManage your account\n\nSixty years after Black Americans gained the right to vote in the United States through the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Sen. Tim Scott on Friday makes history, becoming the longest-serving African American in the 235-year history of the United States Senate. This historic moment will be shared alongside four other African-American senators, making this the largest group of Black senators to ever serve concurrently in the U.S. Capitol, a building constructed with the labor of enslaved Black people.\n\nThe previous longest-serving Black senator was the late Republican Sen. Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, who held office from 1967 until 1979. Scott, the first elected Black senator from the South, is the first to serve in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nIn his first speech as a freshman senator, Scott said, \"I believe in the greatness of America because I have experienced the goodness of our people in America. An ordinary guy like me can be blessed with an extraordinary opportunity like this.\"\n\nBorn and raised in North Charleston, South Carolina, Scott was raised in a single-parent household after the divorce of his parents. He was a troubled teenager who failed English, Spanish, geography, and civics in his freshman year in High School. He often recalls his close relationship with his grandfather, who was forced to drop out of school in the third grade, picked cotton to survive, and was not allowed to vote for more than half of his life. His grandfather was also unable to learn how to read, only to witness his grandson's career rise from those humble beginnings in South Carolina to become both a member of Congress and a U.S. senator.\n\n\"Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,\" Scott said at the Republican National Convention in 2020.\n\nAfter serving in the House of Representatives from 2011 until 2013, Scott was appointed by then-South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley to the Senate in 2012 after former Senator Jim DeMint left to become president of the Heritage Foundation.

In 2016, following the controversial deaths of Eric Garner, Walter Scott, and Philando Castile he delivered a poignant speech about the deep divide between law enforcement and communities in America. He revealed that, as an elected official, he had been stopped and questioned seven times while driving. Even as a senator, Scott was questioned about his identity by Capitol Police despite wearing a pin identifying himenator.\n\n\"While I thank God I have not endured bodily harm, I have, however, felt the pressure applied by the scales of justice when they are slanted.

      "text": "Tim Scott has benefited from mentors along the way. He's hoping for another helping hand\n\nManage your account\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - When Tim Scott was a teenager, a Chick-fil-A manager named John Moniz offered him a sandwich, a job, and four years of indispensable mentoring about how to be a businessman and a citizen. Later, after that helping hand put Scott on a path that eventually led him into politics, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley appointed him to a vacancy in the U.S. Senate.\n\nNow Scott stands on the precipice of perhaps another breathtaking leap, but once again he will need an assist. The South Carolina senator is one of a handful of prominent people being considered by former President Donald Trump to be his running mate this year.\n\nScott, a rarity as a Black Republican senator from the South, tells his story with rags-to-riches flourish, crediting Moniz for helping to lift him from a dead-end life before Moniz died suddenly while Scott was in college. But Scott's own role in taking advantage of the opportunities that came his way is part of the story, too.\n\nFrom Moniz, Scott says, he learned the ins and outs of business, how to be a good citizen, and less tangible lessons about how, in order to receive, one must first give. Scott put that guidance to use as he made his way from business into politics.\n\nHaley named him to the Senate seat in late 2012 after Republican Jim DeMint stepped down. That appointment further propelled a political career that had seen Scott rise from county council to the South Carolina Statehouse to Congress. Since then, Scott has proved to be a force in his own right with South Carolina voters as well as the state's political class.\n\nHe topped 60% all three times he ran for his Senate seat, building a network of supporters as formidable as any in the state. He largely stayed above the fray of internal party fights, making more friends with the powerful than enemies.\n\nIn his wake, he has left a trail of true believers.\n\n\"President Trump, if you want a good, honest man who is not going to embarrass you or embarrass this country, Tim Scott is who you need,\" said Robert Brown, the mayor of Hampton, a town of about 2,600 in the southern part of the state.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Bill Taylor, who got Scott's South Carolina Statehouse parking spot when Scott moved to the U.S. House, said one could not ask for a more compelling story.\n\n\"He's like the embodiment of the American Dream,\" Taylor said. \"He is a preacher for it.\"\n\nStill, not every step Scott has taken has ended in success. Scott had hoped his backstory would fuel his presidential run this year, but his campaign was quickly overwhelmed by the shadow of Trump.\n\nScott initially demonstrated a prowess for fundraising among donors uneasy with Trump, but then he virtually disappeared from the debate stage even without Trump there. Scott's candidacy was further complicated by the fact that South Carolina had a second candidate in Haley.\n\nBut after Scott dropped out, he turned against Haley, who had elevated him over friends and allies . Scott did not hesitate to criticize Haley's record in South Carolina and became one of Trump's biggest backers after leaving the race.\n\nThat demonstration of where his loyalty lies was not lost on Trump, who has been known to measure fellow Republicans in terms of their allegiance to him.\n\n\"You know, you're a much better candidate for me than you were for yourself. I mean it. He was like a different person,\" Trump said at a February rally. \"And I say that with admiration. because I'm the opposite. I'm much better for me than I would be for someone else.\"\n\nIf Trump goes in another direction for his vice president, Scott faces an uncertain path forward. He promised when he took the U.S. Senate job to serve only two full six-year terms, a vow he reiterated in 2022 when elected to that second full term.\n\nIf Trump does not call or the ticket loses in November, Scott's supporters have suggestions.\n\n\"I won't hold him to that. Circumstances change. Tim could be one of Trump's greatest allies in the Senate,\" Taylor said of Scott's promise. \"I have been very fond of saying - Tim, when you're done with all that stuff up there, come home and be governor.\"\n\nWhile the South Carolina governor's seat will be open in 2026 and his supporters keep putting up Scott trial balloons, the senator himself has dismissed the thought.\n\nAt 58, there could be other presidential runs.\n\nLewis Brown, voting in South Carolina's recent primary runoffs, said Scott's campaign convinced him that Scott has the stuff for the White House.\n\n\"I look at one thing for a vice presidential candidate - can you be president?\" Lewis said. \"Scott passes that test with flying colors.\"\n\nNo matter what Trump decides, Scott has another big life change on the horizon. He is getting married later this year.\n\nAs he waits for Trump to make a decision, Scott remains a regular presence on news shows on the former president's behalf, making headlines by dodging questions on whether he would accept the results of the 2024 election if Trump loses or ignoring Trump's support of tariffs that the senator has long been against.\n\nIt's another key test of loyalty for a man trying to take advantage of one more opportunity, someone who has always tried to burn as few bridges behind him as he can - though his relationship with Haley has certainly suffered.\n\nBut holding a grudge is not Scott's style, at least not publicly.\n\nAt another February rally in South Carolina, Trump rattled off criticism of Haley, who had become more forceful in her criticism of him. Then Trump motioned toward Scott standing behind him.\n\n\"She actually appointed you, Tim,\" Trump said. \"You must really hate her.\"\n\nThe senator was not having it. Awkwardly, he stepped toward the microphone, then said simply: \"I just love you.\"\n\n__\n\nThis story was first published on June 30, 2024. It was updated on July 1, 2024, to correct that South Carolina Rep. Bill Taylor is a state representative, not a state senator."

In an exclusive interview with Queen City News, Senator Scott explained his opposition to the proposed rule.\n\nScott's position has drawn sharp criticism from those who argue that the rule is crucial for protecting consumers, particularly those who live paycheck to paycheck. The debate continues to intensify as Congress remains divided on how to proceed with the regulation.\n\nAs discussions about overdraft fees continue, another major issue is also taking shape in Washington: the federal budget. House Republicans recently pushed through a multi-trillion-dollar budget plan, passing it by slim margins. The bill passed largely along party lines, with just one Republican joining Democrats in opposition. Now, all eyes are on the Senate, where the debate over the budget, and its massive tax cuts, is set to unfold.\n\nSenator Scott, who is playing a key role in the budget negotiations, shared his thoughts on the proposed legislation, with the plan including a hefty $4 trillion in tax cuts.\n\nAs the first African American to chair a standing committee in the U.S. Senate and the longest-serving Black senator, Scott has made history. He is also the first African American ever to serve in both chambers of Congress, a testament to his influence in the political landscape.\n\nFurthermore, he serves as the current co-chair of the historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU) caucus, working to increase funding and support for these institutions.\n\nAs the battle over the overdraft fee cap and the budget plan intensifies, all eyes are on the Senate. With major political and financial decisions on the line, Senator Scott is expected to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of U.S. financial regulation and fiscal policy.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Tim Scott (R-SC) speaks during a campaign rally for Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump at the Grappone Convention Center on Jan. 19, 2024 in Concord, New Hampshire. (File/Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nU.S. Sen. Tim Scott is reportedly on Donald Trump's short list of candidates to join his ticket, raising the question of who would replace South Carolina's junior senator - and how.\n\nScott has been considered a potential running mate for Trump since he dropped out in November , when the GOP presidential field was still crowded. But speculation really ramped up after Scott's on-stage endorsement of Trump two months later. Scott's been such an enthusiastic supporter, Trump has said the senator's a better campaigner for him than Scott was for himself.\n\n\"He did well (in the primary), but he wasn't as forceful as he is, because he doesn't want to talk about himself. So interesting,\" Trump said at a rally in North Charleston in February.\n\nSpeculation may end Thursday night.\n\nTrump has teased that he \"most likely\" would announce his pick for vice president during his televised debate with President Joe Biden in Atlanta.\n\nIf Trump chooses Scott, and their ticket wins in November, South Carolina's next U.S. senator would take office the same way Scott did in 2013.\n\nBy state law, the governor replaces any U.S. senator who leaves office before the term ends. The interim appointment lasts through the next general election, considered a special election for the Senate seat, according to the state Elections Commission.\n\nIn December 2012, then-Gov. Nikki Haley appointed Scott to replace U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint of Greenville, who resigned two years into his six-year term to lead the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.\n\nScott had just won re-election to the coastal 1st Congressional District. But instead of starting a second term in the U.S. House, the former Charleston County Council chairman was sworn in to the U.S. Senate in January 2013, becoming the South's first Black Republican senator since Reconstruction.\n\nKeeping the seat required going through the regular election process in 2014. Scott won the GOP primary that June by an 80-percentage-point landslide, then beat his Democratic challenger by 24 points that November to fulfill the rest of DeMint's term.\n\nScott then trounced his competition in 2016 to win his first full term. He had another easy win in 2022 for a Senate race he's said was his last.\n\nIf Scott leaves the U.S. Senate after November - similarly two years into a six-year term - Gov. Henry McMaster would appoint his replacement.\n\nSouth Carolina is one of 37 states that uses a gubernatorial appointment to fill Senate vacancies until a general election. Of those, 10 require the governor to appoint an interim of the same political party as the departing senator, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nSouth Carolina does not mandate that parties match. However, it's a given that McMaster, a former state Republican Party chairman, would appoint a Republican.\n\nIn this hypothetical scenario, should McMaster's appointee want to stay in the Senate, the interim would face a potential primary and general election in 2026 to serve out the remainder of Scott's term through 2028.\n\nMcMaster had no comment on whether he had any candidates in mind to replace Scott.\n\n\"It would be premature at this point to make plans,\" McMaster spokesman Brandon Charochak said Wednesday.\n\nA spokesperson for Scott declined to comment.\n\nIt is possible for governors to take a Senate seat for themselve s when a vacancy occurs. But voters generally don't look kindly on that.\n\nIt's happened only once in South Carolina.\n\nIn April 1965, then-Gov. Donald Russell resigned following the death of U.S. Sen. Olin Johnston, allowing Russell's lieutenant governor to ascend to governor and appoint him to the empty Senate seat.\n\nBut Russell didn't stay in the Senate long.\n\nHe was ousted from the seat by Fritz Hollings in the 1966 Democratic primary. Hollings not only fulfilled the rest of Johnston's term but remained South Carolina's senator for 38 years, making him the eighth longest-serving U.S. senator in history as of his death in 2019 . (When Hollings retired in 2004, voters elected DeMint to replace him.)\n\nThe post Tim Scott is on Trump's VP short list. What happens if he leaves the Senate? appeared first on SC Daily Gazette ."

Tim Scott (R-S.C.) officially rolled out his bid to run the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) on Friday, a move that would put him at the helm of the party's midterm efforts to maintain and possibly grow its majority next cycle.\n\nScott had been mulling a run for the post since mid-October. He is currently the only person in the race for the post.\n\n\"Let's do this! I'm running for NRSC Chair because two years of a Republican agenda is good, but four years of success under Donald J. Trump is even better,\" the former 2024 presidential hopeful said in a statement.\n\n\"That means the entire four years of his presidency will create low inflation, secure borders and safe streets, leading to a generation of American prosperity!\" he said. \"With Donald J.

Tim Scott of South Carolina joins growing GOP primary field dominated by former President Donald Trump. He brings a hefty campaign war chest.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated May 22, 2023, 4:48 p.m. ET | North Charleston, S.C.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott launched his presidential campaign on Monday, offering an optimistic message that his campaign hopes will contrast with the political combativeness that former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have used to dominate the early GOP primary field.\n\nThe Senate's only Black Republican, Mr. Scott kicked off the campaign in his hometown of North Charleston, on the campus of Charleston Southern University, his alma mater and a private school affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention. He repeatedly mentioned his Christian faith in his speech, saying, \"Amen! Amen! Amen!\" and at several points elicited responses from the crowd, who sometimes chanted his name.\n\nBut Mr. Scott also offered a stark political choice, saying \"our party and our nation are standing at a time for choosing: Victimhood or victory,\" adding that Republicans will have to decide between \"Grievance or greatness?\"\n\nHe went on: \"We need a president who persuades not just our friends and our base\" but seeks \"commonsense\" solutions and displays \"compassion for people who don't agree with us.\"\n\nThat was a contrast with Mr. Trump, who has played to the GOP's most loyal supporters with false claims about widespread fraud during the 2020 presidential election. Governor DeSantis, meanwhile, has pushed Florida to the right by championing contentious new restrictions on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, and by picking a fight with Disney, one of his state's most powerful business interests.\n\nMr. Scott planned to huddle with home-state donors and then begin a two-day campaign swing through Iowa and New Hampshire, which go first in GOP presidential primary voting.\n\nHis announcement event featured an opening prayer by Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, who said, \"I think our country is ready to be inspired again.\" Republican Sen. Mike Rounds, South Dakota's other senator, has already announced his support for Mr. Scott.\n\nOther high-profile GOP senators have already backed Mr. Trump's third bid for the White House, including Mr. Scott's South Carolina colleague, Lindsey Graham. Mr. Trump nonetheless struck a conciliatory tone, welcoming Mr. Scott to the race in an online post Monday and noting that the pair worked together on his administration's signature tax cuts.\n\nA source of strength for Mr. Scott will be his campaign bank account. He enters the 2024 race with more cash on hand than any other presidential candidate in U.S. history, with $22 million left in his campaign account at the end of his 2022 campaign that he can transfer to his presidential coffers.\n\nMr. Scott also won reelection in firmly Republican South Carolina - which has an early slot on the GOP presidential primary calendar - by more than 20 points last November. Advisers bet that can make Mr. Scott a serious contender for an early, momentum-generating win.\n\nBut Mr. Scott is not the only South Carolinian in the race. The state's former governor, Nikki Haley, who also once served as Mr. Trump's former United Nations ambassador, is also running.\n\nBen LeVan, a business professor at Charleston Southern who attended Monday's event, said he hadn't decided whom to support in the GOP primary but didn't plan to back Mr. Trump.\n\n\"I really do hope that we can bring some civility back in politics,\" Mr. LeVan said. \"That's one of the nice things about Tim Scott, and quite frankly, Nikki Haley, and some of the other candidates as well. They're more diplomatic, and that is something that I appreciate.\"\n\nLike others in the GOP race, including former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and \"Woke, Inc.\" author Vivek Ramaswamy, Mr. Scott's initial task will be finding a way to stand out in a field led by Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis, the latter of whom is expected to announce his own bid as early as this week.\n\nOne way Mr. Scott hopes to do that is through a sense of optimism. Mr. Scott often quotes Scripture at his campaign events, weaving his reliance on spiritual guidance into his speeches. He called his travels before the campaign's official launch the \"Faith in America\" listening tour.\n\nMr. Scott said Monday that America's promise means \"you can go as high as our character, our grit, and our talent will take you.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Committee responded to Mr. Scott's announcement by dismissing the notion that Mr. Scott offers much of an alternative to Mr. Trump's policies. DNC chair Jaime Harrison, who ran unsuccessfully for Senate in South Carolina in 2020, released a statement calling the senator \"a fierce advocate of the MAGA agenda,\" a reference to the former president's \"Make America Great Again\" movement.\n\nOn many issues, Mr. Scott does indeed align with the more conservative wing of his party. He wants to reduce government spending and restrict abortion, saying he would sign a federal law to prohibit abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy if elected president.\n\nBut Mr. Scott has pushed the GOP on some policing overhaul measures since the killing of George Floyd, and he has occasionally criticized Mr. Trump's response to racial tensions. Throughout their disagreements, though, Mr. Scott has maintained a generally cordial relationship with Mr. Trump, saying in his book that the former president \"listened intently\" to his viewpoints on race-related issues.\n\nWhen he was appointed to the Senate by then-Governor Haley in 2012, Mr. Scott became the first Black senator from the South since just after the Civil War. Winning a 2014 special election to serve out the remainder of his term made him the first Black candidate to win a statewide race in South Carolina since the Reconstruction era.\n\nHe has said his current term in the Senate, which runs through 2029, would be his last.\n\nMr. Scott has long rejected the notion that America is inherently racist. He's also routinely repudiated the teaching of critical race theory, an academic framework that presents the idea that the nation's institutions maintain the dominance of white people.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He's also Black and willing to talk about race - something national GOP leadership often downplays. Will Mr. Scott use his perch to deliver a strong message after Mr. Biden's address to Congress?\n\nLoading...\n\nApril 28, 2021, 12:44 p.m. ET | Washington\n\nTim Scott, the only Black Republican senator, is often happy to dart past Capitol Hill reporters without saying much. This time, he and the spotlight have found each other.\n\nBrought up by a single mother who worked back-breaking hours as a nursing assistant, Mr. Scott has spent a decade in Congress representing South Carolina. Now, the lawmaker who combines a willingness to address racial questions with advocacy of conservative causes is giving his party's nationally televised response to President Joe Biden's Wednesday night address to Congress.\n\nHe's also the lead GOP negotiator as the two parties seek an accord on legislation overhauling police procedures. The issue has long eluded compromise despite national attention fanned by last year's killing of George Floyd and this month's conviction of a former Minneapolis police officer in his slaying.\n\n\"You figure out who your audience is, you figure out what you want to say, and you try and find a way to say it well,\" Mr. Scott told reporters Tuesday about his speech preparations. \"And you lean into who you are.\"\n\nGOP leaders' choice of Mr. Scott to answer Mr. Biden comes at a fraught political moment.\n\nDemands for social justice are reverberating as killings of Black people by white police officers continue. Following years of nativist appeals by former President Donald Trump and others, some out-of-power Republicans say the party should try to broaden its appeal before 2022 elections that they hope will deliver them control of Congress.\n\nMr. Scott, among only 11 Black senators in history, has used riveting Senate speeches to detail his own distressing encounters with the law. He's described being pulled over 18 times while driving since 2000, and being halted by a United States Capitol security officer who didn't recognize him as recently as 2019, despite wearing a senator's lapel pin.\n\n\"While I thank God I have not endured bodily harm, I have, however, felt the pressure applied by the scales of justice when they are slanted,\" he said during a 2016 Senate speech. \"I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself.\"\n\nDays before Democrats derailed a GOP policing overhaul effort he led last June, Mr. Scott bristled over one opponent who'd derided the measure as a \"token, halfhearted approach.\"\n\n\"On the other side, they are wanting to race bait on tokenism,\" he fumed. No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Dick Durbin of Illinois quickly apologized for the remark.\n\nMr. Scott, from North Charleston, South Carolina, nearly dropped out of high school. He tells of a life-changing turnabout after befriending a businessman who became a mentor who stressed the value of hard work.\n\nAfter graduating college, he entered the insurance and real estate businesses and was elected to the Charleston County Council. He was a co-chairman of the 1996 reelection campaign of Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., an overt segregationist decades earlier. When Mr. Scott was elected to the House in 2010, his closest GOP primary rival was Mr. Thurmond's son Paul.\n\nGov. Nikki Haley appointed Mr. Scott to the Senate in 2013 when Sen. Jim DeMint resigned. Mr. Scott was easily elected to complete Mr. DeMint's term in 2014 and to his own six-year term in 2016, and is a favorite for reelection next year.\n\nMr. Scott's background and willingness to discuss racial disparities, a subject infrequently emphasized by the GOP, made him a natural choice for Wednesday's speech.\n\n\"He's got a great personal story,\" said No. 2 Senate GOP leader John Thune, of South Dakota. \"He's very articulate at laying out kind of the Republican message, principles, agenda. I think he's a great voice for our party.\"\n\n\"I've never been stopped from driving while Black. He has multiple times,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. \"And he's sort of opened my eyes to some of the lack of trust\" between minority communities and law enforcement.\n\nMr. Scott joined Governor Haley in 2015 when she announced the removal of the Confederate flag from the State House following the 2015 Charleston church massacre, a decision that infuriated some conservatives. A white supremacist killed nine Black parishioners in that shooting.\n\nMr. Scott spoke out occasionally against some of Mr. Trump's racially offensive remarks and actions. He said the president's \"moral authority\" was compromised when Mr. Trump described \"very fine people on both sides\" after violence erupted between neo-Nazis and counter-demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.\n\nBut some Democrats say he doesn't nearly use his unique perch in the GOP often or vigorously enough.\n\n\"It's one thing to speak out on issues of race,\" said Antjuan Seawright, a South Carolina-based Democratic consultant. \"But when you have the opportunity to do something about it, I think that you should take advantage of that, particularly when you are at the table.\"\n\nMr. Seawright also said GOP leaders \"seem to come to\" Mr. Scott when racial issues arise. \"A Black man from the South. So you get those three things, that's like a political trifecta for Republicans.\"\n\nNo. 3 House Democratic leader James Clyburn of South Carolina told reporters last fall that Mr. Scott and the House's one Black Republican at the time \"sounds like tokenism.\"\n\nBut Tuesday, Mr. Clyburn told reporters that Mr. Scott's selection to deliver the GOP response was a compliment and was good for their state, \"irrespective of whether or not I agree with him.\"\n\nMr. Scott has long championed vintage conservative ideas like tax breaks for companies investing in poor communities and federal aid that families could use for private schools. He has a solidly conservative voting record, backing Trump's Supreme Court nominees and the failed drive to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law.\n\nNow, he's in the middle of talks on legislation revamping police procedures that have drawn intense public attention. The House approved a Democratic package in March ending protections individual police officers have against civil lawsuits, which Republicans are resisting.\n\nBoth sides express optimism that they can resolve disputes soon. \"History has its eyes on this moment,\" one negotiator, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., told reporters.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Tim Scott's vivid socks stand out in a sea of black and gray on Capitol Hill, and so do his views on police reform.\n\nAs the Senate's sole Black Republican, he has addressed incredulity about the prevalence of police discrimination, detailing his own experiences from the Senate floor - including being held up by police on Capitol Hill, where senators normally move freely through security checkpoints without showing ID.\n\nYet he also sees law enforcement as a \"noble\" profession. That's shaped in part by having watched the sons of his influential youth mentor, a white Chick-fil-A operator, become police officers. And as someone raised by a single mother, whose safety he worried about as she would return home late at night from work, Senator Scott places a premium on safeguarding communities. He opposes defunding the police, taking particular issue with liberal activists who didn't grow up in poor minority communities like his.\n\nWhat would police reform look like to a supporter of the police who has also experienced the sting of discrimination? For Sen. Tim Scott, it starts with not stereotyping anyone, including cops.\n\nThe senator from South Carolina, the grandson of an illiterate cotton picker who in 2014 became the first African American elected from the South to the U.S. Senate, has been frank about racial issues. He called out former President Donald Trump on numerous occasions - and won his support for spurring $75 billion worth of investment in low-income \" opportunity zones .\" Yet he has also decried the political weaponization of race and declared that America is not a racist country, prompting critics to call him an \"Uncle Tim\" or \"house Negro.\"\n\nLast year, Senate Democrats blocked his police reform bill in the wake of George Floyd's murder, saying it didn't go far enough. In recent months, Senator Scott and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, a Democrat, have been working on new police reform legislation. They agreed to a framework for police reform in June, together with Democratic Rep. Karen Bass, who spearheaded passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in the House earlier this year. The senators are still chipping away at the details of their bill .\n\nSenator Scott sat down with the Monitor in hot pink socks to discuss his vision for police reform and justice in America at a time of national reckoning - or, as he puts it, a national \"wave of opportunity.\"\n\nThe questions and answers that follow have been condensed, and lightly edited for clarity.\n\nWhat has given you empathy for police officers?\n\nThis really is not only a noble profession when done right; it's also a mission.\n\nWhen I was a senior in high school, I fell asleep driving my car down Interstate 26, flipped over, and went through the windshield. I remember lying on the side of the road, and a highway patrolman walked up to me to give me a little comfort and tell me things were going to be OK. That sticks in my mind - the power of an officer's ability to do good, to show empathy in really hard times.\n\nAnd then I'm also educated and informed by the number of traffic stops I've been involved in where I'm just driving while Black. So, I have to weigh all that information through a filter of honesty and try to come up with solutions that address the issue fairly.\n\nOn a personal level, how have you worked through the anger and humiliation that many would feel in the face of police discrimination, in a way that doesn't seem to have tainted your view of America?\n\nWhat I shared on the [Senate] floor was a lifetime of really bad experiences. And at the same time I think having perspective about it all is really important. I don't know that you can actually just put your sense of humiliation and disrespect in a corner and it doesn't filter in. ... But you can have some really negative interactions and come to the conclusion that stereotyping them all is kind of like them stereotyping me.\n\nI remember talking at the National Action Network run by Rev. [Al] Sharpton about being followed around a clothing store by this young lady. I have good peripheral vision because I used to be a running back, and I see her coming and I thought she was maybe someone who wanted to take a picture. (I was a senator at this time.) She was actually just making sure I wasn't stealing anything.\n\nI said, \"How many of y'all understand that?\" They were all frustrated; you could feel the temperature going up. I said, \"That's exactly how a Republican feels when you walk into a room like this, because everybody's stereotyping,\" and they were like, \"Oh, you got us.\"\n\nWe should all understand the sting of being stereotyped. So if I don't want to stereotype, if I don't want Black people to be stereotyped, and if I don't want Republicans to be stereotyped, why would I stereotype all cops? It's just unhelpful.\n\nHow do you think we as a country can achieve real justice, and do forgiveness and reconciliation play a role?\n\nIt's a good question. I will say that you cannot wait until you have justice to have forgiveness. I think about Charleston's Mother Emanuel church shooting [in 2015] - 36 hours later, there was no justice ... but those nine family representatives all said [to the shooter], \"We forgive you.\"\n\nThe path to justice does require reconciliation, but not one party to the other, but within one's own heart.\n\nThe justice system that we have here in America becoming more fair is really important. And that means being able to have self-awareness as a country. George Floyd brought that to us in a way that nothing else has in my lifetime. You heard and felt and sensed that people understood that the inconsistent application of our justice system leads to real dysfunction amongst our people.\n\nIn your book \"Opportunity Knocks,\" you talk about wanting to positively impact a billion people with a message of hope and opportunity. That's obviously far more people than live in the United States. Do you see your work on police reform as helping not only our American family, as you call it, but also our global family?\n\nForgive me for being naive, but I do think who we are as Americans sets the pace for the rest of the world. I want to make sure that we export the best of who we are, for the rest of the world to see, and that includes our justice system.\n\nWhat does it say when you can measure the outcomes by the color of your skin? It says something bad, or at least insidious.\n\nTo the extent that we're able to improve the overall effectiveness of our justice system is to improve the overall fairness of our justice system. I feel like I'm called to that.\n\nI want a fair justice system, but not one that seeks to discriminate against somebody else for the discrimination of the past. ... That's not fair either.\n\nSpeaking of feeling called, you considered going into the ministry at least twice, yet felt led to stick with politics. At this time of national reckoning, do you see yourself as ministering to a need for healing in our country?\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nI hope so. I have been intentional about that part. ... I want to be a bridge builder among the races. I've always felt that was part of my calling as well.\n\nFrom my vantage point, healing is an individual thing, more than a group thing. I do think sometimes we want an apology, especially on the racial front, for healing to begin. I think that's probably not as helpful as we think it is. I think what's helpful is for us to change the future, not the past.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

As a Republican African-American, Scott is a historic choice - and one likely to please the tea party.\n\nLoading...\n\nDec. 17, 2012, 3:10 p.m. ET | Washington\n\nRep. Tim Scott (R) of South Carolina continued his rapid political ascent Monday, with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley elevating the first-term congressman to a seat in the US Senate .\n\nIn taking the post, Representative Scott is set to become the first African-American Republican to serve in the US Senate since 1978 - and only the third since 1881.\n\nHe will have big shoes to fill within the conservative movement. Scott shared the stage at the state capitol in Charleston Monday with the man he will replace in January, Sen. Jim DeMint (R) , who is leaving the Senate to head the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank. In his seven years in the Senate, Mr. DeMint arguably did more than any other elected official to establish the tea party on Capitol Hill by stumping (and fundraising) for deeply conservative politicians across the country.\n\nConservatives are optimistic that Scott will continue to carry that standard.\n\n\"Congressman Scott is a fighter for limited government and pro-growth policies in Washington , and we can't wait to see him in the Senate,\" said Chris Chocola , president of the fiscally conservative Club for Growth , a group that supported Scott from his GOP primary days.\n\nOn Monday, Scott sounded a confident note.\n\n\"Our nation finds itself in a situation where we need some backbone,\" Scott said. \"We need to make very difficult decisions.\"\n\nScott would have been the only African-American Republican in the House in 2013. Two years ago, he defeated the son of former Sen. Strom Thurmond (R) of South Carolina - the man who lead the Republican Party's resistance to integration - in a Republican primary for his staunchly conservative district including north Charleston and Myrtle Beach .\n\nUpon landing in the House, he was immediately raised into party leadership, where he helped House leaders work the rank-and-file on tough votes as a deputy whip. But he kept to his principles on key issues, such as raising the debt ceiling (he voted against it). His voting record provided evidence that his DeMint-esque rhetoric about taxing and spending was no joke.\n\nScott achieved a 92 percent score on the Club for Growth's legislative scorecard, which meant that he was more conservative than all but 30 members of the House.\n\nAs soon as DeMint announced earlier this month that he would retire from the Senate, speculation centered on Scott as the likely heir apparent.\n\n\"I could not be happier today,\" DeMint said, \"I can walk away from the Senate knowing that someone is in this seat that is better than I am, that will carry that voice of opportunity conservatism to the whole country in a way I couldn't do.\"\n\nScott will serve until a special election in 2014, and said he would likely serve a maximum of two terms after that. Governor Haley, also a Republican, expressed \"no doubt\" that Scott would win his reelection in 2014.\n\nAnd it was Haley - herself the daughter of Indian immigrants - who took up the question of Scott's race most directly. She argued that the lesson of Scott's appointment for the Republican Party at large is \"the answer to winning elections is never about the messenger, it's never about what the messenger looks like... it's about the message.\"\n\nIn that regard, Haley said, \"Congressman Scott earned this seat for the person that he is, he earned this seat for the results he has shown, he has earned this seat for what I know he is going to do by making South Carolina and this country proud.\"\n\nScott joked that he would be putting many more miles on his car traversing the state to introduce himself to his new constituents ahead of his 2014 election campaign.\n\nHe won't be the only South Carolina senator doing so. By Scott's side throughout his remarks was South Carolina's senior senator, Lindsey Graham , a man whose pursuit of compromise on issues including taxes and immigration has made him a potential target for a primary challenge from the right in 2014.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nGraham exchanged kind words with all the South Carolina notables and most of the state's congressional delegation, several of whom are rumored to be mulling a run against Graham, and offered up some advice to his soon-to-be colleague.\n\n\"You got here by being Tim Scott - not Lindsay Graham, not Jim DeMint,\" Senator Graham said. \"You have a unique opportunity for the conservative cause. You have unique burdens.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in\n\nMonitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in.

But a few miles away from where the Greene saga is playing out, Tim Scott is still battling in relative obscurity for his goal: To become the first black Republican in Congress since Oklahoma 's J.C. Watts declined to run for reelection in 2002.\n\nRaised by a single mother who he says taught him the value of small government, Mr. Scott represents the other side of the coin when it comes to racial stereotypes in the new South.\n\nIn the past, South Carolina politicians have sought to exploit race, most notably paying for blacks to run for office as a way to help white candidates. The theory was that white voters didn't want black politicians, so having a black candidate in the field would send white voters flocking to the polls to support \"their\" candidate. Some commentators have gone so far as to suggest that might have happened in Mr. Greene's candidacy.\n\nBut Scott's ascendancy suggests a different dynamic. He's a small-government candidate who is winning votes based on his ideas, regardless of his race. What's more, he's ahead of the scion of one of South Carolina's most august white politicians, the late Sen. Strom Thurmond, in a GOP runoff primary scheduled for June 22.\n\nMoreover, a record 32 black Republicans are running national campaigns this year - a development that is shaking up stereotypes about not only the GOP, but the \"tea party\" movement, which has been widely criticized as racially exclusive.\n\nSo is the racial backdrop of Greene's candidacy the reality of Southern politics? Or has it become the place where Scott can potentially enter Congress representing the viewpoints of the \"tea party\" movement: smaller government and more personal freedom?\n\nThe answer is most likely a bit of both as one considers the complex - and often misunderstood - attitudes about race in the South, where most black Americans live.\n\n\"For a lot of people who think that these elections are racially motivated, you have Alvin Greene on the one hand which probably was [racially motivated], and then you've got [the Tim Scott campaign] which shows a bright future,\" says Dave Woodard , a Clemson University political scientist and author of \"The New Southern Politics.\" \"Scott ran his campaign on principles, on policy, he was a bright, articulate, good-looking guy. So if you were racially motivated, you would still be attracted to him ... because he has a lot of things a candidate needs to have.\"\n\nFraught with symbolism, the Scott campaign could have been a bold statement on race: the up-and-comer taking on the system in a state represented in the US Senate for 47 years by Strom Thurmond - a staunch segregationist, who in later years framed his racial views around the argument of states rights.\n\nThurmond's legacy had modern political costs: In 2003, former Sen. Trent Lott (R) of Mississippi was forced to resign as Senate minority leader after praising Thurmond's presidential campaign representing the segregationist Dixiecrat Party . In his personal life, Strom Thurmond embodied the South's complicated history of race relations; he fathered a child with one of his household's black maids, Carrie Butler.\n\nBut so far, both Scott and his opponent, Paul Thurmond have ignored the campaign's historic racial context.\n\nBoth are running bedrock Republican campaigns geared at the center-right South Carolina voter.\n\nA former prosecutor, Thurmond, who currently sits on the Charleston County Council , says his father taught him that \"public service is a sacred trust ,\" writes Business Week's Patrick O'Connor . Third-place finisher Carroll Campbell III, the son of a former South Carolina governor, painted himself as the \"tea party\" candidate, and has since his defeat endorsed Thurmond. Both Scott and Thurmond promise to work to repeal President Obama 's health care bill.\n\nStill regularly lampooned by shows like \" Family Guy \" as coon hunters and Jim Crow apologists living in kudzu-draped villages, Southern voters are prickly about racial stereotypes and could see Scott as a way to explode those viewpoints.\n\nMore likely, says professor Woodard, ideals are simply trumping race as conservative voters look for someone to wield their anger against Washington . In an anti-incumbent year, having a name like Thurmond - added to the fact of being young and largely political unproven - may not help his opponent. And Woodard says that Scott's willingness to buck black orthodoxy (95 percent of African-Americans voted for Obama) has also helped him make a his case as an independent thinker.\n\n\"This race is really more important, because Tim Scott is going to win and Alvin Greene is not,\" says Woodard. \"His message connected this year where people wanted someone to stand up and say, 'We're mad as hell and we're not going to take it anymore.' \"\n\nScott campaign manager Chris McClure says Scott represents \"tea party\" ideals. Scott won 32 percent of the primary vote; Thurmond got 16 percent.\n\nScott frames his candidacy as a return to the Founders' vision of a country where mandates like federal health care reform go against the intent of the constitution.\n\n\"This race is about the size of the federal government, eliminating that size and getting us closer to the constitutional mandate of a smaller, less intrusive government,\" says Mr. Scott in a phone interview with the Monitor. \"We have strayed so far away from those enumerated powers that we don't even know what they look like anymore.\"\n\nOn his campaign website, he addresses his political milestones as a black politician in the South - he's the first and only black Republican to be elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives since Reconstruction. But Scott has downplayed the race angle on the stump.\n\n\"South Carolinians want someone who represents values more than someone who represents their face, their complexion,\" he says. \"We're succeeding because we're keeping it on the issues. We don't talk about things that we can't control.\"\n\nRelated:\n\nThe curious case of Alvin Greene, surprise Senate candidate\n\nNikki Haley: Fresh face for South Carolina or more of the same?\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Nikki Haley (R) to replace two-term Republican Sen. Jim DeMint , an early leader of the tea party movement who resigned in December to head the conservative Heritage Foundation , Scott will continue to champion his predecessor's tea party principles.\n\n\"I can walk away from the Senate knowing that someone is in this seat that is better than I am that will carry the voice of opportunity conservatism to the whole country in a way that I couldn't do,\" Mr. DeMint said at a press conference .\n\nScott comes to the Senate after a brief tenure in the House. He was elected in 2010 on a wave of tea party support. During his time in the House, he led antiunion legislation, attacking the National Labor Relations Board . Governor Haley commended his antilabor agenda during his appointment announcement, saying his support helped save a Boeing plant in South Carolina, which is a right-to-work state.\n\nHe doesn't compromise his conservative ideals, even amid pressure from congressional leadership.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm not much of a compromiser,\" he told the National Journal , referring to his refusal in 2011 to vote for raising the debt ceiling, despite a request that he do so from House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio.\n\nScott started his political career in 1995 when he was elected to Charleston 's city council. In 1996, he was the campaign co-chairman for the late Sen. Strom Thurmond in his last election. In 2008, he became the only black Republican in South Carolina's Statehouse. Scott defeated Senator Thurmond's son, Paul, in his 2010 congressional bid. He rose quickly in the House ranks as one of the two freshmen selected for the Elected Leadership Committee, and he was asked to serve as Deputy Whip.\n\n\"Our nation finds itself in a situation where we need some backbone,\" Scott said during his appointment press conference. \"We need to make very difficult decisions.\"\n\nRepublican Senate leaders assigned Scott to five committees: Commerce, Science, and Transportation; Energy and Natural Resources; Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions; Aging; and Small Business.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Tim Scott, the lone Black Republican senator, faces a twofold challenge: Unite his party behind police reform legislation, and convince the Black community that he's not being used by the GOP.\n\nLoading...\n\nJune 11, 2020, 11:45 a.m. ET | Washington\n\nThe Republican Party is looking for an answer on how to respond to national outrage over the police killing of George Floyd. And they are looking to Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina to provide it.\n\nThe question is whether Mr. Scott, the lone Black GOP senator, will be able to pull Republicans behind legislation in the roiling aftermath of Mr. Floyd's death. That challenge is steep enough in a mostly white party led by self-proclaimed \"law and order\" President Donald Trump. But Mr. Scott also is batting back at members of the Black community accusing him of allowing Republicans to use him in an election year to right racial wrongs.\n\nMr. Scott, who has kept lines of communication open with Mr. Trump even after the president called white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, \"good people,\" is asking critics: Who better?\n\n\"Not surprising the last 24 hours have seen a lot of 'token' 'boy' or 'you're being used' in my mentions,\" Mr. Scott tweeted Wednesday. \"Let me get this straight ... you DON'T want the person who has faced racial profiling by police, been pulled over dozens of times, or been speaking out for YEARS drafting this?\"\n\nMr. Floyd's killing at the hands of Minneapolis police sparked painful upheaval and protests against systemic racism in the United States. But it also posed a stark test for the white Republicans who control the Senate. As Mr. Floyd's funeral was held in Houston on Tuesday, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell struck a new tone and acknowledged that almost all Senate Republicans, unlike Democrats, are white.\n\n\"None of us have had the experience of being an African American in this country and dealing with this discrimination,\" Mr. McConnell, who is up for reelection alongside Mr. Trump, told reporters. \"I think the best way for the Senate Republicans to go forward on this is to listen to one of our own, who's had these experiences.\"\n\nMr. McConnell spoke after Mr. Scott finished briefing Senate Republicans on the legislation, which in part would establish a national database for police misconduct. Mr. Floyd's brother, Philonise, challenged Congress on Wednesday to \"stop the pain\" with police reforms. Mr. Scott said he was talking with the White House, but not Mr. Trump so far, to agree on a package of legislation.\n\nThe former House member describes himself as \"the son of a son of a son of a slave,\" a descendant of a West African family who arrived in the U.S. aboard a slave ship, probably in Charleston, South Carolina, two centuries ago.\n\n\"For all of my life and for all of my family's heritage, we had tried to avoid being confrontational,\" Mr. Scott writes in \"Opportunity Knocks: How Hard Work, Community and Business Can Improve Lives and End Poverty.\" \"Always, we believed, the primary aim should be to find common ground in order to move forward.\"\n\nIn September 2017, Mr. Trump summoned the senator to the Oval Office to discuss Mr. Scott's criticism of the president's response to the race riots in Charlottesville, Virginia - notably, Mr. Trump's description of the white supremacists involved as being among the \"very fine people on both sides.\" Mr. Scott writes that the president was gracious - and that he walked out with the president's commitment to opportunity zones for poverty-stricken cities. The proposal passed as part of the tax cut bill signed into law that year.\n\nThe police killings of Mr. Floyd, Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, and others have made problems with police conduct and accountability hard for Republicans to ignore. Mr. Scott's legislation is part of a burst of GOP-written bills on the subject. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky wants to stop sending surplus U.S. military equipment to local law enforcement. And Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah is backing several bipartisan bills to change police practices.\n\nBut the challenge is different for Mr. Scott, in part because of the trust issues between the Black community, the Republican Party, and Mr. McConnell. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., said in a telephone interview that Mr. Scott will have succeeded if he \"produces a good product.\"\n\n\"I think that Tim has the background, he has the experiences that are necessary to bring Republican senators to the realization that this law enforcement issue is real and needs to be dealt with,\" Mr. Clyburn said in a telephone interview. \"I would hope that he would engage with enough of the other members to make sure that whatever he comes up with will have buy-in from others in his conference.\"\n\nThere are signs that they're listening. GOP senators, who risk losing control of the chamber in the November election, are distancing themselves from Mr. Trump's provocative response as the Black Lives Matter movement gains support.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said Mr. Scott had told their Bible study group that he'd been stopped by police in Charleston multiple times, even as a public official, for being Black at the wrong place and the wrong time.\n\n\"During these last few days I've been thinking a lot about what Tim Scott told us,\" Mr. Alexander said on the Senate floor. \"One result of George Floyd's killing is that Black Americans are telling more stories like Tim Scott's.\"\n\nAt the political intersection, Mr. Scott on Wednesday addressed his critics in the Black community who chafed at his role.\n\n\"Don't throw 'you're the only black guy they know' at me either,\" Mr. Scott tweeted. He's one of three Black members of the Senate, he noted, the others being Democrats Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California. \"Stop pretending there's some huge racial diversity gap in the Senate.\"\n\nIt is true, though, that the GOP's constituency and Mr. Trump's base of support are overwhelmingly white. And though Mr. Trump insists he's done more for Black Americans than any other president, his rhetoric often carries racial overtones. Last year, Mr. Trump tweeted that four female House members of color, known as the \"squad,\" should \"go back\" to where they came from. All four are American citizens.\n\nMr. Scott on Wednesday called himself an optimist.\n\n\"History is a teacher,\" he said. \"The president has been receptive the last three years on the priorities that I've brought to him,\" he added. \"Hopefully he'll have the same approach.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

So there she was, wearing a fluorescent vest and waiting at the foot of the stairs to a plane, when a former law firm colleague handed over her bag. The woman didn't even recognize Ms. DeCasper.\n\n\"Dulles was probably my greatest job, because it taught me the most in terms of humility, in terms of the way you treat people, the way you see people,\" says Ms. DeCasper, who a year later landed a position with GOP lawmaker Tim Scott of South Carolina, and is today the senator's right-hand woman. \"I truly think that Dulles was necessary for me to be who I am today as the chief of staff.\"\n\nMany argue that staffing Capitol Hill with people from a wider array of backgrounds could help address one of the biggest critiques about Washington - that it's elitist and out of touch with average Americans.\n\nMs. DeCasper brings a different worldview to an institution traditionally staffed by upper-class graduates of elite universities. She was born to a teenage mother in Lincoln, Nebraska, and her dad worked as a garbageman.\n\nWhen she first came to Capitol Hill, it was as a graduate of what is now Colorado Mesa University in Montrose. When she returned to Washington, she had a University of Michigan law degree but was a single mother working a blue-collar job. Now, among the Senate's 100 chiefs of staff, she is likely the only former luggage handler - and one of only two who are Black.\n\nAmid a growing movement to broaden the ranks of congressional staffers, Ms. DeCasper stands out not only for who she is, but also for how she cultivates diversity. While many offices hire from within their own networks, she looks outside the usual Capitol Hill circles, searching for people with interesting life stories, a sense of purpose and passion, and the integrity her father exemplified in his work.\n\n\"I want somebody that has a heart for this place,\" she says. Like the lawyer whose experience living in his car due to financial challenges gave him a different perspective on banking and housing issues. Or the female Marine from Puerto Rico who had the backbone to deal with the press. Or the Black man using a wheelchair who had a desire to make \"an outsized contribution\" but had zero Hill experience.\n\nShe hired them all, helping Senator Scott build a staff with a wide range of backgrounds and life experiences, as well as racial diversity. She's also become known for tapping her network to assist other legislative offices in diversifying their rosters.\n\n\"Jennifer DeCasper continues to be one of the best examples in the entire Senate of a staffer who takes on this role,\" says Don Bell, a former Democratic aide who led the Senate Black Legislative Staff Caucus. \"It's not something you do just because you want to check a box. It's not something you do just because you're afraid of what people would say to you if they look at your numbers. It's just, diversity is good government.\"\n\nCapitol Hill is but one of numerous arenas - including journalism, academia, and nonprofits - that are difficult for working-class students to enter because of low starting pay and the concentration of jobs in expensive coastal cities. Such structural issues, critics say, have contributed to these professions becoming silos of relatively elitist, homogeneous thinking, in which many individuals have never experienced the issues they're tasked with addressing.\n\n\"The world we're in is incredibly complex and multidimensional,\" says Scott Page, a political science professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who studies diversity. If the people building dating apps or writing newspaper stories come from relatively advantaged backgrounds, he says, that could inadvertently perpetuate societal inequities. Improving racial diversity helps, but other dimensions matter, too, he adds. \"Each one of us looks out of a house through a certain set of windows.\"\n\nThe issue has gotten particular attention in Congress this month, driven by an Instagram account called @dear_white_staffers that chronicles minorities' raw tales of mistreatment - including some who were paid so little they lived on food stamps or brought Tupperware to take home leftover office food. Senior Democratic leaders are now supporting their push to unionize.\n\nBut at least until recently, few staffers had received housing, food, or unemployment assistance, which Congress spent more than $650 billion on last year. Yet staffers play a critical role in shaping such policies. Over the past half-century, there's been \"an enormous shift of responsibility\" toward staffers, who now do \"95% of the nitty-gritty work of drafting [bills],\" wrote the late Sen. Ted Kennedy in his 2009 memoir.\n\nAdvocates say that broadening the talent pool would help congressional offices better reflect the country they represent and craft more effective solutions to problems. It could also counteract a growing disconnect between average Americans and elites - and maybe even temper partisan rancor.\n\n\"Right now, we're watching our society become very fractured, very siloed,\" says Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, an Air Force veteran and Teach for America alum whose office emphasizes hiring interns from low-income backgrounds. \"And we really need to break that up.\"\n\nD aQuawn Bruce from Chicago's South Side had wanted to be president since he was 4 years old. He put himself through his first year of community college working from 2 a.m. to 10 a.m. at UPS - on top of taking classes, participating in speech and debate activities, and spending late nights in the library. Then he won a full scholarship to a private school, but still worked full time.\n\nWith the help of College to Congress (C2C), an organization that funds internships for high-achieving, low-income congressional interns, he came to Washington. In a way he felt he didn't belong. Other interns were renting vacation homes in Annapolis, Maryland, for the weekend and going out for steak-and-wine dinners. He would order an appetizer and stick with water. But he also felt a sense of urgency and purpose. He stuck out his internship and went on to work as a staffer on the Hill, a Facebook employee, and a lobbyist before returning to C2C as director of development.\n\n\"If it's all about who you know, what about the kids who have the talent? ... You mean to tell me that they don't get an opportunity?\" asks Mr. Bruce.\n\nMany of them don't. While statistics on the class and educational backgrounds of congressional staffers are difficult to come by, studies hint at how much of a one-dimensional culture the Hill really is.\n\nA 2019 report from Pay Our Interns found that private university students held three-quarters of the paid internships in Congress - 50% more than their share of the national undergraduate population. Blacks and Latinos, meanwhile, were represented at less than half their share.\n\nThe lack of diversity worsens among senior ranks. Less than 15% of senior staff positions are held by people of color, according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. White lawmakers from both parties have similarly low levels of diversity on their staffs.\n\n\"A lot of people think that this is just an issue that the Republican Party has, which is not the case,\" says LaShonda Brenson, senior fellow of diversity and inclusion at the Joint Center. \"Democrats rely on people of color to vote for them. They should be doing not just as good as Republicans, but even better.\"\n\nThe Hill's lack of diversity has ripple effects. \"Congress serves as a feeder for both the federal government, like the executive branch agencies, but also local mayors, city council members, and state legislators,\" says Carlos Mark Vera, co-founder of Pay Our Interns, a group that advocates for equitable hiring and eliminating unpaid internships. \"The impact is way beyond itself.\"\n\nCongress is also a talent pipeline for the lobbying sector, which wields growing influence, doubling its spending since 2000. Many say K Street is even less diverse than the Hill.\n\n\"We just want to see equal representation in lobbying,\" says Monica Almond, co-founder of the Diversity in Government Relations Coalition, which is currently compiling statistics on diversity among lobbying firms. \"That's our long-term vision.\"\n\nF inances remain a key impediment to attracting a broad range of young people to Washington - and keeping them on the Hill once they are there. No human resources department exists to oversee hiring and pay in Congress, leaving the 535 members to set their own policies.\n\nA new report from Issue One, a nonprofit that focuses on political reform, found that 1,200 congressional staffers aren't paid a living wage, including 70% of those working in the entry-level job of staff assistant. Nearly half of House staffers think they are underpaid, and more than 4 in 10 have seriously considered leaving, according to a 2021 survey by the House Office of Diversity and Inclusion.\n\nThe stories are legendary of interns and young staffers trying to survive Washington - the nation's fifth most expensive city - as an unpaid intern or on a junior Hill salary, from subsisting on 10-cent Buffalo chicken wings to carrying pepper spray in the only neighborhood they could afford.\n\nJill Hoffman came to the nation's capital in 1999 with a sense of idealism and $500 in her pocket. To make ends meet, she shopped at T.J. Maxx, grabbed free food at receptions, and worked at a patent law firm at night while babysitting on the weekends. Still, she racked up thousands of dollars in credit-card debt. So she left after 18 months.\n\n\"There continues to be a pervasive view in this country that if you're working on Capitol Hill, or if you're working for the government, you're probably making too much money,\" says Ms. Hoffman, now vice president of federal affairs at Assurant, an insurance provider. \"So there's a lot of political pressure to keep salaries low.\"\n\nMr. Bell, the former Democratic staffer, struggled when he first arrived in Washington, too. The law school graduate was working as an unpaid fellow in a senator's office. To pay the bills, he took a job as a cashier from 6:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. at Walmart. By the time he got a full-time position on the Hill, he was two weeks away from defaulting on his student loans.\n\n\"You go into this hallowed place and you're working on these pieces of legislation, and you end the night going to a poorer part of D.C. and you're providing customer service to people who are using their [electronic benefits transfer] card and pinching pennies,\" says Mr. Bell. \"It reminds you constantly of why you are getting up every morning and trying to make this work.\"\n\nThe rate of attrition among young staff often means talented people never gain the experience needed to move into senior positions. That's particularly true for those from low-income homes, some of whom are supporting their parents.\n\n\"A lot of people stay here because they're passionate about the work,\" says Jazmine Bonner, president of the Senate Black Legislative Staff Caucus. \"But how long can someone be in that role and do that work and not be compensated as someone who can grow into a higher-level position and make a true impact on decision-making?\"\n\nB roadening the range of voices in senior positions could change how Congress operates and the kind of legislation that gets drafted. At the least, it might change the tone in some Capitol Hill cubicles.\n\nAudrey Henson recalls when Congress was debating the 2013 Farm Bill. She was working for a GOP lawmaker and overheard others in her office talking about \"welfare queens\" who would take advantage of the food subsidies in the measure to buy hot meals instead of foodstuffs. She strode over and asked if they had ever been on food stamps. They hadn't.\n\n\"I was like, 'OK, well, I have,'\" Ms. Henson, who grew up in a mobile home, recalls telling them. \"My mom was juggling two jobs - selling used cars and getting home at 8 p.m.\" - that's why she wanted to buy rotisserie chicken with her food stamps, not because she was too lazy to cook.\n\n\"As I progressed from intern to staffer, I realized the harmful effects that come from groupthink and from letting only the elites control our government,\" says Ms. Henson, a Republican who founded C2C and is now running for Congress from Florida.\n\nSNAP benefits, the food subsidies dispersed to 39 million Americans in 2020 at a cost of nearly $80 billion, is the No. 1 issue cited by Hill staffers for why more people from varied backgrounds are needed to shape policies. C2C alum Jalen Johnson recounts that both his white and Black peers were surprised to hear that food stamps were crucial to keeping himself and his siblings alive.\n\n\"Socioeconomic diversity transcends color, for sure,\" says Mr. Johnson, now a Republican city commissioner in Albany, Georgia.\n\nGreater diversity could bring different perspectives to other issues as well, from housing to criminal justice. Mr. Bruce, from Chicago's South Side, has seen his share of adversity. He was shot in his front yard after his C2C internship. His cousin was killed a few months later. Mr. Bruce says his firsthand experience with gang violence gave him insights that he didn't often hear from the experts brought up to the Hill to talk about gun control or crime. Detachment from issues can lead politicians to parrot talking points without really understanding root causes, he says, \"and we get policies that further exacerbate the situation.\"\n\nMarshaling people who feel passionately about certain causes because of their experiences can help move ideas through the Washington bureaucracy, too.\n\nIn 2017, Senator Scott and Ms. DeCasper, his chief of staff, went to the White House and secured the president's backing for an initiative to encourage private investment in \"opportunity zones\" in urban areas. Ja'Ron Smith, a former Scott staffer who had become the Trump administration's director of urban affairs and revitalization, helped mobilize support within the executive branch. And Shay Hawkins, the man who had told Ms. DeCasper he wanted to make an \"outsized contribution,\" played a key role in getting the legislation into the GOP tax cut package that year.\n\n\"People from our side of the track were able to play a big role,\" says Mr. Smith.\n\nW ith a greater spotlight on Capitol Hill's lack of diversity, efforts have sprung up to improve pay and encourage staffing that better reflects America.\n\nOver the past few years, Congress has appropriated $48 million for paid internships, due in part to lobbying from C2C and Pay Our Interns. Yet offices struggle to make that money go very far - and don't necessarily funnel it to those who need it most.\n\nEnter Rosario Duran, a young Democratic staffer who came up with a way to stretch the funds that her office used to pay congressional interns. It had a $25,000 annual intern budget to work with and was only paying summer workers. That meant fall and spring semester internships would be out of reach for most low-income students.\n\nSo Ms. Duran suggested her superiors allocate $8,000 per semester, establish a base stipend for each intern, and divide the rest according to financial need. Programs like C2C could be tapped for supplemental funds, and interns could apply for financial aid from their schools. The result was that her office was able to not only create year-round opportunities for low-income interns, but also pay them better.\n\nStill, it's a long journey from interning to becoming a senior aide. Advocacy groups say it's imperative that congressional offices pay higher wages to staffers at all levels.\n\nMore needs to be done to close inequities as well. Veronica Duron, who came to Congress on a fellowship from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, had been working on the Hill about six years when she decided to look up the publicly available salaries of other staffers. She focused on the ones who, like her, worked on health care for the Senate Finance Committee. She was the lowest paid. Armed with the data, she asked for a raise. Her boss readily agreed.\n\n\"People are not taking time to look at, 'Oh, is there a pay discrepancy between the white staff in my office and the staff of color? Or is there a treatment discrepancy? Is there an opportunity discrepancy?'\" says Ms. Duron, now chief of staff for Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey.\n\nIn addition to better pay, mentoring can play a key role in helping promising young staffers develop.\n\n\"It's kind of like sea turtles on the beach,\" says Saat Alety, a former GOP Hill staffer who is now director for federal affairs and public policy at Allstate. \"You lay 400 eggs and try to get as many as possible past the gauntlet.\"\n\nAlexandria Smith remembers the guidance she got early on from Mr. Alety when he was Senator Scott's staff director for a banking subcommittee. Mr. Alety urged her to develop an expertise in banking - one of the least diverse policy areas. At first, she wasn't interested. Besides, she said, she wasn't good at math.\n\n\"He said, 'Banking isn't just about numbers,'\" recalls Ms. Smith. \"'It's actually dealing with real-life issues, like access to housing.'\"\n\nThat resonated with Ms. Smith, who had grown up in public housing, and she ended up playing a key role in shaping bipartisan legislation (still pending) on lead-safe public housing for children. Now, she's the legislative director for GOP Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida.\n\nOthers are changing hiring practices and trying to build a sense of community on the Hill. Ms. Duron, for one, knows how that can help unleash potential. After enrolling in college against her mother's wishes, she was mistaken for a cleaning woman and confronted by campus groups offering rewards for turning in unauthorized immigrants. (Her family has lived in Texas since it was a part of Mexico.) She found empowerment by joining a Latina sorority and other student organizations, eventually becoming president of the Greek system.\n\nOn the Hill, she says, it's important for senior managers to ensure minorities feel heard and supported, particularly when their communities or families are hit by incidents such as raids by U.S. immigration officials and police killings.\n\nIn building an inclusive environment, she also searches for potential hires who go out of their way to talk to everyone, from the person picking up the trash to the Republican down the hall. \"If you talk to all those people the same - those are the type of people I want,\" she says.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The Hill already has a tightknit culture, which she believes can be leveraged to create a greater sense of community. \"I think it's ripe for that,\" she says.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "Here's How Much 2024 Presidential Candidate Tim Scott Is Worth\n\nBy Kyle Khan-Mullins\n\nU nlike some of his competitors for the presidency, Tim Scott inherited neither a great fortune nor a prominent last name. Instead, he grew up in poverty. Nonetheless, the senator managed to start his own business, build a small real estate portfolio, win elections and become a millionaire-proving that the American Dream is still possible, even for a poor, Black kid from South Carolina.\n\nScott got his big break in 2010, when he won election to the U.S. House-guaranteeing him a $174,000 annual salary, nearly triple the $60,000 he had paid himself as the owner of an insurance business. He took office in January 2011 and sold his firm for more than $500,000 three months later. Before long, he started writing books, including two alongside former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, and eventually earned more than $700,000 as an author between 2017 and 2022.\n\nWhat has Scott done with his money? Worth just over a million dollars today, he completely or partially owns at least five properties: one in D.C. and four in the Palmetto State. That real estate portfolio accounts for the majority of his net worth. He also holds a federal pension that's worth an estimated $265,000 after 12 years on Capitol Hill. Rounding out his portfolio: a collection of equity holdings, including shares in blue-chip names like Apple, Boeing, Coca-Cola and Target.\n\nIt's a far cry from where he started. Growing up just north of Charleston, South Carolina as the grandson of a cotton picker and son of a single mother, Scott worked at a movie theater and dreamed of becoming a professional football player. But politics also intrigued him, starting with a run for student council in eighth grade and continuing through high school. He was eventually elected student government president, overcoming a more accomplished opponent and what he refers to as his own \"impressively prominent\" buck teeth.\n\nAfter graduating, Scott worked 70 hours a week at the movie theater, got braces to fix his front teeth and went off to college, where, thanks to a group called the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, \"Jesus became everything\" to him. His religiosity still shows up today when he delivers scripture-quoting speeches-or even utters his campaign slogan, \"Faith in America.\" Scott earned a political science degree from Charleston Southern University in 1988.\n\nHe started working as a salesman in college and continued after he got his degree, selling increasingly valuable products over time-vacuums, then men's clothing, then insurance policies. In 1999, at 34 years old, he opened his own Allstate franchise. Shaking off a first week with zero sales, his agency eventually won a Rookie Agency of the Year award for South Carolina. His secret: promising customers a quote within an hour of receiving their request.\n\nAround this time, he also began selling voters on his ideas. He was first elected to the Charleston County Council in 1995-the first Black Republican elected to any office in South Carolina since Reconstruction. He joined the GOP, he says, because the local Democratic Party told him to \"wait my turn and go to the back of the line.\"\n\nIn the 2000s, Scott began dabbling in South Carolina real estate. Alongside Michael Sally, a realtor who now serves on Hanahan, South Carolina's city council, he bought two rental properties in 2005, one in Goose Creek and the other in Summerville, for a combined $250,000. The pair barely broke even on the latter, which they sold in 2008, but the Goose Creek house is worth an estimated $270,000 today, more than twice as much as it initially cost, and there is only an estimated $40,000 of debt remaining on the mortgage.\n\nScott's political career blossomed just a few years later. He chaired the Charleston County Council in 2007 and 2008, then served two years in the South Carolina House from 2009 to 2011, before making the jump to the U.S. House of Representatives. In 2013, he was appointed to a vacant Senate seat by none other than Nikki Haley, then South Carolina's governor and now a presidential candidate competing against Scott. In just four years, he'd gone from his county council to the U.S. Senate.\n\nScott and Haley, two rising stars currently battling for the Republican presidential nomination, are pictured here at a 2012 press conference where Scott's appointment to the Senate was announced.\n\nScott, who is not married, ditched his insurance company, freeing him up to focus on his new job-and, eventually, a string of real estate deals. In 2013, he upgraded his personal residence from a 2,300 square foot North Charleston home to a 3,000 square foot Hanahan home, selling the former to longtime aide Joe McKeown. Then in 2017, he upgraded again, paying half a million dollars for 3,400 square feet less than a mile away. Smart move. That home is now worth an estimated $800,000, before subtracting the estimated $440,000 left on the mortgage.\n\nIn 2017, Scott also bought a one-bedroom apartment, which he shares with McKeown, just a short walk from the Capitol for $325,000. It still has an estimated $230,000 of debt on it and is worth around $360,000 today. And in 2018, Scott acquired two more rental properties in South Carolina. One he bought with Michael Sally, the realtor and city councilor. The other was his childhood home. Together, the two homes are worth over $400,000 and have an estimated $85,000 of debt on them.\n\nIn the last two years, Scott has slowed down his buying spree, instead opting to invest some of his cash in stocks and mutual funds. Some of his investments are in the sorts of companies you might expect a Republican to support, like Palantir Technologies, cofounded by GOP billionaire donor Peter Thiel; and Tesla, the car giant helmed by Elon Musk.\n\nBut his most useful asset as a presidential candidate may be his own story, a rags-to-riches tale Scott loves to share with voters. \"I am honored to have our stories woven together into the greater story of America,\" he wrote in his 2022 memoir. \"Though our lives are but a single thread, together we will weave a beautiful tapestry. And I, for one, plan to make my story count!\""

      "text": "Trump Vice Presidential Hopeful Tim Scott Refuses To Say He Will Accept 2024 Election Results\n\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., one of several prominent Republicans vying for former President Donald Trump's vice presidential nomination, refused Sunday to answer whether he would accept the results of the 2024 election if Trump was not the winner-only days after the former president also said he would only accept the results \"if everything's honest.\"\n\nTrump previously said he anticipates the upcoming election will be \"honest\" and said he would accept ... More the results if that is the case.\n\nSpeaking to \"Meet the Press\" host Kristen Welker, Scott refused to commit to accepting the results of the 2024 election, instead insisting \"this is an issue that is not an issue,\" and asserting \"at the end of the day, the 47th president of the United States will be President Donald Trump.\"\n\nWelker gave Scott, who voted to certify the 2020 presidential election despite Trump's false claims of widespread voter fraud, a final chance to commit-but the South Carolina senator simply said \"that is my statement\" and \"I look forward to President Trump being the 47th president.\"\n\nScott's comments come only four days after Trump told The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel he would only accept the election results \"if everything's honest.\"\n\n\"But if everything's honest, which we anticipate it will be - a lot of changes have been made over the last few years - but if everything's honest, I will absolutely accept the results,\" Trump told the newspaper in Wisconsin-a crucial swing state he lost by only 21,000 votes in 2020.\n\nTrump has a long history of contesting election results and baselessly claiming they are \"rigged\" against him. After losing to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in the 2016 Iowa caucuses, Trump claimed the election was \"stolen\" and accused the GOP senator of \"fraud.\" He later claimed his 2016 Democratic opponent, Hilary Clinton, would \"rig\" the election against him-but largely stopped making this claim after his victory that November. After losing to President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, Trump spent months casting doubt on the results and insisting the election was stolen due to widespread voter fraud in key swing states like Arizona and Michigan. In the years following Biden's victory, Trump has continued to insist the 2020 election was \"stolen,\" including at major rallies on the 2024 campaign trail.\n\nFellow Trump vice presidential contender Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., also demurred in a January \"Meet the Press\" appearance when asked whether she'd support certifying the 2024 election regardless of the outcome. \"We will see if this is a legal and valid election,\" she said."

      "text": "Checks & Imbalances: How Vivek Ramaswamy And Tim Scott Earned Their Money\n\nBy Zach Everson\n\nBy Zach Everson ,\n\nForbes Staff.\n\nToday we continue digging into the personal finances of the 2024 presidential candidates.\n\nStanding in a packed New Hampshire restaurant, Vivek Ramaswamy, the fresh-faced Republican shaking up the 2024 presidential race, is making a case for unifying a bitterly divided nation. The secret, he insists, is as American as apple pie: capitalism, reports John Hyatt.\n\n\"Democrats and Republicans alike, we tend to be more proud of a country when we're all making more money in that country,\" he tells 100 or so diners enjoying turkey sandwiches and diet Cokes. \"We don't have to flog ourselves for capitalism. Stop apologizing for capitalism. We should embrace capitalism.\"\n\nRamaswamy certainly has. At 38 years old, the biotech investor and \"anti-woke\" warrior is worth more than $950 million. His net worth was over $1 billion about two weeks ago, making him one of the 20 youngest billionaires in the country, before a downturn in the market pulled him just under the billion-dollar threshold, according to Forbes' calculations. Still, he appears to be the second-wealthiest person competing in the Republican presidential primary , behind only Donald Trump (whose net worth Forbes last pegged at $2.5 billion).\n\nUnlike some of his competitors for the presidency, Tim Scott inherited neither a great fortune nor a prominent last name. Instead, he grew up in poverty.

Trey Gowdy, and eventually earned more than $700,000 as an author between 2017 and 2022.\n\nOn the Republican presidential primary debate stage last week, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley created moments of camaraderie with women viewers, whether intentionally or not, as she stood in light blue among a sea of dark suits. In addition, while little of what she said was new, much of what she chose to emphasize aligns with messaging meant to appeal to a class of more moderate women voters who are unlikely to support Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, according to Kelly Dittmar.\n\nTikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance has spent years negotiating a national security agreement with the Biden Administration that would avoid a ban on the short video app in the United States. Now, a draft of that agreement from summer 2022 reveals just how much control ByteDance may have to give the U.S. government. Were it to be finalized, the agreement would provide the government near unfettered access to internal TikTok information and unprecedented control over essential functions that it does not have over any other major free speech platform, reports Emily Baker-White.\n\nThe number of investigations that the Office of Congressional Ethics referred to the House Committee on Ethics in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe amount Sen.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I cover tax, budget and retirement policy from Washington\n\nBy Howard Gleckman ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nNASHUA, NEW HAMPSHIRE - OCTOBER 14: Republican presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) ... More speaks during the 2023 First in the Nation Leadership Summit. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\n\nSen. Tim Scott's (R-SC) decision to drop his bid for the Republican presidential nomination means voters have lost their best opportunity to hear a serious tax policy debate among his party's White House hopefuls.\n\nUnlike his rivals, Scott campaigned on a thoughtful, relatively detailed agenda that married taxes with his conservative social and economic views. You might not have agreed with all of it. But at least you knew where Scott stood, something that can't be said about his opponents.\n\nI wish I could show you his plan, but Scott took down the content of his website when he suspended his campaign. But to get the gist, here is an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Fdederal Budget (CRFB), an interview Scott did with CNBC and a nice summary of his plan by Kyle Pomerleau of the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nScott's Agenda\n\nScott promised to:\n\n· Make permanent all the individual income tax provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA ), which are due to expire at the end of 2025.\n\n· Repeal the estate and gift tax .\n\n· Permanently allow businesses to immediately write off the costs of equipment and research, and more rapidly depreciate buildings.\n\n· Allow parents to claim the child tax credit (CTC) for unborn babies and make the adoption tax credit refundable.\n\n· Expand his signature Opportunity Zones , which provided extra capital gains tax breaks to investments in designated communities.\n\nMake no mistake, while Scott was quite specific about taxes, his overall fiscal agenda left plenty of holes to fill.\n\nFor example, he insisted his plan would reduce the federal deficit. But it didn't add up. CRFB estimated it would add more than $3 trillion to the national debt over a decade, even with his proposed (and unrealistic) across-the-board cuts in non-defense, non-Social Security, non-Medicare spending. He never would say what he'd do about the looming insolvencies of Social Security and Medicare Part A .\n\nScott claimed he'd fill the fiscal gap because cutting taxes would increase revenue and reduce the deficit. But that idea is unsupported by evidence and has been rejected by nearly all economists.\n\nSpecifics Vs. Platitudes\n\nDespite those shortcomings, his tax plan was specific enough that independent analysts (and voters) could make informed judgments about its virtues and flaws. Nearly every bullet point was accompanied by a reference to an actual bill in Congress. And while Scott left out some key details (on international tax, for example), you knew where he stood on revenue issues.\n\nYou can't say that about his former GOP opponents. While Ron DeSantis had an aggressive tax cutting agenda as governor of Florida, he has been almost silent on what he'd do on fiscal policy as president. Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley has been somewhat more forthcoming , but her agenda still includes huge gaps. For instance, she promises to cut tax rates for working families but never says for whom or by how much. And she is silent on extending the TCJA.\n\nBusinessman Vivek Ramaswamy has a plan but it is internally inconsistent, veering wildly between vowing to never raise taxes, promising to boost the estate tax, and then denying he ever made such a pledge.\n\nFormer New Jersey governor Chris Christie has said little about his tax or budget policies, other than to promise to work with Democrats to reduce the deficit.\n\nThe Trump Factor\n\nAnd Donald Trump? These days, his stump speeches focus on how he'd punish political opponents in a second term. Even his campaign website is more of a retrospective look at his first term than a policy agenda for a second. He never even quite says he'd extend the 2017 TCJA, perhaps his biggest legislative achievement.\n\nThe only real specific revenue proposal Trump has made is to impose a 10 percent tariff on nearly all imported goods. But he's said nothing about how such a levy would work or what he'd do to mitigate the inevitable price increases it would cause for American consumers.\n\nAs long as Trump continues to dominate the GOP primary race, the details of fiscal policy will get little attention. He won't talk about it. And his remaining challengers will continue to focus on attacking one another in a desperate attempt to be the last viable alternative standing when primary voters start heading to the polls or caucuses in late January.\n\nBut voters deserve a debate on tax policy, especially since the 2025 expiration of the individual provisions of the TCJA will force major decisions on the future of the revenue code soon after the next president is sworn in. The demise of Scott's campaign leaves voters with a huge information gap, at least until the general election."

Tim Scott (R-S.C.) made his first public appearance with his girlfriend at the end of Wednesday's GOP presidential debate following months of intrigue surrounding his bachelor status-grabbing headlines after he was upstaged by his opponents' feuding.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen.

(Photo by GIORGIO VIERA/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nScott brought a woman on stage at the end of Wednesday's debate, when candidates are typically greeted by their families, appearing arm-in-arm and at one point holding hands.\n\nHe told reporters in the post-debate \"spin room,\" the woman was his girlfriend of \"about a year or so,\" and multiple outlets later confirmed her name is Mindy Noce, 47, an interior designer based near Charleston, S.C., and a mother of three.\n\nScott's romantic life has been the subject of political intrigue since he launched his presidential campaign, including investigations and analyses by a litany of reputable publications such as the Washington Post and New York magazine .\n\nScott, who at 58 has never been married, has hinted about the relationship, but people close to him have repeatedly told reporters they were unaware he was dating anyone: \"It's nonexistent,\" his campaign manager, Jennifer DeCasper, described as a close friend to the Washington Post, told the outlet in September, referring to his romantic life.\n\nAmericans have elected only one unmarried president, James Buchanan, in 1856. His single status led to widespread speculation about his sexual orientation that persists today.\n\nScott has repeatedly fielded questions from reporters on the campaign trail about his relationship, promising Fox News in September the public would someday meet his significant other, calling her a \"wonderful girlfriend.\" He also told the Washington Post he couldn't \"imagine dragging her onto the campaign trail unless I have the intention of marrying her,\" adding, \"I hope that happens, to be honest with you.\" While the question seems frivolous, donors have expressed concerns that it could hurt his ability to appeal to voters and raise tedious questions about his romantic life, Axios reported in September, citing sources who said top Republican donors were pressing the campaign for answers about his private life. Noce's reveal came after a debate that was dominated by bickering between the three candidates on stage who are leading Scott in polls: biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Scott is currently polling at around 2%, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling average .\n\n5 Takeaways From Trump-Free GOP Debate: Haley Calls Ramaswamy 'Scum,' Candidates Spar On China (Forbes)\n\nGOP Debate: DeSantis Blames Trump For Republicans' Poor Performance In Tuesday's Elections (Forbes)\n\n'You're Just Scum': Nikki Haley Blasts Vivek Ramaswamy Over Mentioning Her Daughter Using TikTok (Forbes)"

On his listening tour, titled \"Faith in America,\" Scott-who was appointed in 2012 to replace Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) after serving in the House-has highlighted his personal experience growing up with a single mother, telling reporters in April: \"It's a blessing to come from a state like South Carolina, where a kid who grows up in a single-parent household mired in poverty can one day even think about being president of the United States.\"\n\nSen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) told the Washington Examiner on Wednesday he would support a Scott presidential bid, making him the first Senate Republican to endorse someone other than Trump in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nDeSantis will reportedly launch his presidential campaign next week, ending months of anticipation about whether he would enter the race.

      "text": "Why Tim Scott? Reasons The GOP Senator Was Picked To Rebut Biden\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) has been chosen to deliver a response to President Joe Biden's address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, a role typically given to rising stars who go on to run for higher office - here's what you need to know about Scott and why he was chosen.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 28: Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) walks through the Senate subway after voting on the ... More Senate floor at the U.S. Capitol on April 28, 2021 in Washington, DC. The Senate held a vote to confirm Samantha Power to be Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development. (Photo by Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images)\n\nScott, who was first appointed to his seat by then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in 2013 after serving one term in the House, is one of three Black Republicans in Congress, but he is well positioned to help the GOP showcase the diversity of its freshman class .\n\nScott has also straddled the increasingly dire divide between Trumpworld and mainstream Republican circles, speaking at the 2020 GOP convention but condemning Trump when he shared a video of a supporter yelling \"white power\", and then voting against overturning the election despite pressure from Trump.\n\nScott has been at the center of a recent effort to strike a bipartisan compromise on police reform with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), though Republicans have also used the fact that Democrats blocked Scott's bill to incentivize banning chokeholds and collect data on no-knock warrants last year against them.\n\nScott often highlights his family's rags-to-riches story, noting in his RNC speech that his grandfather was \"forced out of school as a third-grader to pick cotton, and never learned to read or write.\"\n\nScott's Republican colleagues believe Scott is an ideal speaker for the moment based on his personal history, with Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) telling Forbes he has \"the ability to tell a story about his own life experience... that's very compelling.\"\n\nGOP senators who spoke to Forbes expressed confidence in Scott's ability to convey a strong, cogent Republican message, with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) calling him \"the best of what we have to offer,\" and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) calling him \"better than anybody of the other 49 Republicans.\"\n\nScott, asked Wednesday if he's ready for his speech, replied, \"I hope I am.\"\n\nTwo Senate Republicans who have delivered their party's responses to former President Obama offered similar advice. \"Stay hydrated,\" said Ernst, who spoke in 2015, a reference to a viral moment in Sen. Marco Rubio's (R-Fla.) 2013 speech in which he stopped speaking to grab a small water bottle. Rubio told Forbes his advice to Scott is \"use a glass, not a bottle.\"\n\n\"Our best future won't come from Washington schemes or socialist dreams. It will come from you - the American people,\" Scott will say in his speech, according to excerpts released by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's office.\n\nThough it's seen as a common launch pad, delivering a party's response to a president's address to Congress far from guarantees an immediate bid for president. Only two of the dozen Republicans who rebutted Barack Obama - Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal - later ran for president in 2012. None of the Democrats who responded to Trump's addresses to Congress ended up running in 2020.\n\nThe progressive Working Families Party has tapped Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), a freshman who unseated a longtime and powerful Democratic incumbent last year, to deliver a progressive response to Biden's speech.\n\nBooker praised Scott as a \"really capable leader\" and an \"honorable guy who's a good faith negotiator,\" in an interview with Forbes , predicting he will \"rise to the occasion.\" Booker added that he has \"no idea\" if Scott will touch on police reform.\n\nOne Community.

Tim Scott (R-S.C.)'s presidential campaign in recent days, even though Musk will host Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) for a presidential campaign announcement on Twitter Wednesday-adding to the mystique surrounding Musk's nebulous political leanings.\n\nElectric car maker Tesla CEO Elon Musk looks on among other CEOs before a roundtable during the 6th ... More edition of the \"Choose France\" Summit at the Chateau de Versailles, outside Paris on May 15, 2023. (Photo by LUDOVIC MARIN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMusk retweeted a post by Scott on Monday featuring a video of his announcement speech from Charleston captioned \"Let's go!\" and on Friday , praised a Scott campaign ad that features him denouncing victimhood and promoting individual responsibility as a \"great statement.\"\n\nDespite Musk's new alignment with Scott, DeSantis is set to announce his entrance into the 2024 presidential race on Twitter Spaces Wednesday in an interview with Musk, who said in November he would support DeSantis if he ran for president in 2024.\n\nMusk said Tuesday during the Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit he isn't planning to endorse any specific candidate, but hopes to make Twitter a public forum for the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nMusk also said he wants someone \"fairly normal\" in the White House, echoing his previous statements that he would support someone \"sensible and centrist\" for president in 2024-Scott is a self-described conservative, but has cast himself as an optimistic alternative to Trump's and DeSantis' divisive rhetoric.\n\nHe's also disavowed Trump, tweeting in July last year that Trump should \"hang up his hat and sail into the sunset.\"\n\nOracle co-founder Larry Ellison poured $30 million into a super PAC that supported Scott's 2022 midterm re-election bid and is likely to double those contributions to support his presidential bid, sources recently told CNBC. Ellison, a former member of the board of Musk's Telsa, Inc., was a major backer in Musk's Twitter takeover, committing $1 billion in financing to the $44 billion acquisition.\n\nHow Musk feels about DeSantis' war with Disney, which recently sued the state after DeSantis took a number of steps to curb the company's power following its public opposition to Florida's \"Don't Say Gay\" law. Disney also canceled plans to build a $1 billion office park in Orlando last week, a move that was widely viewed as a rebuke on DeSantis. Disney is a major advertiser on Twitter and Musk recently thanked the company, along with Apple, for its business.\n\nMusk has repeatedly feuded with President Joe Biden during his time in office as he's leaned more to the right-in November, he urged his 140 million Twitter followers to vote for Republicans in the midterm election, though he previously supported lawmakers in parties, including donating to former President Barack Obama's re-election campaign and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).\n\nThe only Black Republican in the Senate, Scott is the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, broadly opposed to government intervention and recently teamed with Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) to explore bipartisan legislation to recoup compensation from executives at failed banks. Though Scott is described as a \"conservative\" he is not aligned with the far-right like Trump and DeSantis, who is set to launch his campaign after spearheading a string of right-wing legislative policies as Florida governor. Those policies have reportedly turned off at least one of Musk's colleagues, tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who has told confidants he won't donate to any 2024 GOP presidential candidates, citing the party's culture war obsession, Reuters reported .\n\nDeSantis plans to announce his presidential bid in a 6 p.m. conversation with Musk Wednesday, and will release an official campaign video later that night, anonymous sources told NBC News .\n\nElon Musk's Political Shift: How The Billionaire Moved From Backing Obama To Endorsing DeSantis (Forbes)\n\nMusk Praises Tim Scott's Presidential Campaign Message, Prompting Speculation: Who Will He Back?

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nSouth Carolina Senator Tim Scott was confronted on Sunday over his past remarks opposing \"victimhood\" and \"grievance\" in a speech he gave while launching his presidential campaign, as those remarks are at odds with his recent endorsement of Donald Trump .\n\nScott, a Republican who entered the GOP primary presidential race in May 2023, later announced in November that he would be suspending his campaign during an appearance on Fox News . On Friday night, Scott gave his official endorsement to Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential race during a rally in Concord, New Hampshire. His endorsement, meanwhile, has been criticized by some, including presidential GOP candidate and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley .\n\nWhile appearing on CNN 's State of the Union , the senator was pressed by host Dana Bash on why he endorsed Trump given his previous remarks in his presidential campaign launch speech in which he called for his supporters to reject ideas of \"victimhood\" and \"grievance,\" words Bash said sounds like Trump's rhetoric.\n\nTrump faces a wave of indictments at both the state and federal levels, including special counsel Jack Smith 's and the Department of Justice 's (DOJ) investigation into his alleged attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election that led to the U.S. Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. Trump, the frontrunner in the 2024 GOP presidential primary, has maintained his innocence in all cases and has said that they're politically motivated and a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Scott's office via email for comment.\n\n\"Senator, you ran a very positive, very hopeful campaign, but 'victimhood' and 'grievance' that you were describing in your launch speech that we played some of right there sounds like Donald Trump. Did you change your mind?\" Bash asked.\n\nScott then responded by stating that he was actually referring to President Joe Biden 's leadership in his speech.\n\n\"No, listen. We absolutely, positively, unequivocally need an America that's not filled with victims. I'm actually talking about how Joe Biden has destroyed our economy and made victims out of people waiting for the government to show up. I'm talking about having a president who's weaponizing the DOJ [Department of Justice] against political adversaries. We need Lady Justice wearing a blindfold. I want America, every single American in every corridor of this nation to have confidence in their DOJ, not a Biden-led DOJ.\"\n\nHowever, when pressed further if he sees any \"grievance\" in Trump's campaign, the senator seemed to deflect by speaking about how the DOJ is being \"weaponized\" against the former president.\n\nTrump and other Republicans have portrayed the DOJ under the Biden administration as being politically motivated and have accused the agency of weaponizing the government against Biden's conservative rivals. Trump has previously blasted the DOJ for charging him in the election inference case and the case related to his mishandling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort residence, while House Republicans launched the Weaponization of the Federal Government Committee last year.\n\nContinuing to press Scott, Bash noted how the senator offered his endorsement by stating Trump will \"restore law and order,\" but asked how that can be as Trump is facing multiple criminal trials.\n\n\"Trump tried to overturn a legitimate election. He called January 6 rioters hostages and promised to pardon them. He is charged with keeping classified documents and obstructing attempts to get them back, and on the campaign now he's now arguing that presidents should have total immunity, even if they 'cross the line.' How is that 'law and order?'\" Bash asked.\n\nIn response, Scott took aim at Biden saying, \"When you look around the cities, when you grow up in poor communities like I did and you watch the crime rapidly ravishing your communities, you ask yourself what president has allowed that to happen, it's Joe Biden.\"\n\nScott's endorsement comes after Trump won the Iowa Republican caucus on Monday, with 51 percent of the vote, well ahead of Florida Governor and GOP presidential candidate Ron DeSantis in second place with 21 percent, and Haley in third with 19 percent.\n\nIn addition, Haley, who criticized Scott over his endorsement of Trump , faces an uphill battle in her home state. According to RealClearPolitics polling averages, Haley is trailing Trump by an average of 52 percent to her 21.8 percent. DeSantis lags behind in South Carolina at an average of 11 percent, according to RCP.\n\nThe South Carolina GOP primary will be held on February 24.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNatalie Venegas is a Weekend Reporter at Newsweek based in New York.

In the moment, the best alternative is four more years of President Donald Trump,\" Scott told Kilmeade.\n\nTrump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has continued to gain momentum since winning the Iowa caucuses last month. The former president also won the New Hampshire primary with 54.5 percent of the vote to Nikki Haley 's 44.7 percent. Meanwhile, speculation over Trump's potential vice president picks has increased, leading to several prominent names being thrown in the mix.\n\nHowever, Trump has given no real indication, beyond offering small heaps of praise to certain people and ruling out any chance he would pick Mike Pence again after their relationship fell apart in the wake of the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nDuring a taped Fox News interview released on Sunday and aired on Sunday Morning Futures , host Maria Bartiromo asked Trump: \"When will you announce who your VP is?\"\n\n\"Not for a while. We have so many great people in the Republican Party, but not for a while,\" he said.\n\nWhen pressed on who his potential running mate, Trump said, \"I speak to everybody. I called Tim Scott this week. A lot of people like Tim Scott. I called him and I said, 'You're a much better candidate for me than you are for yourself.'\"\n\nHowever, when Scott was pressed on Tuesday on whether he was being vetted after being told of Trump's remarks, he said: \"No, not that I know of\" and urged that the focus should be on Trump winning the election.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Scott's office and Trump's campaign via email for comment.\n\nIn January, Kellyanne Conway , a former White House adviser in the Trump administration, was asked by Bartiromo during an interview on Fox News who she thinks will be the MAGA leader's running mate.\n\nConway mentioned a few key names, including Ben Carson , whom Trump nominated as secretary of housing and urban development in 2017, while adding that she thinks Trump should pick a person of color.\n\n\"I also think that, you had a guest on earlier, Ben Carson, has fast becoming a Trump world insider favorite,\" Conway added. \"Very loyal to the president's agenda, won't compete with him. Same can be said about Mike Pompeo . President Trump is probably looking at Marco Rubio , Byron Donalds and maybe Wesley Hunt.\"\n\nThomas Whalen , an American politics expert at Boston University, previously told Newsweek : \"[Representative Elise] Stefanik and Scott make the most sense because they could potentially bolster him politically where he is the weakest-among suburban women voters and African-American voters....He's [Scott] already the butt of jokes on SNL Weekend Update for his craven sucking up to Trump. He makes the old Mike Pence seem subtle.\"\n\nAlthough Trump has said he won't announce his pick for vice president \"for a while,\" the race for GOP nomination still continues as Haley insisted she isn't dropping out of the race.

I'm excited to get back to lowering inflation, lower unemployment-,\" Scott said.\n\nWelker then interjected, asking him if he will accept the results \"no matter who wins.\"\n\n\"That is my statement,\" Scott said.\n\nWelker pressed him for a \"yes or no answer,\" noting, \"I don't hear you committing to the election results.\"\n\n\"This is why so many Americans believe that NBC is an extension of the Democratic Party . At the end of the day, I've said what I said. I know that the American people, their voices will be heard. And I believe that President Trump will be our next president. It's that simple,\" he said.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Scott's office for comment via email.\n\nThe senator's comments were met with condemnation on X, formerly Twitter .\n\n\"The fact that Tim Scott is refusing to say he'd follow the law and not try to overthrow the results of a free and fair election should scare anyone listening. This is how democracies end,\" the government watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) wrote.\n\nThe fact that Tim Scott is refusing to say he'd follow the law and not try to overthrow the results of a free and fair election should scare anyone listening.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Nikki Haley denied former candidate Tim Scott 's claim that he gave her a heads-up before releasing his endorsement for Donald Trump .\n\nHaley previously served as the governor of South Carolina from 2011 to 2017 and as an ambassador to the United Nations (UN) in the first half of the Trump administration. One of the earliest Republicans to declare her presidential campaign, she has recently risen to second place in most polls amid the faltering and eventual end of Ron DeSantis's campaign . Though Haley has recently seen a spike in momentum, she and all other candidates are still considered longshots compared to the former president.\n\nScott, who is among the candidates who have withdrawn from the Republican primary so far, has been a senator for Haley's home state of South Carolina since 2013. The lawmaker officially suspended his campaign on November 12, 2023, and two months after dropping out, he announced endorsed Trump for president.\n\nDuring an appearance on CNN 's State of the Union , Scott claimed to host Dana Bash that he had touched base with Haley about his endorsement decision the day before via text message. On Sunday, Bash asked Haley herself if this was true, to which the former governor said it was not.\n\n\"That's not true. He didn't call, he didn't text,\" Haley said. \"He didn't tell me he was going to do this. I texted him and said, look, I want to sit down and talk, cause we had only spoken once since then, I said, I'd love to sit down and talk about endorsement, he said, I'm getting with my team to figure that out, and I never heard anything else again until his endorsement [of Trump].\"\n\nWhen asked if perhaps Scott had texted someone else on her campaign staff, Haley said that was also not the case, further explaining that she and her team also never heard from him when he decided to run and when he decided to drop out of the race.\n\n\"Am I disappointed? Yes,\" Haley added. \"But that's his decision to live with. We're moving on.\"\n\nIn a statement provided to Newsweek , a representative for Scott reiterated his initial claim that he reached out to Haley while considering his endorsement.\n\n\"As he noted on CNN this morning, the senator texted Nikki on Thursday to let her know he'd be making a decision soon,\" spokesman Nathan Brand said.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Haley campaign via email for comment.\n\nHaley had a similar stance to share when asked about Scott's endorsement on Saturday by Fox News 's Neil Cavuto.\n\n\"South Carolina is a blood sport,\" Haley said. \"Everyone has a decision to make and they have to live with their decision. He'll have to live with his.\"\n\nAside from sharing a home state, the two lawmakers also share a close political history. Scott was first appointed to the Senate by Haley when she was governor to fill a vacant seat, following the retirement of Senator Jim DeMint.\n\nUpdated 1/22/24, 10:23 a.m. ET: This article was updated with a statement from Scott's spokesman.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nThomas Kika is a Newsweek weekend reporter based in upstate New York.

      "text": "Tim Scott Bets on Trump Supporters' Attraction to Optimism\n\nNick Reynolds is a senior politics reporter at Newsweek. A native of Central New York, he previously worked as a politics reporter at the Charleston Post & Courier in South Carolina and for the Casper Star-Tribune in Wyoming before joining the politics desk in 2022. His work has appeared in outlets like High Country News, CNN, the News Station, the Associated Press, NBC News, USA Today and the Washington Post. He currently lives in South Carolina.\n\nBased on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nSouth Carolina Senator Tim Scott officially announced his campaign for president on Monday, ending months of speculation that the rising GOP star would add his name to the rapidly growing field for the Republican nomination in 2024.\n\nFacing a field of culture warriors and rhetorical flamethrowers, however, it's likely he enters the race facing an uphill battle. But like his message, his electoral prospects are rooted in optimism.\n\nSpeaking at the same Charleston Southern University from which he graduated, the junior senator's speech before a packed room in North Charleston had all the hallmarks of those given by other candidates already in the race.\n\nHe lambasted the country's \"weak\" leadership under President Joe Biden , and how the United States had become \"a nation in retreat.\" He claimed Democrats were pushing America to a culture of grievance, rather than greatness, of denying its legacy of seeing dignity in the toils of its labor.\n\nBut for a candidate whose presidential ambitions were first made clear in a video earlier this year outside the site where the first shots of the Civil War were fired, Scott's speech presented the culmination of a story that began well before his upbringing in an impoverished single-parent household in the hardscrabble city of North Charleston.\n\nHis run for president, he said, shattered Democratic narratives, and proved the United States was a country of opportunity where anyone of the poorest means could succeed if they were willing to put in the work.\n\n\"I'm the candidate the far left fears the most,\" Scott said Monday. \"When I cut your taxes, they called me a prop. When I re-funded the police, they called me a token. When I pushed back on President Biden, they even called me the n-word. I disrupt their narrative. I threaten their control. The truth of my life disproves their lies.\"\n\nOne decade ago, then-Representative Scott was relatively unknown outside his home state-an anomaly on Capitol Hill even in a rapidly changing time in Washington.\n\nThe state's first Black Republican congressman since Reconstruction, the second-term House member had few peers in D.C., making headlines after declining to join the Democratically dominant Congressional Black Caucus as a freshman in 2010.\n\n\"My campaign was never about race,\" he said at the time, harkening to previous comments he'd made expressing a tendency to \"shy away from things that create some kind of boundaries.\"\n\n\"It highlights the divisions I've been pushing forward to erase,\" he said.\n\nAs a senator, it's an ethos he has hoped to embrace, particularly as the lone Black Republican in the Senate .\n\nOn the Hill, Scott has long been perceived as a pragmatist, a conservative willing to cross the political aisle for initiatives like federal police reforms.\n\nIn 2021, he was pegged to offer the Republican rebuttal to Biden's State of the Union Address, cementing him as a thought leader of the modern conservative movement. He's also become a favorite of the donor class, using his more moderate brand as a springboard to become the second-leading fundraiser in Congress behind Georgia Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock , whose war chest has helped him win two of the most contentious statewide elections in U.S. history.\n\nBut those who support him hope Scott can also represent something Republicans have had only once since 2004: a conservative that can win.\n\nWhile boasting a moderate's reputation, he's still plenty conservative, voting with former President Donald Trump's position 91 percent of the time during his administration. Though only giving the subject a glancing mention in his speech Monday, he has pledged to support the most \"conservative\" abortion legislation possible in recent interviews, earning the support of hardline anti-abortion organizations like the Susan B. Anthony Foundation.\n\n\"His optimistic message that emphasizes the U.S.A. as the land of opportunity has widespread appeal,\" Gibbs Knotts, a professor of political science at the College of Charleston who has written extensively on Scott, told Newsweek. \"It's a central part of the GOP playbook, but he is in a unique position to make the case as an African-American candidate. He's the only black GOP U.S. Senator, and his message and compelling personal story have the potential to pull voters from Trump and DeSantis.\"\n\nBut relatively untested outside the Beltway, the question remains whether Scott can claim victory on a national stage.\n\nHis most recent election in South Carolina-a 25-point victory over Democratic state Representative Krystle Matthews-was against a candidate plagued by scandal after audio emerged of her appearing to advocate the use of drug money for political campaigns.\n\nSouth Carolina also has not been seriously competitive in a general election in years. The most contentious race in recent memory, the 2020 contest between Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and current Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison resulted in a 10-point Republican victory.\n\nOutside of South Carolina, Scott is likely to face an uphill battle to become competitive.\n\nFrom a policy perspective, much of what Scott championed in his Monday announcement was standard fare for the contemporary Republican Party. While he spoke of a new era of economic resurgence and escalated spending on emerging technology and research, he also called for boilerplate conservative policies from building a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico to bolstering the U.S. presence on the world stage.\n\nHe also expressed contempt for Biden's student loan forgiveness program, the need to \"back the blue\" and make cop-killing a federal crime, and to end the practice of public schools as \"centers of indoctrination.\"\n\n\"Less CRT, and more ABC s,\" he said.\n\nBut right now, there are several others selling the same thing. Even his in-state rival, former Governor Nikki Haley , shared similar sentiments throughout her announcement speech in Charleston this year, echoing Scott's chorus throughout Monday's speech that America was \"not a racist country.\"\n\nAnd at this point in the race, several of those candidates are performing much better than Scott, who has shunned his rivals' scorched earth approach to the culture wars with what his campaign has described as a brighter, more optimistic message.\n\nIn the early voting states of New Hampshire and Iowa, Trump, who has already begun campaigning in South Carolina, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis , who is expected to launch his campaign as soon as this week, are the leaders in early polling, with Scott still performing on the margins against a front-runner who has grown increasingly popular despite his mounting scandals and legal issues.\n\nAnd while Scott has historically outperformed Trump's numbers in elections in his home state, even the most optimistic polls from Palmetto State ahead of the primaries still show Scott performing at single-digit percentages in a multi-candidate field.\n\nBut Scott has something most candidates don't: nearly $22 million in the bank, and a significant level of upside the campaign bets will help his poll numbers into the heat of the Republican primaries.\n\nWhile Trump already boasts near-100 percent name recognition, he's also highly divisive, with a base whom polling shows is still reluctant about his chances to win after two consecutive defeats in the national popular vote.\n\nAnd while DeSantis' favorables today are considerably higher than Trump's, some believe the Florida governor will begin to become exposed in the retail politics' heavy environment of small, early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, where he will be rendered unable to control media narratives like he has in the tightly controlled environ of the governor's mansion.\n\nIt's in this environment that Scott believes he can thrive.\n\nAccording to sources close to his campaign, Scott plans to focus the brunt of his attention on those two early-voting states, hoping to leverage his optimistic messaging and personable demeanor into higher numbers at the polls and convince voters there is a viable alternative to the abrasive styles of candidates like Trump and DeSantis.\n\n\"I do think Scott can make an argument about electability,\" Knotts said. \"He has the potential to win back some of the voters Trump lost in 2016 and 2020, particularly suburban voters and younger voters.\"\n\nScott already has a plan to sell that message. His campaign already announced $6 million in advertising spending there over the coming weeks, a total that campaign officials told Newsweek is hoped will enhance his name recognition in the two states before the upcoming Republican debates this summer. Haley, for comparison, has a little more than $4 million in cash-on-hand, according to her most recent campaign disclosures. However, Scott also has upcoming planned appearances in New Hampshire and Iowa, where he's expected to launch formal campaign rollouts in the early voting states.\n\n\"It's just a matter of Tim Scott, and every household across America, to see who he is, to feel the authenticity that you saw here,\" former Colorado Senator Cory Gardner , a board member on Tim Scott's political action committee, told Newsweek . \"And I think that's exactly what we have to do.\"\n\nAssuming things go well there, it's on to his home turf of South Carolina, where his campaign hopes to ride its anticipated bump in the polls and an expansive war chest to a strong performance there before a number of other states cast their votes on Super Tuesday.\n\nIn addition to attendees at Monday's rally like former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford, Scott has the long-standing backing of tech billionaires like Larry Ellison (who was in attendance Monday) as well as the eye of conservative figures like Twitter CEO Elon Musk , who shared video of one of the campaign's recent events with his more than 140 million followers Friday.\n\n\"Great statement,\" Musk tweeted.\n\nEven on his home turf, however, Scott is still anticipated to meet challenges.\n\nTrump maintains a loyal following in the state, drawing thousands to a rally in Florence last year and earning the support of a small roster of top state officials including Governor Henry McMaster.\n\nDeSantis recently made headlines for a fundraiser attended by several former Trump administration officials in Charleston, raising speculation of wavering support in the state among some of the former president's most ardent backers.\n\nWhile Scott's camp acknowledged in press briefings with reporters prior to Monday's announcement that they will need to capture votes from both to be successful, there's still the question of how he plans to go on the offensive against the two frontrunners to accomplish that.\n\nEven during Monday's announcement speech, Scott paid little attention to his Republican rivals in the race, placing his focus solely on his own platform and its contrasts to Democrats. Haley, meanwhile, was clearly on the attack in her opening speech, directly challenging Trump as emblematic of a fading generation of old leaders and older ideas.\n\nThough Scott's campaign sees potential with the state's critical evangelical voters-who were critical to Trump's success in the state-prospective entrants in the field, like former Vice President Mike Pence , have spent months building inroads into South Carolina's religious community, making stops at churches throughout the state and even delivering the commencement address at a Christian college in the state capital of Columbia last year.\n\nScott and Haley already found themselves in competition for the state's evangelical vote at the Palmetto Family Council's 2024 Vision Forum this spring alongside other hopefuls like Vivek Ramaswamy, all of whom see the state's religious conservatives as key to their 2024 coalitions.\n\nIt was clearly on Scott's mind, who evoked the Epistle to the Ephesians during a call-and-response with the crowd Monday. If that wasn't enough, on the banner behind him, the wall read \"Faith in America.\"\n\nUpdate 5/22/2023, 5:03 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information and comment from Gibbs Knotts.\n\nNick Reynolds is a senior politics reporter at Newsweek.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nSenator Tim Scott, a Republican candidate for president , got into a heated back-and-forth with The View 's Sunny Hostin Monday after she inquired about his thoughts on systemic racism.\n\nScott is currently one of seven GOP candidates who have officially launched campaigns, joining former President Donald Trump , Florida Governor Ron DeSantis , conservative talk radio host Larry Elder, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley , former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Former Vice President Mike Pence and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie are expected to make their bids official within the coming weeks.\n\n\"One of the things I think about and one of the reasons why I'm on the show is because of the comments that were made frankly on this show, that the only way for a young African American kid to be successful in this country is to be the exception and not the rule,\" Scott told Hostin. \"That is a dangerous, offensive, disgusting message to send to our young people today, that the only way to succeed is to be the exception.\"\n\nHe pointed to progress in the forms of the United States having a Black president (Barack Obama), a Black vice president (Kamala Harris), and two Black secretaries of state (Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice). When he brought up a decrease in Black unemployment since 1975, Hostin retorted by referring to a rise in homelessness among a demographic that makes up about 12 percent of the total national population.\n\n\"You had the chance to ask the question,\" the South Carolina senator said, cutting her off. \"I know that you-I've watched you on the show, you like people to be deferential and respectful, so I'm gonna do the same thing.\"\n\nHe then brought up his grandfather being born in South Carolina in the 1920s, a time when he had to step off a sidewalk \"and not make eye contact.\" Scott also mentioned how nearly every TV network and entertainment sector features different races today.\n\nScott, who has been in the Senate since 2013, is one of 11 total Black senators to ever serve in Congress . He is the fourth Black Republican senator, with the first two such senators-Hiram Revels and Blanche Bruce-beginning their terms during the period of Reconstruction in post-Civil War America.\n\n\"What I'm saying is that yesterday's exception is today's rule,\" he said.\n\nCo-host Whoopi Goldberg later asked Scott why the Republican Party doesn't have similar conversations about race as they did in that segment, or those take place among Democrats .\n\nScott replied that it is a \"human issue\" and said his side of the aisle is doing a \"fabulous job\" in making progress, drawing a puzzled response from Hostin-who said Republicans ' rewriting of the tax code in 2017 did not help those affected by systemic racism, drawing applause from the audience.\n\nThe pair seemingly continued the conversation throughout the commercial break, causing Goldberg to warn them that they were back on the air. \"We're arguing over here still, I apologize,\" Scott said.\n\nScott's appearance included multiple commercial breaks and concluded abruptly after co-host Ana Navarro asked him about the feud between DeSantis and Disney , and whether he agrees with \"weaponizing the government.\"\n\n\"I think Tim Scott is trying to find that lane whereby he becomes the alternative to Trump and it's likely a long game but he's hoping that South Carolina can help to catapult him to the front,\" Todd Shaw, associate professor of political science and African American studies at the University of South Carolina, said in a phone conversation with Newsweek .\n\nScott is trying to project his status nationally while also complementing a statewide grassroots campaign, Shaw said, as well as an embracement of the Republican agenda by telling his own life story as someone who is Black and also identifies as a political conservative.\n\n\"It is a difficult proposition given how very divided the parties are by race in this state and nationally, and it is difficult to see to a degree whether or not Tim Scott can build a big tent even though he is arguing about the fact that the Republican Party either can be or is a diverse party-which is not exactly true from an ethnic or racial standpoint,\" Shaw said.\n\n\"But that's what he's trying to predict, and I think he's trying to use a bellwether conservative state such as South Carolina to make that case.\"\n\nPolling conducted by Echelon Insights between May 22 and 25 showed Scott with 2 percent of support from likely voters, trailing Trump (49 percent), DeSantis (19 percent), Pence (9 percent), Ramaswamy (8 percent) and Haley (5 percent).\n\nIn a hypothetical head-to-head matchup at the time of Scott's mid-May race entry with a smaller field than currently exists, Trump held a 79-21 advantage over Scott, according to a Harvard/Harris poll.\n\nThe fact that South Carolina has two conservative candidates in this race, including two politicians who have both successfully performed at the statewide level, makes it seem like Scott and Haley will try to out-match one another to take over that lane in the early primary battles, Shaw told Newsweek .\n\n\"Both of them were fairly popular officials or had a fairly solid level of support in their statewide approval ratings, so it's hard to see exactly how they will distinguish one from the other,\" he said. \"Particularly if they're relying on the question of the diversity of the party and the way in which they can speak to the diversity of the party.\n\n\"Or at least, maybe their argument is diversity of the American electorate more broadly...It's hard to say how they can both compete and both be competitive, given that they're occupying a very similar lane.\"\n\nNick Mordowanec is a Newsweek investigative reporter based in Michigan.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nI grew up in Dubai. Though born into a south Louisiana family, when I was five we moved to the United Arab Emirates and only came home two months each summer until I was 15. My formative years were spent in far-off places. In college, I moved to Macon, Georgia, a small southern city that still thinks of itself as a large town. In Macon, I came to understand the history of the South is way more complicated than any paper trail could show.\n\nPleasant Hill is a decaying, crime-infested neighborhood in Macon. Poverty, drugs, broken families and crumbling homes intermix with slow gentrification. It was not always that way. Pleasant Hill had been a prosperous black middle-class neighborhood where musicians James Brown and Otis Redding grew up. But when all-white road planners paved Interstate 75 headed south out of Atlanta, they could have chosen to run it through Macon between Pleasant Hill and Shirley Hills-a well-to-do white neighborhood. Instead, they bulldozed right through Pleasant Hill, dividing families and collapsing the neighborhood.\n\nAs an example of this decision's effects, consider the Half House. The home belonged to one of the black families in Pleasant Hill, and the Department of Transportation took half of it for I-75. The family technically did not lose their home so they received no compensation. A review of property records would show continuous home ownership, but a decline in value that-for all an observer of the records would know-could have simply corresponded to the interstate being built a few feet away.\n\nIn 2005, as I was winding down my law practice, I represented a family trying to get their share of inherited land in rural Taylor County, Georgia. The land had been acquired by a former slave after the Civil War and amounted to several hundred acres. When the original landowner died in 1905, white landowners pressured the family to give up the land. As my clients told me, the family just kept the probate case open. In rural Georgia, as long as the taxes were paid, no one was going to complain and no one could pressure a sale with the property in probate.\n\nMy clients wanted to shut the probate case and claim a portion of the land for themselves, but they were opposed by others in the family who, one hundred years later, wanted to keep the property intact for the whole family to enjoy and use for hunting. We were successful in the case.\n\nI relate these stories in light of the Washington Post 's in-house fact checker, Glenn Kessler, attempting to fact check the story of South Carolina senator Tim Scott's family. Scott often speaks of his illiterate grandfather, who had to leave school at an early age to pick cotton. His grandfather never learned to read or write and had to farm the land before World War II.\n\nKessler, using legal records from the era, suggests Scott's story is rosier than Scott paints it. Kessler points out Scott's great-great-grandfather had amassed several hundred acres of land after the Civil War. Scott's great-grandfather was literate and farmed the family land. It was only Scott's grandfather who dropped out of school and never received an education.\n\nThe South, after the Civil War, did see black families acquire land and wealth. The South then saw white landowners respond with Jim Crow laws that degraded the supposedly \"separate but equal\" black schools and restricted the voting rights and civic participation of black families. Kessler falls into the same pattern white supremacists have used for years to explain that black Americans had it just fine in the South.\n\nUsing legal records, one can find land ownership, middle classes and good education among post-Civil War black families. It takes a closer look at real lives lived to see the constant fear, the bullying, the legal jeopardy, the degradation of schools and the need to drop out to protect hard-fought-for family land. It takes seeing the forest, not the trees.\n\nNews outlets like the Washington Post frequently lecture Americans about white privilege, systemic racism and other social ills. It is remarkable that its fact checker, whose own ancestry includes founding executives of Royal Dutch Shell, would suggest Senator Tim Scott needs to check his privilege. It shows a level of racism common among white progressive elites in this country. They look at the paper trail and make presumptions without trying to see a life actually lived. They see a black man and presume he must either live a common, collective story or not have lived as a black man at all.\n\nKessler's presupposition amounts to embracing the idea that \"separate but equal\" black society in South Carolina before World War II really was equal, and that a black landowner was no different than a white landowner. The paper trail should never be confused with the trials of life for black Americans in the Jim Crow South, but that is exactly what the Washington Post did. They should apologize.\n\nErick Erickson hosts the nationally syndicated Erick Erickson Show from Macon, GA.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

      "text": "Scott Introduces Comprehensive Housing Legislation\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, introduced the ROAD to Housing Act , comprehensive legislation to reverse decades of failed housing policies and make targeted reforms across all segments of the U.S. housing market. Senator Scott has made access to quality, affordable housing a top priority during his time in Congress. This legislation is the result of negotiations with stakeholders and follows feedback on the Senator's legislative framework , discussion draft , and multiple full committee hearings on legislative solutions to challenges in housing. Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee, including Senators Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Katie Britt (R-Ala.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), and Steve Daines (R-Mont.), joined the Senator on the legislation.\n\n\" I'm the son of a single mother - growing up, we lived with family until we were able to rent a small place of our own. I know firsthand the importance of access to quality, affordable housing. Unfortunately, Democrats' solution for years has been to spend trillions on programs that have yielded little results, especially for minorities as homeownership rates for African Americans have barely changed in over 50 years ,\" said Senator Scott. \" Costs to buy a home and to rent continue to increase, and homelessness is at record levels. It's past time for Congress to take serious action to reverse decades of failed housing policies and put all Americans on the road to housing .\"\n\n\" Homes are the foundation for economic success, family stability and community cohesiveness.  Unfortunately, lack of affordable housing is routinely the number one concern I hear from Idahoans in my meetings throughout the state.  We must reform inefficient segments of U.S. housing availability across all markets to make the American dream of homeownership attainable for as many Americans as possible ,\" said Senator Crapo.\n\n\" Finding housing that is affordable remains a challenge for homebuyers and renters across the country. In South Dakota, median home prices continue to rise and with the high interest rates needed to fight inflation, achieving the American dream of homeownership is extremely difficult. In order to bring prices down and get more Americans into homes, we must start to cut red tape, remove barriers to opportunity and prioritize accountability of Federal bureaucrats. The ROAD to Housing Act will help accomplish that ,\" said Senator Rounds.\n\n\" Under the Biden-Harris Administration, reckless spending and excessive regulations have driven housing affordability to its lowest in decades, devastating American families in the process ,\" said Senator Hagerty. \" As opposed to the Harris proposal to stimulate demand for housing, this legislation marks a first step toward curbing government overreach and expanding the housing supply .\"\n\n\" Many people in Wyoming struggle to find affordable housing, and it is past time for Congress to address the housing shortage in a fiscally responsible way ,\" said Senator Lummis. \" That includes eliminating red tape and holding agencies responsible while making room for innovation. I am joining my friend and colleague Senator Tim Scott in introducing the ROAD to Housing Act to cut red tape which will increase the housing supply .\"\n\n\" There is no doubt our nation faces an affordable housing crisis, and for many hardworking individuals and families, the American Dream of home ownership is completely out of reach. The ROAD to Housing Act is a comprehensive solution that would take a targeted approach to remove unnecessary red tape to lower the cost of housing, while expanding access to important resources like housing counseling and financial literacy programs. I'm pleased to join my Senate Banking colleagues in supporting Ranking Member Scott's legislation to empower more Americans and Alabamians with the opportunity to own a home ,\" said Senator Britt.\n\n\" Over the last four years, housing has become unaffordable for families across North Dakota and the country, leaving many struggling to find a quality place to live ,\" said Senator Cramer. \" It's time to prioritize solutions over rhetoric to help communities throughout the nation, so I joined Senator Scott in introducing the ROAD to Housing Act to provide targeted solutions for renters, homeowners, and the homeless .\"\n\n\" Our ROAD to Housing Act will provide much-needed relief across the housing market at a time when Montanans are struggling under the Biden administration's record inflation and high interest rates. This is a step in the right direction to help Montana families find safe and affordable places to live, work and raise a family ,\" said Senator Daines.\n\nKEY PILLARS OF THE ROAD TO HOUSING ACT:\n\nThe Renewing Opportunity in the American Dream (ROAD) to Housing Act takes a comprehensive view of federal housing policy, introducing long-needed reforms across all segments of the U.S. housing market, centering support around families and communities. For too long, scattershot approaches to assist renters, homeowners, and the homeless have failed to produce meaningful results. The ROAD to Housing Act will pave the way to increasing housing supply, improving quality of life for families, and importantly, providing economic opportunity in communities across the nation. SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS: The American Dream isn't realized when a family purchases its first home - the American Dream is realized each day that a family grows in its home, helping to build stable economic foundations and communities. Families deserve reliable access to a responsibly regulated housing market. Our federal housing programs require greater oversight from Congress to ensure that they are operating in a safe and sound manner. The ROAD to Housing Act aims to ensure the households who utilize federal housing programs have greater access to tools which enhance financial literacy and improve economic opportunity. ENCOURAGING COMPETITION AND INNOVATION:\n\nHousing policy is inherently local, and federal legislators should encourage local solutions to local problems. One-size-fits-all mandates on housing providers reduce consumer choice, increase costs, and restrict private market competition. The ROAD to Housing Act intends to encourage responsible innovation and allow for new approaches to ensure that communities, whether rural or urban, can meet the housing needs of their residents.\n\nPROVIDING HOUSING OPPORTUNITY AND COMBATTING HOMELESSNESS:\n\nToo often, families struggling for help find themselves trapped in a cycle of poverty. While HUD provides some assistance, federally subsidized properties have historically concentrated poverty and limited the economic mobility of residents. Homeless assistance programs have similarly failed to deliver the results we need, with the total number of homeless individuals at the highest levels ever recorded."

      "text": "Tim Scott Wants to Deregulate Manufactured Housing\n\nHousing Policy\n\nChristian Britschgi | 9.17.2024 11:30 AM\n\nHappy Tuesday and welcome to another edition of Rent Free . This week's stories include:\n\nBut first! Our lead story about Senate Republicans' new housing bill.\n\nOn Thursday, a group of Republican senators led by Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) introduced the Renewing Opportunity in the American Dream (ROAD) to Housing Act, which proposes a grab bag of reforms to federal housing programs.\n\nUnlike the slew of federal YIMBY (Yes in my backyard) bills that have been introduced in recent years, Scott's bill doesn't try to poke, prod, or bribe local and state governments into liberalizing their zoning codes. \"Housing policy is inherently local, and federal legislators should encourage local solutions to local problems,\" reads the press release on the bill.\n\nNevertheless, the bill does include at least one idea to increase housing supply.\n\nThat includes a repeal of the federal regulation requiring that manufactured housing sit on a permanent steel chassis.\n\nResidential building codes for traditional, site-built housing are set by state and local governments. Manufactured housing, which is built off-site and shipped to its destination, is regulated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nYou are reading Rent Free from Christian Britschgi and Reason . Get more of Christian's urban regulation, development, and zoning coverage.\n\nΔ\n\nHousing wonks have long singled out HUD's requirement that manufactured homes sit on a permanent steel chassis, even once they're delivered, as a major headwind on manufactured home productions.\n\nThere's some debate about whether HUD's chassis requirement is primarily responsible for a massive, post-1970s drop in manufactured home production, or whether it's a slightly less ruinous but still unnecessary, costly regulation.\n\nWherever one lands on that debate, everyone would seem to agree that repealing the chassis requirement will reduce the cost of building the cheapest form of housing on the market.\n\nScott's bill would also repeal the cap on the number of public housing units that can be \"converted\" to other types of subsidized affordable housing under HUD's Rent Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program.\n\nRAD is intended to address the massive backlog of capital improvements needed at public housing complexes by shifting these units into other programs where funding is more dependable and private capital is available.\n\nCurrent law caps the number of public housing units that can be converted using the RAD program at 455,000 (or close to half of public housing units).\n\nThis past week, I reported that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) gave the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), along with the Massachusetts Alliance of HUD Tenants, a $10 million grant which they will jointly distribute to tenant associations at privately owned, federally subsidized multifamily housing. The tenant groups will use that money to ensure their landlords maintain their buildings and provide habitable living conditions.\n\nHUD's decision to give this grant to AHF is highly questionable, given the organization's track record of managing its own residential properties. From my article:\n\nA detailed Los Angeles Times investigation published in November 2023 reported a number of issues at AHF-owned properties, including apartments infested with cockroaches, exploding radiators, water shut-offs so regular that tenants had to defecate in wastebaskets, violent crime and drug dealing left unaddressed, and months-long elevator shut-offs that left disabled tenants stuck on upper floors or forced to sleep in the lobby.\n\nWhile many of these problems are common at residential hotels on Skid Row, AHF-managed properties were more frequently hit with code complaints and emergency calls than similar properties, reported the Times.\n\nA former AHF employee described the living conditions at foundation properties as \"inhumane.\"\n\nJust yesterday, AHF settled a class action lawsuit filed by tenants of one its Los Angeles buildings. The nonprofit agreed to refund tenants a portion of their rent, hire an elevator consultant, and work with pest control experts to fight bug infestations in its buildings.\n\nHUD told me in a statement that AHF \"is part of a team that applied for these awards. The team is not only eligible, but the best qualified applicant.\"\n\nOne would think that a nonprofit that hadn't been accused of leaving their tenants in \"inhumane\" conditions would be more qualified to help tenants fight for better living conditions. According to HUD, that's not the case.\n\nSeattle's Mandatory Housing Affordability (MHA) Program, like all \"inclusionary zoning\" programs, is predicated on the idea that building new housing somehow makes housing less affordable.\n\nWhen Seattle upzoned the city's \"urban villages\" to allow denser construction under the MHA program, it also required developers to offset the alleged affordability impacts of their new, larger projects by either building below-market-rate housing or paying an in-lieu affordable housing fee.\n\nThe program has been controversial from the jump. City staff warned that fewer projects would be feasible under the costs of the MHA's affordable housing mandates. The city is being sued by one Seattle homeowner over a $77,000 MHA fee that was charged when trying to add more units on her property to house her adult children.\n\nEarlier this month, researchers Jacob Krimmel and Betty X. Wang published a new study confirming the complaints of MHA's critics.\n\n\"We find that new construction differentially declined in the upzoned, affordability-mandated areas,\" they write . \"Developers intentionally avoided MHA-zoned areas - despite their upzoning- opting instead to build on nearby blocks without affordability requirements.\"\n\nThe difference in construction rates between MHA and non-MHA blocks is as much as 70 percent, they found.\n\nThis confirms past research on other cities' inclusionary zoning policies. They raise the costs of building housing, raising costs and reducing construction.\n\nThe vast majority of subsidized housing units in Washington, D.C., aren't making enough money to cover their operating expenses, reports BisNow . That leaves the properties themselves at the risk of foreclosure and affordable housing tenants at risk that they'll be forced to vacate their homes once they're foreclosed on. From the Bisnow story:\n\nMore than 80% of housing properties that have received D.C. funding aren't bringing in enough rental income to pay their mortgages and maintenance costs, according to the District's Department of Housing and Community Development .\n\nAnd more:\n\nThe scale of the crisis is viewed as existential: 22,000 units that house 48,000 vulnerable residents are at risk of foreclosure today, according to DHCD.\n\nLandlords are blaming the situation on a mix of higher operating costs and the housing court delays caused by D.C.'s pandemic-era eviction policies, which have allowed tenants to stay for years in their units without paying rent.\n\nDelinquencies have risen dramatically, the report [ by Apartment and Office Building Association] concludes, because of D.C.'s pandemic-era policies that have tripled the length of the legal process required to evict nonpaying tenants.\n\nWhile cases have been delayed, many tenants continue living in units without paying rent and rack up tens of thousands of dollars in debts, a massive financial hole that is difficult to escape from. They have left landlords with substantially less revenue to maintain their operations and few options to generate more income.\n\nRent Free is a weekly newsletter from Christian Britschgi on urbanism and the fight for less regulation, more housing, more property rights, and more freedom in America's cities.\n\nΔ\n\nNEXT: TikTok Goes to Court\n\nChristian Britschgi is a reporter at Reason .\n\nShow Comments (37)\n\nKatarina Hall | From the May 2025 issue\n\nC.

      "text": "Republicans Pivot to Bombing Iran in Third Debate\n\nDebates\n\nEric Boehm | 11.8.2023 9:40 PM\n\nAfter two debates full of promises to bomb Mexico , the Republican presidential candidates turned their eyes toward a more traditional target for saber rattling: Iran.\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) staked out the most aggressive position against Iran, seemingly calling for direct American airstrikes against Iranian military units that have been involved in the recent strikes against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria.\n\nTo stop the attacks on U.S. troops, \"you've got to strike in Iran i f you want to make a difference,\" Scott said. \" You cannot just continue to have strikes in Syria on warehouses. You actually have to cut off the head of the snake, and the head of the snake is Iran and not simply their proxies.\"\n\n\"M y foreign policy is simple,\" he concluded. \"Y ou cannot negotiate with evil, you have to destroy it.\"\n\nIn subsequent responses, other candidates-except for businessman Vivek Ramaswamy-were asked if they would support military action against Iran as well.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley came the closest to joining Scott in calling for strikes. \"This is Iran giving them the green light, telling them what to do,\" she said, referring to the various Middle Eastern militia groups with ties to Iran that have been behind the strikes on U.S. troops and several rocket attacks aimed at Israel.\n\n\"We need to go and take out the infrastructure that they are using to make those strikes so they can never do it again,\" she said. \"Y ou punch them once and you punch them hard, and they will back off.\"\n\nPerhaps the most diplomatic response came from former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who said he would \" continue to isolate Iran so their only friends in the world are the... evil foursome of China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea,\" possibly invoking the infamous \" Axis of Evil \" from the George W. Bush presidency.\n\nNone of the candidates grappled with the most relevant question regarding the Iranian-backed militia strikes on American troops in Iraq and Syria: Why are American troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria in the first place? Surely, a better way to protect those American lives would be to remove them from a place where they are at risk-and where they might draw America into a broader war with Iran.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis got the closest to raising that point, though his answer was more than a bit muddled.\n\n\"I am not going to put our troops in harm's way unless you're willing to defend them with everything you have,\" he said, seemingly gesturing toward an argument for getting those troops out of harm's way in the first place. (Later, DeSantis would strike a stronger position in vowing not to send American troops to Ukraine-but followed that up with a vow to send troops to America's border with Mexico.)\n\nThen, DeSantis pivoted to a more hawkish perspective. \" I would say: ' you harm a hair on the head of an American service member and you are going to have hell to pay,'\" he said. \" We are not just going to sit there and let our service members be sitting ducks....W e have to be strong, and we have to defend the people who defend us.\"\n\nThe leading candidate in the Republican field is, of course, former President Donald Trump, who was not part of Wednesday's debate. But while in office, Trump's foreign policy toward Iran was noteworthy for his relative restraint-so much so that notorious Iran hawk John Bolton fumed for years about how Trump thwarted his plans to start another Middle Eastern war.\n\nIt's a stretch to say that Trump's skepticism about America's foreign policy misadventures explains his lead in the polls. Still, other candidates looking to stand out in the Republican field ought to remember that GOP primary voters have favored foreign policy restraint , not dangerous threats to start new foreign wars.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Tim Scott Invokes Ronald Reagan and Says UAW Strikers Should Be Fired\n\nElection 2024\n\nC.J. Ciaramella | 9.20.2023 11:29 AM\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said striking United Auto Workers (UAW) members should be fired, following the example of President Ronald Reagan crushing an air traffic controller strike in the early 1980s.\n\nNBC News reported Monday that at a meet-and-greet event in Iowa, Scott was asked whether he would insert himself as president into talks between the UAW and the auto industry. The UAW is on the fifth day of a strike against Detroit's Big Three automakers-Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis-that could have serious economic impacts on the U.S.\n\n\"I think Ronald Reagan gave us a great example when federal employees decided they were going to strike,\" Scott responded. \"He said, you strike, you're fired. Simple concept to me. To the extent that we can use that once again, absolutely.\"\n\nReagan famously fired more than 11,000 unionized air traffic controllers and barred them from federal service for life after they went on strike in 1981.\n\nOf course, those air traffic controllers were government employees. It's unclear if Scott thinks the president would have the authority to fire private employees on strike or compel management to do so. Strikers are also largely protected from firing under the National Labor Relations Act.\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, the campaign also declined to elaborate, but spokesperson Matt Gorman said Scott \"has repeatedly made clear, both at that event and others, that taxpayers shouldn't subsidize any deal with the UAW and auto companies.\"\n\nThat's a perfectly fair point, and the UAW's demands are fair game for criticism as well. UAW leaders have been bargaining for a four-day workweek, in addition to higher wages and cost of living protections.\n\n\"We're seeing the UAW fight for more benefits and less hours working,\" Scott said at the event. \"More pay and fewer days on the job. It's a disconnect from work, and we have to find a way to encourage and inspire people to go back to work.\"\n\nBut it's not the president's place to play strikebreaker (or matchmaker) when a labor dispute involves two private parties.\n\nUPDATE: Scott's campaign reached out after publication with additional comments the Senator made in New Hampshire today:\n\n\"It's also nice to be quoted accurately, which was really difficult for me... I remember exactly what I said, I was talking, someone asked me the question about the UAW and one of the things I said was that, you know, in the Ronald Reagan years when the FAA had their strike, one of the things he did was fire them. Obviously, the President doesn't fire folks in the private sector, but he can do so in the public sector. And, importantly, as a note, and I think this is pretty important, I used that as a bridge to have a conversation about the fact that unions that are negotiating too often overpromise and under deliver so much so that President Biden's first bill the COVID relief package, y'all remember the COVID relief package? $1.9 trillion worth of spending, checks going in the mail very quickly. The only thing missing in the COVID relief package was the COVID Relief. 1% for vaccines, another 10% for COVID related health, but $86 billion to shore up the retirement plans that were going belly up within the unions.\n\n\"I brought up the Ronald Reagan years because I do think that we need to have front and center the example of a president who stood strong and today's president, he stands weak. So weak that he's using your- there's no such thing as a federal dollar. They're all your dollars. Our dollars as citizens. Taking $86 billion out of our collective pocket to use that to shore up the unions is in my opinion, wrong.\n\n\"Third thing I say, really important, is that as a member of the Finance Committee I'll never forget the union widow who was promised $4,000 a month in retirement and needed to depend on the federal backstop of $1,000 a month because she was promised something and not delivered. When your negotiations want to have 32 hour work weeks, but more money and a four day work week and higher benefits, the truth is that we all pay that higher price, but the ultimate payer has been basically the American taxpayers. And so that's what I said but they only clipped it for their benefit.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Tim Scott Debuts Border Platform Including 'Human Wall' and 'Bye-Bye Ambassador' Tucker Carlson\n\nElection 2024\n\nFiona Harrigan | 7.14.2023 5:16 PM\n\nOn Friday, Republican presidential hopeful Tim Scott participated in a Blaze Media forum hosted by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, and the U.S.-Mexico border was front and center. Early in the conversation, Carlson mentioned President Joe Biden's recent move to mobilize 3,000 reserve troops for potential deployment to Europe, and he later connected it back to the border.\n\n\"Why not build a human wall with, say, the reservists who were called up to go defend Ukraine-why wouldn't they be defending our border?\" he asked Scott, who replied, \"Totally agree with you.\"\n\nCarlson questioned why the Pentagon should be funded \"if they are refusing to defend\" the country. \"Aren't you kind of being invaded at a certain point?\" he continued. \"If you've got millions of military-age men coming into your country and hundreds of thousands of Americans are dying, why is that not the job of the military to stop?\"\n\n\"I don't disagree with you,\" said Scott.\n\nThe exchange highlights several mounting trends on the right. For one, it repeats \" invasion \" rhetoric that wrongly paints migrants as national security risks, akin to enemy soldiers. It's also heavy on the misguided belief that closing the border will keep fentanyl out of the country. These points both play into an increasing interest on the right in taking military action along the border and within Mexico-even as Republican lawmakers question the wisdom of military involvement elsewhere in the world.\n\n\"I don't know anyone who's been killed by Russia. I know people personally who have been killed by Mexico,\" said Carlson. That's because the Mexican government, he argued, \"is party to the murder of hundreds of thousands of Americans\" by \"allow[ing] fentanyl to be made in its country and to come over our border.\" Scott didn't disagree.\n\nIt is true, and tragic, that thousands of Americans are dying of fentanyl overdoses. But fentanyl is largely smuggled into the U.S. through legal ports of entry, rather than in remote illegal border crossings, by American citizens. A vanishingly small percentage of arrested illegal border crossers- 0.02 percent -were carrying any amount of fentanyl. A common retort is that fentanyl is going undetected because Border Patrol agents are too busy arresting undocumented immigrants. But according to congressional testimony by the Cato Institute's David J. Bier, even though arrests fell by 42 percent in January, Border Patrol didn't seize more fentanyl that month. Moreover, Bier's research found that \"the government exacerbated the problem by banning most legal cross border traffic in 2020 and 2021, accelerating a switch to fentanyl (the easiest-to-conceal drug).\"\n\nCarlson and Scott didn't explore the main problem fueling fentanyl deaths: the unpredictable composition of black market opioids, which is driven by drug prohibition. As long as there are Americans willing to buy illicit fentanyl, that supply will continue to enter the country-and kill.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Scott rejected the idea of American boots on the ground in Ukraine. But he thinks they'd be effective at the southern border: \"I would use every resource we have, to include the United States military, to stop the flow of fentanyl.\"\n\nHe didn't expand much on what he'd have the military do. But he's previously said that we should \"have more of a military presence on...our southern border\" and that \"we should do...whatever it takes to secure our southern border.\" It's a seemingly less bellicose approach than the one pushed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who wants to authorize the military to \"destroy drug labs.\" But Scott's proposal still risks escalation and contradicts the (reasonable) things he's said about keeping American soldiers out of Ukraine.\n\nScott would have a similarly heavy hand on immigration, with proposals of varying seriousness including \" appoint[ing] Tucker Carlson as my bye-bye ambassador to figure this out\" (\"this\" being broad deportations), finishing the border wall, and doing away with sanctuary cities.\n\nCarlson and Scott touched on a number of genuinely pressing problems. But border security, the immigration system, and fentanyl overdoses won't be solved by more prohibition and more brute government force.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Tim Scott Is Proposing a Major Reform to Qualified Immunity\n\nQualified Immunity\n\nBilly Binion | 4.22.2021 12:24 PM\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) has reportedly proposed a compromise to rein in qualified immunity, the legal doctrine that makes it difficult for victims to sue government officials when their constitutional rights have been violated.\n\nScott, who has served as the Republican leader on police reform talks, is suggesting that the doctrine be pulled back for law enforcement and that liability shift from individual cops to the departments that employ them. As of this writing, it was not immediately clear if the plan would curtail qualified immunity or outright eliminate it. (Qualified immunity protects all public officials, though this move would likely apply solely to police officers.)\n\nLegislated into existence by the Supreme Court, qualified immunity currently requires that any misconduct alleged against state actors be outlined almost exactly in a previous court precedent should the victim want the right to bring his suit before a jury. Such a thing often doesn't exist. Qualified immunity has thus protected a cop who shot a 10-year-old , two cops who allegedly stole $225,000 while executing a search warrant, a cop who ruined a man's car during a bogus drug search, two cops who beat and arrested a man for standing outside his own house, and a cop who shot an unarmed 15-year-old , among others.\n\n\"[Democrats] have been as responsive in this recent conversation than they have ever been, in my opinion,\" Scott told CNN, noting that the discussion is \"on the verge of wrapping soon.\"\n\nSome progressives have pushed back on the idea, according to the network, instead insisting that individual officers be held accountable personally. That's misguided. As I've previously written , police departments already finance the vast majority of payouts when a police officer is not granted qualified immunity and subsequently loses a lawsuit in his or her professional capacity.\n\n\"Sen. Tim Scott's proposal-requiring the city to bear the costs of these suits, instead of officers-would make transparent what already happens in over 99 percent of cases,\" writes Joanna C. Schwartz, a professor of law at the University of California, Los Angeles and an expert in qualified immunity. \"We absolutely need to find ways to increase officer accountability-by, for example, changing union protections that make it difficult to fire bad officers.\"\n\nThe GOP has historically resisted change on this issue. After the death of George Floyd sparked a national conversation on issues of police misbehavior and accountability, the issue of qualified immunity went from an obscure doctrine discussed in legal and academic circles to something the majority of the American public now supports reforming. Former Rep. Justin Amash (L-Mich.) unveiled a bill to eliminate the doctrine for all government officials and achieved tripartisan support-though with only one Republican co-sponsor .\n\nSen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) introduced his own proposal to curb the doctrine, but withdrew it after Fox News host Tucker Carlson lambasted him for it and after the law enforcement lobby made its resistance known. Former President Donald Trump said that reform on the issue would've constituted an automatic veto, and Scott himself said last summer that it would have been a \"poison pill.\"\n\nBut a few states have picked up the mantle where Congress has refused to act. The New York Times reports that legislators are studying reforms in Colorado, which passed a law last summer allowing people to bring claims against police officers in state court. New Mexico and Connecticut have greenlit similar pieces of legislation.\n\nVirginia also mulled such reforms. Lawmakers eventually abandoned the idea after encountering opposition from a group of predictable dissenters: police unions.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Congress Could Overturn a New Rule Limiting Credit Card Late Fees. Good.\n\nEconomics\n\nEric Boehm | 4.9.2024 12:35 PM\n\nLast month's decision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to cap credit card late fees at no more than $8 per month seems destined to earn a spot in the annals of unintended consequences .\n\nOn the surface, of course, it sounds great. No one likes getting hit with late fees for missing minimum payments, which previously averaged about $32 per month but vary from credit card to credit card. The CFPB estimates that the change will save American families about $220 per year in lower fees. In his State of the Union address last month, President Joe Biden hailed the change as part of his overall war on \"junk fees.\"\n\n\"They don't like it. Credit card companies don't like it,\" he said.\n\nSome Americans might end up not liking it either-particularly if the result is higher interest rates on credit card purchases or stricter limits on who gets access to credit in the first place. Those are a few of the likely outcomes that Vince Ginn, an economist and former White House associate budget director, identifies in a new post at the Econlib blog .\n\n\"While it could save us some money if we slip up and pay late, credit card companies will find ways to compensate for this lost income,\" he writes . \"In trying to shield us from high late fees, the government will set us up for a situation where credit is harder to come by and more expensive.\"\n\nThese mandated changes always come with trade-offs that policymakers fail to see or understand. As I covered in a piece for this month's issue of Reason , the 2010 law that capped debit card swipe fees-in the name of saving consumers and businesses pennies on each transaction-resulted in consumers seeing few benefits and hastened a cultural switch towards credit cards, which usually charge even higher swipe fees to businesses. Now, predictably, there's a similar attempt to limit credit card swipe fees, which will inevitably have its own unintended effects.\n\nAs for the CFPB's move to cap late fees, there's the possibility that Congress could get involved. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the top Republican on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, introduced a bill on Monday to overturn the rule using the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to have the final say on executive agency actions.\n\n\"Now is the wrong time to play political games that limit access to credit,\" Scott said in a statement . \"But that's exactly what the CFPB's rule to limit credit card late penalties will do-it will decrease the availability of credit card products and important financial services, particularly for Americans who need them most.\"\n\nIt's also worth considering the similarities between the CFPB's new rule and the Biden administration's ongoing attempts to forgive student loan debt . While capping late fees on credit cards isn't quite as outrageous-or as likely to provoke perverse incentives -both actions reflect the Biden administration's view that the government should shield people from the potential economic downsides of their own, voluntary decisions.\n\nDespite Biden's attempt to call this a \"junk fee,\" it's really not. The only people who pay credit card late fees are those who make purchases on credit, and then fail to make the minimum monthly payments on their balances.\n\nIt's certainly possible to have sympathy for individuals who have missed payments due to economic hardship, but that doesn't change the fact that those fees are a basic part of the contractual obligation that anyone assumes when using a credit card. Late fees are clearly spelled out on every monthly statement . They exist to encourage on-time payment of what is owed-the same reason why the IRS will charge you a penalty for failing to finish your taxes this week (but for some reason the CFPB doesn't seem interested in preventing those fees).\n\nTo the extent that capping late fees will translate into higher interest rates for all credit card users-not merely those who are delinquent with minimum payments-then the effect of the CFPB's rule will be to impose marginally higher costs on individuals and families who are using credit cards responsibly to cover the obligations of those who have not done so. That's fundamentally unfair, and none of the government's business.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

Tim Scott (R-SC), who is challenging Donald Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, conceded on Monday that the 37-criminal count federal indictment against the former is indeed a \"serious case with serious allegations.\"\n\nScott's initial reaction to the news Trump would be indicted was to join Harris Faulkner on Fox News last Thursday night evening and declare the Department of Justice had been weaponized against Republicans - a regular talking point on the right.\n\nScott spoke with reporters on Monday after a campaign stop in Spartanburg, South Carolina and despite labeling the Trump indictment \"serious,\" the South Carolina senator picked up where he left off on Fox.\n\n\"As Americans, we have to have a justice system where the lady of justice wears a blindfold,\" Scott told reporters, according to The Post and Courier, adding:\n\nWhat we see today across this administration of President Joe Biden is a double standard. That double standard is both un-American and unacceptable.

This puts all of our military men and women in danger if you're going to talk about what our military is capable of or how we would about invading or doing something with one of our enemies.

      "text": "The Republican Primary Consensus for Sending the Military Into Mexico\n\nWar on Drugs\n\nMatt Welch | 5.24.2023 12:06 PM\n\nWhen Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), a comparatively affable chap in the context of contemporary GOP politics, announced his 2024 presidential bid on Monday, the speech was predictably full of the upbeat, anecdotal, ain't-America-grand stuff that Scott, like generations of Republicans before him, has made central to his political career.\n\nThen things suddenly turned dark.\n\n\"When I am president, the drug cartels using Chinese labs and Mexican factories to kill Americans will cease to exist,\" Scott vowed. \"I will freeze their assets, I will build the wall, and I will allow the world's greatest military to fight these terrorists. Because that's exactly what they are.\"\n\nScott's bellicosity was no mere bolt from the blue. As Reason has been documenting for six years now , Republicans, even while otherwise souring on U.S interventionism abroad , have increasingly concluded that the alarming spike in domestic fentanyl overdoses would best be treated by sending the military into Mexico .\n\nDonald Trump first floated the idea, while he was president, of designating drug cartels as terrorist organizations-thereby allowing for extraterritorial prosecutions, enhanced investigative powers, and increased penalties for domestic drug-related crimes-in March 2019 , but held off after the government of Mexico repeatedly objected on grounds of sovereignty while making uncooperative noises about transnational migration policy.\n\nBut the appetite for corralling cartels into the otherwise-unpopular war on terror was only beginning to rumble in the conservative belly. Trump himself in the summer of 2020 twice asked then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper whether \"we could just shoot some Patriot missiles and take out the labs, quietly,\" according to Esper's 2022 memoir . Notable MAGA politicians Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) have both suggested violent interdiction south of the border, as have a bevy of more traditional hawks . There are a handful of escalatory bills bouncing around Congress.\n\nOpen presidential primary contests, filled with hot air as they may be, are nonetheless useful X-rays of a political party's ideological heart. Trump's polling bounce in July 2015, after launching his campaign with a barrage of startling insults about Mexican immigrants, bent the entire competition-including politicians with long immigration-friendly track records-toward Constitution-bending restrictionism . Some proposals that sounded implausibly fringe back then-Trump's ban on Muslims of certain nationalities from entering the country, most notoriously-were translated in modified form into federal policy.\n\nSo, listed in order of their RealClearPolitics polling average for the past month, here are the top six 2024 GOP presidential candidates talking in their own words about using the U.S. military in Mexico to fight fentanyl-dealing drug cartels. Below that are some Reason arguments against merging the war on terror with the war on drugs.\n\n1) Donald Trump (56.3 percent)\n\n\"When I am president, it will be the policy of the United States to take down the cartels, just as we took down ISIS and the ISIS caliphate,\" the former president said in January. \"[I will] order the Department of Defense to make appropriate use of special forces, cyber warfare, and other overt and covert actions to inflict maximum damage on cartel leadership, infrastructure and operations.\"\n\n2) Ron DeSantis (19.4 percent)\n\n\"Would you build the wall and would you use the military to go after Mexican drug cartels?\" Florida's governor was asked at a press conference this month, replying , \"Yes, and yes.\" He elaborated :\n\nThe border should be shut down. I mean, this is ridiculous what's going on. You shut it down. You do need to construct a wall. ...\n\nWe also have to come to terms with all the amount of fentanyl that's coming into our country because of this border. And who's doing it, it's these Mexican drug cartels. They need to be held accountable. We can't just let our people die. ...\n\nThat's a Day One issue. I mean, you've got to be really, really determined. You can't let it slide, you can't make excuses, you gotta go in and you gotta really go in with all guns blazing and using all the leverage that you have to be able to do it.\n\n3) Mike Pence (5.6 percent)\n\n\"The cartels are in operational control of our borders,\" the former vice president said at a campaign stop in March. \"National security begins with border security. We need leadership that will secure the southern border of the United States of America as a priority. ... You do not buy into the open-borders crowd. Not only do you have this humanitarian crisis coming across, [there's] the impact on our economy, families, and communities, the flow of illegal drugs. ... We have to have leadership willing to use American strength.\"\n\n4) Nikki Haley (4.3 percent)\n\n\"When it comes to the cartels,\" the former South Carolina governor said in March, \"you tell the Mexican president, 'Either you do it or we do it.' But we are not going to let all of this lawlessness continue to happen. And we can do that by putting Special Ops in there, by doing cyber, by really being strategic-just like we dealt with ISIS, you do the same thing with the cartels.\"\n\n5) Vivek Ramaswamy (3.6 percent)\n\n\"If the U.S. military has one job, it is to protect U.S. soil here in the United States, including the southern border,\" Ramaswamy said in a March interview. \"And treating the cartels like terrorists doesn't just mean freezing their assets, which is what some believe.

      "text": "Is Tim Scott Running on Fumes?\n\nAfter the debate in Miami, the South Carolina senator remains stuck behind.\n\nHappy Friday! Are you thinking of trying to make an independent run at the presidency? Buddy, get in line.\n\nMIAMI-It's easy to identify the candidates running behind in the Republican presidential primary. They show up in the spin room post debate to chat with reporters and make the full round of interviews with television news and conservative talk radio networks. That was Tim Scott Wednesday evening.\n\nSingling out the affable United States senator from South Carolina is unfair. Wealthy biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy also worked the spin room aggressively, here inside the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts overlooking Biscayne Bay, following the third televised Republican debate of the 2024 nominating contest. (And Ramaswamy was accompanied by his wife, Apoorva, who wasn't just there for moral support. She was an active surrogate, making her husband's case in multiple interviews.) He, too, is losing.\n\nBut for a contender many prominent Republicans believed held so much promise at the outset of his campaign, Scott conscientiously traversing the spin room from one interview to next offered a blunt reality check. There's a reason the senator recently scaled back the breadth of his White House bid to focus on Iowa: \"Iowa or bust,\" he told Salem Radio's Hugh Hewitt recently. He's struggling and stuck, an asterisk in national polling and a distant fourth in the Hawkeye State.\n\n\"We're on the stage this month and we'll be on the stage next month,\" Scott told The Dispatch in brief comments in the spin room, referring to the just-concluded debate, broadcast from downtown Miami by NBC News.\n\nExcept Scott might not be on the stage December 6 when the Republican White House hopefuls meet in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, for a fourth scheduled faceoff, hosted by NewsNation. As of today, Scott's 2.5 percent support in national surveys does not meet the polling threshold for participation established by the Republican National Committee.\n\nScott was responding to a request to assess the progress of his campaign. Pressed to elaborate-and to evaluate his viability in light of his retreat from the other critical early states of New Hampshire and South Carolina-Scott declined. \"I just gave you my answer,\" he deadpanned.\n\nIt wasn't supposed to be this way for Scott. A charismatic black politician, he was raised in challenging economic circumstances by a single mother and had to overcome a somewhat troubled adolescence but would eventually start his own business. With that inspiring personal story, he won election to the Charleston County Council and the House of Representatives, before then-Gov. Nikki Haley appointed him to fill a vacant Senate seat in late 2012. He proceeded to win the post outright in a 2014 special election and was easily reelected in 2016 and 2022.\n\nScott's legislative career, and his presidential campaign, have been marked by a focus on substantive issues and detailed proposals, in the domestic and foreign policy realms. And he's a bona fide conservative.\n\nIn Miami, Scott did more than perform well, he dominated-in talk time, at least. Scott spoke for nearly 19 minutes of the two-hour telecast, according to The New York Times , controlling more air time than any of his four competitors on stage. Haley was second, talking for almost 18 minutes. In other words, Scott has all the makings of a serious contender for the GOP nomination. And yet.\n\nThe Scott campaign insists it's not too late for the senator to surge. \"These things are still fluid, there's room to grow,\" spokesman Matt Gorman said, pointing to Rick Santorum and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, both of whom came from behind to win Iowa and appeared in trouble in the November before the 2012 and 2016 caucuses, respectively. \"We feel good.\"\n\nBut Scott's problems run deeper. The Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump, is at 58.5 percent nationally and more than 47 percent in Iowa, despite skipping all three debates. It's certainly true that the Republican candidates considered more likely to emerge as the consensus alternative to the former president-Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis-also have steep hills to climb. But both are significantly closer to doing so than Scott. Crucially, neither appears at risk of failing to qualify for the next debate.\n\nFor a candidate who entered the race with a significant war chest and a collection of prominent supporters among Republican politicians and campaign donors, being barred from the stage in Tuscaloosa could be the death knell of Scott's bid. Even if not, some Republican insiders in Iowa-where popular Gov. Kim Reynolds endorsed DeSantis-say it's already too late, in part because the senator bet all of his chips on their state.\n\n\"It's last gasp, Hail Mary territory and that's the obvious message it sends. Even Iowa voters understand that,\" said Republican strategist David Kochel, a veteran of several Iowa caucus campaigns. \"Voters are trying to decide between Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis for who gets to take on Trump one-on-one. Everyone else at this point has begun to look like a distraction.\"\n\n\"Make no mistake-I will win any race I enter.\"\n\n-West Virginia Sen.

      "text": "Tim Scott's a Good Guy. But Is That Enough?\n\nGOP senators love the South Carolinian, but increasingly 'don't see how' his campaign gets off the ground.\n\nEverybody loves Tim Scott. The senator was reelected in South Carolina last year by a resounding 26 percentage points, and he consistently scores among the most likable in the GOP presidential primary field.\n\nIn this week's Iowa Poll , for example, his net favorability rating among likely caucusgoers was +38 percent, better than Donald Trump's +35 percent, Nikki Haley's +30 percent, and Vivek Ramaswamy's +6 percent. His job over the next 75 days , according to the senator's campaign, is to convince Iowa voters who like him that they should also caucus for him. He's got a lot of ground to make up, though, currently trailing Trump by an average of 43 points in the Hawkeye State.\n\nAs well-liked as Scott is in Iowa, he's arguably even more popular in the Senate. In conversations with The Dispatch this week, a number of his Republican colleagues there were effusive in their praise of the 58-year-old South Carolinian. To Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Scott is \"a great guy and a good friend.\" To Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, he's \"a smart guy.\" Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama labeled Scott \"a good guy,\" and Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska thinks he's \"a great guy.\"\n\nBut while GOP senators love him, many are beginning-gently, with plenty of love-to suggest that Scott's path to the White House isn't viable, as Trump continues to dominate polls and Haley, his fellow South Carolinian, appears ascendant in Iowa .\n\n\"I think he comes from a good place. He's got great conservative values,\" Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana told The Dispatch on Tuesday. \"But I think he's up against a juggernaut in Trump. For any of them that are wanting to think about how they overcome that, I don't see how that works.\"\n\nSome of Scott's colleagues were more delicate with their counsel. \"It's challenging for anybody,\" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. \"But he'll know when the time is right.\"\n\nSen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, was fresh out of advice for Scott on Tuesday. When asked by The Dispatch what he would tell Scott to do to improve his position in Iowa, Romney climbed into an elevator, opened his mouth as if preparing to respond, and then shrugged his shoulders as the doors closed.\n\nScott is heading back to Iowa this week for a series of town halls and roundtables, hoping to jump-start his struggling campaign. Because Iowa's Republican base is particularly socially conservative and made up of lots of evangelical Christians, Scott's campaign viewed the state as one he could corner in a competitive field. He has spent a great deal of time in the Hawkeye State, heading there immediately after launching his campaign in South Carolina in May and making dozens of campaign stops in Iowa since. And on Monday, the senator told radio host Hugh Hewitt that he was \"Iowa or bust.\"\n\nIt's not looking good for Scott. Only 7 percent of respondents in this week's Iowa Poll -the gold standard survey of likely caucusgoers from veteran pollster Ann Selzer-listed him as their first choice, putting Scott in fourth place behind Trump, Haley, and Gov. Ron DeSantis. That's actually a drop of 2 points for Scott since August , while Haley has surged 10 points into a tie with DeSantis for second place.\n\nScott isn't faring any better elsewhere. He's polling a distant sixth place in New Hampshire, and fourth place in his home state of South Carolina. Nationally, the RealClearPolitics average has him at an abysmal 1.6 percent support.\n\n\"I'd be hard pressed to give Tim Scott any advice really,\" said Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota when asked what he would recommend his friend and fellow senator do to improve in Iowa. \"If he asked me this question at the beginning of all this, I'd say, 'Get accustomed to eating a lot of fried stuff on a stick. Spend a lot of time at the Iowa fair, and eat everything with a smile.'\"\n\nBut what would Cramer tell his colleague now? \"I personally don't see a path for anybody that's not Donald Trump,\" he said matter-of-factly. Scott's campaign declined to provide a comment to The Dispatch before this story's publication.\n\nThe old Washington saw that \"every senator looks in the mirror and sees a president\" has been operative in most recent presidential cycles. Four years ago, seven sitting senators ran for the Democratic nomination, and Joe Biden, a longtime senator himself, eventually won it. In 2016, four sitting Republican senators threw their hats in the ring. This time, Scott is the only member of the world's greatest deliberative body to jump in the race. Given the goodwill he has from his colleagues, Scott might have expected a bunch of Republican senators to get behind their own \"favorite son\" in the primary. But so far, just two sitting senators- John Thune and Mike Rounds , both of South Dakota-have actually endorsed him.\n\nAnd the uncomfortable truth is that Scott's stellar reputation in the Senate isn't translating into support with Republican voters, either, no matter how often people like Sen. Lindsey Graham insist, as he did Tuesday, that his fellow South Carolinian is \"doing a great job.\" (Should Scott stay in the race? \"As long as he wants to,\" Graham retorted.)\n\nFor the time being, Scott's long-term viability is reliant on his cash advantage. While his fundraising in the third quarter of 2023 slowed down-$4.6 million compared to 5.9 million in the second quarter-and his $12.4 million in expenditures revealed an alarming burn rate, Scott still reported more than $13 million in cash on hand. That's better than both the $5 million reported by DeSantis and $9.1 million by Haley.\n\nBut any of Scott's positive metrics pale in comparison to Trump, who continues to appear insurmountable for any of the challengers. A number of Republican senators this week acknowledged that reality while otherwise wishing Scott the best. One of them was Tuberville, who said he often worked out alongside Scott in the Senate gym before Scott launched his bid. Tuberville told The Dispatch he believes Scott would \"make a good leader for our country.\"\n\n\"I've told him, I said, 'I'd vote for you, if President Trump wasn't running,'\" Tuberville added. And how did Tuberville's genial gym buddy reply? \"He laughed.\"\n\nMichael Warren is a senior editor at The Dispatch and is based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "Does the GOP Deserve Tim Scott?\n\nToo many Republicans prefer Trump's self-indulgent chaos over smart policy.\n\nIt's official. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott is running for president.\n\nThe first thing you should know is that Scott is one of the nicest guys in Washington. Capitol Hill Republicans and just about anybody who knows him like him. Sincerely patriotic and devoutly Christian, Scott is most comfortable preaching, but he manages to avoid being preachy.\n\nHe does this mostly by leaning heavily on his own autobiography as a way to celebrate traditional values and show his gratitude for a country that made it possible for the grandson of a Jim Crow-era cotton farmer to become a United States senator-and possibly president. If you haven't heard him tell these stories, you will, particularly if you live in any of the early primary states.\n\nScott will do his best to convince Republican primary voters that he deserves their vote. The better question is whether many of those voters deserve him.\n\nIn 2016, the GOP primaries had a belling-the-cat problem . In this parable, it's in the interest of all the mice for someone to put a bell around the cat's neck, but it's not in the interest of any individual mouse to be the one to do it. For months after Donald Trump came down the Trump Tower escalator in June 2015, Republican contenders spent time and money destroying each other in the hope that someone else would take care of Trump and they'd reap the benefits.\n\nThere's a lot of déjà vu in conservative circles, with people worrying about a replay of 2016. But it's a different cat now.\n\nTrump is not an insurgent, he's the frontrunner. Convincing voters that a Trump presidency would be a disaster was possible in 2016. Convincing them he'd lose to Hillary Clinton was plausible. (Trump ended up picking the lock on the Electoral College even though he received a smaller share of the vote in 2016 than Romney had in 2012.)\n\nBut such hypotheticals don't work anymore. Trump won in 2016, and he's even convinced a lot of people that he won in 2020. His biggest fans didn't think his presidency was a disaster; they actually think he made America great for a brief shining moment. And even Trump's less committed fans don't like it when Republicans criticize him. They have no problem with Trump slanderously comparing his opponents to child molesters or pedophiles , but criticizing Trump is off-limits.\n\nThis is the dilemma his opponents face. When Nikki Haley , the former South Carolina governor, announced she was running for president, she said, \"I don't put up with bullies. And when you kick back, it hurts them more if you're wearing heels.\" But when asked about a civil jury verdict holding Trump guilty of sexual abuse, her response was \"I'm not going to get into that.\"\n\nThe point isn't that Haley and all the others, save for former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , who relishes a fight, are cowards for not going after Trump. They'd all throw the kitchen sink at Trump if they thought it'd work. But after years of institutionalized cowardice with regard to Trump, the Republican Party now has a sizable number of voters who like the worst stuff about Trump. They want the entertainment, the policy stuff is incidental. They enjoy watching Trump take the low road, and even those voters who might wince at some of Trump's antics, still recoil at anyone making hay of it. Voter miseducation is real.\n\nI'm not saying all of Trump's most loyal voters are bad or deplorable people. But what a lot of them want from politics is bad and deplorable. Tim Scott is too good for these voters because he's a good guy.\n\nRon DeSantis , Florida's governor, is too good in another way. He's betting that enough Republican voters want Trumpian policies without the drama and the \"culture of losing\" that has cost the GOP dearly in every election since 2018. DeSantis isn't heartwarming and emotionally reassuring the way Scott is. He's tough and ideologically reassuring. From a conservative and partisan perspective, he's been wildly successful as governor. But for voters who thought Trump's drama was a feature, not a bug, DeSantis' stolidness is a poor substitute for Trump's self-indulgent chaos.\n\nWhat Scott, DeSantis, Haley and the rest need are primary voters who think the party should stand for something more than a cult of personality, and that the presidency is more than a tool for self-aggrandizement and retribution.\n\nUnless they know where to find a bunch of new such voters, they're going to have to start reeducating the ones they have. And it's getting late.\n\nJonah Goldberg is editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Dispatch, based in Washington, D.C. Prior to that, enormous lizards roamed the Earth.

      "text": "Tim Scott Hopes for a Republican Reversal\n\nThe South Carolina senator hopes his presidential run will be the antidote to grievance politics.\n\nNORTH CHARLESTON, South Carolina-Watching Sen. Tim Scott announce Monday that he is running for president was like experiencing a Donald Trump rally in an alternative universe.\n\nIn the gym at Charleston Southern University, Scott invited people from the audience onto the stage-not to comically riff at them as Trump loves to do, but to give flower bouquets to family and friends. Instead of a \"Lock her up!\" call and response, Scott offered simple aspirationalism: \"Let's go! Let's go!\" When he went off-script, it was less angry talk-radio show caller and more Southern Baptist preacher.\n\n\"We have an unusual responsibility. We have the responsibility to prove that self-governance works,\" he said, stepping down from the stage and onto the floor, pacing and speaking in a hushed tone. \"We have the responsibility to share, for a thousand generations, what America's done for me, she can do for you.\" Multiple \"Amens\" rang out from the crowd.\n\nAs attendees filed out of the gym and Scott took selfies, Mick Mulvaney, the former South Carolina congressman who later served as Trump's budget director and acting chief of staff, reflected on the differences.\n\n\"Trump rallies tend toward the negative. They are largely an airing of grievances: This is why things are so bad, this is why people are keeping you down, this is why you should be angry,\" said Mulvaney, who is close friends with Scott. \"This is the flip side of that. This is entirely positive. You don't walk out thinking about how mistreated you are, or who is mistreating you. You walk out feeling good about being an American.\"\n\nThe contrast is no accident, conversations with multiple Scott advisers reveal. His team wants Republican primary voters to see the 57-year-old South Carolina senator as a clean step forward for the party. He won't try to out-Trump Trump, nor will he try to dilute the former president's harshest characteristics to sell himself as Trump-lite. But don't expect Scott to center his campaign around taking down Trump directly-or any of his other rivals, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or his fellow South Carolinian, Nikki Haley.\n\nScott's theory of how he wins the Republican nomination rests on two propositions: that enough GOP primary voters are looking for an optimistic conservative message, and that they value candidates who stay above the fray, not down in the mud with Trump or anyone else.\n\nThat theory infused Scott's announcement speech Monday.\n\n\"Our party and our nation are standing at a time for choosing,\" he said, echoing another optimistic Republican, Ronald Reagan. \"Victimhood or victory? Grievance or greatness? I choose freedom and hope and opportunity.\"\n\nHis remarks were aimed not at Trump or any other Republican, but at President Joe Biden and a liberal view of America that Scott argues his own life and experience-as a black man raised by a single mother-disprove.\n\n\"America is not a nation in decline. But under Joe Biden, we have become a nation in retreat,\" he said. \"So all we need to do is turn around.\"\n\nDespite not mentioning Trump's name, Scott is implicitly rebuking the Trump worldview, concerned as it is with American carnage that can be reversed only with \"strength\" in a war of attrition. While many of his policy proposals fall along populist Trumpian lines-being tough on crime and illegal immigration, encouraging American manufacturing and energy production, limiting both imports and foreign investment from China-Scott's tone and personal story are an effort to de-escalate the tension and universalize the appeal of his right-wing politics.\n\n\"As president, I will rebuild and restore every rung of the ladder that helped me climb,\" he said Monday, \"because I want my American story to pale in comparison to yours.\"\n\nThe question for Republican voters remains: Eight years after accepting Trump's darker assessment of the country's problems, do they want a more traditionally conservative message from a non-traditional Republican messenger? Or does the overwhelming support for Trump in the early polls indicate the former president's grip remains firm?\n\nScott's campaign is gambling on the former. And with $22 million cash on hand, a super PAC backed by billionaire Larry Ellison, and home-field advantage in an early primary state, the team is counting on having plenty of opportunities to persuade Republicans not to vote against Trump, but to vote for Scott.\n\nChris Petry, 50, from Mount Pleasant, said he's supporting Scott for that very reason. \"He has just a vision for the country that talks about unity,\" Petry told The Dispatch . \"A lot of people that I know who are Republican voters are looking for a change.\"\n\nMichael Warren is a senior editor at The Dispatch and is based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "Tim Scott Takes His 2024 Shot\n\nPlus: The array of possible GOP candidates still outside looking in.\n\nHappy Monday! Rough weekend for Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, whose campaign manager announced on Twitter over the weekend that he's quitting. (If we were less fastidious reporters, maybe we'd wonder why she didn't foresee this .)\n\nNORTH CHARLESTON, S.C.-Sen. Tim Scott announced his campaign for president Monday from his hometown, presenting himself as a consistent conservative with a positive, uplifting message. \"This is the freest and fairest land. Where you and I can go as high as our character, our grit, and our talent will take us,\" Scott said at the gym at Charleston Southern University, his alma mater. \"I bear witness to that. I testify to that.\"\n\nIt will be an uphill bid for the 57-year-old South Carolina Republican, who has financial resources but does not yet have the name recognition of other current and expected candidates in the field. Standing before a crowd of more than 1,000 and in front of a banner featuring his slogan \"Faith in America,\" Scott avoided direct shots at his GOP rivals-including former President Donald Trump-instead aiming his opening critique at President Joe Biden.\n\n\"Our nation, our values, and our people are strong, but our president is weak,\" he said. \"America is not a nation in decline. But under Joe Biden, we have become a nation in retreat.\"\n\nScott kicked off his campaign with endorsements from two of his colleagues, Sens. John Thune and Mike Rounds, both of South Dakota. Thune delivered the opening prayer Monday morning. Well-liked in the Senate, Scott is likely to see more endorsements from other Republican senators. Cory Gardner, the former Colorado senator who chairs a pro-Scott Super PAC, told The Dispatch he has been talking regularly to his former colleagues about supporting Scott.\n\nA number of former elected Republican officials were also in attendance, including former Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, who co-chairs Scott's campaign. Two from South Carolina were also spotted: former congressman and U.S. Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney and former congressman and Gov.  Mark Sanford. When asked by The Dispatch if he was endorsing Scott for president, Sanford said he was not doing anything \"formal.\"\n\n\"I'm just here as a longtime friend,\" Sanford said.\n\nWith around $22 million on hand, Scott begins his run for president as one of the best-funded candidates. His campaign is making a show of financial force this week with a $6 million initial buy for TV, radio, and digital ads in the two earliest states of the primary season, Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nAnd the pro-Scott super PAC, which is rebranding itself from Opportunity Matters to Trust In the Mission (or TIM) PAC, will play some role in boosting Scott's presidential bid. A TIM PAC billboard could be spotted on the interstate in North Charleston Monday morning. Onstage Monday morning, Scott pointed out that Larry Ellison, one of the wealthiest men in the world and a primary benefactor of the PAC, was in the crowd.\n\nScott joins a Republican field that already includes the frontrunner, Trump, as well as another South Carolinian, former governor and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. She has been a close political ally, having appointed Scott in late 2012 to the U.S. Senate when she was governor.\n\nWith two South Carolinians in the race, the state's all-important early primary-February 24, third on the calendar-will take on added significance. Haley was elected governor twice, while Scott has won three Senate elections, including a landslide victory in 2022. Scott's aides point to this most recent election, in which the senator got nearly 63 percent of the vote, as a good indication of Scott's familiarity among and popularity with the state's Republican primary voters.\n\nBut there is also the likelihood that Scott and Haley could split the available vote in the Palmetto State and hand a plurality winner-take-all victory to another leading contender. Trump won a plurality in the state's 2016 primary in part thanks to a large, divided field in which Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz came in a close second and third. And in 2024, Scott and Haley could be dealing with other rivals, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Vice President Mike Pence, in addition to Trump.\n\nScott aides also believe his money advantage will give the relatively unknown Scott staying power in spite of his current low poll numbers. The most recent Harvard-Harris poll, for instance, had Scott at just 1 percent among registered GOP primary voters nationally, while a Winthrop University poll of the South Carolina primary found him at 7 percent among registered Republicans in the state, behind Trump at 41 percent, DeSantis at 20, and Haley at 18.\n\nTim Scott isn't the only Republican hopping into the presidential pool this week: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is expected to follow the South Carolina senator on Wednesday. And plenty of others are over by the deck chairs putting on sunscreen.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence told CBS last month he'd make his 2024 decision public \"well before late June.\" New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu said recently he'd make his decision \"by late June at the latest.\" Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's launch will reportedly arrive \"in the coming days.\" North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum is already filming ads and preparing to jump in soon too.\n\nThat kind of enthusiasm is apparently contagious: Even former energy secretary and Texas Gov. Rick Perry has publicly daydreamed about mounting a third presidential run.\n\nFactor in the candidates already running-Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, Asa Hutchinson, Vivek Ramaswamy, Larry Elder-and you're looking at a primary much closer to the Republican clown car of 2016 (or the Democratic clown car of 2020) than the Trump v. DeSantis head-to-head some expected.\n\nMany of these candidates, of course, are currently pulling only a point or two-if that-in early polling. ( Today's RealClearPolitics polling average : Trump 56, DeSantis 19, Pence 5.6, Haley 4.3, Ramaswamy 3.6.)\n\nBut for the candidates, that's a tomorrow problem: Today's task is getting their names out there and building a fundraising base, particularly the small-dollar donors who will help them surmount likely new Republican National Committee donor thresholds to get on stage for primary debates beginning in August.\n\nThe wide field partly indicates DeSantis has lost some of his sense of inevitability as the only candidate viable enough to challenge Trump, although it's indicative of something else too. \"A wide and widening field always means one thing,\" national Republican strategist Brad Todd tells The Dispatch . \"The incumbent is so weak that the nomination is worth having.\"\n\nStill, there's no question, at least at the outset, that multiple candidates piling into the campaign car helps Trump. \"Frontrunners love a divided field,\" said David Carney, a GOP strategist in New Hampshire.\n\n\"It's early in the process and there is no reason for candidates not to explore their options,\" said Saul Anuzis, a Republican operative and former chair of the Michigan GOP. \"DeSantis has to try and become the consensus alternative to Trump, while ironically, both Trump and the other candidates want to keep the process open for as long as they can.\"\n\nA mammoth field also intensifies the spotlight-if that's possible-on the early nominating states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, which will sift the electoral wheat from the chaff and likely spark a mass exodus from the race.\n\n\"Remember, it's not how many people get in this summer,\" said longtime Iowa strategist Dave Kochel. \"It's how many people get out before South Carolina, which will likely tell us who the nominee will be.\"\n\nBut the rush of candidates jockeying for third place after those early nominating contests significantly complicates DeSantis' own early strategy: going for broke in Iowa in the hope of shattering Trump's narrative of inevitability there.\n\n\"We expect to be unable to pay all of our bills in early June, and possibly as soon as June 1. And I will continue to update Congress, but I certainly haven't changed my assessment. So I think that's a hard deadline ... The odds of reaching June 15 while being able to pay all of our bills is quite low.\"\n\n-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on NBC's Meet the Press , May 21, 2023\n\nDavid M.

      "text": "How Tim Scott Wins\n\nHe doesn't. Unless ...\n\nOnly three Republicans are capable of mounting consequential presidential candidacies, I think. One has been in the race since November , another will announce later this week .\n\nThe third is Tim Scott, who launched his campaign today.\n\nEveryone else, from Mike Pence on down, is a prisoner of events. Unless lightning strikes Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, none has any hope of becoming the nominee.\n\nScott is different. He controls his own destiny, to a degree .\n\nImagining a scenario in which an authoritarian from Florida isn't at the top of the ballot in November 2024 is like asking a science fiction writer to imagine how civilization would operate if the laws of physics were entirely different. It's an exercise in creative weirdness requiring outlandish flights of fancy.\n\nBut the \"Scott wins\" scenario is less outlandish than, say, the \"Nikki Haley wins\" alternative. It's the difference between speculating what life on Earth would look like if gravity were slightly weaker than it is versus what life would look like if gravity didn't exist.\n\nScott is unusual in that he's the only credible candidate in the race for whom there's no downside to challenging Trump. (I stress: credible. Sorry, Vivek.)\n\nBefore this is over, DeSantis will make mortal enemies of a meaningful fraction of Trump diehards. Pence and Haley will confirm that they're has-beens with no national future. But Scott is likely to make a good impression, raise his name recognition considerably, then return to a very safe seat in the U.S. Senate where he can pile up dough for 2028.\n\nEveryone likes him, an unusual quality for a Republican politician of this era, so he's unlikely to be attacked by other candidates unless he makes a major move in the polls. \"A big step up from Ron DeSanctimonious\" is how Trump greeted his new rival's announcement this morning. That tone will change if Scott begins to rise, but even Trump may find that his rhetorical blows don't land as hard on an appealing opponent as they do on the glowering DeSantis.\n\nI stand by my assessment from February . The realistic best-case scenario for Scott in running is becoming vice president. The worst-case scenario is that he makes lots of new friends on the trail, gains influence in the party, and becomes a coveted endorsement ahead of the South Carolina primary after dropping out early. As worst-case scenarios go, one could hardly ask for more.\n\nBut what about the less realistic scenario where he actually wins? Does one exist?\n\nLet's start here: I think he has a reasonably realistic chance of overtaking DeSantis.\n\nFinancially, he's loaded for bear. He starts the race with $22 million in the bank left over from his last Senate campaign and he's putting it to use . His years on the Senate Banking and Finance Committees have acquainted him with many titans of industry, some of whom have ponied up for the super PAC that's supporting him. Oracle founder Larry Ellison has donated $30 million alone, no doubt with more to come.\n\nScott's popularity on the Hill has also positioned him to earn endorsements. The two senators from South Dakota, John Thune and Mike Rounds , are already supporting him; others will surely follow if and when his polling proves he's for real. Normally being endorsed by Washington Republicans is a badge of dishonor in a GOP primary, but in Scott's case I think it helps more than it hurts. His first task as a candidate is breaking from the pack of non-Trump non-DeSantis also-rans somehow. A drumbeat of prominent endorsements will distinguish him.\n\nAll told, you see what I mean when I say that Scott controls his own destiny-somewhat. He has the cash and the connections to make a splash.\n\nHe also has a distinctive credential that his opponents, Trump and DeSantis included, lack.\n\nIt seems farcically preposterous to imagine a black man winning a majority of votes in a party consumed by white identity politics , whose favorite television broadcaster is prone to musing about racial differences in styles of fisticuffs . If you understand Trump's movement as an expression of nostalgic cultural revanchism by older white people-it's right there in the slogan -then Tim Scott seems singularly unsuited to lead it. Yet the fact remains that African American candidates performed conspicuously well in each of the last two competitive Republican presidential primaries.\n\nLittle-known businessman Herman Cain reached 26 percent in the polls in October 2011, briefly overtaking Mitt Romney for the lead before fading. Four years later, neurosurgeon Ben Carson became the only candidate in a huge Republican field to ever overtake Trump, reaching 24.8 percent before fading as well. Just last week, Daniel Cameron smoked his two white opponents in Kentucky's GOP gubernatorial primary by winning more votes than they did combined .\n\nSuch is the base's enthusiasm for black conservatives that Candace Owens is frequently volunteered by right-wing focus groups as presidential material, according to political consultant Sarah Longwell.\n\nConservative African Americans offer the Republican base what no other political figure can, confirmation from within the Democratic Party's most loyal racial demographic that the right's cultural vision for the country is the correct one. The prospect of a member of that demographic carrying the right's message nationally into combat with the left has a special potency that Trump and DeSantis can't match.\n\nAnd Scott knows it. The degree to which he's leaning into the idea of his own personal success story as an unanswerable rebuke to American leftism is arresting. \"Our party and our nation are standing at a time for choosing: Victimhood or victory? Grievance or greatness?\" he said at one point in today's campaign launch. Then: \"I'm living proof that America is the land of opportunity and not the land of oppression.\"\n\nThis is a man who knows his audience.\n\n\"I'm the candidate the far left fears the most ... When I pushed back on President Biden, they even called me the N-word.\"\n\n- Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) after announcing his 2024 presidential bid pic.twitter.com/inFZhnAPUD\n\n- The Recount (@therecount) May 22, 2023\n\nYou've heard Trump say, \" I am your retribution ,\" yes? Tim Scott is offering a strong brew of his own: I am your vindication .\n\nOne Scott adviser put it plainly. \"The really big point at the end is going to be about how Tim's life disproves the lies of the left-shows you that there is no ceiling on how high you can climb with opportunity and with individual responsibility,\" he told Politico . Structural racism, white privilege, \"wokeness\": If you're a white right-winger who chafes at progressive cant about the struggles of minorities in America, the person of Tim Scott is a smoking gun that your skepticism not only isn't racist, it's warranted. It's correct on the merits.\n\nDeSantis could pass a thousand anti-DEI bills in Florida and never achieve that.\n\nThis is why Scott's stalwart pre-Trump conservatism isn't as much of a liability for him in a post-conservative party as one might think. (Most Republican voters don't care much about policy to begin with, which is how Tea Party conservatism could give way to Trumpism overnight.) He may lack the populist credentials of Trump and DeSantis but on the crucial metrics of \"challenging woke ideas\" and \"making liberals angry,\" nothing can touch the spectacle of a black man mocking left-wing pieties about race. Scott might not even touch on policy much on the trail; his pitch, essentially, will be that nominating him would own the libs in a way nothing ever has or ever will.\n\nAnd the nastier Democrats are in questioning his racial authenticity as he goes about his campaign, the more they'll appear to prove his point.\n\n\"He's got Clarence Thomas syndrome, that's what it is.\"\n\n- \"The View\" co-host Whoopi Goldberg, as the panel reacts to Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) announcing his 2024 presidential candidacy pic.twitter.com/EMzEOGLxQb\n\n- The Recount (@therecount) May 22, 2023\n\nScott understands that the left's acidic scorn- they'll show you who they fear -is one of his greatest potential assets, destined to endear him to Republican voters. No wonder he made a point of noting it in his speech this morning.\n\nAll of this creates a potential problem for DeSantis.\n\nIt's easy to imagine Scott creeping up in the polls on the strength of aggressive ad spending, then capitalizing on the first primary debate to launch himself into contention.\n\nDeSantis will be the focus of that debate, especially if Trump doesn't show. He'll be gang-tackled by the rest of the field while Scott does his cheerful \"I'm your enemy's worst cultural nightmare\" pitch, with no one laying a glove on him. If DeSantis performs badly, the many traditional conservatives who are backing him reluctantly because he's the most viable alternative to Trump (like me, say) will feel the flop sweat and start looking for a back-up.\n\nTim Scott, a dogmatic small-government Republican with charm to burn, is the obvious landing spot. As a devout and outspoken Christian, he's also well-suited culturally to Iowa. If Republican support there begins shifting from DeSantis toward Scott after the debate, the governor might never recover.\n\nScott even has an electability pitch, hypothetically, that DeSantis can't match. The governor won 13 percent of the black vote in Florida in November, in line with the 12 percent Trump received nationally in 2020. Those numbers are an improvement over the Obama era, with black men (especially younger black men ) showing growing interest in the GOP lately, but there's lots of room to expand. If nominating an African American meant even just a few extra percentage points of the black vote for Republicans, Joe Biden would have a daunting math problem in states like Pennsylvania and Georgia.\n\nI wouldn't say that Scott is likely to overtake DeSantis in the polls. But it's probable enough that you don't need force majeure to explain how it might happen.\n\nScott overtaking Trump would require force majeure .\n\nIt's too difficult to imagine the Great White Hope being knocked at last from his perch atop the party by, of all people, a black longshot candidate. Especially one who talks like this : \"I have found that people are starving for hope. They're starving for an optimistic, positive message that is anchored in conservative values.\" Hopefulness and positivity, let alone conservative values, are ... not virtues I typically associate with the modern Republican Party.\n\nTrump has built a base of fanatic messianic support on the right preaching that America is terrible and only he can save it. Scott, essentially, is arguing that America is wonderful and his ascension to the Senate in the first state to secede from the Union before the Civil War proves it. For the party to suddenly shift from Trumpism to Scottism would be as disorienting and unlikely as shifting from, er, Tea Party conservatism to Trumpism.\n\nIf you had to write a scenario in which Scott beats Trump, you'd start with the one I sketched above about Scott overtaking DeSantis. Then would come force majeure , with Trump suffering a health crisis or facing criminal charges so grave and credible that undecided Republicans would be forced to grapple seriously with his electability instead of rallying behind him as usual. Consistent polling showing Scott performing much better head-to-head against Biden than Trump does would further encourage them to do so.\n\nThe clearer it became that either Trump or Scott will be the nominee, the less money available there'd be for the also-rans. They'd begin to drop out and most of them, if not all, would endorse Scott. He'd consolidate most of the anti-Trump vote. Then he'd win Iowa with help from evangelical conservatives (and maybe a few Trump-hating Democrats who insisted on participating in the GOP caucus). After that, even Trump couldn't halt his momentum.\n\nSeems unlikely, no?\n\nOne problem with my scenario is that there probably aren't enough non-populist votes in a modern Republican primary for Scott to prevail even if he won all of them. A sizable chunk of DeSantis' support comes from populists who prefer the governor to Trump for various reasons but prefer Trump to any \"establishment\" politician. If DeSantis were to flame out of the race, those voters are switching to Trump, not to Scott. Which means the senator will need not only to unite the non-populist bloc but also somehow convince a meaningful share of the MAGA base to abandon its hero and embrace a sunny, Reagan-esque African American \"happy warrior\" as their standard-bearer instead.\n\nA movement of dour, aging white authoritarians is probably going to stick with the dour, aging white authoritarian, right?\n\nScott also has a significant political liability that Trump can exploit if forced to do so. The senator is willing, even eager, to assure Republicans that most left-wing messaging about racial politics is inflammatory nonsense. Most, I stress, but not all.\n\n\"While I thank God I have not endured bodily harm, I have, however, felt the pressure applied by the scales of justice when they are slanted,\" [Scott] said in 2016, after a series of police shootings of Black men and the shooting of officers in Dallas. \"I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you are being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself.\"\n\n...\n\nHe initially promoted bills to increase the use of body cameras and the tracking of police shootings. When protests exploded in 2020 after the killing of George Floyd, he took on a deeper and more formal role, writing Republicans' legislative response to the crisis.\n\nWhat came out of that was the Justice Act, which, among other things, would have funded de-escalation training, outlawed chokeholds and made officers' disciplinary records from past police departments available to new departments considering hiring them.\n\n\"Police shouldn't choke people\" isn't the sort of belief that would end a talented politician's chances at higher office in a sane party, but in a party as performatively feral as Trump's GOP, where brutality is a measure of ideological commitment , it's a problem. You can imagine what a demagogue as talented and ruthless as Trump would do with that if Scott ever threatened him in the polls. It's no coincidence that the \" thin blue line \" flag began to feature prominently at Trump rallies in 2020 as a symbolic retort to the George Floyd protests. On one side are the forces of chaos, violence, and Black Lives Matter-ing; on the other side are the forces of order, authority, and white identity politics. Which side is Tim Scott really on?\n\nHis race will be a political asset to him in the campaign right up until the moment it becomes a major liability. If he believes that America's police need to be more rather than less careful with the safety of people in their custody then he's not our kind of African American after all.\n\nHe's their kind.\n\nIt's unlikely that he'll ever threaten Trump in the polls, though.\n\nFar more likely is that he'll end up as his running mate. Trump wants a woman VP in 2024, it's often said, but here again Scott controls his own destiny to a degree. If he charms Republican voters, if his optimism feels like a tonic to those exasperated by MAGA catastrophism, if his conservatism attracts the sort of traditional right-winger who might otherwise boycott a third Trump general election, the party might need him on the ballot.\n\nNothing would make the American right happier than to have an African American candidate in a general election assuring swing voters that Democrats are the real racists. It's just that that guy can't be the candidate at the top of the ticket, which is reserved for the avatar of white grievance. The senator can prove which side he's on, conclusively, by helping that avatar win a second term. Prepare for Trump/Scott.\n\nNick Catoggio is a staff writer at The Dispatch and is based in Texas.

      "text": "Nikki Haley and Tim Scott's Collision Course\n\nPlus: Donald Trump hopes to shut down more GOP debates.\n\nHappy Friday! We were just putting this newsletter to bed when the news broke that California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the longest-serving senator in her state's history, has died at age 90. Our thoughts are with her family.\n\nSIMI VALLEY, California-The spat was inorganic, entirely manufactured by Fox Business moderator Dana Perino. Yet the verbal fisticuffs between Nikki Haley and Tim Scott late in the second televised Republican debate exposed a simmering South Carolina rivalry with the potential to influence the GOP presidential nomination.\n\n\"We certainly didn't initiate that,\" Haley campaign spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas told reporters immediately afterward. \"I think it says more about his campaign and him trying to get some traction, quite frankly, than her.\"\n\n\"He was not afraid to make contrasts. I think that's what you saw tonight,\" Scott campaign spokesman Matt Gorman countered. \"He's going to stand up for what he believes in.\"\n\nThe prime-time faceoff was roughly three-quarters over when Perino pointedly asked Scott why he deserves the presidency more than Haley, who as South Carolina governor appointed him to fill a vacant U.S. Senate seat nearly 11 years ago. Both obliged.\n\nScott raised some easily debunked claims about Haley's tenure as governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations-including, of all things, the price of the curtains installed at the American ambassador's residence in New York. Meanwhile, Haley blamed Scott for Washington dysfunction and trillions of dollars of deficit spending that is hardly his fault.\n\nThe squabble , here at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, devolved into something of a neighborly shouting match. Perhaps the only interesting moment came when Haley looked across the stage at Scott, smiling, and dared him to \"bring it, Tim.\" Still, the episode was not insignificant, even with former President Donald Trump dominating the primary.\n\nHaley and Scott have always enjoyed a cordial relationship, Republican insiders in South Carolina tell The Dispatch . Indeed, there's been little sign a rivalry exists at all since they launched competing White House bids earlier this year. But with Haley and Scott similarly vying to become the consensus alternative to Trump by running as traditional Reagan-era conservatives, their tête-à-tête Wednesday evening could be a preview of things to come-especially in Iowa.\n\nHaley and Scott both hope a strong finish in the January 15 caucuses vaults them over Trump and puts them on a fast track to the 2024 nomination. Only then would the South Carolina primary, where they would compete for the same home turf, become relevant. But whether they cancel each other out-or one sidelines the other-could go a long way toward determining whether any of the former president's primary opponents can chip away at his big lead and mount a campaign capable of upending him.\n\nFor now, Haley appears to have the momentum, movement initially sparked after a standout performance at the first debate in Milwaukee in late August. She has surpassed Scott in national polls and early state surveys, and generally seems to have hit her stride as a presidential contender. Scott, meanwhile, has struggled to find his footing months after a solid launch. These were all points the Haley campaign has been emphasizing since the conclusion of the second debate.\n\n\"She's resonating in early polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, she's consistently second now,\" Perez-Cubas said. \"The rubber's hitting the road right now. I think the field is going to consolidate; it's already consolidating a little bit, it's going to continue to do that-she's going to continue to rise.\"\n\nThe next Republican primary debate won't take place until November, but one prominent Republican has apparently already seen enough.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who has not deigned to appear at either of the first two GOP debates, is calling for the Republican National Committee to cancel the rest of the slate, claiming his polling lead is big enough that additional voter scrutiny of the race's other candidates is pointless.\n\n\"They have to stop the debates,\" Trump told the Daily Caller in an interview Thursday. \"Because it is just bad for the Republican Party. They are not going anywhere. There is not going to be a breakout candidate.\"\n\nTrump adviser Chris LaCivita went further in a post-debate statement: \"The RNC should immediately put an end to any further primary debates so we can train our fire on Crooked Joe Biden and quit wasting time and money that could be going to evicting Biden from the White House.\"\n\nAnd during his Michigan speech Wednesday night, Trump went out of his way to let even more air out of his competitors' tires, dismissing them as \"job candidates\" for posts in his eventual second administration and suggesting he was unlikely to make any of them his vice presidential pick.\n\nAs late as Wednesday, RNC officials were expressing hope that Trump would eventually show up to debate. \"Well, we have more debates coming up-we really hope he'll join us,\" RNC national spokesperson Madison Gesiotto Gilbert told CBS News before the debate. \"It's a great opportunity for us as a party to show that contrasting vision of what we as Republicans have to offer to Americans that are unhappy with the way things have been going with Biden for two and a half years.\"\n\nThe RNC did not respond to a request for comment. But one RNC member tells The Dispatch the former president's demand isn't going to be treated seriously. \"Hell no to canceling the debates,\" this individual says. \"I think it's all Trump's natural bluster.\"\n\nIt's true that Trump's polling lead has only continued to grow in recent weeks, and Wednesday's debate-a chaotic proceeding with too many candidates, poor moderation, and a bevy of oddly off-topic questions-is unlikely to do much to move the needle on its own.\n\nAnd it's also true that, if Trump does emerge from the presidential primary the victor, he'll go into the general election against Joe Biden in worse shape than if he'd run unopposed. It's a political truism that messy primaries hurt their victors; it's one reason incumbents enjoy a significant advantage in American politics.\n\nAnd Biden has already been more than happy to turn Trump's rivals' words against him. The president tweeted a video Thursday of Ron DeSantis' most strident Trump critique from the night before: \"Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be on this stage tonight. He owes it to you to defend his record where they added $7.8 trillion to the debt. That set the stage for the inflation we have now.\"\n\nBut Trump, while the heavy favorite as things stand now, also overstates the degree to which the primary cake is already baked. A CBS News/YouGov poll this week found that only 20 percent of Republican voters in Iowa were considering only Trump for their vote, while 48 percent were considering both Trump and other candidates, and 31 percent weren't considering him at all. In New Hampshire, 23 percent were locked on the former president, with 43 percent considering him among other options, and 34 percent not considering him at all.\n\nBesides, since when does Trump trust public opinion polls, which he has routinely dismissed throughout his political career? \"I'm not losing, because those are fake polls,\" he told Fox's Chris Wallace ahead of the 2020 election. \"They were fake in 2016 and now they're even more fake.\"\n\nWhen asked about this, Trump spokesman Steven Cheung told The Dispatch that, \"Voters are going to nominate President Trump. There is no disputing that. He will be the nominee and he will go on to crush Crooked Joe Biden.\"\n\nA strategist involved with a rival GOP campaign told The Dispatch he's \"honestly surprised\" Trump didn't call for the debates to be canceled sooner.\n\n\"Any time Trump's rivals get a chance to be in front of millions of Americans, it is a problem for the former president,\" the strategist said. \"The field should be requesting more debates.\"\n\nStill, only 9.3 million people tuned into the latest debate, Fox News said Thursday, down from 13 million viewers for the first production. It was the lowest viewership for any Republican debate since 2015.\n\n\"Crooked Joe Biden is back like a wretched old vulture trying to finish off his prey-can you believe it? I don't know.

      "text": "Sen. Tim Scott Joins the Race\n\nPlus: Vacant offices spell trouble for commercial real estate.\n\nHappy Tuesday! WhatsApp-a messaging app used daily by 2 billion people-will now allow users to edit messages for 15 minutes after sending them.\n\nWe won't need that: TMD never has typoes.\n\nAfter months of reports that he would challenge Trump for the Republican presidential nomination-after the fundraising, the demure refusal to confirm or deny, the trips to key swing states-South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott officially announced his candidacy Monday. A devout Christian and longtime conservative with a made-for-politics backstory, Scott still faces a mighty steep climb out of single-digit polling to secure the nomination.\n\nDeclan is out of the office as we write this edition of TMD , so he can't stop us from shamelessly commending to you his 2020 in-depth profile of Scott. But here's the short version: Raised by a single mom, Scott hoped to attend college on a football scholarship before a car crash derailed his dreams. He became a Christian during college and sold insurance before working his way from local to national politics, defeating the son of segregationist Strom Thurmond for a House seat. Then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley-now Scott's opponent in the presidential race-appointed him to the Senate in 2013, and he won his latest reelection in November with a strong 63 percent of the vote.\n\nThe South Carolina senator has long resisted making his race the center of his political identity. His friend former Rep. Trey Gowdy told Declan how Scott liked to introduce himself: \"I am a Christian, who is a conservative, and you may have noticed that I'm black.\" But Scott has spoken up more on the topic in recent years-telling personal stories of discrimination, criticizing then-President Trump's comments after the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and sinking two Trump judicial nominees with poor records on race. After the murder of George Floyd by a police officer, Scott helped drive police reform negotiations, though the package he helped craft did not become law.\n\nYet Scott refuses to characterize America as systemically racist. In his announcement speech , he declared his rise from poverty to Congress as \"proof that America is the land of opportunity, not a land of oppression.\" And he hit Democrats for criticizing his conservative principles. \"I'm the candidate the far left fears the most,\" Scott said. \"When I cut your taxes, they called me a prop. When I re-funded the police, they called me a token. When I pushed back on President Biden, they even called me the n-word. I disrupt their narrative.\"\n\nScott's candidacy will test the appeal of an optimistic message in a Republican Party dominated by grievance politics and anger. He has been a consistent and sometimes tough critic of Biden, but Scott paints a sunny picture of America, heavily reliant on his personal story. \"Our party and our nation are standing at a time for choosing: Victimhood or victory,\" Scott said, suggesting Republicans will choose \"grievance or greatness.\"\n\nScott's already been endorsed by South Dakota Sens. John Thune and Mike Rounds-with Rounds declaring Scott \"the closest to Ronald Reagan that you're going to see.\" Scott starts with $22 million in the bank and he's already made a near-$6 million ad buy in Iowa and New Hampshire to boost his campaign through the first scheduled GOP debate in August.\n\nOne of the key questions facing Scott, and every other Republican candidate, is how he'll handle Donald Trump. Like most elected Republicans Scott has been privately critical of Trump's behavior and character but reluctant to highlight differences with the former president in his public comments. In a February appearance on Sean Hannity's Fox News program, Scott demurred when asked about his policy differences with the former president.\n\n\"What are the differences in terms of policy positions that, for example, you may have with President Trump?\" Hannity asked. \"Probably not very many at all,\" Scott responded. \"I am so thankful that we had President Trump in office.\"\n\nIn an interview Monday with NBC's Tom Llamas, Scott was similarly cautious about criticizing Trump. Asked again what sets him apart from the former president, Scott pitched himself as a persuader instead of going on the offense. \"The question is what do the voters want in their president?\" he told NBC . \"They want someone who can persuade on the issues that matter the most to them.\" When asked about Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election, Scott said: \"We can do two things here. We can have a conversation about President Trump or we can have a conversation about my vision for the future. I'm going to stay on my vision for the future.\"\n\nIn fact, Trump greeted Scott's campaign announcement with comparative grace, noting they worked together on economic Opportunity Zones in the wake of Trump's 2017 comments on the Charlottesville rally. \"Good luck to Senator Tim Scott in entering the Republican Presidential Primary Race,\" Trump posted on Truth Social . \"It is rapidly loading up with lots of people, and Tim is a big step up from Ron DeSanctimonious, who is totally unelectable.\"\n\nThen again, it's easy to be nice to someone you don't consider a threat. While it's far too soon for national polls to provide a reliable barometer of election outcomes, Scott has been polling in the single digits and is currently below 2 percent while Trump has climbed to about 56 percent in RealClearPolitics polling averages . Scott's reluctance to challenge Trump directly has driven speculation that he may be campaigning to be Trump's running mate - a possibility Scott dismissed in March as \" insulting .\"\n\nFor more on Scott's announcement and the state of the race, see the latest Dispatch Politics newsletter.\n\nNo one can say the captains of industry aren't trying to keep the fluorescent lights on.\n\nIn January, Disney CEO Bob Iger deemed in-person interaction an essential ingredient for creativity and announced employees would be required to return to the office four days a week. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy cited similar reasoning as he ordered the company's employees to report to the office three days a week starting this month. And Tesla CEO Elon Musk upped the rhetorical ante last week, declaring remote work a \"morally wrong\" excuse to phone it in.\n\nBut corporate giants' efforts to get butts back in swivel chairs may not be enough to save the sad office salad. Remote work has persisted beyond COVID-19 precautions with no signs of fully bouncing back. The trend threatens commercial real estate business models and has city leaders brainstorming what's next for their downtowns.\n\nThis year has been disappointing for building owners hoping it would mark a return to pre-pandemic office occupancy levels. Exact figures vary , but some companies estimate national office vacancy rates are near 20 percent , and the numbers keep hitting record highs. Even CoStar Group's relatively sanguine estimate of around 13 percent vacancy is worse than at the peak of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nNumbers are particularly bleak in superstar cities. Brokerage firm JLL reported a 16 percent vacancy rate in Manhattan in the first quarter of 2023, and the empty square footage could fill some 26 Empire State Buildings. On the West Coast, commercial real estate firm CBRE reports 30 percent vacancy in San Francisco-up from just 3 percent in 2019. Just 10 percent of office buildings account for more than 80 percent of occupancy loss by square footage between the beginning of 2020 and the end of 2022, according to a CBRE analysis . These \"hardest-hit buildings\" are disproportionately located in the downtown areas of coastal cities.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's rate hikes put extra pressure on the sector, as commercial real estate loans get renewed at higher interest rates. \"More than 50 percent of the $2.9 trillion in commercial mortgages will need to be renegotiated in the next 24 months when new lending rates are likely to be up by 350 to 450 basis points,\" Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer for Morgan Stanley, said last month . With so much vacant space exerting downward rent price pressures, building owners may struggle to make up for these higher loan costs with higher rents.\n\nAnd when buildings sit empty, the financial fallout extends to the constellation of downtown lunch places, dry cleaners, watercooler delivery services, and public transportation networks set up to serve office workers. Even a mostly in-person workweek can pinch restaurants and bars-hybrid workers often stay home on Fridays, drying up the stream of customers fleeing from office blocks to downtown bars to ring in the weekend.\n\nStill, there are some reasons for optimism for building and local business owners. For one, a 20 percent vacancy rate also means an 80 percent occupancy rate-office work may never return to pre-pandemic levels, but the nation's downtowns have far from emptied out. For another, even the deepest office space woes don't necessarily spell doom for the rest of commercial real estate. \"Industrial real estate, multifamily or apartment real estate, retail real estate, [and] hotels are all doing reasonably well,\" Richard Barkham, global chief economist at CBRE, told TMD .\n\nAnd the financial pressures of office building vacancies are a steady drip rather than a deadly cliff, giving owners and cities more time to respond. \"Leases are staggered, they don't all roll over at once,\" Ajay Rajadhyaksha, global chairman of research for Barclays, said last month . \"It is a problem, don't get me wrong, office vacancy rates are very high. There's a lot of office space available, but it's something that's going to play out over a long period of time, not all at once.\"\n\nBarkham agreed, emphasizing that even a broad economic downturn this year-perhaps brought on by the Fed's rate hikes-doesn't guarantee a 2008-style meltdown for the commercial real estate market. \"Even if there is a relatively sluggish recovery in 2024, that doesn't give us enough stress to cause a broad-based collapse in real estate values feeding into the banking sector [and] a great financial crisis sort of situation,\" he said.\n\nStill, this is all cold comfort for urban centers staring down significant short- and medium-term revenue losses-and long-term problems if they can't adjust to the realities of the new office market. In San Francisco, for instance, the near-30 percent vacancy rate-and a resulting drop in property values-has cratered property tax revenue, putting a hole in the city's budget. San Francisco spends about $14 billion a year , but officials expect to cut the budget by about $250 million this year and $500 million next year.\n\nMajor cities must adapt if they want to keep their edge. \"New York will need to recognize that the office market, especially its lower end, is likely to face years of vacancies,\" argued Harvard University economist Edward Glaeser and Carlo Ratti, director of the Senseable City Lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"The city's future depends on being able to attract and empower new residents-the creative class and everyone else-who might be tempted to settle down in other cities that are more affordable and convenient.\"\n\nNew York's leaders are trying to meet the moment. NYC Mayor Eric Adams began his term with an order for city employees to return to office five days a week but has recently suggested he may walk it back after facing difficulty recruiting employees. Meanwhile, Adams and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul released a comprehensive plan in December which included a goal of transforming NYC commercial districts into \"vibrant 24/7 destinations.\" Steps toward that end included improving public green spaces and making it easier to rezone buildings for new uses.\n\nOne popular idea for unused office space is converting it into housing, but that's not as simple as ripping up the cubicles. Offices tend to be wider and deeper than residential buildings with proportionately fewer windows per floor, so dividing them into apartment units is a tricky geometry problem. Residential buildings also require different kitchen, bathroom, and elevator configurations-and all these changes are costly. Lower Manhattan's 25 Water Street-the former office of the Daily News and other companies-was bought for $250 million but could cost more than double that to turn into housing. In some cases, it's cheaper to demolish and start fresh than convert.\n\nAll this takes time. \"Converting the land use, if not the building, out of office into residential and working on neighborhood creation-that doesn't happen overnight,\" Barkham told TMD . \"That's a 10-year program. But the sooner cities get on with it and show themselves creative and active in doing that, the quicker they'll reduce the stock of redundant space and get their tax base back.\"\n\nInsider : The stock market briefly dipped after a seemingly AI-generated hoax photo of an explosion near the Pentagon went viral.\n\nHave you noticed empty office buildings being repurposed in your town or city?\n\nDeclan Garvey is the executive editor at the Dispatch and is based in Washington, D.C.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nGrowing up in a poor, single parent household in North Charleston, South Carolina, a young Tim Scott grew accustomed to moving every few years, as well as the long hours his mom worked to keep a roof over their heads. After failing four classes his freshman year of high school, Tim's path forward was murky at best.\n\nBut thankfully, he had a mom who stuck with him, and met a mentor that showed him the wisdom of conservative principles. Through their belief and his own determination, Tim got his grades back on track, graduated from Charleston Southern University, and eventually built his own successful small business.\n\nThrough the lessons taught by his mentor, Tim developed his mission statement: to positively affect the lives of a billion people. That led him to public service, where he was elected to Charleston County Council, the South Carolina House of Representatives, the United States House of Representatives, and the United States Senate.\n\nSince joining the Senate in 2013, Senator Scott has been a national leader on efforts to bring opportunity to every American family. His signature legislation creating Opportunity Zones was passed as part of the 2017 tax reform package, and has the potential to bring billions of dollars of private investment into distressed communities across the country.\n\nAs he continues to lead on the implementation of the Opportunity Zones initiative, Senator Scott also plays a critical role in issues regarding workforce development, education and diversity. Whether it's tackling the skills gap, making sure children have access to the educational environment best suited for them, or working to bring everyone to the table to find solutions, Senator Scott will keep fighting for South Carolinians every single day he serves in the U.S. Senate.\n\nWhen I started my own business in South Carolina, I learned how hard it is to acquire capital.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nFOX Business senior correspondent Charlie Gasparino reacts to Congress grilling SEC Chair Gary Gensler on 'Cavuto: Coast to Coast.'\n\nLawmakers want the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) chair to be required to testify on Capitol Hill on a semi-annual basis.\n\nThat's according to Senate Republicans, who introduced new legislation on Tuesday that would extend oversight from provisions authorized under the Dodd-Frank Act, and in-turn mandate a biannual appearance before Congress to increase \"transparency and accountability.\"\n\nThe legislation, titled the Empowering Main Street in America Act, was introduced just hours before an announcement that a scheduled Wednesday hearing in the Senate Banking Committee with current SEC Chair Gary Gensler was postponed.\n\nThe hearing postponement comes as Gensler appeared separately Tuesday on Capitol Hill before the House Financial Services Committee, where the Chairman received criticism from both sides of the aisle.\n\nDOJ SUES VISA OVER DEBIT CARD MARKET MONOPOLY\n\nSenate Banking Committee Ranking Member Tim Scott, R-SC, bashed the postponement in a statement to FOX Business, remarking, \"A last-minute cancellation while still testifying before the House underscores what's wrong with the SEC under Gensler's leadership.\"\n\nScott went on to condemn Gensler's record at the Commission, declaring that Gensler's approach during his three-year term has been harmful to businesses.\n\nGary Gensler,Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), testifies during the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on \"Oversight of the US Securities and Exchange Commission\" on September 14, 2021 in Washington,DC.

Tim Scott, R-S.C., ripped apart Vice President Kamala Harris' economic agenda, which includes a price-fixing plan to address 'corporate price gouging.'\n\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., shredded Vice President Kamala Harris' economic proposal on Friday, which laid out a sweeping overhaul including broad cross-industry price-fixing and $25,000 government-subsidized down payments for first-time home buyers.\n\n\"The American people are smarter than Kamala Harris when it comes to the economy,\" the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Ranking Member told Fox News Digital in an interview.\n\n\"The 'price-gouging' that they've experienced has come at the hands of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden,\" Scott said. \"When you artificially stimulate the economy by the federal government and the Democrats spending trillions of dollars, the net effect is high inflation, high interest, high demand and lower supply.\"\n\n'RENT IS TOO DAMN HIGH': ROSEN PANNED FOR BIDEN-ALIGNED VOTES, HIGH HOUSING COSTS\n\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., ripped Vice President Kamala Harris' economic plan that includes price-fixing in the food industry. (Getty Images)\n\nScott explained, \"You cannot put trillions of dollars into our economy and not expect prices to go up.\"\n\nHarris' presidential campaign laid out her economic policy proposals on Friday morning ahead of her afternoon speech on the subject at a campaign stop in Raleigh, North Carolina. The agenda focuses on cracking down on corporate \"price gouging\" in the food industry, and Harris plans to implement a first-ever federal ban on it.\n\nAdditionally, Harris' plan would drastically expand the child tax credit, allowing up to $6,000 during a child's first year. The proposal would also extend prescription drug price caps to everyone rather than just senior citizens. It would further establish a $40 billion fund for assistance to local governments to build more housing, as well as take on landlords to prevent certain rent increases.\n\nDHS, FBI PROBED FOR INFO ON ALLEGED IRANIAN AGENT'S ASSASSINATION PLOT POSSIBLY TARGETING TRUMP\n\nAmericans are concerned about the economy ahead of the November election. (Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nThe plan quickly amassed criticism, mainly from Republicans. However, even a left-leaning Washington Post columnist panned the agenda. \"At best, this would lead to shortages, black markets and hoarding, among other distortions seen previous times countries tried to limit price growth by fiat,\" wrote columnist Catherine Rampell in an op-ed. \"(There's a reason narrower 'price gouging' laws that exist in some U.S. states are rarely invoked.) At worst, it might accidentally raise prices.\"\n\nScott eviscerated Harris' idea, slamming the vice president and her party for lacking \"understanding of the private sector.\"\n\nCriticizing her proposal for the government to provide $25,000 down payments to first-time homebuyers, the senator explained it \"will only make the demand higher, with the supply not moving - which means prices will go up [and] fewer people will be able to afford it.\"\n\n\"And frankly, unless they're going to embed financial literacy in any program, it only means there will be a higher level of default,\" he said.\n\n'PREGNANT PERSONS': OHIO SEN SHERROD BROWN SCRUBBED 'WOMEN' FROM BILL ON PREGNANCY\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign revealed its sweeping economic proposal on Friday.

Scott noted the \"Inflation Reduction Act actually increased inflation.\"\n\n\"The COVID relief package, that only had 1% for vaccines and less than 10% for COVID-related health, that was $1.7 trillion of spending that resulted, by June-July of [2022], in 9% inflation,\" he added.\n\nIn June 2022, following the passage of the President Biden and Harris-led spending packages, inflation broke records by rising above 9%, the largest yearly increase since 1981.\n\nWhen asked about the recent July inflation report, which showed it rising by a less-than-expected 2.9% during the month, Scott slammed the idea that it should be celebrated. He noted that the Federal Reserve aims for a target of 2% inflation.\n\n'PATH TO JUSTICE': DURBIN URGES AUSTIN TO RETHINK REVOKING 9/11 MASTERMINDS' PLEA DEALS\n\nSen.

We'll see what happens,\" he said.\n\nBanking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, is embroiled in a competitive re-election match in red state Ohio and faces a real risk of being unseated. Neither the vulnerable Democrat senator's campaign nor his office provided comment to Fox News Digital regarding whether he agreed with Harris' proposal.\n\nScott predicted the vice president's economic plan would face an uphill battle in Congress. \"No way in Hades would we allow the American people to suffer under four years of price manipulation, brought to you by Kamala Harris,\" he said, expressing confidence that Republicans would retake the Senate majority.\n\nThe senator has been speculated as a candidate for a role in Trump's potential second term, but he seemed to indicate he plans to stick around and lead the Banking Committee in a Republican-majority Senate. \"I am excited about being the chairman of the Banking Committee.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nSEC commissioner Hester Peirce discusses the agency's regulation plan for US companies on 'Cavuto: Coast to Coast.'\n\nFIRST ON FOX: Senate Banking Committee Ranking Member Tim Scott, R-S.C., will introduce a measure in the upper chamber on Wednesday attempting to overturn a controversial Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) climate rule that has drawn outrage from Republicans - and even some Democrats - FOX Business has learned.\n\nThe rule, adopted last month by the SEC, requires public companies to \"enhance and standardize climate-related disclosures\" in an effort to inform investors \"about the financial effects of climate-related risks on a registrant's operations and how it manages those risks,\" according to the SEC.\n\nThe climate rule was paused earlier this month, with the SEC issuing a stay on the rule while it defends itself from dual right- and left-wing litigation.\n\nIn announcing the new rule, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said, \"Investors get to decide which risks they want to take so long as companies raising money from the public make what President Franklin Roosevelt called 'complete and truthful disclosure.'\"\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler participates in a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council at the U.S. Treasury in Washington, D.C., on July 28, 2023. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nSOCIAL SECURITY CHECKS COULD INCREASE NEXT YEAR DUE TO COST-OF-LIVING CRISIS\n\n\"These final rules build on past requirements by mandating material climate risk disclosures by public companies and in public offerings. The rules will provide investors with consistent, comparable, and decision-useful information, and issuers with clear reporting requirements,\" Gensler added.\n\nThat announcement, however, was immediately denounced by Republican lawmakers, who accused the SEC of federal overreach.\n\nNow, Scott says he plans to employ the Congressional Review Act (CRA), a seldom-used oversight tool employed by Congress used to overturn rules issued by agencies such as the SEC.\n\nSen.

Over and over again, SEC Chair Gensler has disregarded the real-world impacts of his aggressive regulatory agenda in his dogged pursuit of left-wing political priorities. This rule is no exception,\" Scott said in a statement to FOX Business.\n\n\"The SEC's mission is to regulate our capital markets and ensure all Americans can safely share in their economic success - not to force a partisan climate agenda on American businesses,\" Scott continued.\n\nThe CRA currently has 34 cosponsors - more than enough needed for a discharge petition - and expands its list of supporters across the aisle, to West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin.\n\nThe CRA currently has 34 cosponsors - more than enough needed for a discharge petition - and expands its list of supporters across the aisle, to Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. (Scott Eisen/Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nLegal challenges have engulfed the rule since its introduction, with lawsuits filed by both Republicans and Democrats for differing reasons.\n\nFED'S POWELL SAYS INFLATION DATA THIS YEAR SHOWS A 'LACK OF PROGRESS'\n\nTwenty-five Republican attorneys general filed a lawsuit almost immediately after finalization of the rule. That was followed by litigation from various energy and commerce groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nMissouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who participated in the suit, condemned the Biden administration on X, saying, \"The mandate is part of Biden's radical green scheme to influence investments based on climate change theories instead of returns.\"\n\nConversely, the rule also found detractors from the progressive Sierra Club, which sued the SEC over allegations that the final rule \"will yield much less information about companies' exposure to climate-based risks than the [original] proposed rule would have.\"\n\nThe Sierra Club, in a statement announcing the lawsuit, wrote, \"While the SEC's final climate disclosure rule will provide investors with some much needed information, the Commission's arbitrary decision to remove robust emissions disclosure requirements and other key elements from the proposed rule falls short of what the law requires.\"\n\nThe path forward for Scott's CRA resolution is unclear in the Democratic-led Senate, but it currently enjoys the support of every Republican member on the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nScott, discussing the resolution, was critical of the SEC, offering a simple word of advice.\n\n\"This rule is federal overreach at its worst, and the SEC should stay in its lane,\" he said.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

      "text": "Sen. Tim Scott's $1M swing-state ad buy bets school choice will move voters, decide close races\n\nCampaign advertising tends to be one of two things: lifeless or ludicrous .\n\nSo the ads Sen. Tim Scott is sliding into swing states - which he revealed exclusively to The Post - should get voters' attention.\n\n\"The left says the Republican Party is a racist party. I'm telling you something different,\" Scott begins most of the ads, staring straight at the camera.\n\n\"Nothing is more racist than Democrats that chain poor black and brown kids to failing schools, robbed of a quality education, robbed of their future,\" the black South Carolinian continues. \"Why? Because of power. It's wrong.\"\n\nHe closes with a line promoting each state's GOP Senate challenger.\n\nIn Nevada, where Scott held an education-themed event with the candidate last month, he says, \"We need Sam Brown in the Senate. Sam understands school choice, breaks the chains and sets kids free.\"\n\nThey're the most striking spots from any candidate or political-action committee.\n\nScott's Great Opportunity PAC is spending a full $1 million to place these ads - aimed at parent and persuadable-minority voters - on connected TV in competitive Senate races, mostly in the swing states: first Nevada, Ohio and Montana, then expanding to Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\n\"So often I've made the statement that America is not a racist country, and I get so much pushback. And frankly, I'm not suggesting that there's not racism somewhere in America,\" Scott told The Post. \"There's nothing more racist than trapping a poor kid on the South Side of Chicago with a single mom into a place where he can't leave. That, to me, only cements my notion that if we want to talk about racism, let's go to big blue cities and talk about the challenges that we're seeing.\"\n\nThat's just what party leader Donald Trump did this month.\n\nThe former president dived into Democratic stronghold Milwaukee - \"home of the first and oldest school choice\" program, he said - to promote educational freedom alongside students and graduates of the program.\n\nTrump proclaimed education is \"the civil-rights issue of our age.\"\n\nIt's a message Scott, who gave up his own presidential bid and endorsed the ex-prez in the primary, has been sounding for years.\n\n\"That issue resonates,\" he said, \"beyond racial lines. African Americans, whites, Hispanics, Asians, all agree that school choice should be their choice, not ours as politicians or elected officials, but their choice. And the ads reinforce the notion that there are parents who will vote for Republicans\" - \"frankly, who will vote for their kids, no matter the partisan label.\"\n\nIndeed, as Corey DeAngelis recently pointed out in these pages , \" support for education freedom crosses party lines.\"\n\nSchool choice illustrates that core conservative concerns with choice, competition and decentralization actually fit the needs and self-interest of many voters who haven't traditionally looked to the GOP.\n\n\"Our values as Republicans,\" Scott said, \"are best seen through the prism of a black grandmother or Hispanic family. They're interested in making sure that their children, just like the rest of America, have a quality education. They want their daughters not to have to compete against boys in sports. They want to make sure that the future of this country is a meritocracy. They just want to make sure that they're included in that merit-based system when we educate people.\"\n\nHe put it bluntly: \"I've oftentimes said the question that people want answered isn't 'Is the American Dream real?'\" It's \"Is the American Dream real for me?\"\n\n\"The difference between those two\" is where Republicans offer answers - and can make inroads with needed voters.\n\n\"The truth is the decision makers in households around health care, finance and education are consistently women, whether that's a single-parent household or two-parent household. And so if you want to focus on getting good results with women voters, talk about the issues that they talk about. And I can't think of a more important issue to my mother than her sons,\" Scott said.\n\nAnd school choice is a proven winner at the ballot box, the senator argues.\n\n\"I go back to being on the campaign trail with Rick Scott a number of years ago, and one of the issues he was running on, in his final year as governor, for Senate was, in fact, the issue of educational choice. I look at Ron DeSantis, who was the beneficiary of Rick Scott's work,\" he said.\n\n\"Most experts agree,\" he continued, \"Ron DeSantis won his race against a black candidate because single mothers voted for their kids and not the partisan label of their choice necessarily.\" The Florida governor won in 2018 with 18% of the black female vote, per exit polls.\n\nAnd Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds \"was able to defeat a few state senators and state House members who stood in the way of school choice.\"\n\nScott, raised by a single mom to become the first black senator elected from the South since Reconstruction, is optimistic education will transform lives - and the nation.\n\n\"The story will be told five years looking back on the number of changes that we've seen in our country because more parents have options for their kids, and they started realigning their voting records with prioritizing their kids first,\" he said. \"Our kids are smarter than we are. Why not give them the tools to prove it?\"\n\nAdvertisement"

Tim Scott received a ringing endorsement from one particular South Carolina voter over the weekend.\n\nScott, a lifelong bachelor, popped the question Saturday night to his girlfriend, Mindy Noce, whom he publicly revealed amid a slew of media curiosity over his dating life during his brief run for president last year.\n\nScott, who reps the Palmetto State, announced his engagement to Noce on Sunday in a short and sweet social media post that showed the moment he got down on one knee at a Kiawah Island beach in South Carolina to ask the interior designer to marry him.\n\n\"She said YES,\" Scott tweeted. \"Mindy, thank you for making me the luckiest man in the world.\"\n\nHe also cited Proverbs 18:22 in the Bible: \"He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord.\"\n\nScott, 58, slipped an engagement ring on Noce's finger a day after he officially endorsed Donald Trump for president.\n\nThe only black Republican in the US Senate had his own presidential ambitions, but dropped out of the race in November after he didn't gain much traction with voters.\n\nScott debuted Noce as his girlfriend on stage at the third GOP presidential debate in Miami as curiosity - and apprehension among donors - over his love life grew.\n\nNoce is a Charleston-based design and renovation consultant and mom of three kids. The two met about a year ago after being introduced at church and connecting over Bible study, Scott told the Washington Post.\n\n\"My joke is as soon as I saw her picture, I figured it out. But the truth is about two weeks into it, I knew there was something very different about her and her faith,\" he told the newspaper.\n\n\"In our first conversation that went about an hour and a half or two, we ended up deciding to do a Bible study together.\"\n\nThe lawmaker reportedly received permission to propose from Noce's parents before Christmas.\n\nAs he tried to figure out his proposal plans, his idea of popping the question after a game of pickleball - a sport the two bond over - was quickly rejected by one of his friends, according to the outlet.\n\nNoce, who was previously married, was sporting her new engagement ring when she attended church Sunday morning, Scott said.\n\n\"I've been very patient and prayerful, and I'm really excited and somewhat nervous, and I couldn't be more thankful for having found a soul mate and someone who shares a lot of the same interests, passions and goals that I do,\" he told the Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Tim Scott is 'doing everything he can' to be Trump's running mate: sources\n\nSen. Tim Scott, who has become a fierce supporter of Donald Trump after dropping his own 2024 presidential bid in the fall, is angling to be selected as the 45th president's second-in-command, sources who have worked with both men tell The Post.\n\nSince Scott (R-SC) suspended his campaign in November, two months before the first nominating votes were cast, and endorsed Trump following the Iowa caucuses , the 58-year-old senator has been a constant, almost ubiquitous presence on the campaign trail.\n\n\"It's very clear that Tim Scott is doing everything he can to build his relationship with Donald Trump in an attempt to get picked as VP,\" a source close to the Trump campaign said.\n\n\"It's pretty clear he's one of the people who is being considered.\"\n\nIn February, Scott admitted to the Wall Street Journal that he felt more comfortable campaigning for Trump, 77, to be president than he did when seeking the same office for himself, saying he was \"free from the internal struggle on how to promote myself without being braggadocious.\"\n\nA month earlier, after Trump's victory in the New Hampshire primary, the former president told supporters that Scott \"must really hate\" former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who appointed him to his Senate seat in 2012.\n\nScott, ever good-natured, leaned into the microphone and told Trump, \"I just love you.\"\n\n\"Tim did a fantastic job increasing his name recognition throughout the primary while avoiding Trump's fire,\" a former Scott staffer explained. \"In this session of 'The Apprentice,' I think Tim Scott will go far.\"\n\nTrump himself has been vague about his veepstakes - reacting positively to names that get thrown his way while declining to rule anyone out.\n\nIn February, Fox News host Laura Ingraham asked Trump whether Scott, former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem were on his vice presidential shortlist.\n\n\"They are,\" confirmed Trump.\n\nSince then, the former president has ruled out Ramaswamy , while DeSantis took himself out of the running the day after Trump's Fox appearance - leaving Scott among the prominent contenders.\n\n\"The senator has a unique role within the Republican Party and I think the former president appreciates that,\" says a former supporter of Scott's presidential run, referencing his status as the only black Republican senator.\n\n\"I think he appreciates how he conducted himself on the national stage when he ran for president,\" the person added. \"And the message that he offered obviously differs from the president ... and I do think there's likely an effort to provide a degree of balance to the ticket.\"\n\nThose close to the Trump campaign have reiterated amid the swirling rumors that the 45th president is looking for someone who is loyal, on board with his agenda, and adds to the ticket, but won't compete for the spotlight - all traits that would seem to fit Scott, whose campaign platform barely deviated from Trump's.\n\nThe former president himself has said he is looking for someone who will be able to step in should something happen to him.\n\n\"It's got to be who would [be] able to be a good president. I mean, you always have to think that because you know, a civil emergency ... things happen, right?\" he told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" in February. \"No matter who you are, things happen. It's got to be number one.\"\n\n\"You want the vice president to be a value to the nominee,\" the former Scott supporter said. \"A value add, to bring something to the table that you might not have - and I think that's something Donald Trump has done a pretty good job of over the course of his time in American politics. There are things that he does really well, and then there are things that he knows can help him do his job better or can appeal to more voters.\n\n\"I think [Scott has] been pretty clear that he will - he's interested in being an advocate for Donald Trump and certainly has not turned down the notion that he could be the vice presidential nominee,\" the source went on.\n\n\"He seems to be a pretty natural fit for the VP slot.\"\n\nThose close to Trump have insisted the decision will ultimately come down to the former president alone, and there's no set timeline on his announcement.\n\n\"Tim Scott would make a great running mate. He's well-liked by many, including President Trump,\" an official working for Trump's re-election told The Post.\n\n\"However, all running mate talk at this point by anyone but Donald John Trump is pure speculation. There are about a dozen people in the running and President Trump will announce who his pick is in a time and manner of his choosing.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

Tim Scott (R-SC) sounded the alarm for children stuck in America's failing public schools, calling on more leaders to wholeheartedly support school-choice measures .\n\n\"The house is on fire, and there are kids trapped at the top of the stairs,\" Scott said on Thursday. \"Someone has to be willing to go into fire to rescue children, to get as many kids out as possible.\"\n\n\"We may not get them all out, but I think we have the responsibility in our nation to save as many kids in a burning house as possible,\" the senator continued, describing \"anything less\" as \"abject failure.\"\n\nScott made the comments while campaigning with Pennsylvania GOP Senate hopeful Dave McCormick at a public forum at Philadelphia's Liguori Academy, a private high school in the city's Olde Richmond neighborhood.\n\n\"Having someone who understands that education should be about kids, not adults, that's Dave McCormick,\" Scott said of his potential future Senate colleague.\n\nMcCormick told dozens of people attending Thursday's roundtable that newfound enthusiasm for school choice was a silver lining of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"In this one area, COVID was a blessing,\" McCormick said. \"Because our parents looked over the shoulders of our children on these Zoom calls. They got more engaged in what's happening in education.\"\n\nScott - who recalled his own experience of attending multiple public schools growing up in South Carolina - said the issue of school choice could be one the whole country can get behind.\n\n\"This should not be a partisan issue, but it is,\" Scott said, noting strong majorities of Americans across all demographic groups support measures aimed at allowing parents to get their kids out of failing public schools.\n\nPublic-sector teachers' unions present the greatest obstacle to progress, Scott argued.\n\nAmanda Greenberg, who teaches at a private school in suburban Delaware County, came out to see Scott and McCormick Thursday. She told The Post a lack of support from her union influenced her move from public to private education - even though she had to take a pay cut.\n\n\"I didn't feel that the teachers' unions were representing me, my interests and my students,\" Greenberg said.\n\n\"I knew I wanted to keep teaching, and I knew I wanted to keep working with kids,\" she added. \"But I also knew that it needed to work for us as a family.\"\n\nGreenberg, who is Jewish, also said she pulled her children out of Philadelphia public schools following the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel - a culture of antisemitism had permeated the district.\n\nScott also lit into President Biden for calling supporters of Donald Trump \"garbage\" in an interview with The Post after Thursday's event.\n\n\"Call me garbage for supporting low unemployment, low inflation, high enthusiasm, respect on the world stage,\" Scott said. \"I hope there's a lot of garbage showing up at the polls between now and Tuesday!\"\n\nAdvertisement"

I love you.\"\n\nSeacoast founder Pastor Greg Surratt, who counseled Scott during his GOP presidential bid, officiated the wedding, according to the Post and Courier.\n\nScott's older brother Ben served as his best man, while Noce's best friend, Joni Blair, whom she met in college, was her maid of honor.\n\nNoce, a Charleston-based design and renovation consultant and mom of three kids, met Scott in 2022 through a mutual friend at the church.\n\nThey hit it off while using an app to study the Bible together, the Washington Post reported as Scott described his bride as a \"lovely Christian girl.\"\n\nThe couple made their first public appearance at the third GOP Presidential Primary debate last November following speculation about the South Carolina senator's love life.\n\nBefore the appearance, Scott said he wouldn't drag Noce \"onto the campaign trail unless I have the intention of marrying her.\"\n\nScott, a lifelong bachelor, asked Noce to marry him on South Carolina's Kiawah Island in January, announcing their engagement through a social media post.\n\n\"She said YES,\" Scott tweeted on Jan. 21 alongside photos of the couple on the beach on Kiawah Island. \"Mindy, thank you for making me the luckiest man in the world.\"\n\nGuests inside the chapel included former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy and Senate Minority Whip John Thune of South Dakota.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen.

Wrong girl, right time is chaos.\"\n\n\"Like everybody else, I think we pretty selfishly want what we want. I think marriage helps you understand that maybe it's not the only mission on the planet to get what you want, but it is to help others enjoy the journey of life, as well to be an ambassador of hope,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this year, Scott was seen as one of the favorites to be selected as former President Donald Trump's running mate, after the senator suspended his bid for the Republican nomination.\n\nTrump ultimately selected Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate during the Republican National Convention in July.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Tim Scott ended 2024 White House campaign after hemorrhaging cash\n\nSen. Tim Scott's presidential campaign was doomed by failure to reverse a decline in fundraising that led to a financial loss in the third quarter of this year - as well as stagnant polling numbers in a crowded Republican field.\n\nThe 58-year-old's campaign recorded $12.4 million in expenditures between July 1 and Sept. 30, while only raising $4.6 million over the same period, according to Federal Election Commission records. Meanwhile, Scott (R-SC) was polling at 2.5% on average nationally, according to RealClearPolitics data , and could only muster a 7.8% average in his home state.\n\nThe senator's Sunday evening announcement that he was suspending his campaign came as a shock to his staffers and backers.\n\nAs recently as Wednesday, former Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) - the head of the pro-Scott super PAC Trust in the Mission (TIM PAC) - told The Post his former colleague was all in on the Jan. 15 Iowa caucuses.\n\n\"Iowa is his focus. Then it will be New Hampshire, then it will be South Carolina. And by the time we get to November, it'll be great,\" Gardner said in the spin room following the third GOP debate in Miami , where Scott barely made the stage due to his low polling numbers.\n\nWhen asked if he thought any candidates would drop out following the debate, Gardner deflected: \"Look, I think this is, again, a reason for Iowa to look at candidates like Tim Scott and say, 'You know what? I saw leadership tonight.'\"\n\nScott's campaign had canceled a planned Iowa swing on Friday, attributing the change of plans to the flu. The South Carolinian then told Fox News on Sunday that \"when I go back to Iowa, it will not be as a presidential candidate.\"\n\n\"I am suspending my campaign,\" Scott told \"Sunday Night in America\" host Trey Gowdy. \"I think the voters, who are the most remarkable people on the planet, have been really clear - they're telling me, 'Not now, Tim.'\"\n\nMoments before Scott's FNC appearance, his campaign sent out a fundraising email with the pleading headline: \"One last chance.\"\n\nLast month, in the clearest sign that Scott was struggling to gain traction , TIM PAC said it was canceling a planned ad buy because it didn't want to \"waste our money when the electorate isn't focused or ready for a Trump alternative.\"\n\nTo qualify for the next debate , on Dec. 6 in Tuscaloosa, Ala., Scott was going to need to hit at least 6% in certified polls and attract at least 80,000 unique donors - with at least 200 unique donors in each of 20 states or territories.\n\nThough Scott has declined to endorse another candidate in the GOP primary, his departure from the race frees up another chunk of voters desperately needed by contenders trailing former President Donald Trump in the polls.\n\n\"I don't think Scott's voters were thinking about voting for Trump, but I think they were thinking about [Florida Gov. Ron] DeSantis or [former South Carolina Gov. Nikki] Haley,\" GOP strategist John Feehery told The Post, adding that his best guess was that DeSantis would benefit from Scott's absence in Iowa while Haley would would get a boost in the first-in-the-South primary.\n\n\"I think this marginally helps Haley more just because of the South Carolina part,\" he surmised. \"I think DeSantis has a really good shot at winning Iowa, even against Trump ... so this helps that process.\"\n\nWhile DeSantis and Haley battle for second spot, the 77-year-old Trump is still far ahead in both national and early state polling.\n\n\"It really reminds everyone that Donald Trump is 30 points ahead and unless these candidates catch up, they're going to run out of money and support,\" said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean, who added: \"This is a blip on the radar for [Trump's] campaign.\"\n\nThroughout his run, Scott sought to cast himself as a \"happy warrior,\" but Bonjean said that messaging was out of step with the tenor of the campaign and the needs of the GOP electorate.\n\n\"He refused to get into the scraps that Vivek [Ramaswamy], Haley and DeSantis were willing to do to each other,\" Bonjean added. \"His message just wasn't wasn't attractive to a wide variety of voters.\"\n\nScott is the sixth notable Republican candidate to drop out of the 2024 presidential race, joining former Vice President Mike Pence, radio host Larry Elder, former Texas Rep. Will Hurd, businessman Perry Johnson and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez.\n\nAdvertisement"

Tim Scott (R-SC) unexpectedly announced Sunday night that he was suspending his 2024 presidential campaign, as polls showed him failing to gain traction in a race increasingly dominated by former President Donald Trump .\n\n\"When I go back to Iowa, it will not be as a presidential candidate,\" Scott told his fellow South Carolinian, former Rep. Trey Gowdy, on Fox News' \"Sunday Night in America.\"\n\n\"I am suspending my campaign,\" Scott added. \"I think the voters, who are the most remarkable people on the planet, have been really clear - they're telling me, 'Not now, Tim.'\"\n\nScott announced he was suspending his campaign five days after the third Republican primary debate in Miami, in which he failed to stand out on the five-person stage, and as he faced an uphill battle to qualify for the next debate Dec. 6 in Tuscaloosa, Ala.\n\nThe most memorable moment of Scott's debate was the first public appearance of his girlfriend , Mindy Noce, after the verbal sparring concluded.\n\nScott wasn't even the most popular South Carolinian in the race, with that distinction going to former Palmetto State Gov. Nikki Haley.\n\nThe 58-year-old had campaigned on an optimistic message about his life story belying liberal tropes of American oppression of its minority populations, but surveys indicated little appetite for that among Republican voters.\n\nA benchmark Iowa poll published late last month showed Scott getting just 7% support, nine percentage points behind Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and a whopping 36 percentage points behind Trump.\n\nHowever, Scott was widely expected to fight on and try to at least qualify for the fourth debate. The Associated Press reported late Sunday that campaign staffers had no advance knowledge that Scott would drop out before he went on the FNC airwaves.\n\n\"I'm gonna respect the voters, and I'm gonna hold on and keep working really hard and look forward to another opportunity,\" Scott told Gowdy, who appeared stunned by his former colleague's announcement.\n\n\"I'm trying to process this information, and I'm trying to do it on live television, so forgive me,\" said Gowdy, who later lamented that \"maybe I should ask the voters what it says about the Republican Party\" that Scott felt he could not remain in the race with two months still to go before the first nominating contest.\n\n\"I do think that sometimes optimism in the midst of chaos isn't seem through the proper prism,\" the senator suggested.\n\nNotably, Scott said he would not endorse another candidate in the Republican primary contest, saying that \"the best way for me to be helpful is to not weigh in.\"\n\nThe senator also indicated he would not accept an invitation to assume the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket, telling Gowdy: \"I ran for president to be president ... being vice president has never been on my to-do list for this campaign, and it's certainly not there now.\"\n\nIn response to Scott's announcement, DeSantis praised him on social media as a \"strong conservative with bold ideas about how to get our country back on track.\n\n\"I respect his courage to run this campaign and thank him for his service to America and the U.S. Senate.\"\n\nScott is the sixth notable Republican candidate to suspend his campaign before any ballots have been cast, joining former Vice President Mike Pence and four longshots: Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, former Texas Rep. Will Hurd, radio talk show host Larry Elder, and businessman Perry Johnson.\n\nAdvertisement"

Tim Scott (R-SC) broke onto the national scene when he delivered the GOP rebuttal to President Joe Biden 's first address to a joint session of Congress in 2021.\n\nThough temperamentally different from former President Donald Trump , Scott has positioned himself as a staunch defender of the former president and someone who could help deliver the ever-more important black vote if he joins the ticket.\n\nTim Scott was born on Sept. 19, 1965. He is 58 years old.\n\nScott was born and raised in North Charleston, South Carolina .\n\nScott graduated from R.B. Stall High School in North Charleston, South Carolina, in 1983. He attended Presbyterian College on a partial sports scholarship and graduated from Charleston Southern University with a bachelor's degree in political science in 1988.\n\nScott has represented South Carolina in the U.S. Senate since 2013.\n\nScott identifies as a Christian.\n\nForbes estimated Scott to be worth just over a million in 2023.\n\nScott was raised by a single mother who he said worked 16-hour days to support him and his brother.\n\nHe is engaged to Mindy Noce, an interior designer and mother of three. Their wedding is set for early August. The senator has no children of his own.\n\nScott worked as an insurance agent after graduating from college. He represented South Carolina's 1st Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2011-2013 and previously served in the South Carolina House of Representatives and as a member of the Charleston City Council.\n\nScott is the author of three books:\n\nScott has said while campaigning for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination that he supports a 15-week national abortion ban and supports sending military aid to Ukraine, but he said in November that people needed \"accountability\" on how the aid was being spent.\n\nHe supports many of Trump's immigration policies and said during his presidential campaign in August that he would finish the border wall if elected president.\n\nScott endorsed Trump for president in January, saying that America needed \"a president who will unite our country.\"\n\nHe has been critical of some of Trump's comments against a federal abortion ban and comments criticizing Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nScott ran for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2024 election. He dropped out of the race in November 2023."

      "text": "Tim Scott eyes run for chairman of National Republican Senatorial Committee\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R-SC) has expressed interest in leading Senate Republicans' campaign arm in 2026 following his unsuccessful presidential run last year.\n\nScott has been making phone calls to his Senate colleagues to discuss chairing the National Republican Senatorial Committee, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The development comes as other Senate Republicans have withdrawn their names from consideration in the face of what is expected to be a less favorable campaign cycle for the party.\n\nA spokesman for Scott confirmed that he is pursuing the chairmanship. He has made recent campaign stops to Nevada and Wisconsin on behalf of GOP candidates and will soon travel to Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Separately, he has raised more than six figures for 2024 Senate campaigns, while a super PAC linked to Scott plans to spend seven figures in swing states.\n\n\"The senator is grateful for the encouragement he has received from colleagues to run for chair of the NRSC. He is working tirelessly to send Donald Trump back to the White House and take the U.S. Senate, then looks forward to growing the Republican majority in 2026,\" said Scott spokesman Nathan Brand.\n\nScott raised his stature this past year by running for the Republican nomination for president but bowed out and endorsed former President Donald Trump before the Iowa caucuses. He eventually made his way to Trump's shortlist for vice president, but another Senate colleague, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), was chosen instead.\n\nIn the Senate, Scott is the top Republican on the Banking Committee.\n\nIf chosen by his colleagues in leadership elections this fall, Scott would be facing a Senate map with fewer pickup opportunities in 2026. Twenty of the 33 seats up for election are held by GOP senators.\n\nSen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO) had been considered a leading contender for the slot but declined to run, according to a top aide. Schmitt is also on a short list for attorney general in a possible second Trump administration.\n\nSen. Katie Britt (R-AL) had also been approached but decided against running, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to the Washington Examiner . She is part of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-KY) leadership team.\n\nOther names under consideration include Sens. Ted Budd (R-NC) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)."

      "text": "Tim Scott positions himself as best Trump VP hopeful to court black voters\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R-SC) is preparing to help turn out black voters for former President Donald Trump with a new multimillion-dollar campaign blitz that aims to deny President Joe Biden a win in key battleground states.\n\nThe initiative, to be deployed in a half-dozen states, comes as Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, vies to become Trump's vice presidential nominee. He is an outspoken surrogate for the former president on the trail but also emphasized his appeal among black voters in announcing the campaign to a small gathering of reporters in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"I do with black voters in South Carolina two or three times better than the average Republican,\" Scott said. \"There's a reason why I win the reddest counties in South Carolina by about 8-10 points better than the average Republican because I performed better with the conservatives there, but I also win the blue counties where no Republicans are winning at all.\"\n\n\"I'm able to bring together the working-class coalition that is typically more minority than any other place in the country,\" he added.\n\nThrough his Great Opportunity PAC, Scott is deploying a $14.3 million travel and advertising budget that he and close aides say will build on the shift of nonwhite voters away from Biden. The plan is to flip a nominal number, just a few percentage points, of nonwhite voters, particularly black voters, in favor of Trump.\n\nA 3- to 5-point swing, Scott argued, could have \"tectonic shifts\" in battleground states that Democrats would be unable to accommodate.\n\n\"There is no way to fill the hole. The coalition that is necessary for the Democrats to have success, period, is not just black and Hispanic. It's specifically black [voters] in the battleground states where they have to be successful,\" he said. \"If you change those numbers in those larger cities, you can't make it up somewhere else.\"\n\nBiden and his campaign, with the help of Vice President Kamala Harris, launched a nationwide black voter initiative in Philadelphia last week as the party sounds alarm bells over polling showing lower performance with black voters.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of black voters still back Biden, 77%, over Trump, 18%, according to recent Pew Research Center polling, the president could be losing sizable ground to his predecessor. Biden captured nearly 90% of the black vote in 2020.\n\n\"A lot of African American men have said, 'You know what, I'm going to take a closer look at the Republican Party and the GOP,'\" Scott said. \"Much to the chagrin of many folks, there's no doubt that African American men are wide open for a political shift.\"\n\nHis political action committee's $14.3 million operating budget includes $9 million for voter contact, $4.8 million for earned and paid media, $330,000 for research and data, and $225,000 for other operations and legal expenses. An aide for the group who declined to be named said they've raised roughly half the funding and plan to fundraise the rest in the coming months.\n\n\"There was always an undercurrent of conservatism in the black community, obviously in the social and faith spaces that we felt the most,\" the aide said. \"We knew that there was potential there for us to kind of spread the message about conservatism.\"\n\nScott, echoing Trump, also argued there is more opportunity to convince black voters to vote for the former president after his conviction by a New York court on falsifying business records.\n\n\"I honestly think this decision is helpful to driving even more folks to the Republican Party,\" Scott said. \"African American men are fed up with this two-tiered justice system, so much so that I would suggest the number today is closer to 45% to 50% of African American men who are open\" to the GOP."

Tim Scott (R-SC) claimed Sunday that voters in the United States are more focused on their future rather than on former President Donald Trump 's past, suggesting that Trump could help voters make their futures more secure.\n\nScott's statement was in response to a question on whether the Republican National Convention should pay the legal fees of the former president, who is facing multiple legal battles amid his campaign for the 2024 presidency. Scott responded by arguing that voters are not currently focused on Trump's \"legal challenges\" but rather their economic challenges \"across a kitchen table.\"\n\n\"Their issues are very clear, by the way,\" Scott said during an interview. \"The American people are more focused on their future than Donald Trump's past.\"\n\nScott also expressed criticism of the \"two-tiered\" justice system within the U.S. right now, noting how one of the legal battles Trump is facing regards his handling of classified documents. His criticism stems from the recent report from special counsel Robert Hur , which argued that Biden should not be charged for his own mishandling of classified documents due to his faulty memory.\n\nThe South Carolina senator elaborated on the report's findings, stating that Biden is \"too old\" to continue serving as president.\n\nScott, who endorsed Trump last month, campaigned with the former president in South Carolina on Wednesday. It comes as the state's primary election is scheduled to be held on Saturday, Feb. 24.\n\nScott joining Trump in South Carolina has stirred rumors that he is a possible candidate for Trump's vice president in the 2024 election. Other possible vice presidential candidates for the former president include Republican Arizona 2024 Senate candidate Kari Lake , Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson ."

Tim Scott (R-SC) cast an early vote for the South Carolina GOP primary on Thursday morning as he cast doubt over former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley 's campaign against former President Donald Trump .\n\nThe Palmetto State senator has emerged as a top vice presidential contender for Trump's campaign but brushed off questioning on Thursday.\n\nAt the front opening of Hanahan Library, Scott briefly chatted with a Marine veteran who teased him about vice presidential rumors.\n\n\"Congratulations, you might get it,\" the veteran told Scott, shaking his hand.\n\n\"Well, one day at a time,\" Scott responded. \"One day at a time.\"\n\nELECTION 2024: FOLLOW LATEST COVERAGE\n\nTrump has repeatedly brought up Scott's name when asked about his running mate. The most recent occurrence came during a Fox News town hall event with Laura Ingraham on Tuesday evening.\n\n\"He's been so great. He's been such a great advocate,\" Trump said about Scott.\n\nRusty Howe, 60, a Hanahan resident, was enthusiastic about a Scott vice presidential pick. \"I love Tim Scott,\" he said before suggesting another high-profile role for the senator. \"He needs to be in the Cabinet, for sure.\"\n\n\"Well, you vote for whoever's at the top of the ticket, not for who's the vice presidential candidate. It might make a difference. It might not,\" said Lewis Tabb, 74, of Beaufort, South Carolina. \"Given some of the other alternatives, I think he would be a better candidate than some of the other names I've heard tossed about.\"\n\nScott did not respond to shouted questions from the Washington Examiner after a press gaggle on Thursday morning, but he did have pointed remarks about his relationship with Haley, a fellow South Carolinian native.\n\n\"I think it's about as it was beforehand, honestly. We didn't talk a lot before then, and we don't talk a lot now,\" he said.\n\n\"But in the end, you know, I look at the comments coming from the Haley camp and her son calling me Judas,\" Scott continued, referencing comments from Nalin Haley referring to him as \"Senator Judas.\"\n\nHaley appointed Scott to the Senate in 2012 to replace retiring Republican Sen. Jim DeMint. Scott, however, chose to endorse Trump days before the New Hampshire primary last month.\n\n\"The one thing I think about is the importance of remembering that politics sometimes brings out the best of people and the worst of people,\" Scott said. \"And you have to have an attitude of forgiveness if you're going to play this game long term.\"\n\nScott continued to call for Haley to drop out of the race if she loses the primary on Saturday, in which she is trailing Trump by a 2-to-1 margin.\n\n\"The one person that stands in the way of having a conversation between Joe Biden and Donald Trump is Nikki Haley,\" the senator said. \"And so getting out of the way is incredibly important, not for the party but for America's future.\"\n\nAs a top Trump surrogate, Scott defended the former president again when he was asked about Trump comparing New York Judge Arthur Engoron ordering Trump and associates to pay $355 million in penalties for his civil fraud case to the recent death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n\n\"I think the one thing we can get out of the judgment in New York is that every business person who fears for the future of their business because of the absolute oppressive nature of the courts in New York, they are now considering leaving the state,\" Scott said."

      "text": "Manchin joins Tim Scott resolution to overturn new SEC climate disclosure rule\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R-SC) launched an effort Wednesday to overturn the Securities and Exchange Commission's climate disclosure rule with the help of a key Democrat.\n\nScott, who is the ranking member of the Banking Committee , introduced the Congressional Review Act resolution after previously announcing he would challenge the rule. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to vote down administrative rules through an expedited process.\n\nThe SEC voted 3-2 to adopt the controversial rule, which sets requirements for how and what companies must report to investors about how their operations affect the climate. It requires large and mid-sized companies to report greenhouse gas emissions, reports that would be audited by an outside party.\n\nScott's resolution has 34 co-sponsors, including one Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV). That is more than enough needed for a discharge petition and gives the legislation bipartisan backing, making it more likely to make its way to President Joe Biden's desk.\n\nIn a statement, Scott said the SEC rule is \"federal overreach at its worst.\"\n\n\"The SEC's final climate disclosure rule threatens economic opportunity across the country, and it must be overturned,\" the South Carolina senator said. \"Over and over again, SEC Chair Gensler has disregarded the real-world impacts of his aggressive regulatory agenda in his dogged pursuit of left-wing political priorities. This rule is no exception.\"\n\nThe Congressional Review Act allows for resolutions to be brought to the floor of the Senate through an expedited process, meaning that it could not be stopped by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). The success of the vote would hinge on Democratic centrists like Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ). The vote would almost certainly be approved by the House, which is controlled by Republicans.\n\nIf the resolution gets pushed through Congress, Biden is likely to veto it as he has with other Congressional Review Act resolutions narrowly approved by the Senate.\n\nManchin called the SEC climate disclosure rule \"fiscally irresponsible\" in a statement after the CRA resolution was announced.\n\n\"The SEC's new rule on emissions disclosures completely contradicts its long-standing commitment to protect investors and promote a fair and efficient U.S. financial market,\" Manchin said. \"This deliberate targeting of fossil fuel companies not only threatens our economic security, but also sends a strong signal of opposition to the all-of-the-above energy policy that is absolutely critical to our country and our allies right now.\"\n\nWhile still controversial, the new SEC climate rule is significantly scaled down from a proposed version by omitting a requirement that corporations disclose emissions generated by suppliers and customers.\n\nRepublicans have been highly critical of rulemaking under Biden, arguing that his administration is using the process to circumvent the legislative process.\n\n\"The SEC's mission is to regulate our capital markets and ensure all Americans can safely share in their economic success, not to force a partisan climate agenda on American businesses,\" Scott said."

He has the endorsement of the majority of statewide lawmakers in South Carolina and has not hesitated to tout their snubbing of Haley.\n\nScott, a former presidential candidate, has appeared at several Trump rallies since suspending his campaign and endorsing the former president days before the New Hampshire primary last month.\n\nAnd in recent weeks, he has emerged as a strong contender to become Trump's running mate should he win the GOP primary.\n\n\"It's nice to be on the short list because I think Tim just wants to help the Republican Party,\" a source with knowledge of the matter told the Washington Examiner on Wednesday. \"I know he would strongly consider it because he believes he can help change the narrative.\"\n\nScott, who was appointed to the Senate by Haley in 2012, gave a forceful endorsement of Trump during a Concord, New Hampshire, rally last month in a major blow to Haley.\n\n\"We need a president who will unite our country. We need Donald Trump,\" he told the crowd of supporters at the rally. \"And that's why I came to the very warm state of New Hampshire to endorse the next president of these United States.\"\n\nTrump directly named Scott and Gov.

I don't want anybody to take even any inference, but it's incredible.\"\n\nScott remains coy over the vice presidential speculation when directly asked.\n\n\"My answer would be 'yes' to America having four more years of Donald Trump. I don't think any one of us should make this about me or any other person who might be the candidate for vice president,\" Scott told Fox News's Sean Hannity last week.\n\nRep. Nancy Mace (R-SC), who has sparked some level of vice presidential speculation of her own, will also join Trump onstage, the Washington Examiner has learned.\n\nJulia Johnson contributed to this report."

Warren wrote:\n\nNone of the amendments proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren made it into the bill , including her proposal to limit stablecoin issuance to banking institutions.\n\n\"Without changes, this bill will supercharge the financing of terrorism. It will make sanctions evasion by Iran, North Korea, and Russia easier,\" Warren argued.\n\nNow do USDollars, Lizzy!\n\nThe GENIUS stablecoin bill was introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty on Feb. 4 as a comprehensive regulatory framework for tokenized US dollars.\n\nAs CoinTelegraph reported today, Hagerty defended the legislation against the proposed amendments from Senator Warren, arguing that the bill already includes provisions for consumer protection, Anti-Money Laundering, and crime prevention.\n\nOn March 10, Hagerty announced that the bill was updated to include stricter reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers, AML provisions, safeguards against terrorist financing, transparent risk management procedures, and stipulations for sanctions compliance.\n\nAccording to Dom Kwok, founder of the Web3 learning platform Easy A, the newly added provisions will make it harder for foreign stablecoin issuers to comply, giving US-based firms a competitive edge.\n\nShortly after the bill was introduced to the US Senate, Federal Reserve Bank Governor Christopher Waller said non-banks should be allowed to issue stablecoins .\n\nWaller argued that stablecoins could expand payment use cases, particularly in the developing world, due to their cost-savings and efficiency.\n\nStablecoin fees vs. legacy payment processing solutions. Source: Simon Taylor\n\nBank of America CEO Brian Moynihan told an audience at the Economic Club of Washington DC that the bank may enter the stablecoin business - likely launching its own dollar-pegged stable token.\n\nDuring the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the US will use stablecoins to extend US dollar dominance .\n\nOver-collateralized stablecoin issuers are collectively the 18th largest buyers of US government debt in the world - putting these firms ahead of countries like Germany and South Korea.\n\nSenator Tim Scott, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, characterized the bill as a victory for innovation . The Senator said:\n\nThe bill must still pass a vote in both chambers of Congress before it is turned over to President Trump and ultimately signed into law.\n\nHowever, the Senate Banking Committee advancing the bill represents the first step in clear, comprehensive legislation requested by the crypto industry.\n\nAttorney Jeremy Hogan said the GENIUS Act signals an impending merger of the traditional financial system with stablecoins.\n\n\"The legislation is explicitly making plans for stablecoins to interact with the traditional digital banking system. The 'merge' is being planned,\" the attorney wrote in a March 10 X post .\n\nBy adopting pro-stablecoin policies and promoting stablecoin usage worldwide, the US government can use stablecoins as a sponge to soak up inflation and protect the dollar's status as the global reserve currency.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

My first column of 2024 declared it \"The Year of Trump,\" and there was never a dull moment as Donald Trump aimed not just to take back the White House, but to stay out of prison and ultimately to stay alive.\n\nNow that the election is over, it's time to look in the rear-view mirror and contemplate why Trump is not just the greatest political comeback in history, but the greatest showman in the world.\n\nSo let's consider Trump's Top 10 best moves in the most consequential election of our lifetimes. It could easily be the Top 100, but that would be bragging.\n\nNo. 10: If we think of 2024 as an election season rather than a calendar year, then the first big move by Trump was skipping the Republican candidate debates starting in August 2023 and thus reducing his opponents to desperate Lilliputians in search of a Gulliver. Without Trump, the public soon lost interest in Tim Scott, Chris Christie, Mike Pence (remember him?), and Asa Hutchinson. Even Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Vivek Ramaswamy barely peaked out of single digits and were soon vanquished. The August debate on Fox News was the high point with 13 million sets of eyeballs, with each subsequent debate shedding viewers, until the CNN debate before the Iowa caucuses could barely muster 2.5 million bored spectators.\n\nNo. 9: After cementing his hold on the Republican Party's base with his commanding primary performance, Trump moved to change the leadership of the party as well. On Feb. 12, he announced his desire to see GOP chair Ronna McDaniel replaced by North Carolina GOP chairman Michael Whatley, with Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump serving as co-chair. McDaniel had always had an arms-length relationship with Trump's MAGA movement, and she was blamed by many in the party for not doing enough to ensure Trump's victory in 2020, both before and after the Nov. 3 election, including her lackluster support for the president's claims that the election was rigged.\n\nNo. 8: From the time he was indicted in the so-called hush-money trial in March of 2023, Trump realized that his popularity increased every time his enemies tried to put him in prison. Rather than resign from his campaign and concentrate on his legal woes, Trump wore each new indictment like a badge of honor. And he fought against the judges and district attorneys arrayed against him from his Truth Social page, calling them unhinged, corrupt, or simply Trump haters. Meanwhile, his attorneys battled in multiple courtrooms to prove not just his innocence, but ultimately his victimhood. When they argued before the Supreme Court that the president was entitled to immunity for actions taken while he was in office, the mainstream media portrayed Trump as desperate. This view was obliterated when the ruling came down in Trump's favor on July 1, almost guaranteeing that most charges against him would be dismissed.\n\nNo. 7: The media also ridiculed Trump for campaigning in exceedingly liberal New York City. Once again, they played themselves for fools. Since Trump was spending so much time in New York City thanks to the Letitia James civil fraud trial, the E. Jean Carroll civil suit for defamation, and ultimately the so-called hush-money trial, what choice did he have? It should have been no surprise that the presumptive GOP nominee decided to campaign in his hometown. In April, Trump visited the Manhattan bodega where a clerk fatally stabbed a would-be robber and then was charged with murder by the same district attorney who had the former president on trial for vastly hyped felony charges based on the fact that he called payments to his lawyer \"legal expenses.\" Trump also visited a construction site and a local firehouse. But even better, and clearly one of the best moves of 2024, was Trump's decision to hold a rally in the South Bronx while awaiting a verdict in the hush-money case. The Democrats' smear against Trump as a racist looked pathetic as a diverse crowd of blacks and Hispanics joined whites to applaud Trump's message of a stronger America.\n\nNo. 6: Seizing on President Biden's ill-fated proposal to hold a presidential debate in late June, before either candidate was even officially nominated by their party, Trump again outsmarted the analysts. At the time, Trump was ahead in the polls and there was a general consensus that he had the most at risk in the debate. That perception proved laughable when Biden's performance exposed him to be cognitively impaired and dangerously unfocused. In retrospect, some analysts think Trump made a mistake by debating so early because it forced Democrats to replace Biden as their candidate. Yet two simple words put that theory to rest: Kamala Harris.\n\nNo. 5: Harris's inability to articulate a vision for the next four years and her refusal to separate herself from either Biden's failed presidency or the radical leftist agenda of the Democratic Party made her an easy foil for Trump.\n\nBut in order to ensure that he would attract disaffected Democrats to his own campaign, Trump did something that would have been unthinkable eight, or even four, years ago: He reached out to Democrats and found common ground. Most significantly, he saw that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had been maligned and mistreated by Biden's campaign, first as a Democratic candidate and then as an independent. Trump recognized that not just the Kennedy name but the Kennedy agenda would broaden his coalition and make him nearly unbeatable. When RFK Jr. suspended his own campaign and endorsed Trump on Aug. 23, the electricity was palpable. It didn't hurt that the mainstream media hated Bobby Kennedy nearly as much as they hated Trump. Add that to Trump being endorsed by former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard and tech billionaire Elon Musk and it was clear that Trump was intent on building a coalition that could not just win the election but help him govern.\n\nNo. 4: While we are on the subject of campaign appearances, none made Trump more human and more endearing than his visit to a Bucks County McDonald's restaurant in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania two weeks before the election. While trolling Harris' dubious claim that she had worked for the fast-food chain while in college, Trump also proved himself to be a billionaire of and for the people. Donning an apron, Trump learned how to prepare French fries the McDonald's way and served meals in the drive-thru window to delighted customers. The photo of the former president waving to fans outside the restaurant was one of the indelible images of 2024.\n\nNo. 3: You know you had a good year when surviving not just one but two assassination attempts fails to break into the Top 2! We won't dwell on the second assassination attempt since the accused assailant doesn't face trial until at least late in 2025, but no such qualms need bother us when talking about the shooting by Thomas Matthew Crooks at Butler, Pennsylvania, since Crooks was shot well and truly dead, as Hemingway might have put it.\n\nWhen you are talking about Trump's best moves that day, it is hard to ignore his head turning to the right to read an immigration chart that was displayed on a giant screen. Because of that fortuitous gesture, Trump was shot in the ear instead of the head, thus surviving what was very nearly a fatal blow. That was providential, but what the wounded candidate did next was pure Trump. After being helped to his feet by the Secret Service agents who had surrounded him, the bloodied Trump raised his fist three times and entreated the shocked crowd to \"Fight! Fight! Fight!\" This was the stuff of legends.\n\nNo. 2: Perhaps the most audacious political move of the 2024 campaign was Trump's decision to outsource most of the Republican get-out-the-vote effort to two independent super PACs - Turning Point Action and America PAC. The Republican Party had always run a distant second to Democrats when it came to making contact with voters and getting them to the polls, but establishment pols thought the answer was for the Republican Party to spend more money. Trump counter-intuitively decided to spend less by soliciting the support of outside groups that would spend their own money and use their own volunteers to reach impassioned voters. Charlie Kirk's Turning Point Action and Elon Musk's America PAC were laser-focused on getting out the vote in the seven so-called swing states. The fact that Trump won all seven demonstrates just how successful the new strategy proved to be.\n\nAnd at No.1 for Trump's best moves of the year , it's the Trump Dance! As the terpsichorean equivalent of Trump's devil-may-care attitude, the Trump Dance was unleashed on the world at an unknown date, but it perhaps became most famous during the Oct. 14 campaign town hall when Trump decided to stop taking questions after two people in attendance suffered medical emergencies. It's not unusual for Trump to halt his campaign rallies when someone is in distress, but in this case, after several minutes the crowd spontaneously broke into a chorus of \"God Bless America.\"\n\nThis inspired Trump to request \"Ave Maria\" on the loudspeakers, which inspired the candidate to then order an impromptu music fest. For roughly 40 minutes, the soon-to-be leader of the free world led the delighted crowd from the stage and added his unique dance stylings that mostly consisted of waving his arms with closed fists, swaying left and right and acting completely un-self-consciously as he mouthed the words to \"Y.M.C.A.\"\n\nThere actually wasn't much dancing, but it inspired thousands of TikTok videos and the absolute disdain of the legacy media. MSNBC declared, \"Questions mounting over Trump's mental acuity after derailed event turns into dance fest.\" Rolling Stone called the event \"a bizarre instant-classic trainwreck.\" So much for the perspicacity of the mainstream media, which had never understood Trump or his attraction. The real trainwreck of 2024 was the press coverage of Trump. And when multiple NFL stars performed the Trump Dance to celebrate touchdowns one weekend, it was obvious that Trump had won not just the election but the cultural war that had been declared against him in 2015.\n\nNow it's on to 2025, and it's a safe bet that the coming year will be \"The Year of Trump 2.0.\" I can't wait.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

The letter is addressed to Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\nChinese \"threat actors had gained access to a key used by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support for Treasury Departmental Offices (DO) end users.

Cyber risks are not limited to federal agencies , critical infrastructure , and corporations; home routers , firewalls, storage devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices have also been compromised.

      "text": "Republicans Call For Drug Testing Ahead Of Presidential Debates\n\nAuthored by Steve Watson via Modernity.news,\n\nSeveral Republicans are calling for Joe Biden to undergo drug testing before taking part in the presidential debates with Donald Trump scheduled for June and September.\n\nSouth Carolina Senator Tom Scott was asked to comment on the issue on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" and responded \"Why not?\" when asked if substance tests should be carried out.\n\n\"The truth of the matter is if you saw the State of the Union and you watched that performance, it was surreal,\" Scott noted of Biden's speech in March.\n\n\"There was something going on, and if we could find the truth of what it was, we're all better off,\" Scott added.\n\nTim Scott to Maria Bartiromo on Trump: \"He doesn't need a teleprompter!\" (Complaining about his teleprompter is something Trump does almost every speech ... ) pic.twitter.com/XPy7QgNDGI\n\n\"If it takes artificial stimulation to make the President of the United States perform, how often can he do that?\" The Senator further pondered.\n\nRepresentative Anna Paulina Luna of Florida also called for Biden to be drug tested, noting \"We're talking about someone who has the ability to launch nukes.\"\n\nThere should be required drugs tests before the debates. pic.twitter.com/ugsi2nFfo7\n\nLuna also referred to questions over Biden's mental competence following the comments of former special counsel Robert Hur who described Biden as an \"elderly man with a poor memory.\"\n\nNorth Carolina Representative Greg Murphy, who is also a trained surgeon, commented that Biden \"must have been jacked up on something\" during the SOTU speech.\n\n\"I absolutely believe that from a medical viewpoint, actually I have a little bit of good knowledge that that happened,\" Murphy asserted, adding that Biden \"can't stand it. He can't stand under the lights for that long. And I don't think he can keep a concept in his brain that long.\"\n\n\"What do you mean when you say he was jacked up?\" Republican Rep. Greg Murphy, who is a practicing surgeon, claims President Biden was under the influence of some kind of performance enhancer during his State of the Union address...and Murphy has \"evidence\".

No, we're going to demand a drug test,\" Trump added.\n\nThe proposal has moved further into the spotlight spurred by a bizarre video that circulated Friday of Biden wide eyed and looking completely different to his usual squint while making a short recorded statement.\n\nWhat is going on here? https://t.co/CXDJireFWe\n\nAs we have highlighted, Biden has agreed to take part in only two debates, despite Trump accepting two more proposals from Fox News and NBC/Telemundo, and calling for further debates to be scheduled.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy believes that the Democrats are allowing Biden one last \"Hail Mary\" by allowing him to participate in a debate against Donald Trump , but that if he fails, as he inevitably will, they will swap him out for a new candidate.\n\n*  *  *\n\nYour support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.

      "text": "Ranking Trump's Vice-Presidential Options\n\nAuthored by Sean Trende via RealClearPolitics ,\n\nPlaying the Veepstakes guessing game is often a losing one for analysts . Vice-presidential selection is ultimately a highly personal choice, and it is simply too difficult to venture into the mind of one individual and mimic their thought process. Perhaps more importantly, Republican presidential nominees haven't made the obvious choice for vice president since Ronald Reagan chose George Bush in 1980 . Dan Quayle, Jack Kemp, Dick Cheney, Sarah Palin, Paul Ryan, and even Mike Pence were all somewhat \"out-of-left-field\" selections for their respective presidential candidates.\n\nIt is tempting to say that the journey into the mind of a presidential candidate is particularly likely to become a failed venture when that candidate is Donald Trump. This doesn't give Trump enough credit. Picking Mike Pence in 2016 was, in retrospect, an inspired choice and probably helped win him the presidency . In this regard, at least, his 2016 campaign was surprisingly normal.\n\nNonetheless, the goal isn't to predict who Trump's pick will be. Instead we'll rank the prospective candidates by who would do the most good for the Republican ticket. There are a number of potential candidates not listed here. Ben Carson, Elise Stefanik, Tom Cotton, or Ron DeSantis come to mind (and Kristi Noem until about three weeks ago), and Trump really could pick someone completely out of the blue. But let's look at the potential running mates who have gotten the most buzz of late:\n\n10. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley .\n\nFirst, Haley certainly isn't showing much interest in the job. A vice-presidential candidate should, at a minimum, have endorsed the presidential candidate. There's a universe where this is the Republican dream ticket, but relations between Haley and Trump have deteriorated so much that Trump risks looking weak or desperate were he to pick her. Probably a net negative at this point.\n\n9. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders .\n\nSanders' pros are threefold: She is a female governor, she served in the Trump administration, and she is supportive of Trump. Beyond that, she brings little to the table.\n\n8. Sen. J.D. Vance, Ohio .\n\nVance might have made sense for Trump's 2016 campaign, when he was trying to build a coalition by tearing away blue-collar voters from Obama's 2012 win. But if Trump is trying to shore up the blue-collar vote in 2024, he's in trouble. He needs to make gains elsewhere. Also Vance's 2022 win in Ohio was fairly unimpressive, so even if he needs to win by those voters for some reason, it isn't clear that Vance is the ticket.\n\n7. Former Hawai'i Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard .\n\nThis is one I go back and forth on. Ultimately, I think Gabbard probably has too many liberal votes dating from her almost-decade in Congress. Check out her scorecard from the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, for one . That didn't stop George H.W. Bush from being chosen in 1980, but this isn't 1980 anymore. She's an outside-the-box pick for a campaign that, at least right now, doesn't have to think outside the box.\n\n6. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott .\n\nOn paper, Scott makes sense. Trump is hoping to add non-white voters to his coalition, and the first black Senator from the South since Reconstruction seems like he would not hurt. But Scott underwhelmed in the debates and lacks the executive experience that some of the other possibilities bring to the table.\n\n5. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott .\n\nFour of my top five picks are governors, and this isn't accidental. Probably the two most important things Trump's pick would do are: (a) reassure suburban voters that this will be a serious administration, rather than the at-times chaos-filled farrago that was Trump's first term; and (b) give the various wings of the Republican Party confidence that when Trump leaves in 2029 he'll leave the GOP in capable hands. Abbott has been a reasonably successful governor of the nation's second-largest state for a decade now. His experience with the immigration issue will also help highlight a top theme of the Trump campaign for the election.\n\n4. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds .\n\nReynolds is a lot like Sanders or Vance in that she doesn't bring a lot immediately to the table, electorally speaking - as Trump is already counting on carrying Iowa, Arkansas, and Ohio, respectively. What she does bring, though, is eight years of executive experience (14 if you count her time as lieutenant governor.) It also doesn't hurt that she's from a state that borders the state likely to be electoral vote number 270 for one candidate or another (Wisconsin). A serious midwestern governor who could be a serious president one day, and who doesn't turn off one faction or another of the GOP coalition, is a pretty solid veep resume.\n\n3. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum .\n\nYes, yes, I know. Burgum has Interior Secretary written all over him. But boring and safe worked for Trump in 2016, and for reassuring wavering GOP suburbanites that Trump is serious about governing in 2025, he could do a lot worse. Although Burgum certainly looks the part, he has a history that is to the left of what we would expect from a modern Republican candidate - but not so far to the left that it would cause some of the problems that a Tulsi Gabbard pick might cause.\n\n2. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin .\n\nImagine Burgum, but make him a little more charismatic, and give him minor GOP celebrity status. That gives you Youngkin. If Trump is serious in believing that Virginia is in play this time around, he might add some interesting electoral math as well. If I had to make a pick about who I thought Trump would choose, this is probably who I'd come up with.\n\n1. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio .\n\nYes, one of them would probably have to change his residence (c'mon, Trump owns property everywhere). Yes, there's some bad blood from 2016 still. But Rubio makes so much sense. He takes Florida off the board (to the extent that it isn't already) and probably ices Nevada and Arizona as well. He might put New Mexico into play. He's reassuring to suburbanites, and beloved of anti-anti-Trump Republicans. He sounded Trumpian themes on working class woes before Trump. The only downside is the address thing, and even if neither wanted to declare residency elsewhere (much easier today than in 1789) the worst-case scenario would be that the vice-presidential election would go to the Senate, which Republicans probably control if Trump wins the presidency.\n\n*  *  *\n\nSean Trende is senior elections analyst for RealClearPolitics.

      "text": "Toxic Atmosphere At FDIC Spurs Calls For Chair's Resignation\n\nAuthored by Philip Wegmann via RealClearPolitics ,\n\nThe White House did not offer their full faith and credit to the FDIC chairman when asked by RealClearPolitics about a bombshell 234-page investigation that detailed a toxic environment within the agency.\n\nOther than noting that Martin Gruenberg, the official in question, had already \"apologized and spoke[n] to\" allegations that he presided over a culture of bullying, harassment, and mismanagement, Karine Jean-Pierre, the president's spokeswoman, mostly demurred.\n\nGruenberg will not skate by so easily when he testifies before Congress this week. Republicans in both the House and Senate are hell-bent for leather. And his scalp.\n\nThe report was published by law firm Cleary Gottlieb last week and followed a Wall Street Journal investigation last November that documented a federal agency akin to \"a good ol' boys club\" where female employees were subjected to stalking, unwelcome illicit messages, and sexual harassment.\n\nThe episode is an embarrassment to President Biden, who promised on the first day of his administration to fire \"on the spot\" anyone who engaged in such behavior.\n\nIt is also a political liability. If Gruenberg, a Biden nominee who served in both the Obama and Trump administrations and the Senate confirmed by voice vote, exits under pressure, it would leave the FDIC board deadlocked during an election year. \"A 2-2 vote would stall and probably doom politically sensitive banking policy,\" observed Renaissance Macro Research. The regulatory policy of the administration would then hang in limbo.\n\nThese realities are not lost on many in the FDIC workforce who want reform. In a statement obtained by RCP, current employees expressed their concern that \"the egregious issues documented in the Cleary report by over 500 employees have become partisan.\"\n\nWorking at an agency now under scrutiny for a history of reprisals against whistleblowers, the statement was left unsigned, though the drafters noted that they \"have a wide range of political views, ranging from far left to far right.\"\n\n\"The FDIC employees behind this statement do not have confidence that the chairman and executive management have the willingness to truly make the cultural and structural changes necessary to fully address the [matters] identified in the report,\" they write.\n\nFor his part, Gruenberg has already offered an apology.\n\n\"I want to also thank everyone who shared their experiences throughout this process. I know that doing so was difficult. To anyone who experienced sexual harassment or other misconduct at the FDIC , I again want to express how very sorry I am. I also want to apologize for any shortcomings on my part,\" he said in a statement when the Cleary Gottlieb report was published.\n\n\"As chairman, I am ultimately responsible for everything that happens at our agency, including our workplace culture,\" Gruenberg added.\n\nThe chairman, whom the report found has a history of anger and belittling staff, plans to announce a new, independent office devoted to professional conduct at the agency, according to prepared testimony before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday. But the head of that committee, Republican Chairman Patrick McHenry, has already called for his resignation. And some FDIC employees are already registering their dissatisfaction.\n\n\"The Chairman has communicated the action plan that he oversaw the creation of as proof of his commitment to improving conditions at the FDIC. We, however, do not have confidence that this action plan is meaningful,\" they wrote.\n\nMore than a dozen Republicans now oppose Gruenberg. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, has called for his resignation. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst has called on the Department of Justice to open an investigation. Only one Democrat, however, Illinois Rep. Bill Foster, has followed suit, calling for the FDIC chairman to step down.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on Financial Services, blasted the report , not the FDIC chairman , for focusing too much on current leadership. Democrats are expected to circle the wagons to protect Gruenberg during his testimony - an irony given the propensity of Democrats, not Republicans, to rail against toxic workplace environments.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen signaled her displeasure, telling reporters Tuesday that \"the kind of abuses that were documented in the report are a totally unacceptable way to treat employees at the FDIC and not in line with the core values of the Biden administration.\" She stopped short, however, of joining Republican calls for his resignation.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

Kennedy Jr. will face a second day of grilling by Democrat senators as he is slated to appear at 10 a.m. ET before the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee , which will hold a 'courtesy hearing' for Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nWhile yesterday's Senate Finance Committee is the only one that votes and reports out the nomination to the Senate Floor, four senators sit on both committees; Chairman Bill Cassidy, (R-LA); Bernie Sanders, (I-VT); Roger Marshall, (R-KS); and Tim Scott, (R-SC).\n\nWatch Live:\n\nWhile Some Democrats have expressed support for Kennedy's positions on issues such as food safety, he has yet to receive a single public dem endorsement for the role . During Wednesday's hearing, several Democrats harangued him over his stance on vaccines and other controversial positions.\n\nKennedy, a former independent presidential candidate, faced aggressive lines of inquiry during yesterday's 3.5 hour appearance before the Senate Finance Committee. Democrats repeatedly brought up Kennedy's history of vaccine skepticism Wednesday, which he sought to get ahead of in his opening statement.\n\n\" News reports have claimed that I am anti-vaccine or anti-industry ,\" said Kennedy. \" I am neither; I am pro-safety. I worked for years to raise awareness about the mercury and toxic chemicals in fish, but that didn't make me anti-fish. All of my kids are vaccinated, and I believe vaccines have a critical role in health care.\"\n\nSen. Liz Warren (D-MA) went completely apeshit on Kennedy, badgering him over whether he would commit to not making money as HHS secretary amid his multiple ongoing lawsuits against vaccine makers.\n\nNEW: Elizabeth Warren accidentally makes RFK Jr. look GREAT with the perfect softball question. WARREN: \"You're not going to take money from drug companies in any way, shape, or form?\" KENNEDY: \"Who, me?\" WARREN: \"Yes, you.\" KENNEDY: \"Oh, yeah. I'm happy to commit to that.... pic.twitter.com/flALLbDVTV\n\nAnd of course, the senators grilling Kennedy have taken millions from the pharmaceutical industry...\n\nThe hostility @RobertKennedyJr experienced at his hearing was directly proportional to how much Pharma money each Senator received.

      "text": "Trump Returning To White House With A Bigger Mandate\n\nAuthored by Ivan Pentchoukov and Janice Hisle via The Epoch Times,\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump will reclaim the presidency next year with a wide-ranging agenda for America and a significant electoral mandate to implement his plans.\n\nHaving already won 295 Electoral College votes by the afternoon of Nov. 6, Trump was on track to capture the national popular vote and sweep all seven battleground states.\n\nThe president-elect was ahead by nearly 4.7 million votes in the national vote as of 11:16 p.m. on Nov. 6 - a 3.3 percentage point margin. He is on track to best his own national totals from 2016 and 2020, having made significant gains in broad swaths of the country, notably in safe blue states, including New Jersey, Illinois, Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Maine.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, Trump's Democratic opponent, conceded the election in a speech in Washington on the afternoon of Nov. 6. A spokesman for the Trump campaign said Harris called Trump to congratulate him earlier in the day and that \"both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country.\"\n\nTrump's commanding performance was buttressed by that of the Republican Party, which recaptured the U.S. Senate and was well on its way to winning the House of Representatives. As of 10:39 p.m. on Nov. 6, Decision Desk HQ projected that the GOP had a 90 percent chance to retain control of the lower chamber.\n\n\"This was a movement like nobody has ever seen before, and frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time,\" Trump said in his victory speech.\n\nShould Republicans win both the House and Senate, Trump will face a different Congress from the one he did in his first term that started in 2017. Now, his allies are in charge of the House Republican caucus, and all but a few of his biggest intra-party detractors have been ousted in closely-watched primary contests. In the Senate, the long-time leader of the Republicans, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), is stepping down and setting the stage for a leadership contest all but sure to be decided by Trump's endorsement.\n\nWith allies in both chambers, the president-elect is less likely to run into the legislative roadblocks that characterized his first term in office.\n\nThe Senate, in particular, will be key to confirming Trump's headline Cabinet picks, which would have seemed impossible eight years ago-particularly Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Trump wants to task with tackling federal food and health agencies.\n\nAs the Trump transition team prepares to take the White House, Americans can expect major changes in how the government handles the economy, foreign affairs, illegal immigration, tax policy, and health care.\n\nTrump promised to end the war in Ukraine before Inauguration Day and to launch a massive operation to deport illegal immigrants. As president, he will have the power to achieve both without the help of Congress. The same goes for rolling back the tailpipe emissions rule, which Republicans call a de-facto electric vehicle mandate.\n\n\"We're going to help our country heal. We have a country that needs help, and it needs help very badly,\" Trump said.\n\n\"We're going to fix our borders. We're going to fix everything about our country.\"\n\nThe president-elect will have to work with Congress to deliver on some of his other promises, including ending taxes on tips, overtime pay, and Social Security income, as well as expanding the child tax credit. Other provisions in his tax plan include reducing corporate taxes to 15 percent from 21 percent, maintaining lower individual taxes and permanently expanding the $2,000 child tax credit.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump has floated the idea of ending taxation altogether and funding the government through tariffs on foreign goods. He has singled out China for 60 percent import tariffs and, a day before the general election, said he would threaten Mexico with a 25 percent tariff to get the southern neighbor's help in stemming the flow of illegal immigrants.\n\nTo tackle inflation, Trump would boost domestic energy production by increasing oil drilling on public lands and offering tax breaks to oil, gas, and coal producers. He said he would double down on the deregulation agenda he embraced in the first term, with a requirement to cut 10 current regulations for each new one.\n\nThe U.S. Capitol building in Washington on Sept. 9, 2024. Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times\n\nTrump plans to bring on billionaire Elon Musk to head a new Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk has said will be key to getting inflation under control.\n\nIn addition to Musk and Kennedy, Trump's picks for his Cabinet are likely to include some of the Republicans who challenged him in the primary election, such as North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nFormer Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and Kennedy's running mate, Nicole Shanahan, are also likely at the front of the line for posts. Gabbard aligned with Trump's opposition to so-called forever wars abroad. Shanahan is an attorney with experience in Silicon Valley.\n\nThe president-elect's picks will be closely watched because many of the people he selected during his first term ended up turning against him, especially in the aftermath of the contested 2020 election.\n\nTrump challenged the outcome of the 2020 race in seven battleground states and refused to bow out of the race until Jan. 6, 2021, when a crowd of his supporters clashed with police on Capitol grounds and breached the building while Congress certified the results of the election.\n\nAfter Trump left the White House on Jan. 20, 2021, the Democrats used the events of Jan. 6 to impeach Trump in the House of Representatives, making him the first president to face two impeachments. The Senate exonerated Trump in both cases.\n\nA Trump supporter waves a giant flag outside the White House on Nov. 6, 2024. Former President Donald Trump on Nov. 6 won a sweeping victory in the 2024 presidential election.

Trump was banned from several social media platforms, had his residence raided by federal agents, faced several indictments on the state and federal levels, posed for a mugshot taken at a Georgia jail, survived two assassination attempts, and went up against two Democratic Party nominees in a single election.\n\nIn the face of the challenges, he ran a successful campaign, took control of the Republican National Committee, beat GOP fundraising records, and made gains with parts of the electorate long-aligned with the Democrats, including Hispanics and young men.\n\n\"God spared my life for a reason,\" Trump said during his victory speech on election night, referring to the assassination attempts on his life.\n\nTrump's 2024 campaign leaned into interviews with internet influencers, including Joe Rogan, the Nelk Boys, and Logan Paul. The strategy appears to have paid off in attracting young men. Exit polls by Edison Research show Trump gaining 6 percentage points with the group compared to 2020.\n\nOne campaign staple remained unchanged from Trump's first run for the White House: the rallies. The president-elect held 119 of these signature events during the 2022-2024 campaign season. As he did in 2016 and 2020, he held the final rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\nTrump rallies have evolved over the years to include elements of entertainment and visual aids. Some of the final rallies of the 2024 campaign, including a jam-packed rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City, included live opera performances.\n\nIn Trump's speeches, social media messages, and campaign ads, he focused on the three crises facing the Biden-Harris administration: inflation, the border crisis, and, more recently, the wars in Ukraine and Israel. The current administration has managed to get inflation under control, but illegal border crossings have remained stubbornly high and the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East appear to be spiraling out of control.\n\nTrump has promised to end the war in Ukraine during the transition period between November and January. He has repeatedly said his top priority on the first day in office would be to seal the southern border with Mexico.\n\nTo win the 2024 Republican nomination, Trump defeated more than a dozen contenders without participating in any of the four Republican presidential debates.\n\nSeveral contenders jumped into the race early in 2023 after Trump declared his candidacy in November 2022. By the fall of 2023, the field of candidates began to shrink. Trump's former vice president, Mike Pence, withdrew from the race in October 2023. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) dropped out the following month.\n\nTrump comfortably won the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 15, nearly 30 percentage points ahead of his nearest competitor, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Ohio biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy dropped out immediately after the caucuses. DeSantis quit the race several days later.\n\nTrump's former ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, hung on until March before dropping out.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at the PPL Center in Allentown, Pa., on Oct. 29, 2024. Arjun Singh/The Epoch Times\n\nNow 78 years old and making his third presidential run, Trump started his rise to fame and fortune in his native New York. After leaving the White House in 2021, he now lives in Florida at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of his father, Fred Trump, he built an international real estate empire. Donald Trump became a household name during the 2000s while starring in the reality TV series \"The Apprentice.\" During the show, he coined his famous phrase \"You're fired!\" while axing a contestant at the end of each show. Trump also has authored several books, including 1987's \"The Art of the Deal.\"\n\nBefore he became the standard-bearer for a revamped version of the Republican Party, Trump had changed his political affiliation several times.\n\nIn 2004, he told CNN, \"In many cases, I probably identify more as Democrat.\"\n\nHe said it seemed to him that the economy was healthier under Democrats. Trump switched to the Republican Party in 2011, records show.\n\nIn 2014, Trump took steps toward running as governor of New York but decided against it. The following year, he pursued politics in earnest, ending years of speculation about a Trump presidential run.\n\nOn June 16, 2015, he and his wife, Melania Trump, rode down an escalator at Trump Tower in Manhattan to announce his candidacy.\n\nThat day, he debuted his \"Make America Great Again\" slogan, echoing the \"Let's Make America Great Again\" phrase that Republican Ronald Reagan used during his successful 1980 presidential campaign.\n\nIn 2016, Trump became the unlikely victor of the presidential election, making him the first U.S. president with no prior experience in public office or as a military commander.\n\nSecurity in front of Trump Tower in New York City on Sept. 26, 2024. Samira Bouaou/The Epoch Times\n\nThroughout the campaign season, polls showed Trump trailing Democrat Hillary Clinton, a longtime politician and wife of former President Bill Clinton. That pattern continued in 2020 and 2024, with Trump consistently outperforming polls.\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump fought a barrage of political attacks that began immediately after he took the oath of office in 2017.\n\nHe became the third U.S. president to be impeached, and he stands alone as the sole president to be impeached twice. The Senate acquitted him both times.\n\nDuring the first two years of his term, the president and dozens of people close to him were ensnared in the so-called Russian-collusion inquiry headed by special counsel Robert Mueller. The special counsel concluded the investigation with a report that did not document any evidence of collusion.\n\nIn the final year of his presidency, Trump grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic and a summer of race riots as he campaigned for reelection. His Democratic opponent was Joe Biden, a longtime senator who served as vice president under President Barack Obama.\n\nA Trump White House statement said his presidential accomplishments included a strong economy with low interest rates, \"massive deregulation\" to spur business growth, and taking \"historic action to promote peace in the Middle East.\" He was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in the Middle East.\n\nTrump was born in New York City on June 14, 1946; his parents, Fred Trump and Mary Trump, née MacLeod, had five children. Trump himself has five children through three marriages, and 10 grandchildren.\n\nHe received his education at the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school, followed by Fordham University and the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a bachelor's degree in economics.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Tim Scott Is Trump's Ideal Running Mate We can only hope that Trump himself has the foresight to see that blindingly obvious reality.\n\nT he conventional wisdom concerning vice-presidential picks is that they don't really matter because voters focus on the top of the ticket in presidential elections. This is ordinarily true, but 2024 is no ordinary election year. This time the winner will be the oldest president ever inaugurated, so it's eminently possible that his vice-president will be called on to finish his term. We know what that means if Biden wins, so Trump's running mate will receive more than the usual amount of voter scrutiny. Thus, he can't afford to choose another irascible white male or any Florida resident. This eliminates all but one of the four choices toward whom he is reportedly leaning.\n\nHe has a compelling life story and, at 58, he's young enough to be a vigorous chief executive if required.\n\nAccording to an NBC News report , Trump has narrowed his search to four top prospects: North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Tim Scott of South Carolina and JD Vance of Ohio. If the report is accurate, the first name that should be crossed off the list is Burgum. The last thing Trump needs in a running mate is an aging white guy from a state he won by 33 points in 2020. The next name that must be scratched off is Rubio. The 12th Amendment precludes electors from voting for a president and vice president who reside in the same state. The third name that should be removed from the list is Vance. He's a good Senator but would add nothing new to the ticket but a history of trashing Trump that would be exploited by the corporate media.\n\nWhich brings us to Senator Scott, who is encumbered by few if any liabilities and has much to offer Trump's ticket and the country. He has a compelling life story. Having grown up in a poor, single-parent household in South Carolina, he nonetheless believed the escape route from poverty was hard work and education. In 2010, he proved it by becoming the first Black Republican from South Carolina elected to the House of Representatives since 1897. In 2012, he was appointed to a vacant seat in the U.S. Senate and subsequently won a special election in order to finish out the term. In 2016 and 2022, he was reelected with more than 60 percent of the vote. He is a solid conservative who vociferously repudiates identity politics :\n\nI am living proof that America is the land of opportunity, and not a land of oppression ... For those of you on the left, you can call me a prop, you can call me a token, you can call me the N-word, you can question my Blackness, you can even call me \"Uncle Tim.\" Just understand: Your words are no match for my evidence. The truth of my life disproves your lies.\n\nNor does Scott pull his punches when pointing out President Biden's myriad economic blunders. As the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, he recently delivered this withering indictment of Bidenomics :\n\nPresident Biden and Bidenomics has devastated our economy and devastated people working paycheck to paycheck. The highest percentage of Americans with the fewest dollars in their savings account for an emergency is now because of President Biden and Democrats' reckless spending ... Prices across the board have certainly increased nearly 20 percent since Biden took office.\n\nAs the Associated Press reports , he has launched a $14 million outreach effort to minority voters: \"Scott's push comes as Trump's campaign is ramping up its own outreach efforts to Hispanic and Black voters, especially Black men, in his expected rematch against President Joe Biden.\" The polls have consistently shown that non-white working class voters are deeply dissatisfied with Biden's job performance, particularly on the economy. As Scott himself puts it, \"Much to the chagrin of many folks, there's no doubt that African American men are wide open for a political shift of partisanship.\" And he knows how to drive home the message that Biden is bad for all voters. Here's how he said it on Fox and Friends yesterday:\n\nThe one thing we know without any question: We cannot afford Joe Biden on the world stage. The best thing Joe Biden can do to restore American prominence on the global stage - stay off of it. We need Donald Trump back on the stage ... We need a sharp President of the United States, protecting the Western alliance, defending our allies and doing the right thing for the American people. That person is Donald Trump. It's time for us to fire Joe Biden.\n\nThat clip should allay any fears that Tim Scott is too nice to play the \"attack dog\" role that vice-presidential candidates traditionally play in tight elections. He would be far better in this role than Mike Pence ever was and would also do a better job in a VP debate with Kamala Harris. His candidacy would be historic and kill any (serious) claim that Trump is a racist. He has a compelling life story and, at 58, he's young enough to be a vigorous chief executive if required by unforeseen circumstances to move into the Oval Office. He has more experience in Washington than most of his rivals for the VP nomination, yet retains a positive vision of the United States reminiscent of the optimism that Ronald Reagan always exuded.\n\nIn the end, Tim Scott is clearly the perfect running mate for Trump in 2024. We can only hope that Trump himself has the foresight to see that blindingly obvious reality.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Tim Scott's Poor Debate Performance Seems to Doom Campaign He needed a breakout performance, and he didn't have one.\n\nT here have been occasional smatterings that there exists a lane for South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott to win the GOP presidential nomination. The cover of the most recent print magazine for the Washington Examiner , for instance, was headlined \"Scott's Shot: An intriguing but tricky path for a new Trump challenger.\" Conservative New York Times columnist Ross Douthat penned an op-ed at the end of last month headlined \"With DeSantis Reeling, What About Tim Scott?\" It was speculated elsewhere that Scott could be an alternative choice for a GOP donor class that is alienated by Ron DeSantis' struggles in the polls as well as the Florida governor's decision to pursue a Trumpian lane and an isolationist position on foreign policy.\n\nBut hopes that Scott could be an alternative all but collapsed Wednesday night with his poor debate showing. When the camera panned across the candidates upon the opening of the debate, Scott looked confused and surprised that his name was called, and that halting appearance continued throughout the debate.\n\nScott seemed low-energy and unconfident in his words. His demeanor was nervous, and his lack of a smile contrasted with businessman Vivek Ramaswamy's near-constant grin.\n\nThe senator's most memorable moment came when he pushed back against the debate's moderator, Bret Baier, to ask for more time, stating: \"I'm a Southern boy. I talk slow.\" He let out a chuckle in a much-needed departure from his otherwise expressionless composure. In that moment, his awareness of his more subdued personality was able to come across as a cordial and dignified contrast to the other candidates' bombastic tendencies. In other moments, however, Scott's disinterest in getting involved in the raucous arguments left him out of the conversation.\n\nAnother strong moment for Scott came when he spoke out unapologetically against abortion. \"Our Declaration of Independence says our creator gave us inalienable rights, including life,\" said Scott. \"That is an issue we must solve.\" Unlike other candidates, he pushed back against the notion that the federal government should permit states to have whatever abortion laws they would like. \"We can't allow states like California, New York and Illinois to have abortion on demand up to the day of birth,\" he said. However, when he attempted to butt in and push for a 15-week federal ban, he was all but ignored.\n\nA weaker moment came in the senator's first debate response, when he gave what seemed to be a canned answer. Scott was asked about what he has done to rein in the increasing size of government, and he called for \"turning the spigot off in Washington.\" Moderator Martha MacCallum pushed back, pointing out that he had been part of spending trillions on COVID relief, and made his answer seem insincere.\n\nPerhaps a debate is not the best forum for the soft-spoken senator. But with Scott averaging 3.6 percent in the polls , he needed a breakout performance. In this case, not - as he put it - \"g oing back and forth and being childish\" may have left Scott in the dust.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Tim Scott for Veep! He would consolidate the rightward shift of black voters.\n\nP resident Donald J. Trump should select Sen. Tim Scott (R-South Carolina) as his running mate. Trump-Scott 2024 would be a juggernaut. Scott would serve Trump ably as vice president. He is well positioned to step in for Trump, should he become sidelined.\n\nLong before any of that, this duo must get elected. Here, Scott looks uniquely promising.\n\nA May 15-16 Harvard-Harris survey of 1,660 registered voters discovered that, among seven potential veep choices, Scott is the only one who makes Americans more likely to back Trump, by an additional 6 percent. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida), with 0 percent, does not move the needle. Gov. Doug Burgum (R - North Dakota) curbs enthusiasm for Trump by 6 percent.\n\nMy American Spectator colleague David Catron is not buying the Burgum boomlet: \"The last thing Trump needs in a running mate is an aging white guy from a state he won by 33 points in 2020.\"\n\nBurgum also advances the proposition that two billionaires are not always better than one - especially since Burgum could deliver so little in the hunt for 270 Electoral College votes. (Three down, 267 to go!) And his state will go GOP, with or without Burgum on the ticket. North Dakota last voted Democrat in 1964 , when it went all the way with LBJ. The Peace Garden State will back Biden in November ... as soon as Massachusetts boards the Trump Train.\n\nTim Scott's broad appeal - across the Palmetto State's cities, suburbs, and rural towns - helps explain why he regularly outperforms other top statewide Republican contenders. In November 2014 , U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham was reelected with 54.3 percent of the vote. Gov. Nikki Haley scored a second term with 55.9 percent of the ballots. Tim Scott bested them both, with 61.1 percent support among the electorate.\n\nIn 2016 , Donald J. Trump won the White House, partially thanks to 54.9 percent of South Carolina's vote. That same Election Night, Scott won 60.6 percent.\n\nAnd in 2022 , Gov. Henry McMaster earned four more years with 58.0 percent of the vote. Sen. Tim Scott that evening won six more years, with a 62.9 percent victory.\n\nWhile Scott was a low-key presidential candidate, he has been one of Trump's best surrogates, in person and on-air. He is upbeat, energetic, informative, and persuasive. Those qualities will serve Trump well on the hustings, via Scott's debate with Kamala Harris, and as his chief advocate as 50th vice president of the United States.\n\nTim Scott's experience in the House and Senate, including his work as ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, his role as a member of the Finance and Foreign Affairs Committees, and his impact on the Opportunity Zones and related tax cuts that he has sponsored or endorsed make him the right man to help President Trump push the Make America Great Again agenda through Congress.\n\nWhile South Carolina's nine electoral votes have not gone Democrat since 1976 , Scott could attract far more electoral votes elsewhere.\n\nScott is not the sort of black man whose high school overlooked the ocean and who weekends on the slopes at Aspen and Park City - not that there's anything wrong with that. Scott grew up poor, with a single mom, in public housing. Anyone who challenges his \"black authenticity\" is a certified bigot and a mindless one at that.\n\nScott justifiably holds these race critics in contempt:\n\n\"I am living proof that America is the land of opportunity, and not a land of oppression,\" Scott has said. \"For those of you on the left, you can call me a prop, you can call me a token, you can call me the N-word, you can question my Blackness, you can even call me 'Uncle Tim.' Just understand: Your words are no match for my evidence. The truth of my life disproves your lies .\"\n\nThe mere presence of Tim Scott on the GOP ticket would consolidate the recent rightward shift of black voters. They are marching toward Trump in stunning numbers.\n\nCNN's data analyst Harry Enten was visibly shocked on June 17, when he discussed an aggregate of network polls that captured Trump's swelling share of the black vote. At this point in 2020, Trump had 7 percent of the black vote, before scoring 12 percent that November, according to exit surveys by Edison Research. Trump now has 21 percent support among black voters - triple his position in June 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, excitement for Biden among black voters has vanished. Overall, he has plunged from 86 percent at this point in 2020 to 70 percent in 2024. With those age 50+, he has slid from 83 percent to 74 percent. Biden has collapsed among blacks under 50, from 80 percent to 37 percent.\n\n\"I've just never seen anything like this. I'm like speechless,\" Enten said. \"We're careening towards historic performance for a Republican presidential candidate, the likes of which we have not seen in six decades.\"\n\nScott would solidify and enhance the 20 percent or so of the black vote that consistently has backed Trump in polls since last fall. Trump-Scott could secure 25 percent of the black vote; 35 percent no longer seems beyond imagination. If that many black Americans also vote GOP downballot, Republicans should keep the House and capture the Senate from New York's Chuck Schumer and the Biden Democrats.\n\nAnd if Trump-Scott spend four more years satisfying these new Republicans, a significant and swelling cohort of black voters will stay GOP. With the cornerstone of its base reduced to rubble, the Democrat Party will wither away and, to quote Friedrich Engels, enter \"the museum of antiquities , next to the spinning wheel and the bronze axe.\"\n\nStylistically, Scott would be the cream in Trump's coffee. While some people find the former president a tad hot and strong, Scott is relaxed and soothing. Stirred together, these two would make a fine blend, and complement each other - as running mates and governing partners should.\n\nScott also would comfort nervous whites. Suburban women and others might believe the garbage they hear daily on MSNBC and The View : Trump is a black-hating racist monster - a Klansman in a bright-red tie. Scott exposes this as the grotesque lie that it always has been. Some white voters will think to themselves, \"I heard Trump was a racist. But he picked Tim Scott as his V.P. So, the Democrats lied to me about this, too. To Hell with them! I will go ahead and vote for Trump.\"\n\nIf such thoughts cross at least, say, 200,000 minds in Scottsdale, Arizona; Marietta, Georgia; Grosse Pointe, Michigan; Henderson, Nevada; and Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, Trump-Scott will win the White House.\n\nGiven his personal integrity, legislative experience, increasingly polished rhetorical skills, and everything he would gain while riding shotgun to Trump, Tim Scott would make a suitable successor to the 45/47th POTUS. America's future would be quite bright, indeed, if, on January 20, 2029, President Donald J. Trump hands the keys to the White House to President-elect Tim Scott.\n\nDeroy Murdock is a Manhattan-based Fox News contributor.\n\nREAD MORE from Deroy Murdock:\n\nNew Video: Vegas Voters 'Reside' in Bars and Strip Clubs\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Tim Scott Is Running for Vice President - But Whose? The senator's presidential campaign has left many puzzled.\n\nS en. Tim Scott's announcement that he is running in the Republican presidential primary has left many puzzled. With two heavyweights - Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis - and several other contenders vying for the nomination, Scott seems a long shot at best. On the other hand, as Jim Newell of Slate pointed out, \"Hope, opportunity, aspiration ... is not a message being offered by either of the top two Republican contenders.\" Republican strategist Karl Rove exuded even more confidence , writing for the Wall Street Journal : \"Tim Scott can move a crowd. I've seen it more than once.\"\n\nIn announcing his presidential exploratory committee , Scott touched on race , patriotism, and economic decline as themes of his engaging personal story - and countered with an unapologetic defense of the American Dream. After describing how he was raised in poverty by a single mother, he said the key to success is to move forward: \"Joe Biden and the radical Left have chosen a culture of grievance over greatness.\"\n\nBut the South Carolina senator's path to victory will be difficult, perhaps insurmountable. Scott's current lack of national support stands in stark contrast to his personal charisma and unique optimism - leading many to speculate that the influential black conservative is really running not for president but for vice president. He may not be able to contend with Trump and others electorally, but in the minds of the top presidential candidates, he is already being positioned as an effective counterpart.\n\nTrump wished him well on Truth Social, reminding his followers: \"I got Opportunity Zones done with Tim, a big deal that has been highly successful. Good luck Tim!\" Nikki Haley, another presidential hopeful who was formerly governor of South Carolina, has been a strong supporter of Scott's political career since 2012 and remains on cordial terms with him despite competing for the nomination. Keith Naughton recently wrote in the Hill that \"Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott are the ticket to beat Trump.\"\n\nThe question is this: For which of these candidates would Scott make the best running mate? He has been critical of Trump in the past, despite partnering on key pieces of legislation. He has little-to-no official relationship with DeSantis and hails from the same state as Haley. Some have speculated that the outsider candidate Vivek Ramaswamy could partner with Scott to provide more Washington experience and credibility - but both candidates currently have low poll numbers.\n\nRegardless of which candidate (if any) ultimately joins forces with Scott, his presence in the political arena injects fresh energy and a unique perspective into the conversation. In a time marked by uncertainty and division, Scott's emphasis on hope, opportunity, and unity may prove to be a compelling message capable of resonating with an ever-more-diverse electorate.\n\nScott's story, which he recounted in his announcement, is a living refutation of the lies of the progressive left: \"I know America is a land of opportunity, not a land of oppression. I know it because I lived it.\" His America is far from the otherworldly narrative converging from the far Left and far Right that our nation is somehow a failed experiment.\n\nNotwithstanding the regulatory onslaught of the Biden administration, the United States today still provides the best opportunity to start and grow a business that we have ever known. One needs no more than brain power and an internet connection to become an historic success.\n\nBut uplifting rhetoric like Scott's promise to \"restore opportunities for hard-working Americans to thrive and prosper\" will not alone suffice. It is incumbent upon us to embrace opportunity, to take risks, and to build new ventures. Our primary obstacles are mainly of our own making, whether public policy, tax and regulatory burdens, barriers to entry, or personal choices. We can overcome these obstacles both through smarter political choices and by building our own businesses, charities, and other institutions.\n\nThat is why it will be big news if or when one of the top-slated candidates adds Scott to his or her ticket. While nobody should expect the next election to solve problems that are decades in the making, we need representatives who have not lost faith in the very engine of our prosperity - who are not actively undermining the institutions that make us the greatest nation on earth.\n\nScott distinguishes himself from Trump and DeSantis in that both candidates seemingly owe their success to the tinge of doom and crisis underlying their rhetoric. He provides a crucial alternative perspective, talking about how great our country was, is, and will be again. Choosing him as a vice-presidential running mate would be a way of arguing that America has better days ahead.\n\nThis early in the campaign, nobody should count Scott out for the big job. Lesser-known presidential candidates with messages of hope have caught fire before. As the primary wears on, Republicans may find that Scott's command of policy issues and experience in Washington make him the best candidate. Regardless, he will have an important part to play in coming months.\n\nMatthew Mohlman is President of Monument Ventures , a unique finance platform for principled investors.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Sen. Tim Scott Endorses Marco Rubio\n\nM arco Rubio has a lot of work to do if he intends to repeat last night's spectacular performance in Iowa. He's running behind in New Hampshire, where voters are split between the \"Don't Tread on Me\" stylings of Trump and Cruz, and the \"compassionate conservatism\" of Jeb Bush and Chris Christie, who see New Hampshire as a \"must win\" if they intend to say in the game (both got miserable 1% ratings last night with Bush earning a single delegate for his trouble and Christie coming in just below Mike Huckabee, who performed so badly he dropped out).\n\nPart of that work will obtaining solid endorsements, and this morning, Rubio secured a major one in South Carolina, picking up the good word of Senator Tim Scott .\n\nSen. Marco Rubio scored a key endorsement on Tuesday as South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott gave the Republican presidential hopeful his backing.\n\nIn a video posted to Rubio's Youtube page, Scott said the Republican party has \"one shot\" to beat Hillary Clinton in 2016 and \"that shot is Marco Rubio.\"\n\n\"I'm putting my confidence and trust in Marco Rubio because I believe he takes us to that better future,\" Scott said. \"Marco Rubio understands that, here in America, it's not about where you start, but where you're going.\n\nThis is, of course, not unexpected. Tim Scott has worked closely with Rubio and would be a natural ally. But I like this endorsement less for it's impact on the election cycle and more for what it represents about the modern GOP.\n\nSenator Tim Scott is the <s>first black Senator</s> (I stand corrected, Tim Scott is the first in modern times , but not the first. Hiram Revels and Blanche Bruce were both elected shortly after the Civil War, both from Mississippi, both Republicans) elected from the \"deep south.\" He was appointed, initially, by a female governor, herself a woman of color, a child of immigrants and a Methodist. He is throwing his support behind the Hispanic son of immigrants who escaped Communist Cuba, the night after more than 60% of Republican Iowa caucus-goers voted for a minority - Hispanic, black, or female -  to win the Presidential nomination. Even if you're not a fan of Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Dr. Ben Carson or Carly Fiorina, you have to appreciate what that means for the \"party of old white people.\" Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, both lily-white septugenarians - literally old white people - are arguing over .4% of a vote that drew only half as many caucus-goers as in 2008, flipping coins for delegates and lobbing accusations of voter fraud.\n\nThe media certainly won't talk about it, but the diversity among Republicans is a very big deal .\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "The Unintended Consequence of Trump Skipping the Debate He's the long-term loser.\n\nD onald Trump will be present by his absence Wednesday night in Milwaukee. Ron DeSantis, Tim Scott, Vivek Ramaswamy, and the others who hope to wrest the Republican nomination from him not only will walk a minefield when attempting to criticize the former president; they cannot even escape his shadow when he sits in another state.\n\nA quadrennial tradition sees presidential aspirants debating. Donald Trump, as he does with many customs, bucks that tradition.\n\nIn doing so, he follows another one: When you run comfortably ahead in the polls, do not allow the people beneath you to stand on your level on a stage before the electorate.\n\nLyndon B. Johnson refused to debate Barry Goldwater in 1964. Richard Nixon, comfortably ahead of Hubert Humphrey until an 11th-hour surge in which the vice president siphoned off many George Wallace voters, balked at debating in 1968. Ditto for 1972 when he cruised to a 49-state landslide. Nota bene: Johnson and Nixon rebuffed a general election debate, and Trump merely skips an intramural forum helping to sort out the Republican nomination.\n\nGerald Ford debated Jimmy Carter in 1976, and Carter (after some gamesmanship) debated Ronald Reagan in 1980, because the incumbents feared losing, which they did. By the time Reagan debated Walter Mondale in 1984 - and muffed some answers in debate one that brought about one of the great lines in presidential debate history in the second contest - a debate felt obligatory.\n\nPresidential debates amount to not so much an American tradition as a TV tradition. It came as no coincidence that the first presidential debate in American history occurred in 1960, when nine in every 10 households owned a television. William McKinley did not debate William Jennings Bryan. Martin Van Buren never debated William Henry Harrison. But we imagine they did because television makes us think that what we experienced through pixels our forebears experienced somehow, too.\n\nDonald Trump, who generally performs well in debates - with his first encounter with Joe Biden a Hindenburg exception - possibly will win the debate by no-showing tonight in Milwaukee. He allows eight candidates who want to beat him to instead beat each other up. Specifically, without the frontrunner present, they aim to make a piñata out of second-place Ron DeSantis, which is another way of saying that they unwittingly do Trump's bidding. Should any of them vault ahead of the sickly pack, he has a plan for that, too. The former president will show up to post bail and pose for a mugshot in Georgia on Thursday, which surely blunts any momentum the debate winner may enjoy.\n\nNeither Ron DeSantis nor Chris Christie nor Tim Scott plays the immediate major loser in this scenario. Fox News does. Trump equals ratings. His absence equals not so much a must-see debate as a Star Search competition for who may proceed under a brighter spotlight, only in this audition eight egos on the stage, rather than Statler and Waldorf armed with rotten tomatoes, eggs, and sacks of flour in the balcony, decide who continues. In other words, the ambiguity in who becomes the challenger for Trump emboldens those polling in the low single-digits to continue their ego trip - and continue helping Gulliver defeat the many Lilliputians.\n\nIs there any doubt that Trump attracts more eyes in his conversation with Tucker Carlson, undoubtedly eager to stick it to his corporate overlords who unwisely dumped him, than do DeSantis and the seven dwarfs? This hurts Fox News.\n\nThe long-term loser? Donald Trump.\n\nIn bowing out of the primary debates, he gives Joe Biden an easy excuse to bow out of the general election debates. Katie Hobbs chickened out of debating Kari Lake during the 2022 Arizona gubernatorial campaign. This worked, as the Democrat won the general election.\n\nBiden's underwhelming intelligence, propensity to say idiotic or barely coherent things, and alleged senility make the debate stage the perfect place to showcase his disqualifiers before voters. Donald Trump, in taking his ball and going home from this and presumably other Republican debates, allows Joe Biden to weasel out of a general election debate without consequence. This surely imposes adverse consequences on Donald Trump should he become the Republican nominee for the third consecutive contest.\n\nUndoubtedly, he devises a memorable one-liner, à la telling CNN's Kaitlan Collins \" because now I'm not president \" earlier this year to rationalize an about-face on the debt-ceiling vote, to justify not debating his opponents but calling for a debate with the president. This cannot undo the self-inflicted damage, albeit belated damage as though from a time bomb, that giving the dullard-in-chief an excuse to play hooky on debates unleashes.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "GOP Debate: What's Not to Like? The Republican Party enjoys a surfeit of candidates who could beat Joe Biden.\n\nW ednesday night, Republican voters had a glimpse of what could be: a 2024 GOP primary not held hostage by the insatiable ego and self-absorbed rantings of former President Donald Trump. Sure, many of the eight hopefuls who - unlike Trump - participated in the Fox News debate in Milwaukee probably won't remain on the field next year, but none would be an ominous drag on the party.\n\nOne of the stars of the night, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, warned: \"Trump is the most disliked politician in America. We can't win a general election that way.\"\n\nIf the 2024 primary centers on Trump's 2020 grievances, President Joe Biden wins.\n\n(A recent AP-NORC Center poll found that 53 percent of Americans would \"definitely not\" support Trump in November 2024, with only 36 percent saying they'd probably or definitely support Trump. In 2020, Biden garnered 7 million more votes than the then-incumbent; few believe Trump can do better next year.)\n\nHaley also took members of her party to task for runaway deficit spending during Trump's tenure. \"The truth is that Biden didn't do this to us,\" she said of the $32 trillion national debt. \"Our Republicans did this to us, too\" - as when they passed that $2.2 trillion COVID stimulus bill in March 2020.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie served as the party's conscience when he berated Trump's decision to push then-Vice President Mike Pence to not certify Biden's victory on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\"Someone's got to stop normalizing this conduct,\" Christie argued. \"Whether or not you believe the criminal charges are right or wrong, the conduct is beneath the office of president of the United States.\"\n\nThe audience booed.\n\n\"This is the great thing about this country,\" Christie responded. \"Booing is allowed, but it doesn't change the truth.\" Bravo.\n\nPence robustly defended his refusal to bow to Trump in deference to his constitutional duty. And he mopped the floor with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. The youngest participant on the stage tried to appeal to the base by hailing Trump as the greatest president in this century.\n\nThere's an argument to be made about limiting U.S. aid to Ukraine. Ramaswamy preferred to whack Pence and Christie for visiting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whom he cheekily dismissed as their \"pope.\"\n\nHaley schooled Ramaswamy on foreign policy. Christie waved off the businessman as \"a guy who sounds like ChatGPT.\" It was the sound bite of the night.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis touted his record in Florida. Under his leadership, the Sunshine State has been a magnet for businesses and families looking for a place without California-style intrusive regulations, such as the COVID closures that shut down too many American schools.\n\nWith the media fixation on his lack of bonhomie, DeSantis had to hold his own and not come off as a hothead. He succeeded.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott didn't quite break through. He's too darn polite for a crowded field.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is a seasoned policymaker, but he's a \"former\" elected official.\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum brought a folksy small-town flavor to the stage.\n\nIn sum, the Republican Party enjoys a surfeit of candidates who could beat Biden, whose disapproval rating is nearly 53 percent, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average. The question is: Do Republican voters want to win?\n\nDebra J. Saunders is a fellow at the Discovery Institute's Chapman Center for Citizen Leadership.

      "text": "CFPB: New Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Deployed to Fix What Rohit Chopra Broke\n\nI n a desperately needed move this week, President Donald Trump fired Rohit Chopra , director of the Consumer Financial Protection Board (CFPB), and installed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as acting director.\n\nThese actions drastically enlarged the regulatory scope of the CFPB, with little concern for the potential impact on businesses and consumers. Under Chopra, the bureau even ignored rebukes from congressional leaders like Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC).\n\nThere's no question the Biden-era CFPB with Chopra at the helm pursued politically-motivated, ideological goals at the expense of its core mission to protect consumers from banks and other financial services companies.\n\nBut now Bessent is at the wheel.\n\nIn a Monday morning memo to CFPB staff, the acting director immediately halted movement on proposed or final rules and guidance. He suspended effective dates of rules and put a pause on investigations, enforcement action, material agreements, public communications, and reports.\n\nIt's a strong first step toward reorienting the CFPB to serve its stated mission. Bessent should continue to make haste undoing the disastrous 11th-hour regulations and lawsuits issued under Chopra.\n\nNext, Bessent should look to restructure the CFPB to prevent such out-of-control behavior from ever happening again. Under the CFPB's unique structure, it receives funding from the Federal Reserve. This puts the agency outside of Congress's annual appropriations process and shields it from the oversight to which all agencies ought to be subjected.\n\nThis absence of accountability is not acceptable for American taxpayers and businesses.\n\nAlthough the CFPB's funding structure was ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court in 2023, the Trump administration and Congress can still work together to make the CFPB more accountable to the public. They should immediately bring the agency under the annual appropriations process and require its leaders to go to Congress each year and make a case for continued funding.\n\nNext, they should completely overhaul the CFPB's mission and orient it toward helping consumers, rather than waging ideological battles against private businesses. Certainly, Bessent will continue the Administration's efforts to crack down on DEI policies by eliminating the CFPB's stated goal of \"promot[ing] diversity and inclusion best practices,\" but he shouldn't stop there.\n\nThe CFPB should no longer measure success based on how many enforcement actions it launches or how much money it shakes out of businesses. A truly successful CFPB ought to focus on educating consumers and making the financial services industry more transparent, as its mission statement requires.\n\nBessent needs to get this agency back on track or - if that's not possible - shut it down.\n\nREAD MORE from Brandon Arnold :\n\nFederal Agency Gone Wild: Why the CFPB Needs Immediate Reform - and a New Chair\n\nBrandon Arnold is the executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

Tim Scott (R-SC) reintroduced legislation to allow the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to expedite the processing and removal of migrants illegally entering the country in response to the fentanyl-related public health emergency, Breitbart News learned exclusively Wednesday.\n\nScott's Alan Shao II Fentanyl Public Health Emergency and Overdose Prevention Act takes a threefold approach to addressing the fentanyl crisis fueled by the expiration of Title 42 during the Biden administration.\n\n\"The former president left a disaster on our southern border that infected communities and families across our nation,\" Scott told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement. While President Donald Trump and his team are making remarkable progress securing the border through executive actions, Scott seeks to move legislation that would remain in place after the Trump administration.\n\nHe explained to Breitbart News his very personal reason for introducing the bill.\n\n\"A couple of years ago, my friend Alan Shao lost his son to the crisis curated by the Biden administration's open border policies. This legislation is named in honor of his son to remind us that one life lost is one too many and that we can't continue to sit idly by allowing devastation to rip through our homes,\" he said.\n\nAlan T. Shao, for whom the bill is named, was the son of Dr. Alan Shao, the former Dean of the School of Business at the College of Charleston in Scott's home state. Alan passed away at the age of 27 due to a fentanyl overdose.\n\nUnder Scott's bill, expedited processing and removal would apply to migrants attempting to enter the United States from Canada or Mexico illegally, not possessing necessary travel documents for admittance into the United States, and being held at a point of entry or a Border Patrol station facilitating immigration processing.\n\nThe legislation utilizes powers similar to those under Title 42, which Trump activated to curtail illegal immigration during his first administration. Those powers, which Biden halted, allow DHS to expedite the processing and removal of migrants illegally entering the country, and applies them in response to the fentanyl-related public health emergency.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), the agency seized more than 367 million deadly doses in 2024 - a mere 2 mg of fentanyl equates to a deadly dose. More than 100,000 Americans died from drug overdoses during 2023, the majority caused by fentanyl.\n\nScott has been a leader in the Senate in seeking to close the southern border to drugs and illegal migrants. In addition to the Alan T. Shao II Fentanyl Public Health Emergency and Overdose Prevention Act, he introduced the Securing Our Border Act , which redirects $22.4 billion of unobligated funding in Democrats' ill-named Inflation Reduction Act to hire 87,000 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agents and utilizes those funds to bolster border security measures.\n\nHe also introduced the Stifling Transnational Operations and Proliferators by Mitigating Activities that Drive Narcotics, Exploitation, and Smuggling Sanctions Act - or the STOP MADNESS Act , which would also ensure the president can sanction foreign governments that resist efforts to repatriate their citizens who unlawfully enter the United States.\n\nScott has worked to advance bipartisan border security measures as well. In April 2024, his FEND Off Fentanyl Act was signed into law. That bill directs the Treasury Department to use U.S. economic national security tools to choke off the profits of the Chinese precursor manufacturers and the Mexican cartels that push fentanyl across the border.\n\n\"I am grateful to lead efforts to put an end to this public health crisis and clean up our border,\" Scott said. \"I look forward to working with the Trump administration to ensure more Americans can live in a safer nation.\"\n\nBradley Jaye is Deputy Political Editor for Breitbart News.

      "text": "Exclusive - NRSC Chair Tim Scott on Gary Peters' Retirement: Trump a Force to Be 'Reckoned With,' Michigan Seat Winnable\n\nNational Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) told Breitbart News exclusively on Tuesday that Sen. Gary Peters' (D-MI) retirement proves that President Donald Trump is a \"force to be reckoned with\" and that Republicans can win the open Michigan seat for the first time in 30 years.\n\nScott spoke to Breitbart News after Peters said he would not seek reelection in 2026. Peters' announcement has sent shockwaves throughout Washington, DC, and Michigan, as the outgoing senator just served as the Democrat Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) chair, and is responsible for Democrats losing their Senate majority.\n\nScott, the newly minted NRSC chair, said that Trump's victory in Michigan has proved that Americans across all walks of life are flocking to the Make America Great Again agenda.\n\nScott said, \"It just tells me one thing that is completely crystal clear in American politics today: that President Trump is a force to be reckoned with, and if you don't, then you lose. And bottom line - I think he's running scared because President Trump won Michigan.\"\n\nThe South Carolina senator said that Trump won Michigan for two reasons: the open border and Trump growing the Republican coalition.\n\n\"Number one, Peters sat by while the American Southern border was wide open. The greatest invasion in American history, 14 million people crossing illegally, a lot of them landing in Michigan. Number two, the auto workers. President Trump has an open policy as relates to American workers, union or not. President Trump supports American workers. Peters did not. Number three, minority voters, 39 percent President Trump told me the other day, 39 percent of the African American males voted for him. That number might be off by a little bit, but what it says is Detroit, Michigan, is in play. The state is in play. Why? Because President Trump showed us a recipe to get things done.\"\n\n\"We have to take advantage of that by recruiting a great candidate, and we're going to make sure that we maintain the Trump coalition of union workers, minority voters, and, frankly, everybody that loves apple pie, baseball, and the American dream,\" he added.\n\nAfter the Peters' retirement announcement story broke, a spokesperson from the DSCC said , 'No Republican has won a Michigan Senate race in 30 years,\" and asserted Democrats will continue to hold the seat.\n\nScott said that Democrats cannot \"respond to the truth\" that Republicans beat them in 2024 and can flip the seat in 2026. He noted that now-Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) beat Republican Mike Rogers by three-tenths of a point in the 2024 Michigan Senate race.\n\nHe said that the seat \"is not just winnable with President Trump leading the ticket, not literally on the ballot, but he's going to lead the ticket because of his economic policies that will make it easier for us to build more cars in America, American-made cars. Number two, we know that closing the southern border will make our nation safer. President Trump is already doing that. And number three, he is focusing on making sure innovation happens before regulation. That's good for the economy. All over Michigan, all over Georgia, we are going to have an opportunity to run the tables.\"\n\nAlthough many Democrats may run for the soon-to-be-open Michigan Senate seat, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, an Indiana native, is reportedly \"taking a serious look\" at running for the seat.\n\nButtigieg may be having some trouble transitioning into a Michigan transplant, as one union auto worker in December quizzed him on which team the Detroit Lions were going to play.\n\nStunned by the question, Buttigieg failed to produce an answer.\n\nDespite the potential slate of opponents, Scott said that the focus should be running on President Trump's agenda and recruiting the right candidate for the seat.\n\nHe remarked, \"The great news is we will work our tails off to make sure that we take advantage of this opportunity for Michigan, but also for America.\"\n\nSean Moran is a policy reporter for Breitbart News.

Tim Scott: 'Disgusting' Biden 'Weaponized' Financial Markets to Debank Conservatives, Trump Family\n\nSenate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Tuesday that it is \"disgusting\" that former President Joe Biden \"weaponized\" the financial system to \"debank\" conservatives.\n\nScott spoke to Breitbart News right before he announced witnesses for the February 5 committee examining the real life impacts of debanking in America.\n\nThe hearing will feature three witnesses, including Nathan McCauley, the CEO and cofounder of Anchorage Digital; Evan Hafer, the founder and executive chairman of Black Rifle Coffee Company; and Stephen Gannon, a partner at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP.\n\nConservatives, venture capitalists, and cryptocurrency companies have long complained about \"debanking,\" or losing access to one's banking services due to the person or group's commercial activity or political affiliation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump recently brought this into the limelight at the World Economic Forum when he told Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase to platform conservatives.\n\nScott blamed the Biden administration for forcing banks to stop providing their services to conservatives.\n\n\"It is disgusting to watch the number of industries and individuals de bank, because Biden weaponized, not just the Department of Justice, Obama weaponized just, not just the department of the IRS, but we've seen the weaponization of our financial markets that is disgusting,\" the South Carolina senator said. \"It is not just wrong. It is immoral, unethical. I believe it might be illegal.\"\n\n\"We're gonna bring all that back up to the table, because it's not just digital assets [crypto], Black Rifle Coffee, it is actually oil and gas legal industries in America being shunned and thrown shade at them because they're not on the right side of the political spectrum,\" he added.\n\nVenture capitalist Marc Andreessen noted that Trump' wife and son were debanked, sharing a quote from Melania Trump's book, Melania :\n\nBreitbart News has reported about how the Biden administration has pushed to debank many industries in a similar fashion to the Obama administration:\n\nThis practice of debanking first became commonplace during President Barack Obama's time in office through Operation Choke Point, which discouraged banks from doing business with gun sellers and payday lenders.\n\nThe Biden administration similarly warned financial institutions about the alleged risks of working with the crypto industry.\n\nAccording to supervisory letters obtained by cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase via Freedom of Information Act requests, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) pressured banks to debank crypto companies.\n\nThe Blockchain Association, a crypto trade group, said it has identified more than 30 instances of debanking in the crypto industry.\n\nIn his executive order last Thursday calling for American leadership in digital financial technology, Trump called for \"protecting and promoting fair and open access to banking services for all law-abiding individual citizens and private-sector entities alike.\"\n\nSean Moran is a policy reporter for Breitbart News.

The Times speculates that the endorsement could further discussions on potential running mates, as the former president has also developed a strong relationship with former presidential candidate Gov.

      "text": "Exclusive - Tim Scott: 'Prejudiced' Trump Trial an 'Injustice' Driving Black Voters to GOP, They Want 'Fair Justice System'\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R-SC) told Breitbart News exclusively on Monday afternoon that the trial that Democrats are dragging former President Donald Trump through in New York is only driving more black voters away from Democrats - like President Joe Biden - and toward the Republican Party and Trump.\n\n\"There's no doubt that when you see a nearly 75 percent increase in black men wanting to support President Trump, that's not an insignificant increase,\" Scott told Breitbart News as Trump sat in a New York courtroom facing criminal charges from District Attorney Alvin Bragg. \"That is a gargantuan step in the right direction. Why? Because the Democrat stronghold on power is being broken by people who say, 'This isn't fair, and I want an America that is fair, and if they will do it to him, they will do it to me.' So that's what you're seeing in the black community from black men, specifically, and, frankly, black women have moved from 2.5 or three percent to 11 percent. We're talking about a 300 percent improvement. This is all the case not simply because of the desire for a strong, powerful, fair justice system, but when you ask the age-old question of, 'Am I better off under four years of Trump or better off under four years of Biden?' the answer is unequivocal economically better off under Trump. Our country was better off in terms of safety under Trump. Fentanyl that's ravaging communities, better off under Trump. There's no statistic that matters to people-black people, white people, Asians, Hispanics, women, or men-there's no statistic where you're not better off under Trump than under Biden.\"\n\nThe first day of Trump's trial was Monday, which began the process of jury selection. While no jurors were selected on Monday, at least 50 prospective ones were disqualified. Trump was in court in New York for the whole day on Monday to face the beginning of the process, and Scott-a possible vice presidential pick for the former president-told Breitbart News in the exclusive interview that this would not be happening if Trump were not running for president. Scott also compared this to the justice system targeting black men because of the color of their skin.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump arrives at Manhattan Criminal Court with his legal team before the start of jury selection on Monday, April 15, 2024. (Jabin Botsford/Pool Photo via AP)\n\n\"The simple way of understanding what's happening is if he was not running for president, he would not be on trial,\" Scott said. \"That's why I started with election engineering. The facts of the case are, frankly-the expiration of this being a legal challenge-in and of itself a point we should all reflect upon. Who wants a justice system that chooses the person you go after based on whether you like them or not or based on what office they're running for or not? Just imagine if this was not about the red party Republicans versus the blue party; imagine that this was a racial issue. Put a black person in the position where the legal system is coming after them because of the color of their skin and because of what they represent for hope in America. That, to me, is the easiest way to understand how disastrous this would be if not for the partiality woven into the system in New York, specifically against President Trump.\"\n\nScott said he thinks what Democrats are doing by encouraging this-Biden himself is clearly cheering it on-amounts to \"election engineering.\"\n\n\"I think of it as election engineering,\" Scott said. \"They're literally trying to engineer the results they want by keeping President Trump off the campaign trail. Frankly, it's an assault on American justice.\"\n\nScott added that he does not believe Trump will get an impartial jury.\n\n\"No is the simple answer,\" Scott said when asked if the jury that is eventually selected will be impartial. \"I do not believe it. Frankly, I believe Bragg-the prosecutor-is not looking for a fair trial. He's not looking for justice. He's not looking for Lady Justice to maintain a blindfold. They have been prejudiced this entire time in this entire process; so the one thing you cannot expect is justice to be served.\"\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (Michael M. Santiago/Getty)\n\nScott also ripped Judge Juan Merchan for refusing to rule on a motion by Trump's attorneys that Trump should be allowed to attend his son, Barron Trump's, high school graduation in May rather than sitting in the New York courtroom.\n\n\"It's unprecedented and unbelievable and undeniable that stopping a dad from going to his son's graduation is simply wrong, ridiculous, and un-American,\" Scott said. \"There's no there-there, so the entire thing is, in my opinion, already in shambles, but think about what they're trying to do. They're not trying to have a fair and judicious process. They're trying to punish him not through the legal system but by using the legal system as a sledgehammer against him and his family.\"\n\nJudge Juan Merchan (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\n\nScott also dismissed a litany of establishment media outlet polls that suggest Trump's numbers would drop upon a conviction, arguing that those polls are wrong.\n\n\"Number one, I think the next president of the United States-the forty-seventh president of the United States-is Donald Trump,\" Scott said when asked about the polls. \"Number two, why is that the case? Because of the coalition of new voters coming to the party and the ability to maintain the voters we currently have. Then, number three, why is that the case? It's because Americans are sick and tired of being sick and tired, and, therefore, the result of this absolute injustice system run by Joe Biden and used against political opponents will actually backfire on the Democratic Party and the elite establishment. This is part of it.\"\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "'Said What I've Said': Tim Scott Pushes Back On NBC Host After Being Challenged On 'Committing' To 2024 Election Results\n\n[Screenshot/NBC News/\"Meet the Press\"]\n\nRepublican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott pushed back against NBC host Kristen Welker Sunday after being challenged about committing to the 2024 presidential election results.\n\nScott appeared on \"Meet the Press\" to discuss the upcoming race between President Joe Biden and presumptive GOP nominee former President Donald Trump . As Scott has been rumored to be on Trump's short list for his vice president pick, Welker questioned the GOP senator on why he would want to be considered when there is a \"fundamental difference\" between Scott's and Trump's beliefs over the election results of 2020. (RELATED: Tim Scott Suspends Presidential Campaign)\n\n\"There are clear facts here. President Trump himself said he expects this election to be fair. He expects it to be honest, and he expects to win. That's what the presidential candidate should expect. I expect the exact same thing. Frankly, the American people agree with him. This is an issue that is not an issue. I'm not going to make it an issue,\" Scott stated.\n\n\"Well, senator, will you commit to accepting the election results of 2024, bottom line?\" Welker questioned.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the 47th president of the United States will be President Donald Trump. I'm excited to get back to low inflation, low unemployment -\" Scott stated.\n\n\"Wait, wait senator, yes or no? Will you accept the election results of 2024 no matter who wins?\" Welker interjected.\n\n\"That is my statement,\" Scott noted.\n\n\"Just yes or no. Will you accept the election results of 2024?\" Welker asked.\n\n\"I look forward to President Trump being the 47th president. You can ask it multiple times, Kristen. But -\" Scott stated.\n\n\"Senator, just a yes or no answer,\" Welker jumped in.\n\nScott continued to double down on his statement regarding his hopefulness towards a second Trump administration, however, Welker carried on with pressing the GOP senator on his commitment for this year's election cycle.\n\n\"The American people will make the decision and the decision will be for President Trump,\" Scott stated.\n\n\"I don't hear you committing to the election results.Will you commit to accepting the election results?\" Welker questioned.\n\n\"Here is the deal - This is why so many Americans believe that NBC is an extension of the Democratic Party. At the end of the day, I've said what I've said. I know that the American people, their voices will be heard. I believe that President Trump will be our next president. It's that simple,\" Scott pushed back.\n\n\"But senator, as you know, the hallmark of our democracy is that both candidates agree to a peaceful transfer of power. I'm asking you as a potential VP nominee, will you accept to commit to the election results in this election cycle no matter who wins? Just simply yes or no,\" Welker continued to press.\n\n\"I expect President Trump to win the next election. Listen, I'm not going to answer your hypothetical question when in fact, I believe the American people are speaking today on the results of the election. If it continues for the next six months, we find ourselves in a great position where we get back to another century of American prosperity. I'm looking forward to that,\" Scott stated.\n\nFollowing Scott's withdrawal from the 2024 GOP presidential nominee race in mid-November, the South Carolina senator endorsed Trump roughly two months later. Since his endorsement, reports have continued to speculate that Scott is potentially in the running to be Trump's VP pick.\n\nWhile Scott has not discussed details about the potential running mate offer, a March survey conducted by The Center Square Voter's Voice Poll questioned Republicans on who they would want to have on a ticket with Trump. The poll found at 18% of Republicans were supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, 17% went to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, with businessman Vivek Ramaswamy and Scott tying in third with 15% of the support.\n\nPolls between Trump and Biden have shown a hypothetical tight race between the two rivals, with many indicating a potential win for Republicans. In a recent Redfield & Wilton Strategies poll released Friday, results showed that 43% of the 1,133 registered voters surveyed would be supporting Trump, while 41% stated they would support Biden.\n\nTRENDING\n\n©2025 The Daily Caller, Inc.\n\nThe Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006\n\nSubscription Type\n\nUnlimited digital access to The Daily Caller\n\nPremium Article: Subscribe for $1 to read the rest.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nAlready have an account?

Tim Scott is set to endorse former President Donald Trump on Friday evening during a campaign event in Concord, New Hampshire, a source familiar confirmed to the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nScott had been running for the GOP nomination until mid-November, conceding that voters were relaying to him \"not now, Tim.\" The endorsement is significant as Scott was appointed to his position in the upper chamber in 2012 by former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who is currently polling second place for the first-in-the-nation primary on Tuesday.\n\nWith Scott's backing, Trump will have secured the endorsements from several former 2024 GOP hopefuls, including conservative entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy , North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum , radio personality Larry Elder and Michigan businessman Perry Johnson .\n\nThe New York Times first reported the expected endorsement.

Tim Scott (R-SC) speaks during the NBC News Republican Presidential Primary Debate at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nTrump is currently leading Haley 46.8% to 33.3% in the RealClearPolitics (RCP) average for the state, followed by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 12%, DeSantis at 6% and Ramaswamy at 6%. Christie and Ramaswamy have both withdrawn from the race.\n\nThe expected endorsement also comes a month out from Scott's home state primary on Feb. 24, where Trump currently holds a massive 30-point lead over Haley in the RCP average , followed by DeSantis with 11% support.\n\nScott launched his presidential bid in late May and focused his campaign largely on restoring traditional American values, tackling the border crisis, combatting China, promoting parental rights in education and reducing crime and inflation.\n\nThe senator said he wasn't planning on weighing in on the primary when he announced his decision to leave the race during an interview with Fox News' Trey Gowdy, and skirted the question on his desire to be a potential running mate.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and \n\t\t\t\t\tjoining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes \n\t\t\t\t\tto marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; \n\t\t\t\t\tsenators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want \n\t\t\t\t\tto limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our \n\t\t\t\t\tindependence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our \n\t\t\t\t\thands, and it's intense.

We love her with every fiber of \n\t\t\t\t\tour being, and we think she's worth saving from today's craziness.\n\nHelp us save her.\n\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have \n\t\t\t\t\ttrained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political \n\t\t\t\t\tspectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN?

Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, \n\t\t\t\t\tNewsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a \n\t\t\t\t\tfair system.

      "text": "JD FOSTER: Senate Republicans Could Pull Off The Unthinkable In Midterms\n\n(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott is nothing if not an optimist. As Senate Republican Campaign Committee lead, Scott hopes to score two seats net in the coming mid-terms. He calls it his \"stretch goal \".\n\nHow much of a stretch? Think gold medal gymnast Simon Biles prepping before a competition, legs wide, chin to the mat. Biles can do it. Can Scott? (RELATED: JD FOSTER: How Republicans Can Break History And Hold On To House)\n\nConventional wisdom says mid-term elections are tough on the president's party. Absent a wave or war, the president's party typically loses 9 seats in the House , but circumstances suggest Republicans might still keep their majority with luck.\n\nThe same basis shows Republicans face a range of outcomes between losing two and gaining two seats, net. Scott's stretch looks plausible. In fact, the historical average is a push - neither net gaining nor losing a seat.\n\nConsider the macro political environment. Democrats collectively are doing yeoman's work exercising every politician's right to act stupid. Defending wasteful spending and embracing legislation that replaces the word \"mother\" with \"inseminated person\" doesn't fly with most Americans. (RELATED: BOB EHRLICH: Trump Plays Chess While His Opponents Play Checkers)\n\nRepublicans could rescue the Democrats, however. The big test will be whether they emerge unscathed and minimally embarrassed from the budget fight complete with extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts in toto.\n\nFive seats seem in play. Republicans' best shot is Georgia. If incumbent Democrat Jon Ossoff ran in a typical bluish-purple state, then he would likely cruise to victory. But this is reddish-purple George which Trump won by 2.2 points.\n\nOssoff is likely to face highly popular Gov. Brian Kemp. Recent polls show Kemp beating Ossoff by about five points.\n\nTerm-limited Kemp at 62-years old and facing good prospects would seem sure to run. If he doesn't, the Republican bench looks thin and so a sense of duty may compel him to run. Assuming Kemp runs, count this a Republican pickup.\n\nRepublicans might also gain seats in Michigan and Minnesota. Trump won Michigan by 1.4 points confirming the state is now truly purple. Republicans have two strong contenders in Tudor Dixon and Mike Rogers.\n\nThe Democrats' best option would probably by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer who declined to run , her sights set on the White House in 2028. That leaves Biden Transportation Secretary and carpetbagger \"Pothole Pete\" Buttigieg leading a parade of pretenders. Count this one as lean Republican.\n\nIn contrast, Minnesota is blue with Democratic Lieutenant Gov. Peggy Flanagan running. Republicans look to put up 21-year U.S. Marine and Navy SEAL Adam Schwarze.\n\nThis race should be interesting as Flanagan is a radical leftist and Gov. Tim Walz acolyte running against a former jarhead and SEAL. We'll be generous for now and rate this as a true toss-up.\n\nRepublicans also have two tough seats to defend. Maine's Susan Collins is defending in a state Harris won by almost 7 points, yet Collins fits Maine and Maine knows Collins. So far, no notable Democrat has stepped up to be chopped down by Collins; Republican hold.\n\nThe most at-risk Republican incumbent is North Carolina's Thom Tillis. North Carolina leans Republican, but not by much and Tillis won re-election in 2020 with just 48.7% of the vote. Knowing Tillis might face a challenge from the right, former Republican Governor Pat McCrory says Trump is already engaged .\n\nThis race hangs on whether popular former Democratic Governor Roy Cooper jumps in as expected. If so, then this becomes a toss-up. If Cooper declines, then Tillis is likely to survive again. Count this a toss-up.\n\nTo sum, the best one can say is that, as usual, the outcomes all depend on who runs. Candidate quality will be decisive, but Republicans seem likely to pick up 1 and maybe even Scott's 2 stretch. It pays to be optimistic.\n\nJD Foster is the former chief economist at the Office of Management and Budget and former chief economist and senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
